			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MAGNET FOR TROUBLE;  </P> <P> HOMELESS: AS THE TRANSIENT POPULATION IN SANTA MONICA EXPANDS, SO DOES THE  VIOLENCE. AND THESE DAYS, THE BACKLASH TOO IS MUSHROOMING.  </P> <P> The image of a transient man choking the life out of a teen-age girl in the  surf off Santa Monica is one that lifeguard Arthur C. Verge III will never  forget. The 1982 incident, he said, starkly illustrated that his lifelong home  was fast becoming a magnet of sorts for some dangerous elements.  </P> <P> From his perch on the county lifeguard towers that dot the beach, Verge, 34,  has spent much of his adult life observing Santa Monica's relationship with  transients, and says it has gone from bad to worse to intolerable.  </P> <P> "In 17 years of this, you see a lot," Verge, now a part-timer, said recently.  "I wish I could say things are getting better, but they have continued to  deteriorate. . . . It's becoming Dodge City down here."  </P> <P> Verge's mother was attacked by a transient three years ago in a local church.  Last year, a mentally ill homeless man stabbed social worker Robbyn Panitch to  death.  </P> <P> More recently, there have been a barrage of incidents, including the arrest of  one transient on charges of arson in connection with a series of fires, and  another charged with an attempted armed holdup of a Santa Monica bank. While  shopping March 4, an 89-year-old woman was stabbed and robbed by a transient.  </P> <P> Then, last Friday, what some have called the ultimate irony occurred: Santa  Monica City Atty. Robert M. Myers, widely criticized for his reluctance to  prosecute transients, was himself attacked and slightly injured during a  scuffle with a man who was attacking Myers' chief prosecuting deputy, Jerry  Gordon. Myers said the man appeared to be mentally ill. It has not been  determined whether he was a transient, and he has not been caught.  </P> <P> "I hope they are all right," Verge said of Myers and Gordon. "But it does seem  like a case of them getting their just deserts."  </P> <P> Critics of Myers immediately issued a press release saying the attack was  "proof of his failed policies towards transients in the community," and  evidence that Santa Monica's officially tolerant attitude has made the liberal  community a magnet for predatory vagrants and troublemakers.  </P> <P> Even supporters of Myers said the attack underscored what has become a dominant  concern not just in Santa Monica but other Westside communities as well: What  to do with a homeless population that seems to be expanding, increasingly  desperate and, many would argue, more aggressive and violent?  </P> <P> In the past, most Westside residents considered the transients who gathered at  parks and street corners merely nuisances who would loiter, pester passers-by  for change and occasionally shout an obscenity or two, or relieve themselves in  the bushes. But in a recent survey conducted by the citizens' group Concerned  Homeowners of Santa Monica, a whopping 75% of the 1,000 city homeowners who  responded said their biggest concern was not overdevelopment, pollution, or  traffic, but the homeless. Many said they no longer felt safe walking their own  streets.  </P> <P> Other Westside communities are grappling with similar problems, and some have  responded by cracking down in response to complaints.  </P> <P> West Hollywood, which budgets $2 million a year for social service programs and  is considered one of the most tolerant cities in Los Angeles County, early this  year banished the community's free-meal program from a public park and  prohibited sleeping there. Beverly Hills pays for homeless services outside its  city line, and Venice outlawed sleeping on the beach three years ago.  </P> <P> In Venice, "Clearly, we still have a number of homeless people at the beach.  There are some people who are concerned," said Los Angeles City Councilwoman  Ruth Galanter, who represents the seaside area. And Malibu, some say, has been  quietly directing its transients south to Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Hollywood residents are shooing transients off their streets, saying, "Hey, we  don't want you here," Los Angeles police Officer Carlos Lopez said.  </P> <P> Santa Monica residents have reacted so strongly, they say, because the city's  policies and programs have exacerbated the problem.  </P> <P> Santa Monica police say one-third of their annual budget and police time is  spent on transient-related incidents and arrests. The number of transients  arrested on felony charges has at least doubled in the last four years, and  assaults by transients are up sharply, they said.  </P> <P> What is even more troubling, local residents and police say, is that for every  highly publicized attack, there are innumerable smaller attacks and acts of  violence and intimidation. City convention and tourism promoter Beverly Moore  said such reports are starting to hurt business.  </P> <P> Tour groups and conventions are heading elsewhere rather than risk  confrontations with aggressive transients, Moore said at a recent public  meeting. She estimated that the city was losing about 5% of its tourism revenue  this year as a result.  </P> <P> A recent poll of Santa Monica tourists and conventioners found that 40%  reported having "disturbing, frightening experiences," Moore said. "This past  summer was absolutely the worst. We are very worried about this summer."  </P> <P> Santa Monica officials estimate that there are 40,000 transients in Los Angeles  County, of which 4,000 are generally found on the Westside, and about 1,200 of  them in Santa Monica. Many gather among the swaying palm trees in Palisades  Park while others frequent street corners and alleys.  </P> <P> City Atty. Myers has become a lightning rod for criticism because of his  publicly stated refusal to prosecute transients for some minor nonviolent  crimes such as public inebriation and sleeping in parks. Myers, who did not  return repeated phone calls requesting comment, has said that such prosecutions  would only clog an already overburdened judicial system and that intervention  by social agencies is a better way to help the homeless.  </P> <P> Santa Monica resident Leslie Dutton, who has organized a petition drive aimed  at replacing Myers, says the city attorney's lenient attitude -- shared, Dutton  says, by the majority of City Council members -- "has led to a decay of this  community" and has created an unsafe environment, particularly for the elderly  and children.  </P> <P> Dutton's group, Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act, is seeking to  place an initiative on the November ballot to make the city attorney post  elective instead of appointive. Group members have collected 2,000 signatures,  but need 8,288 by June 11 to qualify the measure.  </P> <P> Myers, appointed in 1981, has drawn praise from some social service workers and  activists who work with the homeless for his compassionate approach. Some  police and city administrators concede that the problem is too large and  complex to blame one man, particularly because it is the county-level district  attorney's job to prosecute major crimes, and the task of judges to decide  wether to impose harsh or lenient sentences.  </P> <P> Effective or not, Myers is a committed social activist who takes a personal  interest in helping the homeless. He spends many Saturday mornings handing out  sandwiches to transients who file in lines past City Hall.  </P> <P> In any event, the homeless are hardly a new political issue in Santa Monica. In  1984, for example, challenger Herb Katz won election to the City Council on a  platform that included a call for a crackdown on the homeless. A year later,  two councilmen called for Myers' ouster for declining to prosecute some  transients for nonviolent misdemeanors.  </P> <P> Some say Myers is not the only scapegoat in the current controversy; that the  homeless themselves are being used as political pawns.  </P> <P> County health officials estimate that one-third of the transients suffer from  diagnosable mental illnesses. Vivian Rothstein, executive director of the Ocean  Park Community Center, which runs five different shelter programs, said the  mentally ill and other truly needy homeless are being lumped with drifters,  drug addicts and career criminals into a "convenient package" that society can  hold responsible for all of its ills.  </P> <P> "On the street, things are much more complicated," Rothstein said. "I think it  is getting meaner on the streets. People have been out there much longer, and  they are much more desperate."  </P> <P> The homeless are more often than not the victims of crime. Since 1988, police  say seven transients were murdered in Santa Monica. Eigth other transients were  arrested as suspects in those and other attacks.  </P> <P> At a public forum late last month organized by the Concerned Homeowners group  to discuss the transients, hundreds of angry residents interrogated city  prosecutor Gordon, three City Council members, and representatives of the city  police department, human services agency and tourism promotion office. The  officials said they are hamstrung by societal problems such as jail  overcrowding, a lack of affordable housing, and inadequate programs for the  mentally ill and those with alcohol and drug problems.  </P> <P> Few of the officials won much applause that day, except Councilman William  Jennings, when he said: "What did Santa Monica do to become the homeless  capital of the nation? We can't afford to become the Skid Row of America!"  </P> <P> While the debate rages and officials search for answers, Santa Monica has for  the most part resisted pressure to cut back its services to transients, and  spends as much as $1.5 million a year on the homeless.  </P> <P> Although a noontime feeding program in Ocean Park was cut back by more than 100  meals a day because of neighborhood complaints, after a six-month study, the  City Council in late January approved what amounted to a $41,000 stopgap  appropriation to deal with some aspects of the homeless issue.  </P> <P> Among the provisions: hotel vouchers for the disabled homeless, policing of  liquor stores and the establishment of an advisory group of homeless people.  And last August, at the urging of Mayor Dennis Zane, the city authorized  spending $30,000 to retain a consultant to organize local governments' support  for action at state and federal levels.  </P></p>

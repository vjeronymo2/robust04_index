			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Zhilin: "Army: Businessmen </F> Command Aviation"]    [Text] The grave economic crisis in  Ukraine is dealing a tough blow to the Army. It seems that the  republic is unable to maintain its armed forces at full strength.    National-state ambitions do not allow cutbacks in the armed  forces. As a result, certain military-commercial hybrids have  appeared in the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. For example,  military-transport aviation, equipped with IL-76 airplanes, is  being turned over to the control of commercial structures!  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI has learned that the 37th Military  Aviation-Transport Regiment (military unit No. 54918, commanded  by Colonel Bayev), stationed in the city of Artsiz, is at the  service of the commercial firms "Atlanta" [Atlanta] and "Yuzhnyy  bereg Kryma" [Crimean South Shore]. They are financing the  planes' maintenance, buying aircraft engines and fuel, and  organizing the retraining of crews for international flights.  After that, the military pilots will carry out orders from the  businessmen, hauling cargo.    As is commonly known, army airplanes cannot fly certain  international air routes. In order to avoid complications, the  Ukrainian entrepreneurs are repainting the military airplanes to  resemble "civilian airliners." However, this does not alter the  essential state of affairs. It turns out that the crews of  military-transport airplanes, whose chief mission is to drop  assault forces on enemy territory, have begun overflying the  airfields of foreign countries. In international practice, this  is nonsense.    A noteworthy detail: A deputy commander of the Ukrainian Air  Force, seeking to justify the commercialization of  military-transport aviation, said: "The international flight  experience being gained by our crews could come in very handy  for us in the event of war, since the pilots will master  international OVD [joint military operations] and test the  technical facilities of many foreign airfields. In addition, we  will be able to invigorate the branch of military intelligence  associated with air traffic."    The Ukrainian military aviation chief is not bluffing.  Indeed, few military crews get a chance to overfly the airfields  of a "likely adversary." And special equipment installed on the  pseudocommercial airliners will make it possible to obtain  unique intelligence data.    We should point out that a similar air regiment stationed in  Krivoy Rog has already begun making "commercial-intelligence"  international flights.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Investment level 'hits recovery' LOW manufacturing in-vestment in the late 1980s has put the recovery at risk, an economist warns today. Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, writes in Midland's weekly circular that too little of the wealth generated during the late 1980s boom went into building up manufacturing. The result is that the UK 'still does not have a sufficiently large manufacturing sector', he adds. The report underlines concerns in the City that Britain's large deficit on manufactured goods will increase as the economy expands. This might put a brake on overall economic growth, possibly because a large deficit could weaken sterling and so lead to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. In his report Mr Shepherdson says net investment by manufacturing in the 1980s was low even by the standards of the 1970s - generally believed to have been a dire era for the sector. Net investment, which accounts for machinery and buildings written off because of being obsolete or worn out, totalled 3 per cent of manufacturers' trading profits during the 1980s, compared with 10 per cent in the 1970s. In 1985 prices, net manufacturing investment during the 1980s totalled Pounds 6bn, after Pounds 26bn in the 1970s. Mr Shepherdson says that in other areas - such as in rising output per employee and attracting overseas investment - UK manufacturing performed well in the 1980s. However, the promised overall benefits from such trends 'have been slow in appearing'. The report warns: 'Rebuilding the manufacturing sector could take a decade, or even a generation.'

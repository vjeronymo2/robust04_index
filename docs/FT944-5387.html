			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (14): Two decisions as tax relief matters less - Mortgage A mortgage is no longer as tax-efficient as it used to be. Tax relief is only available on the first Pounds 30,000 of the loan, and from next April the rate of relief will drop to 15 per cent from the current 20 per cent. So paying off the mortgage is one of the most sensible investment decisions you can make, but if you need a mortgage do not be put off by the seemingly endless choice. There are basically two main decisions: whether to repay the loan with a repayment or an interest-only mortgage; and whether to take a fixed or variable rate. Repayment or interest-only? Any mortgage is made up of the capital sum borrowed and the interest payments. With a repayment mortgage, the homeowner's monthly payments comprise both, so that the whole debt is paid off at the end of the mortgage term - usually 25 years. You should take out term assurance - basic life insurance - to cover the mortgage in the event of your death. The main disadvantage of the repayment mortgage is that, by repaying the capital, you are handing over money which might work harder for you elsewhere. The alternative is an interest-only loan. You only pay interest to the lender, but save up separately to pay off the capital sum at the end of the mortgage term. The most common savings plan is an endowment policy, where an insurance company invests the monthly premium you pay and gives you some life assurance. However, endowments are relatively inflexible, and you are likely to be penalised heavily if you redeem within the first five years. You should consider other methods, such as linking an interest-only mortgage to your pension, so that part of the tax-free lump sum paid on retirement is used to repay the capital sum. The disadvantage here is that less will be left over to invest for your retirement. A pension mortgage is not suitable for young people, who may find themselves making interest payments for more than 25 years, which can wipe out the tax advantages. Mortgages linked to personal equity plans (Peps) are also tax-efficient, because you are not liable for income or capital gains tax; and, since you can stop payments without penalty, they are very flexible. The main drawback is that you are at the mercy of stock market fluctuations, and need to take great care in choosing a good provider. Fixed or variable? A fixed mortgage rate offers certainty, and avoids the shock of a sudden increase in interest rates. Since interest rates look as if they are on the way up, you also hope to pay less interest with a fixed rate than one which is variable. However, this depends on finding a competitive fixed rate. At the moment, most of these are concentrated on the shorter term (two to three years), but you may save more with a discounted variable rate (unless rates rise significantly over this period). In general, discounted rates, which offer a reduction of a set proportion for a fixed period on the variable rate, are better value than cashback offers. Some very lengthy fixed rates may seem historically low, but commit yourself only if you are sure that you will remain in the UK and do not want to reduce the capital sum within the fixed-rate period. Be aware that 'portable' fixed rates may not be as portable as you would like - you will usually have to buy and sell within a relatively short period to avoid redemption penalties. These are onerous on long-term fixes; while some short-term fixes carry a redemption penalty beyond the fixed-rate period. Lenders will charge a fee of about Pounds 100-Pounds 300, determined by the length of the fix. Avoid fixed rates tied to the sale of insurance-related products, because you can probably find cheaper insurance elsewhere.</p>

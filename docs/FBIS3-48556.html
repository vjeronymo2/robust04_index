			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura said Wednesday [26 January] he can neither  confirm nor deny whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa might  resign if he fails to secure Diet approval for political reform.  Asked about an adviser's comment on the possible resignation of  the Cabinet depending on the result of Diet debate on reform,  the top government spokesman said, "I neither confirm nor deny  that."    Shusei Tanaka, a special adviser to Hosokawa, said Tuesday  the premier may disband the cabinet and step down if he fails to  get the measures put into law.    Four bills to reform the system for elections to the House  of  Representatives and curb corruption in public life were defeated  in the House of Councillors last Friday. They had cleared the  lower house last November.    Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enactment of such  measures by a self-imposed deadline of Saturday, when the  current Diet session ends. To meet public expectations, ruling  and opposition parties must do their utmost to ignore even major  differences and accomplish a common goal of political reform,  Takemura told a news conference.    The ruling coalition and the opposition camp begin  negotiations Wednesday afternoon to work out a compromise reform  plan and get it onto the statute books before the close of the  Diet term.    Earlier Wednesday, the premier brushed aside speculation  that  he and his cabinet might resign, saying he has no plans to take  such a step.    Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said  Hosokawa should dissolve the lower house for a snap general  election, rather than stepping down, if the political reform  program fails to win parliamentary approval by Saturday. "I  don't think the mass resignation of the cabinet is possible with  such a high level of public support," he said.    Hata also ruled out the possibility of carrying the  government reform proposals over to the next regular session of  the Diet, which begins next Monday.    A government source said there is no consensus within the  government about the resignation of the cabinet, adding that  Tanaka was only expressing his personal views.</p>

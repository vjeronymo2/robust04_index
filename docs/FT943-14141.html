			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Waiting for the dollar - Overseas investment 4 / The US / If the currency were to strengthen, it would magnify any growth in the stock market If you want to invest in the United States, there are a number of different ways of going about it. But at the moment, many investors may see it as a very big 'if'. Nigel Sidebottom, a portfolio manager at stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray, says he and his colleagues took the decision more than a year ago to withdraw their most aggressive portfolios from the US altogether. More conservative portfolios still have a small amount of US exposure, but Sidebottom says he can see little reason to increase that in the foreseeable future. The US is further ahead in the economic cycle than the rest of the developed world. Rapid growth has slowed down, and the Federal Reserve Bank has already raised interest rates by 1.25 percentage points. Bond and stock markets have been jittery, with equities following the bond market's every move, and reacting badly to negative economic news, but showing little response to more positive data. US investors have been sending huge amounts of money abroad - American fund managers were largely responsible for the soaring stock markets in east Asia at the end of last year. Since those markets started to drop, however, much of the money has been withdrawn. Some of those funds may be finding their way back into US stock markets. But if interest rates continue to rise, the same investors who stampeded into domestic and overseas equities during the past year or two, driven out of deposit-based investments by the meagre rates, may start a stampede in the opposite direction - which would not bode well for share prices. One brighter point for overseas investors is the possibility of the dollar strengthening after a prolonged period of weakness. This would magnify any stock market growth, and could even make a stagnant market profitable. On the expectation of that, some fund managers are keeping money in the US, or even increasing their weightings. However, the dollar has not shown much sign of strength yet. UK investors who look at the evidence and decide that the US is a good home for at least part of their portfolio at the moment have an enormous choice of collective investment vehicles. There are more than 100 unit trusts in the North America sector, offering a wide range of specialisms, including currency bear and bull funds, index-trackers, reverse index funds, special situations, recovery funds and biotechnology, as well as general trusts. North American investment trusts are thinner on the ground: there are only seven in total, four of which are specialist smaller companies funds. There are also a few predominantly or entirely US-invested funds in other sectors, such as Lazard's North American Gas trust and the River &amp; Mercantile American split-capital trust. For the average investor who does not have a strong view on US market prospects, a sensible approach could be to pick a general international fund with some US exposure (most have between 5 and 25 per cent in the US), and leave the precise asset allocation up to the professionals.</p>

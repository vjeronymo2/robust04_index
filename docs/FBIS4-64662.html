			<p>BFN     [Text] Saarbruecken (DPA) -- German industry places great  expectations on the enlargement of the European Union. The  acceptance of Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Austria, which was  approved by the European Parliament on Wednesday [4 May],  creates additional opportunities for investments, for German  companies also, Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of  German Industry (BDI), said on Saarland Radio on Thursday.  "There will be a great number of improved opportunities for  cooperation."    German industry need not fear potential greater competition  by the new members, Necker said. Rather, there is the  opportunity for a better division of labor within Europe. Thus,  the Nordic states are, for instance, strong regarding the  production of cellulose. Traffic routes to Scandinavia could  also be improved and expanded. The decisive thing is "that we  will all become stronger in international competition through a  larger market," Necker stressed.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ROLLING HILLS GETS GIFT FROM TEXAS;  </P> <P> PREPS: TWO WEEKS BEFORE ROLLING HILLS PLAYED ITS FIRST GAME, ROBERT COULTER  ASKED FOR A TRYOUT. TWO MONTHS LATER, HE'S THE SOUTH BAY'S LEADING RUSHER WITH  L,102 YARDS IN SIX GAMES.  </P> <P> In all his years of coaching high school football, Gary Kimbrell has never  received a gift quite like the one that arrived at Rolling Hills in August.  </P> <P> That's when Robert Coulter, a junior from Paris, Tex., unexpectedly showed up  and asked for a tryout two weeks before the Titans' first game.  </P> <P> "We stuck him right in there, on the scout offensive team running against the  first-team defense," Kimbrell said. "We wanted to find out what kind of talent  he had."  </P> <P> And?  </P> <P> "No one said much, but we knew."  </P> <P> Kimbrell knew he had found another running back. Two months later, Coulter has  proved to be that and much more.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-11, 178-pound transfer not only leads Rolling Hills in rushing, but  the entire South Bay. He has gained 1,102 yards on 119 carries, nearly a first  down-per-carry average of 9.26 yards, and he has surpassed 100 yards in all but  one of the Titans' six games.  </P> <P> Coulter enjoyed his finest outing last Friday in a 44-8 Bay League victory over  Inglewood by rushing for 283 yards on 36 carries, marking the third time in the  last four games he has gone over the 200-yard mark. He also scored five  touchdowns to raise his season total to 12.  </P> <P> No longer are teams asking, "Who is that guy?" Now the question is, "How do we  stop that guy?"  </P> <P> Hawthorne, boasting one of the area's top defenses, draws the assignment of  trying to shut down Coulter and Rolling Hills' explosive option attack at 7:30  Friday night in a key Bay League game at Hawthorne. The Titans (4-1-1 overall,  1-1-1 in league play) trail first-place Hawthorne (6-0, 3-0) by a 1 1/2 games.  </P> <P> So far, teams have had little success slowing down the transplanted Texan,  whose slashing, cut-back style of running has become his trademark.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Coulter gained 252 yards on 17 carries in a 16-16 tie with  Leuzinger. The Olympians rarely give up that many total yards in a game.  </P> <P> "There are not a whole lot of guys who get that kind of yardage against us,"  Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes said. Coulter "ran well. When he's out in the  open, he's very tough. I was impressed with him."  </P> <P> Coulter didn't think it would be this easy. Although he was a starting wide  receiver as a sophomore last year for North Lamar High in Paris, Tex., Coulter  expected the caliber of football to be much higher in California.  </P> <P> "I figured it would be really tough for me to play," he said. "I thought it  would be the hardest thing in the world."  </P> <P> However, once Coulter demonstrated his determination and began breaking off  long runs in practice, Kimbrell knew there was a place for his newest player.  </P> <P> "He really has been a tremendous asset to our team," he said. "We knew he was  talented in our first scrimmage. He proved himself and gained people's respect  right away."  </P> <P> Although he didn't start, Coulter gained 103 yards on 13 carries and scored two  touchdowns in the Titans' 35-10 season-opening win over Redondo. The next week  he gained 171 yards on 18 carries and scored two TDs in a 26-14 win over Mira  Costa. In the third game, he finally earned a starting spot and responded with  a 203-yard, two-touchdown effort in a 36-0 win over North Torrance.  </P> <P> Kimbrell, who coached several All-CIF running backs during a 10-year stint at  Miraleste, rates Coulter the best in terms of raw ability.  </P> <P> "He's definitely the most talented back I've coached," he said. "We had some  good backs (at Miraleste) like Mike Silane, Chris Ridout and Andrew Dunn. But  Robert definitely is the most talented."  </P> <P> Coulter was set to be the starting quarterback for North Lamar High School when  his stepfather, Lance Anderson, decided to move his jewelry business and family  to Southern California this summer.  </P> <P> Moving from rural Texas to the Los Angeles area has taken some getting used to,  Coulter said.  </P> <P> "In Texas, it's like the country," he said. "There are a lot of cowboys. It's  really different here. But people are basically the same wherever you go.  You've got the good ones and the bad ones.  </P> <P> "Everything has been going pretty well. People are starting to get to know me.  At first, I was just by myself. It was tough."  </P> <P> Kimbrell says Coulter has been a model player.  </P> <P> "He's well-liked by everybody," he said. "He's a very hard worker on the  football field. And it helps to have him in practice. He gives our defense a  chance to look at someone who can move and run. He gives our defense a little  preview of some of the quick backs we face in the Bay League."  </P> <P> The week before Rolling Hills met Leuzinger, Coulter played quarterback in  practice so he could simulate the moves of Olympian quarterback Zac Odom, a  dangerous runner. It was during one of these practice sessions that starting  quarterback Bill DeMucci, who was playing running back, suffered a sprained  ankle.  </P> <P> That forced Kimbrell to put backup tailback Greg Schwartz at quarterback, a  move that has paid dividends in the Titans' last two games. With Schwartz, the  team's fastest player, calling signals and Coulter playing tailback, Rolling  Hills now possesses two breakaway threats.  </P> <P> "It makes us a better football team," said Kimbrell, who intends to keep  Schwartz at quarterback even though DeMucci has recovered from his injury.  </P> <P> The coach considered Coulter too valuable to move to quarterback, although he  has proved capable of playing the position in practice.  </P> <P> "To have a good option attack," Kimbrell said, "you have to have someone you  can pitch the ball to."  </P> <P> Coulter, who can play any of the three positions in Rolling Hills' option  backfield (quarterback, fullback or tailback), says wherever Kimbrell decides  to put him is fine.  </P> <P> "As long as I'm playing back where the ball is, I'm all right."  </P></p>

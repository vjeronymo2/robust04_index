			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Highest earners suffer largest cash losses - Winners and losers / An analysis by The Institute For Fiscal Studies The chancellor delivered two Budgets yesterday. One was a set of tax measures for immediate implementation, described as 'broadly neutral'; the other was a second set which, from 1994-95, will raise substantial sums for the exchequer. While the measures for immediate implementation have little effect on aggregate tax revenues, they are far from neutral in terms of their effect on the distribution of income. This article, therefore, begins by setting out the distributional effects of those immediate measures on households of different types and at different levels of income. It also offers some preliminary reflections on the likely distributional effects of the longer-term measures. We examine how the measures the chancellor actually announced compare with a 'do-nothing' Budget which merely increased all tax allowances and thresholds in line with inflation and made no changes to direct tax rates. The analysis includes all the main changes to income tax and excise duties announced for 1993-94 but does not include changes to stamp duty, business taxes or the abolition of car tax previously announced in the autumn statement. The results are obtained by applying the 1993 Budget measures to a representative sample of households drawn from the Family Expenditure Survey using the IFS computer model of the personal tax and benefit system. The first chart shows the immediate effect of yesterday's Budget on the annual disposable income of households of different types. The bottom line of this chart shows that households as a whole are Pounds 43 per year worse off. It should be remembered that this small net increase in taxation is consistent with the chancellor's claim to have introduced a neutral package for 1993-94 mainly because it does not take into account the cut in car tax which some of this year's tax increases are intended to finance. While the average effect of the Budget measures is a relatively modest loss of Pounds 43 per year, the chart shows that this effect is by no means uniform across different family types. The smallest losses occur among households where there is nobody in paid employment. As well as the unemployed households who lose up to Pounds 30 per year, this category also includes single parents who lose about Pounds 15 per year and pensioner households who lose up to Pounds 33 per year. The source of these losses among the non-employed population is primarily the changes to indirect taxes announced yesterday. Though largely unaffected by the changes to income tax, these groups do tend to lose from the above- inflation increases in the excise duty on beer, wine, tobacco and fuel. The only excise duty not to be raised in line with inflation was that on spirits, which is of relatively little importance to these low income groups. The larger losses are concentrated among households where one or more member is in employment, and in these cases annual losses typically lie in the range Pounds 60 to Pounds 80 per year. In addition to the losses imposed by increases in the rate of indirect taxes, these groups also suffer from the freezing of personal income tax allowances. Nonetheless, the overall impact on these groups taken as a whole is relatively modest, amounting to less than Pounds 2 per week on average. The effects of the Budget measures for 1993-94 on households at different levels of income is shown in the second chart. This collects the UK household population into 10 groups with the poorest tenth labelled 'Decile 1' and the richest 'Decile 10'. This chart shows clearly the way in which losses from the Budget become substantial only for the highest earners. Only in the top 30 per cent of the population do average losses from the Budget rise above Pounds 52 per year or Pounds 1 per week. There are a number of reasons why those on the highest incomes suffer the largest cash losses. The first is that they tend to use larger absolute amounts of excisable items such as fuel and so their absolute loss from over-indexation is larger than that for poorer households. Second, the chancellor continued the Conservative tradition of increasing the tax levied on users of company cars, and this will tend to hit high earners hardest. Finally, the chancellor froze the point at which higher rate tax becomes payable. As a result, during the coming year many of those whose incomes are just too low to make them higher-rate taxpayers will drift into the net of higher rate tax. This increase in the number of higher-rate taxpayers has in fact been an almost unnoticed revolution of Conservative tax policy during the last 14 years. Back in 1979 there were fewer than 700,000 higher rate taxpayers. In the current financial year the total number is more than 1m higher and is set to rise still further in 1993-94. This is the third time in four years that a Conservative chancellor has frozen the threshold at which higher-rate tax becomes payable. It would seem that as well as aiming to increase the width of the reduced rate band the government is also aiming to widen the scope of higher-rate income tax. One of the few factors which reduces the average losses reflected in the two charts was the chancellor's final announcement that the 20 per cent band will be widened to cover the first Pounds 2,500 of taxable income in the coming financial year. While this move partly offsets the effects of other tax increases, it is however inadequate to prevent the vast majority of taxpayers from being worse off. Had the chancellor chosen simply to index the 20 per cent band it would have increased from its present width of Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 2,100. Thus the chancellor widened the band by only Pounds 400 more than was necessary to keep pace with inflation. This measure saved a basic rate taxpayer 5 per cent of Pounds 400, or Pounds 20 per year. It was indeed a modest step on the road towards a 20p basic rate for all. This then is the immediate effect of the measures announced for the coming financial year. The effects on the distribution of income could be said to be relatively minor, with even the richest tenth of the population losing less than Pounds 3 per week. The same cannot be said however of the measures foreshadowed by Mr Lamont for the coming financial years. Of the measures promised for 1994-95 and beyond, a number will have significant effects on household disposable incomes, and will on average produce far greater losses than the measures for the current year. By far the most significant in terms of its effect on household incomes is the proposed extension of VAT to domestic fuel, first at a rate of 8 per cent in 1994-95 and then at the full 17.5 per cent in 1995-96. Given that fuel forms a significant part of the expenditure of low-income households, this measure taken alone could bear particularly heavily on the poor. In recognition of this fact, the chancellor has indicated that income-related benefits will also be increased, and it seems possible that the groups who lose most will be those relatively low income households just beyond the scope of the income-related benefit system. Other measures announced by the chancellor will bear rather more heavily on high income households. In a previous Budget, Mr Lamont restricted the value of tax relief on mortgage interest payments so that they were worth the same to higher-rate taxpayers as to basic rate taxpayers. From April 1994, this process will be taken one step further with the value of the relief being restricted to the reduced rate of 20 per cent for all homebuyers. It seems likely that this marks a further important step on the road to the eventual abolition of mortgage interest relief. A second allowance to be restricted to the reduced rate is that for married couples. This change would have had a particularly large impact on pensioner couples who currently enjoy a higher tax allowance, but the chancellor is also proposing some increases to pensioner allowances so that they suffer no more than married couples below pension age. Again, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the days of the married couple's allowance are also numbered. A final direct tax measure proposed for 1994-95 is an increase in the rates of National Insurance Contributions for employees and the self-employed. This will affect only the non-pensioner population (since pensioners are exempt from NICs) and will add further to the already significant increases in taxes planned for the coming years. The losses from the measures to be introduced in 1994-95 will make the losses produced by this year's changes seem trivial by comparison.

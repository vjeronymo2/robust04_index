			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Call for clearer legislation THE Law Society said yesterday that the next government should adopt clearer and more user-friendly legislation. The society said in a detailed submission to the Hansard Society's commission on legislative reform that much time and money were wasted by businesses and individuals in trying to understand laws which should be clear and readily accessible in the first place. The law should be easy to find, easy to read and easy to understand, the society said.</p>

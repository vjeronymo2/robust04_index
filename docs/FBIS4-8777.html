			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 15 April carries within  its regular 42-minute newscast several reports on the combat  situation in the republic.    Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "the  encirclement around Gorazde is becoming increasingly tighter and  stronger. Gorazde is literally drowning its own blood,  suffering, and pain. Crushing everything before them, the  chetniks are mercilessly advancing on the town. The situation  in the town is so bad that it cannot get worse. A river of  surviving refugees from the surrounding villages this morning  continued to flow into the almost destroyed and overcrowded  Gorazde."    Musovic also says that the "chetniks are at the very gates  of  the town. On their way to the town so far, in only 18 days of  this unprecedented offensive they have killed 208 and wounded  840 residents of Gorazde. The survivors of Gorazde are warning  U.S. President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali to take new energetic measures and urgently stop  the chetnik hordes, which are at the very gates of Gorazde, at  the last minute. If they do not take urgent measures, it will  be too late for the residents of this town."    According to Brcko correspondents Hamiz Deronjic and Nijaz  Salihovic, "on the fifth consecutive day of their attacks, the  enemy is using all available weapons: snipers, machine guns, and  122-mm and 155-mm howitzers. The aggressor has fired hundreds  of artillery and tank shells at the positions of the 108th  Motorized and the 108th Infantry Brcko Brigades. Vranovaca and  the central part of Odora are being subjected to particularly  heavy shelling. The situation in Boderiste is the worst. The  aggressor has been carrying out combined artillery, tank, and  infantry attacks there since about 0700."    Reporting that the army had not suffered any casualties, the  correspondents report that "at 0850 this morning, the Malutka  operators of the legendary 108th Motorized Brigade destroyed a  chetnik tank at [words indistinct], in front of the positions of  the 108th Infantry Brigade. This is the third tank that the  aggressor has lost, together with its crew, on the Brcko front  in the last 24 hours."    According to Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic,  "Karadzic's  terrorists have not stopped attacking Buzim and the surrounding  area today. They are shelling civilian houses and the  defenders. The chetniks have been attacking them since 9 April.  This (?region) has also been attacked from the other side, from  behind, by Abdic's betraying falangists, who are fiercely  attacking Todorovo, [word indistinct], Pecingrad, Krivaja, and  Liskovac."    From Sarajevo a correspondent reports that the "chetniks  today continued their attacks with small arms in the Sarajevo  area, which began last night. Provocations took place in  several locations, where the defense lines of the town came  under attack. Shots were fired at the very center, Marijin  Dvor, where an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] vehicle was  parked, from direction of Sljivik. This resulted in the wounding  of two civilians at about noon. The passage of the street cars  was blocked, too."    The correspondent concludes his report by saying that the  "chetniks are preparing to renew artillery attacks on the town.  They have been seen bringing up heavy weapons, ammunition, and  troops to almost all the artillery positions around Sarajevo for  hours. The observers and UNPROFOR appear to be powerless to  stop this behavior by the aggressor and we therefore warn the  citizens to take the warnings seriously about precautionary  measures and self-protection."    Gracanica correspondent Ezudin Durakovic reports that the  "chetniks have been using all their artillery since early this  morning to attack mainly civilian targets in Lukavica, Malesici,  Rijeka, and Miricina from the well-known chetnik strongholds of  Paleznica, (Besanj), Sjemina, Kojica, and Porecina. The enemy  fired over 200 shells of various calibers within a very short  period of time. One woman and one child were killed. Six  others were wounded and the material damage is substantial."</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Elegant speakers make their entrance Combining a taste for hi-fi sound with a desire for elegant surroundings is not always easy - loudspeakers can be bulky and obtrusive. Dance London, a small UK company, has developed the Mirage speakers to help overcome this dilemma. Shaped rather like a pair of curved, squat lamp bases, they are made of durable ceramic and send out what Dance calls 'all surround sound' at 360' instead of the more limited direction of conventional speakers. The 'sweet spot', where the listener sits at an equal distance from each speaker, is enlarged by the way the Mirage sends the sound on to a cone-shaped deflector and then out into the room. Using a Danish-made loudspeaker drive, the speakers are made in the UK; they will appear in shops later this summer. The basic units priced at Pounds 230; a Pounds 199 sub-woofer (of special resin) for enhanced bass will cost an extra Pounds 199. Dance London: UK, 081 5673229</p>

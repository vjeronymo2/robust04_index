Mola is developing the park and is dedicating an  additional 50 acres of nearby property to Seal Beach as part of the company's  development agreement with the city.  </P> <P> The park plan, which will now be submitted to the City Council for  finalapproval, includes eight tennis courts, two basketball courts, a sand  volleyball court and a 2,000-square-foot community center. Also included would  be a gazebo, a raised viewing area near the wetlands, a picnic area, playing  fields and modest landscaping.  </P> <P> Construction will not begin on the residential development or the park until  the company's plans receive final approval from the state Coastal Commission,  which will meet to review the proposal on Nov. 14.

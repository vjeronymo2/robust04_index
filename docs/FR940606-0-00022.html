The EPA does not agree that the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) can reasonably be read to serve this purpose. First, such a reading is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with the provision of section 112(d)(3) establishing a ``floor'' for new sources. Under those provisions, new source standards may not be less stringent than <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. 7412(d)(3). Notably, Congress did not use the word ``average'' in this provision. If the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) was intended to refer to averages across time, or between emission points, or among different HAP, then Congress must have intended that such averaging would take place for existing source standards, but not for new source standards. There is no reason to believe Congress intended this implausible result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is a much more likely explanation: That to the extent Congress contemplated that averaging across time, or between emission points, or among HAP would play a role in either existing or new source MACT standards, it considered the terms ``emission limitation'' and ``emission control'' fully adequate to reflect that fact. In EPA's air program, emission limitations have routinely been expressed in terms of averages across time, for example, without any special statutory direction or authority. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have thought that special instructions were needed to ensure that EPA continued this practice, and even less reason to believe Congress would have thought special instructions were needed with respect to existing source standards, but not new source standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the legislative history of section 112 casts doubt on the interpretation of the word ``average'' offered by these commenters. When Congress comprehensively revised section 112 in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, it based the revisions in substantial part on the Clean Water Act's effluent guidelines program. (See, e.g., Remarks of Sen. Durenberger, Cong. Rec. S516 (January 30, 1990) (``*&blank;*&blank;* this approach to regulation of toxic air pollutants is not without precedent. A program very similar to the one I have just described has already been implemented under the Clean Water Act'').) Under that program, certain limits (known as ``BPT limits'') have long been based on the ``average of the best'' performance at existing facilities. (See generally Remarks of Sen. Muskie, Legislative History of Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 at 169&hyph;70 (``The Administrator should establish the range of `best practicable' levels based upon the average of the best existing performance by plants of various sizes, ages and unit processes.'')) In determining ``average of the best'' under the Clean Water Act, EPA has historically identified the best performers in an industrial category, and then averaged their performances. This methodology is consistent with the Higher Floor Interpretation and not the Lower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proximity of the Word ``Average'' to the Words ``Emission Limitation''.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters argued that the proximity of the word ``average'' to the words ``emission limitation'' suggests that ``average'' modifies ``emission limitation,'' and not the entire phrase following those words. The EPA does not agree with this argument. In English, adjectives often modify not only the noun immediately following, but an entire phrase. In the phrase ``the biggest mountain in North America climbed by members of the Washington, D.C. Climbing Club,'' for example, the adjective ``biggest'' modifies the entire remainder of the phrase. There is no reason to conclude that the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) plays a different role.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of the Words ``Achieved By''.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters argued that the use of the words ``achieved by'' in the statute indicates that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sources within the top 12 percent must be achieving the emission limitations used to set the MACT Floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

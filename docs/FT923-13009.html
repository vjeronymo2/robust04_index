			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / HK eases stance on airport negotiations THE Hong Kong government has significantly softened its negotiating stance with China over plans to finance the colony's HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.9bn) airport and related projects. At a meeting of the joint Sino-British airport committee today the government is expected to propose to China that it approve the financial package for the airport and leave resolution of China's concerns about the airport railway to future negotiations. Previously the Hong Kong government had sought approval for the whole financing for the project. The decision came on Tuesday at the first meeting of the colony's cabinet, chaired by Governor Chris Patten, and might indicate a more pragmatic attitude in dealing with Beijing. At the same time, the government released details of Hong Kong's foreign reserves - hitherto a secret known only to a few officials and never revealed in detail to Beijing - a move seen to ease China's concerns about the robustness of the colony's finances. It said Hong Kong's foreign reserves were USDollars 29bn at the end of 1991, 12th largest in the world. China's reserves are put at Dollars 43.6bn. The government said knowledge of the figure would help lenders to its infrastructure programmes realistically to assess the colony's financial health.</p>

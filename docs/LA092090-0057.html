			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEVRON'S SUIT AGAINST PENNZOIL IS DISMISSED;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: A FEDERAL JUDGE SAID ITS CLAIM THAT THE HOUSTON OIL FIRM ILLEGALLY  BOUGHT 9% OF ITS STOCK WAS WITHOUT MERIT.  </P> <P> A federal judge Wednesday dismissed Chevron Corp.'s lawsuit charging that  Pennzoil Co. illegally purchased nearly 9% of Chevron's stock, a Pennzoil  lawyer said Wednesday.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti ruled that the suit was without merit after  most of the charges had already been dismissed, Pennzoil attorney Stephen Bomse  said.  </P> <P> Conti cited sworn declarations by Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke, who said  Pennzoil had two priorities for investing the Texaco proceeds: achieving  maximum long-term value for Pennzoil's shareholders and, if possible, a tax  deferral on the settlement proceeds.  </P> <P> The Liedtke statement also disclosed that Pennzoil had considered buying  smaller oil companies outright but decided that they were either fully priced  or unavailable.  </P> <P> He also said Pennzoil considered buying British Petroleum PLC shares but was  outbid by BP itself.  </P> <P> Chevron said late Wednesday that it would review the possibility of appealing  Conti's ruling. "We're disappointed with the outcome," said Chevron Chairman  and Chief Executive Kenneth T. Derr, "and we're looking at the merits of an  appeal."  </P> <P> Chevron, a San Francisco-based oil company long haunted by takeover rumors,  last December filed the lawsuit when Pennzoil, a much smaller rival, disclosed  that it had bought about 31.5 million Chevron shares.  </P> <P> William Edlund, Chevron's lead counsel in the case, said he had not seen the  judge's 23-page ruling but was disappointed that the suit had been dismissed.  </P> <P> "Frankly, speaking as the lawyer but not for the company, I see some errors in  it," Edlund said of the ruling.  </P> <P> Chevron argued that Pennzoil was seeking an active management role but said the  company failed to disclose that in its filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> Many industry analysts have taken Chevron's point of view. "A company the size  of Pennzoil is not going to take a position in a company the size of Chevron  and be passive," said oil industry analyst Craig Schwerdt at Drake Capital  Securities in Santa Monica. "They are in the same business. Pennzoil might try  to get a board seat or two. And Chevron would not want somebody looking over  its shoulder, especially if it's a competitor."  </P> <P> Schwerdt speculated that Pennzoil eventually might try to swap its Chevron  stake for company assets, such as oil reserves.  </P></p>

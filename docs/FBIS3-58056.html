The question of dissolving the two  chambers is now in the hands of the Quirinale [office of the  president of the Republic].    Rome--Carlo Azeglio Ciampi is satisfied with what his  government has accomplished in these eight months, especially on  the economic front, where it has succeeded in regaining the  confidence of the international markets. He is more than  cautious, however, with regard to the possible political  developments of the next few days, all of which will involve the  procedures for dissolving the two houses of Parliament pursuant  to the motions of no confidence introduced by Marco Pannella and  others.    The political statements made by the prime minister during  the traditional year-end press conference serve above all to  confirm several things. First, the parliamentary debate will  take place and the government is resigned to it, as has already  been explained in the statement made by the Quirinale and  published following Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's summit with the  presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate; and  second, at the meetings already scheduled for 4 and 5 January  with the parliamentary groups, Ciampi will seek to clarify the  general orientation of these groups, especially because many  members of Parliament--who have supported the government and say  they will continue to evaluate its action--have chosen the  option of the no-confidence motion.    Before taking its next steps, Palazzo Chigi [office of the  prime minister] is waiting for 12 January, the date already set  for the parliamentary debate. For his part, Ciampi confirmed  that the government--having performed its function--is ready to  relinquish power immediately, but then insisted several times  during the press conference that "it is not the task of this  administration to decide if--and for how long--this legislature  should continue," explaining that for this reason he is not yet  in a position to know "whether it should end immediately or  continue until the next legislature."    In short, we learned from Ciampi's statements that  everything  will depend on what develops in the course of the parliamentary  debate, and--in particular--we learned that any decision  concerning the date of the elections will depend on the  assessment that the president of the Republic will make of these  developments.    And concerning his own political future, Ciampi was  particularly reserved. He offered only one certainty: he will  not participate in the election campaign. "If it is needed,  however," he explained, "I shall be happy if I am able to offer  my counsel," inasmuch as he has spent a lifetime in the civil  service.    The prime minister did not, however, dodge those questions  that were in some way connected with Silvio Berlusconi's entry  into politics, and made two firm points. The first point was  that if he remains in Palazzo Chigi during the election  campaign, the principal task of his administration will be to  "guarantee the par condicio [equal treatment before  the law] to everyone." The second point--which he expounded with  a touch of irony in response to a question by a sports  reporter--was that "no one can have a copyright on the motto,  Forza Italia." The prime minister will accordingly  continue to root for the National Team even before the  elections, and of course afterward.    Ciampi--who also expressed appreciation for the pope's words  concerning the unity of our country--did not conceal the fact  that he twice was tempted to throw in the sponge and leave  Palazzo Chigi: first, when it appeared that the agreement on the  cost of labor would not be successfully concluded, and again  following the simultaneous terrorist attacks in Rome and Milan  on the night of 27-28 July of this year.    The prime minister also dealt with economic topics,  especially in his introductory statement at the press  conference. He emphasized the renewed confidence that Italy,  Inc., has regained on the international markets and also the  positive result of a current inflation rate of 4 percent, which  makes the objective of an eventual reduction to 2.5 percent a  realistic one. These results were also--and above all--achieved  thanks to the agreement on the cost of labor. There remains,  unfortunately, the "distress" over the high unemployment, the  causes of which--Ciampi said--can be removed "if Italy will  construct its future development on new foundations."    Marco Pannella, sponsor of the motion of no confidence,  offered a favorable assessment of Ciampi's statements. "The  press conference," Pannella said, "demonstrates that a strong  Ciampi administration is necessary and that we must hold the  elections to render a judgment as between the political  coalition that has supported Ciampi, on the one hand, and the  opposition."</p>

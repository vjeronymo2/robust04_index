			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RUSH FOR CASH MAKES PAWNBROKERS MERRY;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: WHILE RETAIL BUSINESS IS DOWN, PAWNSHOPS REPORT A HOLIDAY SURGE AS  SHOPPERS LOOK FOR QUICK DOLLARS TO MAKE CHRISTMAS PURCHASES AND END UP BUYING  PAWNED ITEMS.  </P> <P> Jeff Bernard acknowledges that there is some good-humored debate about the  meaning of the three balls that hang above the doorway of Palace Pawnbrokers.  </P> <P> Some people say the balls, long the symbol of the pawn industry, stand for Buy,  Sell and Trade, said Bernard, the manager of the San Diego shop. Others quip  that, if you borrow money at a pawnshop, leaving your valuables behind as  collateral, the three balls are a reminder that "two to one, you won't get them  back."  </P> <P> But, on Monday, harried pawnbrokers around the county said the three balls  might as well have been Christmas ornaments. From El Cajon to Lemon Grove to  Oceanside, owners of hock shops reported a holiday surge in business sure to  make most conventional retailers turn red and green with envy.  </P> <P> At the pawnbrokers' well-lighted loan counters, people lined up to trade their  belongings for last-minute shopping money -- usually 10% to 25% of an item's  retail worth. And, as often as not, many turned around and spent their  new-found cash before leaving the shops, reveling in the unusual selection and  the rock-bottom prices.  </P> <P> "I do all my Christmas shopping here," said Kathy Carpenter, an executive  secretary from Mission Valley who spent part of Christmas Eve browsing around  Royal Loan Pawnbrokers in Hillcrest. She proudly displayed a gold chain  bracelet that she had bought for her boyfriend -- a $400 value, she said, for  just $185.  </P> <P> "Gold is gold. Diamonds are diamonds. What does it matter if it's been used?"  she asked. "I'll never go back to a regular jewelry store."  </P> <P> Indeed, as area department stores and gift shops report lighter-than-usual  holiday buying, Christmas cheer is alive and well at local pawnshops. According  to shop owners, including several who have extended their hours to accommodate  the new business, the recent economic downturn seems to have broadened their  customer base.  </P> <P> "We're hitting more the middle class as opposed to the lower-to-middle," said  Marc Vogel, owner of We Lend More Inc. in National City, who says the last 90  days have brought more requests for high-end loans. "More Rolex and Cartier  watches (being pawned). Larger diamonds, larger loans. . . . We knew about the  recession before the recession happened."  </P> <P> "They seem to come in busloads," said Donny Kaufman, the owner of East County  Pawn Shop in El Cajon, who claims to buy, loan, sell or trade "practically  anything" of value. Kaufman also reported making more loans on everything from  computers to compact discs. "People need money, more so this year than last  year," he said.  </P> <P> Bernard, who was serving champagne at his store Monday, attributes some of the  rush to the fact that department stores, desperate for sales, have held their  usual post-Christmas sales before the holidays.  </P> <P> "The stores are forcing people to spend now," he said. But, while they're in  the pawnshop getting cash, it never hurts to look around -- at the autoharps,  conga drums, encyclopedias, luggage, shortwave radios, weed whackers and  wedding rings, among other things.  </P> <P> "You'd rather give somebody a used Nintendo game than something else new that  they won't use, right?" said Bernard. "You have to put things in perspective:  If it works, it works. Quality is quality -- new, used or indifferent."  </P> <P> Besides, it's not necessarily forever -- you have four months to reclaim your  belongings. And it's fun to drive a bargain. Haggling is generally frowned upon  in Robinson's or Nordstrom. But, at a pawnshop, it's encouraged -- especially  if you have cash.  </P> <P> "This would be $2,500 new," Bernard said of a gold pinkie ring sporting a  3/4-carat diamond. "Here, it's $1,600. And, if a customer had cash, they could  walk out of the store with this ring for $1,200 or $1,300."  </P> <P> Jerry, the manager of Royal Loan Pawnbrokers, says he has had customers this  year who charged expensive items on their department store accounts in order to  sell them to Jerry for cash. That's how he got the new video camera in the  window -- just $895, complete with manufacturer's warranty.  </P> <P> Jerry doesn't want to see his last name in the newspaper; he says he wants his  customers to visit him at the 4,000-square-foot store, not at home.  </P> <P> Jerry, who calls his shop the poor man's bank, likes to hand out a three-color  flyer that commands: "Visit Your Pawn Shop for a Day of Exciting Shopping." It  points out the relative impossibility of getting a 30-to-90 day loan of, say,  $300 from a larger financial institution. It also notes that pawnshops are  legitimate businesses, licensed by the state.  </P> <P> "You may be asking, 'Isn't a lot of the merchandise in a pawnshop stolen?' "  reads the flyer, which uses the term "previously owned merchandise" instead of  "used." The answer is no, it says. "The pawn broker is not here today and gone  tomorrow like the flea market, auction sale, garage sale, or the guy selling  out of a van on the side of the road."  </P> <P> On the wall at Royal Loan is a vibrant painting by LeRoy Neiman, the artist  best known for his sports paintings and his close association with Playboy  publisher Hugh Hefner.  </P> <P> "That would be $10,000 at any gallery in La Jolla," Jerry says. "We're asking  $5,500."  </P> <P> At the loan counter is a photograph of a Classic '58 Buick with a custom  turquoise paint job and all the original parts. Somebody pawned the car and  never picked it up. It has just 3,700 miles on it, and it can by yours for  "just $4,995, or best offer."  </P> <P> Jerry claims to have no set limit on his loans. But he doesn't take just  anything as collateral, as one woman found out Monday.  </P> <P> "It's before Christmas, and I'm running low, and I found out my boyfriend's got  me an engagement ring," she said, holding out a slim wristwatch. "I want to get  him something special. If you could give me even $10 for this. . . ."  </P> <P> Jerry shook his head. Only gold watches and Rolexes, he explained. "I'm sorry,"  he said.  </P> <P> Another woman was on the telephone. She needed a minimum of $1,000, she said,  for an Australian coin.  </P> <P> "You got gold coins?" Jerry asked her. "Bring 'em all in here and I'll do my  best to see you walk out of here with $1,000."  </P></p>

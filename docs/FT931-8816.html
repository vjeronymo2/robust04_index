			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley accused of capitulating to Treasury MR DAVID BLUNKETT, shadow health secretary, reacted angrily in the Commons yesterday to Mrs Virginia Bottomley's statement on the future of London's hospitals. He told the health secretary that the commercialisation of the NHS and the introduction of the internal market had turned the capital's health care problem into a 'crisis'. Mr Blunkett accused Mrs Bottomley of capitulating to Treasury demands for cash to pay for the government's 'economic incompetence'. Existing hospitals would be allowed to 'wither on the vine' while adequate resources were not being made available to put in place the health care needed, he said. Mrs Bottomley said Mr Blunkett had made 'a populist, knee-jerk, unreconstructed, destructive reaction'. It also reflected the fact that he was sponsored by the health union Cohse, which always put jobs before patients. She stressed that the Pounds 170m additional money being made available to improve primary health care in London was Pounds 30m above the figure recommended in the Tomlinson report. The government's proposals won a broad welcome yesterday from most of the hospitals affected, Robert Rice and Richard Tomkins write. Both Guy's and St Thomas' said they were pleased that Mrs Bottomley had accepted the recommendation that they should merge as a single NHS Trust. St Thomas' said it particularly welcomed the government's recognition of the need for a merged accident and emergency department for south London on one site. University College and the Middlesex said the planned merger of the two hospitals was in line with their own strategy. They expected to merge on the UCH site, redeveloping it to incorporate the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. The Royal London said it was uneasy about the proposal to strip it of responsibility for community services, but it strongly welcomed the forthcoming review of specialities. Charing Cross, which remains under the threat of closure, said the report clearly recognised that the hospital's specialty services had a future: it now had to be established exactly what form that future would take.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- China announced here  today a removal of licenses and quotas from another 195 kinds of  imported goods.    China had abolished import licenses and quotas for 283 kinds  of goods from January 1, 1994.    The announcement was made by Long Yongtu, assistant minister  of foreign trade and economic cooperation, here this afternoon.    The move taken by the Chinese Government this time is  designed to bring its import system closer to requirements of  international practice and to set up a new import system with  tariffs as its major means of regulation, Long said.    This marks an important part of China's efforts not only in  reforming its import management system, but also in pushing  forward the process of restoring its contracting status in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the assistant minister  told XINHUA.    Long made the remarks on the eve of his trip to Europe and  the United States. He will head a delegation to Brussels and  Washington on Friday [27 May] to discuss China's re-entry into  GATT with the European Union (EU) and the United States.    The discussion with the EU is scheduled for May 30 and 31 in  Brussels and the negotiations with the U.S. will run from June  3 to June 8 in Washington.    The 195 kinds of imported goods from which licenses and  quotas have been lifted this time cover 30 kinds of imports to  be free of controls by the end of this year and 120 by the end  of next year, as planned in the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of  Understanding on Market Access.    China's stepped-up implementation of its promise in the  agreement demonstrates China's sincerity and capability, Long  said.    On the upcoming talks with the EU and the U.S., Long said  the  talks will be very substantial since a protocol package will be  discussed during the period.    China has prepared itself in an earnest way for the  discussions and will present a large number of documents on  China's foreign trade regime, he said.    The assistant minister said the discussions, on a basis of  full transparency, will focus on tariffs, tariff exemptions,  foreign trading rights and other issues related to China's  foreign trade system.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Romanian coalminers back at work as strike collapses ROMANIA'S Jiu Valley coal miners returned to work yesterday after a nine-day strike collapsed without apparently securing the large pay rises union leaders had demanded. The miners' union, the government, the Ministry of Industry and the RAH, the state-owned company which administers the region's 13 coal mines, would not release details of the settlement. Rompres, the state news agency, said the union and the RAH had agreed on monthly wages ranging from 146,000 lei (Pounds 122) for an unqualified worker up to 207,000 lei for an underground miner, compared with an average monthly wage of 224,000 lei which the union had demanded. Before the strike, the region's 43,000 miners earned on average 40 per cent more than other Romanian miners as well as receiving free coal, transport to work, meals and subsidised electricity and rent. The government said the strike had achieved nothing and it had stuck by its original offer of an average monthly wage of 166,000 lei. The union and the RAH had also agreed that 60 per cent of the 91bn lei (Pounds 75.8m) government subsidy to the RAH for 1993 would be spent on production and investment with the balance subsidising wages. The Romanian train drivers' union yesterday launched its second strike in two months, demanding new wage increases, causing further industrial chaos just hours after the end of the strike by coalminers. Many main-line stations were severely disrupted.</p>

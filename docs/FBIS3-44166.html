			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 25 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] on Tuesday demanded the government suspend its  planned salary increases for senior civil servants. The  resolution evoked controversy within the TEC as government and  National Party representatives rejected it. Government  representative Fanie van der Merwe and the NP's Leon Wessels  argued the TEC had recommended its finance sub-council  investigate the increases and report to the TEC next week. Any  TEC decision on the increases should be made only after the  sub-council had delivered its report, they argued.    The increases were reported in a Sunday newspaper which  speculated their effect would be to dramatically boost civil  servants' pensions for retirees after the April elections. Mr  Van Der Merwe said the TEC had no way of knowing who exactly  would be affected by its decision. The resolution was carried  with government and NP disagreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Noshiro, Japan, June 21 KYODO -- The first-stage  motor of the three-stage M-5 rocket, Japan's largest solid-fuel  rocket for launching space exploration vehicles, was  successfully test-fired Tuesday [21 June], the Education  Ministry said.    The test was conducted at the ministry's Institute of Space  and Aeronautical Science rocket test site at Noshiro in Akita  Prefecture on the west coast of northern Japan.    The M-14 motor has a diameter of 2.5 meters, a length of  13.7  meters, and weighs 92 tons. It can develop a thrust of up to  382 tons.    The test team said the fuel used in the test matched their  expectations and the equipment regulating the thrust operated  normally.    The fuel was ignited at 11:30 A.M. under a cloudy sky with a  strong easterly wind. About 71 tons of fuel was consumed over  80 seconds.    Journalists covering the event about a kilometer away could  hear the rumbling of the horizontally positioned motor as it  spewed orange flame and white smoke out over the Sea of Japan.    Development of the M-5 began in the 1990s, but was delayed  because it was accorded lower development priority than the  smaller 1.8-meter-diameter solid-fuel rocket booster used in the  National Space Development Agency's large-scale liquid-fuel  rocket, the H-2.    This autumn, in-flight combustion tests of the second-stage  motor, M-24, will be conducted, and in 1995, fuel will be tested  in a second experimental version of the M-14 using the same  high- tensile steel as in the actual rocket.    The first rocket is scheduled to carry a scientific  satellite  known as Muses-B from the Kagoshima Space Center in 1996.</p>

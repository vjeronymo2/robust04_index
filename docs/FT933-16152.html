			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Irish talk tough but look for development aid deal THE IRISH government is ostensibly digging in its heels, in its fight to win IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) from the European Community regional development programme for 1994-1999. However, it is also quietly softening up public opinion for a possible compromise. Mr Dick Spring, foreign minister, blocked a deal at the weekend on the share-out of the programme's Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.4bn) package, after he had been offered only IPounds 7.5bn at an EC foreign ministers' meeting. The Dublin government insists it had oral assurances from the European Commission, at the Edinburgh summit last December, that Ireland's percentage of the 1994-1999 programme would remain as it was during the 1989-1993 programme. On returning from that summit, Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, had told the Dail (parliament): 'The agreement now reached ensures, and I say this with complete confidence, that Ireland will obtain in excess of IPounds 8bn over seven years. This will comprise up to IPounds 1bn from the new cohesion fund and more than IPounds 7bn from the structural funds.' After the devaluation of the Irish punt in January, he said the total he had been promised would be worth some IPounds 8.6bn. Having laid his political reputation on the line, despite having received no written assurances in Edinburgh, Mr Reynolds has been caught in the embarrassing situation of either having to compromise and face criticism at home, or be seen in Brussels as the principal obstacle to the biggest package of regional aid to be disbursed to the EC's disadvantages areas. Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael, said yesterday that Mr Reynolds should settle for nothing but the IPounds 8bn 'he promised, or was promised by an EC official'. At the weekend, Mr Reynolds insisted that he would not 'sell out' Ireland's interests, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that 'our target remains not less than IPounds 8bn'. However, the latter said: 'It is a matter of serious national concern and we will fight as hard as we can for the maximum. But we are in a negotiating stance. There is room for manoeuvre and space between the two figures.' In London, the prime minister's office yesterday welcomed an outline EC agreement on aid worth Pounds 2.3bn for depressed UK areas, but refused to say how Britain would interpret the rules on matching EC funds with aid from local or national government. Past UK Treasury attempts to curb its spending on regions benefiting from EC assistance have led to clashes with Brussels, and to rows between UK government departments and in parliament.</p>

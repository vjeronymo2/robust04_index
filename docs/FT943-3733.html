			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Kantor acts on Uruguay Round Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday met Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, in an effort to clear away final obstacles to passage this year of Uruguay Round-implementing legislation, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Mr Kantor was widely expected to withdraw the Clinton administration's request for new 'fast-track' authority, needed for further free-trade negotiations, in order to speed passage of the Round package. Fast-track has become controversial as Democrats want new trade agreements to include labour and environmental provisions, which Republicans oppose. Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the trade subcommittee, called yesterday for a slow approach to hemispheric free trade, smoothing the way for a withdrawal of the fast-track request.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Norman Chandler] </F>   [Text] America has the Avon cosmetics lady and the Fuller  brush salesman, both of whom have become part of that country's  folklore.    Destined to become part of South African legend is the  "Armscor [Armament Corporation of South Africa] Man"...now  hanging up his hat after 17 years of foot-in-the-door  international canvassing to convince the world that South Africa  needed military equipment and offering, in return,  top-of-the-range systems to anyone with the capability to pay  cash or barter.    Like the cosmetics lady and the brush salesman, "Armscor  Man"  has on occasion been spectacularly successful, but has also, at  the same time, endured a hard, long slog in representing a  beleaguered armaments industry trying to reach out  internationally during years of weapons sanctions imposed by the  United Nations as part of the campaign to end apartheid.    Last month, the UN decided apartheid had ended and, as a  result, the imposition of crippling sanctions should also be  terminated. That was, of course, due in no small measure to the  stunning victory at the polls of President Mandela's ANC.    -- The story of how Armscor -- the Armaments Corporation of  South Africa -- developed its expertise in a number of fields  will probably remain classified for years, but from what little  is known the company has taken South Africa into the big league  of arms manufacturers, exporters and procurers.    -- Executive general manager Tielman de Waal went on record  immediately after the lifting of sanctions as saying: "Armscor  will be able to conduct its business in an open and transparent  way.    "We do not foresee that the lifting of the (UN) embargo will  substantially change the procurement pattern of the past, except  that foreign procurement will no longer have to be conducted in  secret, and it can be conducted in a more cost-effective manner."    The organisation is at pains to emphasise that its staff did  not conduct highly secretive meetings in the back alleys of  Baghdad, Casablanca or other such mysterious cities but rather  "worked the room", as the saying goes, finally getting what it  wanted in the boardrooms of the world.    What has been acquired overseas remains a matter for  conjecture.    Armscor calls its acquisitions operations (or sales pitch,  in  plain English) the "value-for-money option", with expertise on  tap to provide specialist guidance to ensure maximum  cost-savings, without sacrificing quality and product capability.    During the last five years, the organisation has made  acquisitions totalling R30 billion [rand], the bulk of which has  been for South Africa's defence force.    Armscor says: "This was made possible through a  well-developed system comprising dedicated teamwork, the highest  technical expertise, strict financial discipline, advanced  project management and marketing, quality assurance, logistical  support and product-lifecycle management."    Behind those claims are the men and women who have put South  Africa at the cutting edge of international armaments, as well  as of commercial products.    Peet Smith, the company's general manager for import and  export control, puts it rather quaintly: "We can assist in  bringing the horse (the international client) and the water (the  South African product) together. In the end, the attractiveness  and the taste of the water will determine how much the horse is  going to drink."    The water has certainly been tested by many governments.  Horses such as Iraq have liked our long-range artillery pieces,  such as the G5 used in the Kuwaiti war and earlier in the  10-year battle between Iraq and Iran. Oman is buying Rooivalk  attack helicopters, regarded as far more efficient than anything  else on earth (Britain is evaluating the machine as well).    Certain unnamed countries have battle-tested armoured  equipment and mine-resistant vehicles, and assault rifles have  been sold to many others.    Also coming to light is how Armscor coped with the  international leaders in the armaments field, as well as with  the end of the Cold War, and what it has been doing since in the  local and international markets.    With the disintegration of the former Union of Soviet  Socialist Republics, the end of Russian influence in Angola, the  end of the total onslaught era and the abolition of apartheid,  the organisation had to find something else to do other than  sell weapons, which had suddenly become a dirty word in the  maelstrom of international politics.    It decided that to guarantee the survival of the highly  focused local armaments industry, and at the same time ensure  continuing state-of-the-art technology, adaptation was the name  of the game.    Armscor decided to split into two: the original company  continuing to acquire armaments and related products and  services, and the new firm -- known as Denel (Pty) Ltd, with a  host of subsidiaries -- the manufacturer.    During the 1980s, Armscor was a "fully fledged player in the  international arms market", but was winning customers in the  marketplace "through liaison at ministerial and other levels."    As part of its legacy as an armaments organisation, Armscor  at the end of March last year had paid R3.6 billion for  armaments out of its share of the Special Defence Equipment and  Activities Account (SDA) -- part of the R10 billion defence  budget.    The SDA is an account which, unlike many in other government  departments, need not be fully spent during the fiscal year.  Eighty percent of the money can be committed for the following  year, and the year thereafter.    Outstanding commitments on contract at that time stood at  R4.2 billion and approved commitments not yet contracted  totalled about R668 million, with a further R93 million in fixed  assets with contractors.    The effort now is concentrated on technological  sophistication, which could in fact be of help in non-military  products and processes, similar to the United States's space  programme, which has helped bring many products to the consumer  marketplace over the years.</p>

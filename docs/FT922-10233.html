			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Money Markets: Interest rates ease SOME traders speculated yesterday on the possibility of a cut in British interest rates after the Bank of England again bought bills at the longer end at slightly reduced rates. In yesterday's early trading in the discount market, the Bank bought Pounds 36m of Band-3 bills at 10 1/8 - 3/32 per cent and Pounds 13m of Band-4 at 10 1/32 -10 per cent. These were lower rates than those used on Wednesday morning, when the Bank bought Band-3 bills at 10 5/32 - 1/8 per cent and Band-4 bills at 10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent. Last week, the Bank was buying Band-3 bills at 10 5/32 per cent and Band-4 at 10 1/16 per cent. Rates for the shorter term bills in Bands-1 and 2 remained unchanged, however, with the Bank once again selling Pounds 147m of Band-1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Traders were divided over how to read the Bank's intentions from yesterday's rates in Bands-3 and 4. One trader believed this was the start of a slow climb down in rates, as the Bank of England tests whether the foreign exchanges will sell sterling at slightly reduced rates. 'The news is mildly encouraging on rates,' commented one trader. However, the majority believed that the Bank was more concerned to relieve the large shortages in the discount market without reducing the shorter term rates in Bands-1 and 2. Once again, the Bank posted a large end-of-month shortage at the start of trading yesterday of Pounds 1.2bn. In the afternoon, the shortage was revised to around Pounds 1.15bn before taking account of the morning operations. The Bank then purchased bills totalling Pounds 164m, of which Pounds 147m were Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 17m were for resale to the market on May 8 at 10 13/32 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 375m. In the interbank market, the 3-month rate, a key indicator of possible base rate moves, finished a shade lower at 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent compared to 10 1/2 - 1/2 yesterday. There was also a slight easing in the futures markets. The June Short sterling contract edged up during the day, tracking sterling's rise against the D-Mark. June short sterling opened on a low of 89.64 but finished at around 89.72. This suggests that the market believes that interest rates three months from now will be 10.28 per cent. In the German markets, the overnight rate fell from 9.60/65 per cent to around 7.50 to 8.50 per cent.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich falls prey to fresh weakness in Roche Bourses had a mixed day. The recovery in the dollar, in US treasuries and in European bonds helped in some countries, particularly Germany, where the expiry of DTB options contracts exaggerated the ebullience of equities. However, there was continued equity weakness in Switzerland, where bonds were a strong market, and Madrid ran out of steam although Spanish bonds had been the strongest market of the week, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH was lifted by the expiry of July futures contracts early in the day but, subsequently, Roche reasserted its negative influence. The SMI index finished 13.4 lower at 2,514.9, after a high of 2,556.3, and 1.8 per cent lower on the week. In its latest market outlook, CS Investment Research said that the downside potential for the market was limited and that a turnround was likely in the next two to four weeks. Roche certificates, under pressure earlier in the week after disappointing half-year sales figures, gave up SFr70 to SFr5,430 with foreign investors said to be taking profits after Thursday's improvement. According to one analyst, it appeared that index-linked funds were selling in order to switch holdings out of Switzerland. Ciba dipped SFr5 to SFr730 and Sandoz gave up SFr6 to SFr679. Banks, which produce half-year statements next month, ended mixed. UBS lost SFr6 to SFr1,166 and CS Holding rose SFr4 to SFr577. FRANKFURT consolidated Thursday afternoon's gains on the surge in bund futures, climbed about another percentage point on the session and then broke through the 2,100 mark in the afternoon, the Ibis-indicated Dax ending the day 1.6 per cent higher over 24 hours at 2,103.54. In official trading hours, it was up 2.1 per cent on the week at 2,093.61, turnover climbing from DM5.4bn to DM8.1bn, but market professionals said that both the scale of rises and business activity were inflated by the DTB closures. It was noticeable, they said, that the most of the big moves came in shares with a heavy weighting in the Dax. Allianz rose DM64 to DM2,497 on the session, and another DM19 to DM2,516 after hours. The top three shares by moves in Ibis trading were Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens. Outside the Dax index the ladies clothing company, Escada, put on DM31 or 9.6 per cent to DM353 on positive first-half figures, and the forecast that this year's results will exceed expectations. MILAN was unable to maintain early momentum on the last day of the monthly account as the clash between the government and magistrates over moves to limit powers of arrest in corruption cases raised the political temperature. The Comit index finished 9.91 higher at 711.12, a 3.5 per cent rise on the week. However, the real-time Mibtel index reflected the day's pull-back, ending 16 higher at 11,294, after an early high of 11,427. Independent Strategy, which has reduced its exposure to Italian equities from a neutral 2.8 per cent to 1.8 per cent in its model portfolio, commented that the government measures announced on Wednesday were unlikely to be sufficient to achieve their budgetary target, and that the deficit could rise to 11-12 per cent of GDP next year. The London-based group thought that the government's failure to institute credible measures to reduce the deficit in 1994 and 1995 would weigh heavily on financial market sentiment. Mr Richard Davidson at Morgan Stanley also reiterated an underweight recommendation in Italy, commenting that the Berlusconi factor was no longer a positive and Italian politics looked as fragmented as ever. The market's valuation was high at 21.6 times 1995 prospective earnings and there was still a significant equity supply overhang at a time when even domestic fund flows were slowing, he said. Telecommunications stocks remained in demand, Stet rising L89 to L5,607 and Sip adding L60 to L4,446. Some insurers also continued their strong showing. Ina added L28 to L2,430 while Ras was up L550 to L26,200. Generali was an exception, giving up L350 to L41,850. AMSTERDAM was mainly unaffected by the expiry of options and the AEX index closed the session 3.25 higher at 392.09, for a week's rise of 1.6 per cent. The main international stocks were firmer, reflecting dollar stability: Royal Dutch was up Fl 2.30 at Fl 190.10 and Unilever was Fl 1.20 higher at Fl 184.80. Heineken, strong in recent sessions, slipped 50 cents to Fl 221.50. Hoare Govett rated the stock a buy yesterday and forecast 1994 eps of Fl 14.50 per share and Fl 16.20 for 1995. MADRID was rescued by Telefonica which rose Pta50 to Pta1,870 in 5.7bn shares. Turnover was inflated by the closure of futures contracts but the general index rose only 0.13 to 302.79, up 3.1 per cent on the week.

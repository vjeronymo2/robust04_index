			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Barclays freezes pay for 3,000 managers BARCLAYS BANK has imposed a pay freeze on a third of its 9,000 managers after a breakdown of negotiations with its staff union. It is also refusing to go to the independent Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service to resolve the conflict on the grounds it cannot improve its offer. Mr Paul Snowball, general secretary of the Barclays Group Staff Union, said yesterday he was still hopeful that an agreement could be reached over managerial salaries. Much will depend on how quickly the bank can improve its financial performance. According to calculations by the staff union, Barclay's managers will receive salary increases ranging from zero to 1.2 per cent this year, with as many as 3,000 receiving no rise. Under the pay offer, which came into force yesterday, bonuses are being held at last year's levels and no changes are being made to the salary grid which decides the size of merit awards. In a ballot, 92 per cent of management rejected the bank's offer. But the bank told the staff union it could not improve its proposal for managers and was imposing the new deal from this month. As many as 470 managers are being made redundant this year. Last year the bank made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m. The executive of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation - the tax officers' union - is writing to its 53,000 members this week to tell them it will ignore the union's conference rejection last week of their 1.5 per cent pay rise. The members voted in a ballot to accept the pay offer by 63.6 per cent for and only 36.4 per cent against in a 70 per cent turnout. At last week's annual conference delegates rejected the 1.5 per cent pay offer and refused to accept the ballot result of the union's membership. They also called for an overtime ban until a satisfactory agreement had been reached and declared the ballot null and void. But after legal advice the federation executive decided to go ahead and accept the pay increase in line with the government's public-sector pay limit.</p>

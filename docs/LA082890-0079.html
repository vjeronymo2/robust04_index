			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: DURBAN;  </P> <P> A PIVOTAL PARTY CONGRESS  </P> <P> South Africa's ruling National Party, battling to hold onto white voters  nervous about apartheid reforms, meets in this southeastern coastal city  Thursday and Friday for its first provincial congress since President Frederik  W. de Klerk's election 11 months ago.  </P> <P> Its biggest problem is retaining white support long enough to prove that the  reform process can bring the country together and end its international  ostracism. But recent black factional fighting near Johannesburg has fueled  white fears of a future black-led government.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, party leaders have hinted that they may also discuss opening their  membership rolls to all races.  </P></p>

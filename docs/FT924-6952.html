			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: GAN acquires 10% of Imperio GAN, one of France's largest insurance groups, is accelerating its international expansion by acquiring a 10 per cent stake in Imperio, the biggest insurer in Portugal. The investment comes at a time when a number of French insurers are expanding into other countries. Assurances Generales de France (AGF) recently strengthened its involvement with AMB of Germany and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) is still locked in negotiations to try to expand into the German market by taking a stake in Colonia. France's insurance companies have been hit by the economic slowdown and by the fall in the value of their property holdings. However, they have not suffered to the same extent as their counterparts in the US and UK. GAN, the smallest of France's big three state-controlled insurers, recently reported a fall in net profits to FFr487.1m (Dollars 90.37m) in the first half of this year from FFr961.9m in the same period in 1991. Imperio controls 12.5 per cent of the Portuguese insurance market with premiums worth FFr2bn. The GAN deal is a by-product of a change in control at Imperio which puts entrepreneur Mr Jose Manuel de Melo back at the helm of Imperio, 17 years after the company was nationalised. He is paying the state Es18.4bn (Dollars 130m) for 70 per cent of Imperio. In a subscription operation for the remaining 30 per cent of capital, GAN was the leader among 11 foreign investors, acquiring 10 per cent. Company employees acquired 10.5 per cent and small savers 4.5 per cent, both at discounted prices. Mr de Mello, who is rebuilding a financial and industrial empire largely destroyed by Portugal's post-revolutionary nationalisations of 1975, indicated he did not plan large management changes.</p>

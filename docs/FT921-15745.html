			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Colleges fail to claim tax relief for training THOUSANDS of financially troubled colleges of further education and private providers of training are failing to register for tax relief worth more than Pounds 20m in 1992-93. Tax relief was announced in the last Budget on courses leading to National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) up to level 4 - the vocational equivalent of a degree. Individual trainees, according to new guidelines, would pay reduced fees from which basic-rate tax has been deducted. But providers of training can claim tax relief only if they register with the Inland Revenue before April 6. The Department of Employment said yesterday that only 430 of the 7,000 providers of training who were eligible for relief had claimed it. They included colleges of further education and private providers of training. An estimated 250,000 people pay to study for NVQs. The government's objective in announcing the tax relief was to encourage more people to invest in their own training and self-development. It estimated the cost of the tax relief at Pounds 20m in 1992-93, rising to Pounds 40m in the mid-1990s when all NVQs are avail-able. The Inland Revenue said it was arranging a series of seminars to explain to trainers how the tax relief would work. These will run during February and March.</p>

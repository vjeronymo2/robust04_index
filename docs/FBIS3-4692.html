			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi </F> Takemura by unidentified reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you describe your opinion  on prospects for a realignment of political parties?    [Takemura] Political circles are being urged to catch up  with  the new election system, and a realignment of political parties  is becoming a realistic and vivid topic. In the next general  election, we must not simply seek the majority power or  quorum-oriented alliances. I think that in the next election we  should take the first step based on our own judgment of Japan's  future and the direction of its politics.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] In a recent speech, you noted that a  regrouping of parties should be carried on in view of three  factors: the perception of the times, political ideals, and  political style. Could you explain these a little?    [Takemura] Each party must have a clear political ideal or  basic policy. I think that an interparty alliance should be  discussed according to how distant a party is from others in  such official positions.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you mean exactly by the  perception  of the times?    [Takemura] Unlike the period of rightist-leftist antagonism  under the cold war structure, we now can afford to choose  political partners from a wide range, from the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] to the Social Democratic Party of Japan.  This is the time in which we have to find appropriate partners  to hammer out new goals.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Could you define the political ideal?    [Takemura] Basically, it is a party's stands toward the  Constitution, the direction of the nation, and the  implementation of democracy. Individual subjects include  education, welfare, and the environment. Of course, security  policy is also an important subject.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Then, what is your description of  political style?    [Takemura] The public is strictly observing in what manner  parties collect and spend money, and in what manner they manage  their own personnel and organization. So, I think a policy is  not enough for a party to win the public's confidence.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you say this to clarify a gap between  your party and the Shinseito-Komeito [Japan Renewal Party-Clean  Government Party] team?    [Takemura] I do not want to believe that the two parties  have  clear problems in their styles; however, some specific persons  may have such problems. Probably, one of the most important  points is (in what manner) the parties makes decisions (on their  courses of action).    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your stand toward the "ordinary  nation" proposal made by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa?    [Takemura] Mr. Ozawa described that idea in various ways,  but, generally speaking, the proposal for being an ordinary  nation is being discussed in connection with Japan's military  role in the world. I guess that advanced Western nations look  normal to him, and he wants to make Japan play a military role  equal to that of their levels. But it is impossible for Japan  to achieve that objective without a revision of the  Constitution. I think that the public takes a negative stand  toward such an idea because the Japanese people still continue  their regret over their nation's behavior during the war. The  most urgent question for the international community is how  human beings can jointly solve contradictions in various  nonmilitary fields. As a matter of fact, coping with regional  conflicts is a very important subject, but global environmental  problems are even more critical.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your comment on Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's proposal for a unification of the  parliamentary groups of all the coalition parties?    [Takemura] It is hard for me to see whether this is needed  for managing the current Diet session or for a party realignment  in preparation for the next general election. I cannot go for a  drastic idea like that. Because each coalition party has its  unique standpoint, it is too reckless to merge all of them into  one parliamentary group or party all at once.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the prime minister's  proposal affects your plan for a merger of Sakigake [Harbinger]  and the Japan New Party [JNP]?    [Takemura] I am seriously worried about that. We have been  dealing with each other with much respect concerning an  engagement to the JNP. I would like to have a serious talk with  Mr. Hosokawa as soon as possible. This issue affects the very  foundation of my party. I feel that the proposal ruins our  steady steps up to now.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] There is an opinion that the next general  election should be fought between the LDP and the anti-LDP  group. What is your comment on that?    [Takemura] I am skeptical over an election under such an  artificial bipolar framework. It is theoretically possible to  form a new party only for one's survival in the next election,  but we would lose the public's confidence if we dissolve the  party immediately after the election. Two-party politics is not  a necessary condition for a single-seat constituency system. In  particular, Japanese politics is undergoing a transitional  period. For the time being, sound development would be ensured  under the multiparty system, rather than under the two-party  system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] About 200 Portuguese immigrants have arrived in  Lisbon from South Africa, some vowing never to return, fuelling  fears of a panic-stricken exodus before the elections. However,  most said they were merely taking an extended break and would  watch the results of the elections from a safe distance.  Meanwhile, Lisbon is bracing itself for a stampede of  Portuguese immigrants if South Africa should plunge into chaos  after the elections and has already begun contingency plans to  airlift and temporarily accommodate fleeing nationals.</p>

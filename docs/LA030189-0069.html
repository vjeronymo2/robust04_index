			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT JUDGE TO HOLD POST-TRIAL HEARING ON DEFENSE DELAYS  </P> <P> The judge in the Randy Steven Kraft trial, increasingly impatient with the pace  of courtroom activity, declared Tuesday that he will hold a hearing after the  trial is over to determine whether delays by the defense in presenting  witnesses have been reasonable.  </P> <P> Although Judge Donald A. McCartin did not describe it as a contempt of court  hearing, that's how Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald viewed it. He immediately  lashed back at the judge.  </P> <P> "This is impacting my ability to effectively and fairly represent Mr. Kraft,"  McDonald told the court. "It's going to reflect on my willingness to vigorously  represent Mr. Kraft if I feel that the court is threatening me with contempt at  the end of the case."  </P> <P> Although McDonald was shouting at the judge, he said later that he would  characterize his demeanor as "assertive" instead of "excited."  </P> <P> "This is an extremely complex case," McDonald said. "We're doing the best we  can under the circumstances."  </P> <P> Kraft, 43, is charged with 16 Orange County murders. But he is accused by  prosecutors of a total of 45 murders in Southern California, Oregon, and  Michigan, many of which will be mentioned to the jury if the trial reaches a  penalty phase. It took Kraft's attorneys 5 years to prepare for trial, a time  they said they needed to investigate all the deaths attributed to their client.  </P> <P> When the prosecution ended its case in November, the defense was given until  Jan. 30 to begin presenting witnesses. Since then, they have rarely had enough  witnesses to keep the court in session a full day.  </P> <P> McCartin expressed irritation Tuesday that jurors were outside the courtroom  waiting to enter on time at 9:15 a.m., but McDonald wasn't in court because he  was still interviewing a witness.  </P> <P> The judge complained that the defense has seldom had more than 2 hours of  testimony a day since it began presenting witnesses.  </P> <P> "I think I've bent over backwards to be extremely fair," the judge said. "But  the jury is going to wonder what in the world we are doing. I mean they come in  at 9:15 in the morning and and have no idea why they are sitting (outside the  courtroom) until 10 o'clock."  </P> <P> McDonald responded: "Your honor, if you can get somebody else to handle this in  a more expeditious fashion, I welcome it. Frankly, I'm going as fast as I can  here."  </P> <P> And the judge responded: "We will put it in the drawer for now. I'm just saying  that when the end of this case is over, we will have a hearing and see if the  reasons you stated (for any morning delays) are valid."  </P> <P> Judge McCartin said a citation for contempt would be a possible option if the  defense explanation turns out to be unsatisfactory.  </P> <P> McDonald asked for a mistrial -- the third time he has done so since testimony  began last September -- but McCartin denied it.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown was quiet during most of this exchange, but  when the judge asked him if he had anything to say, he let McDonald have it.  </P> <P> The problem is not just getting the defense to start on time in the mornings,  Brown said. "Once we start, it peters out after a few witnesses."  </P> <P> Brown went on: "I'm having a difficult time believing Mr. McDonald when he says  that the court's comments are compromising his ability to represent Mr. Kraft.  That's just got to be a bunch of baloney. The court has not put anywhere near  the pressure on them that the court has put on the (prosecution).  </P> <P> Brown reminded the judge of his comment when Brown ran out of witnesses one day  last September about 20 minutes before the normal 4:30 p.m. stopping time. "I  want those witnesses out there three deep from now on," he told Brown at the  time.  </P> <P> "The court hasn't done that to the defense. . . . Yesterday was a good example.  What did we have, three witnesses yesterday?" Brown said.  </P> <P> The judge countered that he did not want to pressure McDonald on how many  witnesses he must produce each day because, "I don't want the record to reflect  I'm trying to put a firecracker to his ear. . . ."  </P> <P> "Well, your honor," replied McDonald, "I would say threatening me with contempt  is a firecracker by my standards."  </P></p>

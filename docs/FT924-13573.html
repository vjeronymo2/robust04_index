			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Russia's first deputy foreign ministers steps down RUSSIA'S first deputy foreign minister stepped down yesterday in response to accusations that he was too 'soft' on the Baltics and other former Soviet republics, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Fyodor Shelov-Kovedyaev said his depature did not signify 'tragic changes' in Russian diplomacy but was intended to remove a pretext for conservatives to hinder President Boris Yeltsin's liberal policies. However, a spokesman for Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, a leader of the Civic Union alliance which has demanded the heads of several ministers including that of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, said: 'His resignation is a first step along a path of very serious changes in the foreign ministry.' A Latvian representative in Moscow, Mr Igors Graushs, whose republic has been at loggerheads with Moscow over its treatment of its large Russian minority and the timing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, said he feared the resignation could signal a 'much tougher line on the Baltics'.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONE MARROW DONOR BABY  </P> <P> This was a very private choice. It is, therefore, very disturbing to hear  bioethicists criticize that decision and those parents on suspiciously  unbecoming grounds.  </P> <P> If it is wrong to have more than one child or a large family in order to  protect the family unit, civilization has had it wrong since man moved off of  the savannah and into caves. For billions of people throughout the world and  for a million years before there was a lady bountiful or a welfare state,  having many children was, and remains today, social security and child support  and Meals on Wheels all rolled into one. If one child has to go to work in  order that the family may eat and pay the rent or even so that siblings may go  to school, is it any concern of professional do-gooders?  </P> <P> ARTHUR D.

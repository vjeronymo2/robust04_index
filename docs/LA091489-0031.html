			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: WRONG MIX OF MEDICATION, FOOD CAN LEAD TO NUTRITIONAL  DEFICIENCIES  </P> <P> Many of us try to choose our foods to promote good health. Some of us also take  medications -- either over-the-counter or prescription -- for the same reason.  But what happens when the two are at odds?  </P> <P> Research has shown that use of certain drugs can lead to nutritional  deficiencies. And by the same token, diet can block the effectiveness of some  medications.  </P> <P> It makes sense that foods and drugs interact within the body. Yet the chemical  intricacies of how they do so remain a gray area. Meanwhile, medications on the  market multiply every year, widening the problem's scope.  </P> <P> Some facts are known about the effect of drugs on nutrition. Digitalis, used in  the treatment of heart disease, has been found to depress appetite. Many other  drugs can upset the stomach, causing you to eat less. Over a long period of  time, such a side effect might result in significant weight loss and depletion  of nutrients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nutrient Absorption Blocked  </P> <P> Some drugs impair the body's ability to utilize nutrients. One of the first to  be shown to do so was mineral oil, once commonly used as a laxative. In some  people it hampers absorption of vitamins A, D, E and K. Laxatives cut down the  length of time foods stay in the body, reducing the opportunity to absorb the  nutrients they provide. And some laxatives also can affect the lining of the  intestine. Likewise, antibiotics alter the intestine, affecting intake of  glucose, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, carotene and Vitamin  B-12.  </P> <P> Another group are the antacids containing magnesium or aluminum hydroxide.  Binding themselves to phosphorus, they make phosphorus hard to absorb. They  also interfere with absorption of folic acid by making the gastrointestinal  tract more alkaline. And potassium chloride, which is used to protect potassium  supplies, raises the acidity of the intestine, reducing uptake of Vitamin B-12.  </P> <P> Other drugs can hasten the destruction of vitamins. Patients on long-term  anticonvulsant medication may develop a bone disease called osteomalacia,  possibly because the drug stimulates enzymes that inactivate Vitamin D, which  is essential to bones.  </P> <P> Still other drugs cause nutrients to be lost through urinary excretion. Taking  aspirin may increase excretion of Vitamin C. Isoniazin, a drug used to fight  tuberculosis, binds with Vitamin B-6, which is then excreted by the kidney.  </P> <P> With all the drugs we've been discussing, the extent of the nutritional problem  caused will depend on the length of time involved, rather than on the dose. In  other words, occasional use of medications won't jeopardize your nutritional  status, but long-term use could open the door to nutritional deficiencies.  </P> <P> The flip side of the coin is that as drugs can alter nutritional processes, so  food may affect the action of drugs. If you drink milk when you take the  antibiotic tetracycline, calcium will block the drug's absorption. Other foods  affect other medications differently, and the effect is not always negative.  For instance, anti-fungal medications are absorbed more readily if taken with a  high-fat meal. And while fruit juices may interfere with absorption of some  antibiotics, the acid environment they create is helpful when it comes to  taking iron supplements.  </P> <P> Some foods contain ingredients that counteract the effectiveness of a medicine.  Foods high in Vitamin K (essential for blood clotting) such as broccoli, beef  liver, cabbage, asparagus and spinach may inactivate anti-clotting medication.  And if you're taking the anti-depressant monoamine oxidase inhibitors, you  should stay away from foods rich in tyramine such as Cheddar cheese, avocado,  bananas, soy sauce and chicken liver. These foods can bring about serious  complications. Also, megadoses of Vitamin B-6 work against L-Dopa, used to  treat Parkinson's disease.  </P> <P> So, what's a body to do when medications are necessary over the long term? The  wisest step is to read directions on the bottle or package to find out just  when (before or after a meal) and how (with water, milk, etc.) any drug should  be taken. It's also important to consult with your physician about what dietary  course to follow.  </P> <P> When it comes to mixing drugs and food, you should give yourself every chance  to make the mix both effective and safe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Updated Figures Give Eggs Lower Cholesterol Content  </P> <P> Question: Are eggs today lower in cholesterol than they used to be? I heard  that on the radio and wonder if it's really true.  </P> <P> Answer: Updated figures for the cholesterol content of eggs are considerably  lower than those first published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture more  than 20 years ago. Indeed, the results of a nationwide study conducted jointly  by the USDA and the egg industry indicate that the average large egg contains  213 milligrams of cholesterol, down 22% from earlier estimates of 274  milligrams. These results are based on analyses of samples representing more  than 60% of the eggs produced in this country.  </P> <P> A major reason is the availability of superior methods of laboratory analysis,  making more accurate determinations possible. But there may be real differences  in the amount of cholesterol in eggs now available. It has been suggested that  changes in feed and increased production of eggs by hens result in eggs that  contain less cholesterol.  </P> <P> But even at these lower levels, eggs remain the main source of dietary  cholesterol for most Americans.  </P> <P> Q: Is it true that one out of five adults in this country is overweight?  </P> <P> A: Alas, the figure is higher. The most recent estimates come from data  obtained by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 32  states and the District of Columbia in 1987. Conducted by state health  departments and coordinated by the National Centers for Disease Control, the  surveillance system's telephone surveys have been providing valuable  self-reported behavioral and personal-health practices information since 1981.  </P> <P> That survey found the prevalence of overweight to be 21.8% for men and 21.1%  for women. Prevalence varies considerably by region. It is lowest in the West  (17%), followed by the Northeast (19.8%), the South (22%) and the Midwest  (23.1%).  </P> <P> But if anything, these estimates, based as they are on self-reporting, err on  the side of underestimation.  </P> <P> In the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, where  individuals were weighed and measured, the prevalence of overweight was 24.2%  among men and 27.1% among women. Given the increased risk of a number of  diseases associated with excess weight, even the lower figures are too high.  </P> <P> Q: Can honey cause botulism poisoning in infants?  </P> <P> A: Honey has been linked to increased risk of botulism in infants and is  currently not recommended as a suitable food for babies under 1 year of age,  and especially not before they are 6 months old. But the occurrence of infant  botulism cannot be explained by the use of honey alone. In fact, while as many  as 29% of the affected subjects in early studies had been given honey, in later  studies that figure had dropped to about 20%.  </P> <P> In an attempt to better understand the infection, which has been diagnosed in  600 infants since it was first described in 1976, the Center for Infectious  Diseases of the Centers for Disease Control recently conducted a study of all  known cases that had occurred over a two-year period in every state but  California between April 1985 and March 1987. The objective was to identify  factors common to babies who got botulism but absent from a similar group who  did not.  </P> <P> Risk factors were found to change with age. For infants less than 2 months old,  living in a rural area or on a farm was the only consistent factor. For those 2  months and older, however, the condition was more likely to occur among those  who were breast-fed, among those who had a history of decreased frequency of  bowel movements for at least two months, and among those who had been given  corn syrup, which has occasionally been found to contain low levels of botulism  spores. The use of honey also remained a factor, although only 11 babies in the  case studies had consumed it.  </P> <P> These data do not provide a cohesive approach to preventing botulism. The  report's authors concluded that while avoiding honey does make sense, the  relationship with corn syrup requires further clarification. And the higher  prevalence of botulism among breast-fed infants should not be viewed as a  deterrent to breast-feeding. The reason for the association with breast-feeding  remains a matter of conjecture. Moreover, botulism is rare, and the benefits of  breast-feeding far outweigh any possible increase in risk.  </P> <P> Infants who do not have a fever but who show a reduced ability to feed, and in  whom no other infection can be demonstrated, should have a stool specimen  submitted for detection of the toxin, especially if there has been a change  toward less frequent bowel movements.  </P></p>

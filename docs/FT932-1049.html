			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Testimony doctor owned Polly shares ONE OF the doctors providing medical testimony which delayed action against Mr Asil Nadir was a substantial shareholder in Polly Peck International, the company founded by the fugitive businessman. Mr Alan Wootliff, a doctor at Spitalfields Health Centre in London, held nearly 300,000 shares at the time of PPI's administration in 1990. Some were previously held in his wife's name. The shares - which were worthless when he submitted medical reports on Mr Nadir earlier this year - were not disclosed to the courts or in the reports. Copies of two letters written by Dr Wootliff for use in the criminal and civil proceedings against Mr Nadir, and one confirming his opinion written by another doctor earlier this year, suggest that Mr Nadir was in very poor mental and physical health. These letters provided some of the information which delayed investigations by the Serious Fraud Office, by administrators to PPI and by Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy. Asked whether there was any conflict between his medical views and his financial interest, Dr Wootliff said: 'I would not let one cloud the other. My conscience is clear. There was nothing illegal, immoral or unethical in what I did.' He defended his views on Mr Nadir and said: 'I was asked for my opinion at the time. He was not capable of co-operation. The stress and strain must have had some result. Perhaps if I examined him today it would be different.' He said he had bought shares throughout PPI's history and had known Mr Nadir since the 1960s. Mr Paul Gordon-Saker, a partner with Alsop Wilkinson working on behalf of the PPI administrators, said: '(The letters) prevented us from obtaining information since last September. Clearly (Mr Nadir) doesn't look very ill now.' In a letter dated April 14 1993, Dr Wootliff says Mr Nadir has agitated depression, disturbed thought processes, limited concentration, little sleep and 'unrealistic thought disturbances'. He concludes: 'This is reactive upon presumed unreasonable and demeaning strains that have been put upon him. The position is most precarious and the outcome is liable to be tragic without speedy resolution.' In a letter on January 19 this year, Dr Wootliff concludes: 'We have a rather fragile state which will not withstand stress for the time being'. A third letter from Dr Lawrence Goldie of Harley Street, London, on March 3 this year describes 'an obvious and considerable deterioration in Mr Nadir's physical condition' between consultations in September 1992 and February 1993. 'The despair which he manifests (anomie) can, in my experience, lead to death,' he writes. 'This psychological deterioration . . . has commenced and a life-threatening vascular catastrophe was imminent. He was incapable of attending to any practical matters concerning his legal affairs or his general living needs.' Dr Goldie says he began 'psycho-analytic psychotherapy' three or four times a week. He concludes: 'One cannot estimate exactly his full potential and when the maximum benefit from psychotherapy will have been attained, but considering his past history and present developments the duration should be thought of as being at least 12 months and most probably two to three years.'</p>

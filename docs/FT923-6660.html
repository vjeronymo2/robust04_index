			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets (At A Glance): Funds boost for life insurers Life insurance sales figures for the second quarter of this year remained healthy, although they bore testament to the UK's continuing recession, according to industry-wide figures from the Association of British Insurers. Life insurers still seem to be attracting fresh funds more successfully than the building societies. Single premium pension sales, boosted by people investing their redundancy cheques, continued to register strong growth, rising 27 per cent to Pounds 1,450m. Meanwhile regular premium contracts, which tend to require investors to have confidence in their long-term employment prospects, did poorly, falling 10 per cent to Pounds 304m.</p>

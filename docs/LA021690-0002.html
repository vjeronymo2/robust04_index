			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 HAWTHORNE MINISTERS OPPOSE LEGAL GAMBLING  </P> <P> A proposal by former Hawthorne Mayor Guy Hocker to legalize gambling in the  city generated strong opposition this week when two Hawthorne ministers urged  the City Council to reject the idea.  </P> <P> Pastor Bruce Chamberlain of Hope Chapel and the Rev. Earl Thornton of Del Aire  Assembly of God Church told the council that they oppose gambling because it  can lead to other problems, such as higher crime rates, lower property values,  and increases in gangs.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Chamberlain said the Ministerial Assn. of Hawthorne and Lawndale  voted unanimously to oppose Hocker's plan.  </P> <P> After the two ministers spoke Hocker urged the council to place a measure on  the ballot and allow voters to decide whether they want to legalize gambling.  </P> <P> The council took no action on Hocker's proposal.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: UK life group floats property portfolio Transatlantic Holdings, the UK life assurance and property group, is to float off its retail property portfolio as Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), which will become one of the seven largest listed property companies on the London stock exchange. The company will own the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, the largest in southern England, which will account for about half of CSC's estimated gross assets of Pounds 800m (Dollars 1.2bn). At least 25 per cent of CSC will be sold through a placement and public offer, raising about Pounds 150m. Transatlantic, 54 per cent owned by Liberty Life, the South African insurance group, and 19 per cent owned by UAP, France's largest insurer, will retain about 75 per cent of CSC's shares (issued at net asset value), its Pounds 600m property portfolio, half of Sun Life and a 3 per cent stake in Sun Alliance. The demerger will provide a funding source for a capital intensive part of Transatlantic's operations, and it could present a more attractive valuation for its retail properties. The parent company (Transatlantic) is to raise an additional Pounds 200m from a convertible bond issue. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said this was to pay off floating rate debt and the Pounds 162m recently paid to increase its interest in the Harlequin shopping centre, rather than to increase its stake in Sun Alliance. Brokers expected interest in the issue. 'I think the market will like the idea of having a large specialist retail property company,' said Mr Chris Turner, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. According to the brokerage, the property sector is trading at a 19 per cent premium to its asset value, and it is expected that CSC will be priced above asset value. CSC will comprise interests in seven shopping centres. Three of these properties have been built since 1990, and Mr Gordon argues that shopping centres take between five and seven years to reach maturity.</p>

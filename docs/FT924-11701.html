			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank settles Alkar dispute WALKER GREENBANK, the wallcoverings group, has reached an out-of-court settlement of its claims against Arthur Young, the group's former auditors, and Mr William Carr and his son, Alan. The litigation arose from the group's Pounds 3.5m acquisition of Alkar, a shop fitting company, from the Carrs in 1987. The total value of the settlement of the group's claims for damages and costs is worth about Pounds 4.6m, including Pounds 3.7m in cash which will be used to strengthen the balance sheet. Walker Greenbank had originally sought Pounds 15m in damages and interest. In arriving at the settlement the parties recognised that the costs, length and complexity of the litigation made a commercial solution desirable. Since the end of July Walker Greenbank has incurred legal and professional charges of about Pounds 500,000 Its interim results included a Pounds 484,000 extraordinary charge mainly to cover these costs. As part of the cash element 1.16m Walker Greenbank shares, issued to the Carrs in 1988, which had been frozen since the litigation started, were sold raising about Pounds 660,000 which was remitted to the group, together with frozen dividends totalling about Pounds 200,000. In addition the Carrs are writing off Pounds 900,000 in loans made to Walker Greenbank. The balance of the settlement will be met by Arthur Young, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, the group's auditors at the time of the acquisition who resigned in January 1989 after accounting irregularities and stock problems in Alkar came to light. Mr Charles Wightman, Walker Greenbank's chief executive, said the settlement represented a satisfactory conclusion. He added the cash would be used to reduce borrowings to below Pounds 2m for gearing of less than 10 per cent. 'Senior management will now be able to concentrate all their efforts on the further successful development of our core businesses,' he added.</p>

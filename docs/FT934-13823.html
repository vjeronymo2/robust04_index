			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / 'Wise men' warn over tax rises ANY tightening in fiscal policy in next month's Budget should be accompanied by a cut in interest rates to avoid jeopardising the fragile recovery, the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers - the so-called 'wise men' - said yesterday. The group said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should set out a long-term package of measures to bring down public borrowing as a way to boost confidence in financial markets, while spreading any tax rises over a wide spectrum of the economy to minimise the effects on demand. In a cautious assessment of economic prospects, the economists said the slow upturn would continue but might 'falter' in the second half of this year, partly because of weakening consumer spending as tax rises loom. The panel expects the gross domestic product to grow 1.7 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent next year. Recovery might be held back by 'below potential' growth for some time in export markets in continental Europe. The economists are concerned about the threat to the recovery of the Pounds 6.8bn of tax rises already due to take effect in April. Even so, they believe Mr Clarke should take action to cut the growing gap between public spending and revenues - likely to reach Pounds 50bn this financial year - because of the danger of a rapid increase in borrowing over the next few years. The panel said: 'A prudent solution would be to introduce a package of tax and spending reforms, desirable in themselves, which would reduce the public sector borrowing requirement over a number of years.' For the next financial year, the group suggested a 'modest fiscal tightening' because anything more might damage the recovery. For 1995-96 and beyond the Treasury should pencil in a net fiscal tightening, taking into account both tax rises and cuts in public spending, amounting to about 1 per cent of gross domestic product, or roughly Pounds 6bn. The panel said one of the threats to the recovery was that personal disposable incomes were likely to grow 'slowly if at all' in inflation-adjusted terms. Also there were 'worrying signs' that the housing market had failed to pick up convincingly. The consensus among the panellists was that the government's 4 per cent ceiling for underlying inflation was unlikely to breached by the end of next year.</p>

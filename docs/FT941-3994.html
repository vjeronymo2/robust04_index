			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Hopes for global green fund at meeting today Delegates from 80 countries are meeting in Geneva today in an effort to reach agreement on setting up a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) Global Environment Facility to help developing countries deal with climate change, water pollution, threats to biodiversity and ozone depletion. A pilot GEF has been operating since 1991 under the wing of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, but the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro agreed to reorganise the facility and give it new resources. Member countries failed, however, to reach agreement on the rules and structures of the new GEF at a meeting in Colombia, in December, as delegates from many developing nations began to question whether the richer industrialised countries were cooling on their promise to provide Dollars 2bn for the fund. Mr Mohamed el-Ashry, GEF chairman, is optimistic that agreement can be reached in Geneva, but he warns that time is running out for the negotiations. 'While all the indications point towards agreement, I also feel this could be the last opportunity for governments to put together a GEF,' he said last week. Other participants agree both with his optimism and with his warning that the window of opportunity could close. Developed countries have reaffirmed their commitment to a target of Dollars 2bn for the facility, divided among them roughly in line with a formula based on their shares in the International Development Association, the soft loan window of the World Bank. The US, the largest contributor, is offering Dollars 430m, about Dollars 20m less than the IDA formula would require, and France and perhaps Italy have threatened to reduce their contributions in line with the US. Australia and Spain will also give slightly less than the formula. US officials are unapologetic, however, about what they see as a substantial contribution in a very difficult budget environment. 'It's a little unfair for others to use us as an excuse,' a US Treasury official said. Japan, the second largest contributor, is expected to come up with its full share of just over Dollars 400m, likewise the UK with its share of over Dollars 130m. With contributions from half a dozen developing countries, the total would probably come to about Dollars 1.9bn, which GEF officials hope would be enough to avert a collapse in negotiations, and which could be topped up later with money from countries not involved in the talks. With the issue of money out of the way, delegates in Geneva must resolve their remaining differences on the new GEF's procedures. These differences have for the most part been over whether the GEF should be run more along the lines of the UN and its spin-offs - an approach favoured by the developing countries - or like the World Bank and the other Bretton Woods institutions, as the developed countries prefer. Perhaps most contentious is whether the council should be chaired, like the World Bank, by the chief executive, or by one of the country representatives, like the UN. Mr el-Ashry believes that the GEF countries have moved much closer to an agreement since the Colombian meeting: 'We have gone a long way towards putting together something that can stand the test of efficiency and effectiveness, while at the same time having political acceptability.'</p>

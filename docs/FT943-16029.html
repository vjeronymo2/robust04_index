			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sims Food swings back into black Sims Food Group saw its shares leap 13p to 84p yesterday after the Milton Keynes-based integrated meat group reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 103,000 for the year to March 31. This compared with a Pounds 586,000 loss last time, which was after exceptional charges of Pounds 6.6m, of which Pounds 3.1m related to asset write-downs and Pounds 3.5m to restructuring provisions, largely in the retail division. In line with its strategy to reduce its involvement in the commodity wholesale side of the industry, turnover fell by 2 per cent to Pounds 306.4m. After adjusting for the timing of acquisitions, which contributed Pounds 18.4m, and disposals, which accounted for Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 39.4m), the underlying fall was 6 per cent. The recommended final dividend of 5.5p makes an unchanged total of 7.5p, which is uncovered and payable from reserves. There were nil earnings per share, against 5p losses.</p>

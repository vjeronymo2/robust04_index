			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--Anis Hasan Yahya, speaker of  the provisional parliament recently established in Aden, today  commended the efforts that Egypt, under President Husni  Mubarak's leadership, is making to resolve the Yemeni crisis.  He said that during his meeting with Egyptian officials he felt  that they were anxious for a cease-fire in Yemen to safeguard  the country's future.    He remarked that the war has created new, undeniable facts  influencing Yemeni unity and tragic conditions that do not serve  the country's interests.    The south Yemeni official added: Nevertheless, we are still  taking the Yemeni people's united interests into account. We  are advocating a different form of unity and will leave its  discussion to the negotiators.    Yahya continued: At any rate, we are seeking to prevent  further destruction in Yemen.    He affirmed that the problems that will surface after the  war  ends will be bigger than the war itself. Noting the adverse  effects that the war has had on the south Yemenis' normally calm  disposition, he said it is necessary to restore that disposition.</p>

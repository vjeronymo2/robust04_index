			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 4 (AFP) -- Senior NATO official  Gebhardt von Moltke said here Thursday [3 March] the Western  European Union (WEU), the only exclusively European defence  organisation, could eventually be brought under the control of  the European Union.    Moltke told a seminar of French senators that the WEU's  executive council could disappear, as the Maastricht Treaty in  effect conferred the power of political decision-making in  defence matters on the foreign ministers of the 12 member states.    The WEU, considered the European pillar of the North  Atlantic  Treaty Organisation, consists of 10 members. The only two EU  states that are not part of the WEU are Ireland and Denmark.</p>

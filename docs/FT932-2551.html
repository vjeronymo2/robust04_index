			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / BP backs proposed oil tax reforms BRITISH Petroleum has written to MPs welcoming the government's proposed changes to North Sea oil taxes. Mr Chris Gibson-Smith, BP's head of European exploration, said in his letter: 'It is in the national interest that these reforms are implemented without delay.' In an amendment to the Finance Bill, the government is proposing to cut the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and to abolish tax relief on exploration work. On Wednesday, it also suggested an amendment to extend transitional aid to smaller companies to cushion them from the immediate effects of the tax changes. BP said the reforms were publicly supported by companies representing 60 per cent of UK oil production. Smaller companies have led an outcry over the proposed tax changes, claiming they would halve exploration work and cost up to 30,000 jobs.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h)(3)(ii) requires that when bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees, precautions must be taken to prevent the root wad, tree butt, or logs from striking an employee. These precautions include, but are not limited to, chocking or moving the tree to a stable position before bucking or limbing. The proposed rule also contained a requirement for bucking or limbing wind-thrown trees. However, the proposed rule did not specify what precautions should be taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters said that the proposed provision was too general to be useful (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters said that this was one of a series of proposed work practice requirements which should be deleted from the final rule and included in topics that must be covered in training sessions. OSHA believes that this work practice requirement is necessary to address the significant risk of injury during these activities. According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of reported injuries occurred during bucking and limbing. OSHA does agree with the commenters that these work practice requirements should also be addressed in training sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Chipping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (h)(4) of the final rule, OSHA has specified various work practices regarding chipping that is performed at in-woods locations. Paragraph (h)(4)(i) of the final rule requires that access covers or doors not be opened until the drum and disc is at a complete stop. The access covers and doors are the means by which employees are safeguarded from the risk of contacting these parts while they are moving. This provision is adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contains a similar provision. OSHA did not receive any comment opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that this requirement is necessary to keep employees away from the dangerous moving drums, discs, knives and blower blades of a chipper. OSHA's FCI reported indicated that two employees have been killed while operating a chipper or trying to free jammed logs (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The moving chipper mechanism presents significant hazards, and employees need protection from contact with those mechanisms when they are moving.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of the final rule requires that infeed and discharge ports be guarded to prevent contact with the disc, knives, or blower blades. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of the final rule requires that the chipper be shut down and locked out in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.147 when an employee performs any servicing of maintenance on the chipper. The proposed rule required that the chipper be shut down and locked out before an employee works in the infeed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA did not receive any comments opposing lockout of the chipper while working on the infeed. OSHA received one comment stating that lockout should be expanded to apply when an employee is working on the drive mechanism or chipping disc (Ex. 5&hyph;28). The lockout/tagout standard, 29 CFR 1910.147, applies to servicing and maintenance of all machines and equipment in which the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> unexpected <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  energization or start up of the machine or equipment, or release of stored energy could cause injury to employees. This includes machines and equipment used in logging operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lockout-tagout standard permits employers to either place a lock or tag on any machine before beginning servicing. However, OSHA believes that the environmental conditions involved in logging operations necessitates the use of locks rather than tags when servicing chippers. As OSHA stated in the preamble of the lockout/tagout standard, it is intended to interact with any new or revised standard to address the use of specific control measures on an individual basis (54 FR 36644, 36665, Sept. 1, 1989). Selection of the specific method of control, at that time, will reflect a thorough evaluation of the extent of exposure to the hazard, the risk of injury involving the particular machine or industry, and the feasibility of applying a particular method of control. OSHA also pointed in the preamble of the lockout/tagout standard that damage to or loss of tagout devices is a serious drawback to the use of tagout. Logging operations are carried out in all kinds of weather, including rain, snow, ice and wind, and there is a significant possibility that tags could be damaged or lost. In such circumstances, OSHA believes only locking machinery will provide adequate protection for employees who are servicing it. Therefore, OSHA is requiring chippers to be shut down and lockout out before an employee performs any servicing or maintenance activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of the final rule requires that detached chippers be chocked during usage on any slope when movement of the chipper is reasonably foreseeable. As with other mobile equipment that is intended to be operated from a stationary position, the unexpected movement of the equipment can endanger employees who are either operating the equipment or in the path of the equipment when it moves. The vibration caused by the operation of the equipment can enhance the potential for unintended equipment movement. Chocking of mobile equipment to prevent movement is recognized throughout industry as a necessary and appropriate means to prevent unintended movement. For example, OSHA requires in 29 CFR 1910.178(k)(1) that trailers be chocked before being boarded by powered industrial trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

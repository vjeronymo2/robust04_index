			<p>BFN     [Text] The public committee created in Blagoveshchensk  (administrative center in the Amur Region) will study the  ecological problems associated with the building of a new space  center in the town of Svobodnyy. The committee includes  scientists, doctors, public figures representing different  parties and state structures.    Members of the committee believe that during the  construction  period the public should be given all information about the  possible influence of the Center on the unique wildlife of the  Amur-Zeya Valley and the influence of rocket launching on the  environment. The demand was greeted with understanding by the  regional administration. In Blagoveshchensk and Svobodnyy the  first information meetings were held between the public and  workers of the federal space agency.</p>

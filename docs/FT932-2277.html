			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Basic skills don't add up: The high rate of adult illiteracy is placing a heavy burden on industry It might not seem difficult to calculate 10 per cent of Pounds 4,900, but a survey published this week found that 23 per cent of the UK's 21-year-olds could not work out the answer - even with calculators. The survey, conducted by the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, an independent government-funded agency, poses rather more difficult questions for educators and industrialists. It indicated that one in five young adults needs urgent help with numeracy, while one in seven has serious problems with literacy. Many more had a barely adequate command of reading, writing and arithmetic. For example, 35 per cent of the 21-year-olds had mathematical skills inferior to those expected by the national curriculum of a 12-year-old. Such difficulties with basic skills cause problems for those who suffer them. But they also inflict great damage on the economy. A separate survey of 400 companies by the Albsu, carried out at the end of last year, produced an estimate that the total cost of poor basic skills to industry in the UK was Pounds 4.83bn a year. This estimate includes Pounds 2.5bn as the cost of rectifying customer orders dispatched incorrectly, and Pounds 1.8bn for the cost of lost custom and orders. Industrialists believe such costs are growing, and will continue to grow, as the changing workplace requires greater skills. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Heath Springs, a small West Midlands spring manufacturer, said: 'In the last five years there has been a dramatic change in the skills needed on my shop floor. The artisans who work here don't just have to measure the components they produce, as in the past. Now, the whole factory is run using statistical controls. If you don't have workers with the basic skills required, those controls will fail.' Many workers were uneasy about their ability to use computers when the company introduced them. And Mr Roberts has had problems bringing in the Japanese technique of 'visual management', which uses written signs on the shop-floor to direct workers. Such techniques are doomed to failure if the workers cannot read. Mr Roberts does not believe his workforce has grown less literate; what has changed is that he now needs a higher standard of literacy among his employees. While illiteracy was once a problem that could be ignored, industry is now forced to confront it. As Mr Roberts said: 'If companies aren't bothered whether their employees are literate or numerate, they won't be internationally competitive and they may as well close down now.' Precise international comparisons are difficult, but research suggests the UK's problems are not unique. In Australia, 28 per cent of those tested failed an exam in 'practical' literacy, which involved such tasks as filling in forms. The National Assessment of Educational Progress in the US found in 1989 that 42 per cent of the population had difficulties with day-to-day tasks, such as working out percentages on a restaurant bill. In Canada, 38 per cent of the adult population had 'some difficulty dealing with the reading demands they encounter in their everyday lives', according to an extensive survey carried out by Statistics Canada in 1990. Estimates by the UN agency Unesco for European countries put the proportion of the population having some difficulty with basic skills at 15-25 per cent in Belgium, 15-20 per cent in France, 15-25 per cent in Italy and 15-30 per cent in Spain and Portugal. It is far from clear how to attack the problem. During the 1970s, adult literacy programmes were emphasised - perhaps most memorably in the BBC television series On The Move in which the actor Bob Hoskins played an adult illiterate nervously encouraging himself to go to evening reading classes. But teaching adults is difficult, complicated and expensive, according to Ms Ann Barnes, general secretary of the National Association for the Teaching of English. 'They develop inhibitions and defence mechanisms', she said. 'Resources, skills and expertise should be put in at a very young stage.' That shift in emphasis to improving basic skills among younger people has now been adopted by the Department for Education. Last year, the department announced grants of Pounds 4.4m for pilot projects in 'reading recovery'. These were modelled on projects pioneered in New Zealand, in which six-year-olds who had slipped behind in reading were given intensive one-on-one tuition. Parents provide another line of attack. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week announced a small grant of Pounds 250,000 for pilot schemes in family literacy, modelled on programmes developed in the US, where parents are given help with reading and encouraged to help teach their children. Neither approach is uncontroversial, however. Ann Barnes of the National Association for the Teaching of English is dubious about reading recovery programmes, which she believes to be unnecessarily expensive. Resources might have been better used by experimenting in the use of computers in the classroom to help children read and write, she says. Nor is it always possible to rely on parents: the Albsu research shows that children who have difficulty with reading and writing often have parents with the same difficulties. And some teachers are unhappy about encouraging parents to help their children as it can make life difficult in the classroom when some pupils have been taught to read while others have not. Yet finding ways to raise the level of literacy and numeracy skills is essential given their increasing importance at work. Not only employers lose out when their employees are not fluent in reading and writing or with numbers. Mr Patten likes to point out that adults of today who lack confidence with language may be at a greater disadvantage than they would have been in the Victorian era.</p>

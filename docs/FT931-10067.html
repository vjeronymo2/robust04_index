			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (1): Swings in currency the deciding factor - Peter Martin, Financial Editor, looks at the winners and losers in this year's FT500 RARELY are sweeping statements so speedily disproved as in the case of last year's introduction to the FT500. Hailing the 1992 ranking as a 'historic' one, the article explained that most of Europe's currencies were now firmly tied, formally or informally, to the ERM structure. As a result, it proclaimed, 'the factors which decide whether companies move up and down the rankings largely exclude the currency factor which has been such an overwhelming influence in the past'. That 'historic' change lasted less than a year. There was a sweeping pattern of devaluations during 1992 - involving Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Finland, Sweden and Norway. That restored the traditional threefold pattern of influences on the rankings: the underlying performance of the companies; the movement of individual national bourses; and the changes in the values of the currencies in which a company's shares are quoted. The result can clearly be seen in this year's rankings. Companies from countries which had devalued by the time the ranking was drawn up - at September 30, 1992 - slide down the list. For example, 28 of the 30 companies which suffered the largest drops in rank came from Britain, Sweden or Italy. Similarly, 28 of the 30 companies which achieved the largest rises in rank came from hard-currency countries, such as France and Germany. Currency moves apart, investors' valuations of companies and industries changed during the year. The FT500 ranks companies by stock market value (that is, shares outstanding times share price). It therefore avoids the differences between national accounting standards that bedevil rankings based on profitability and avoids the inconsistencies between industries that undermine rankings by revenues. Instead, it reflects the changing judgments of international and domestic investors on the likely performance of companies and industries. Their view of the companies at the top of the table remains relatively stable: seven of the top 10 had also been there in each of the preceding two years. There were a few significant moves among the top group, nevertheless. Glaxo Holdings, which was ranked 10th in 1990 and leapt to third in 1991 edged up again in 1992, to second. It is unlikely to be able to make much more upward progress, in the near term at least, since its market capitalisation of Dollars 38bn is almost exactly half that of the undisputed leader, Royal Dutch/Shell. Another pharmaceuticals company was the biggest gainer at the top of the table. Roche Holding leapt from 18th to 6th, leapfrogging SmithKline Beecham (in 11th place this year). All three big Swiss pharmaceuticals groups did well - Sandoz moved up nine places to 20th and Ciba-Geigy rose two to 24th - but Roche was the clear winner. It was helped up the table by a doubling of profits in dollar terms and a string of optimistic trading forecasts. It also benefited from the growing interest of foreign investors, reacting to the company's decision to simplify its share structure and conform to internationally accepted accounting standards. Another new arrival in the top 10 was BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group. In rising six places to ninth, BAT managed to shrug off the effect of the UK's devaluation, a task made the easier because so much of its profits come from abroad. As a group, Europe's 10 biggest companies by market capitalisation now consist of three British concerns, three German ones, two Swiss and one dual-nationality Netherlands-UK company. As usual, French and Italian companies are under-represented in the FT500 because so many big businesses in these countries are still in the hands of the state. The highest French company, Alcatel-Alsthom, is 17th; the highest Italian one, the insurer Generali, is 23rd. Italy's ambitious plans for privatisation will increase the Italian presence, and may push up the rankings some state-controlled companies already listed, once their managers obtain greater freedom to run them in shareholders' interests. The biggest gainer in the table was yet another pharmaceutical company, France's Institut Merieux, which rose 216 places to 253th place. Other big gainers were Germany's Badenwerk, which rose 196 places to 275th; and Britain's De la Rue, up 174 places to 217th. Badenwerk, the electricity utility based in Karlsruhe, has been discussing a merger with EVS, another power generator. De La Rue, which specialises in banknote printing and payments handling systems, is one of the London market's big recovery stories of recent years. It benefited from sharply rising profits and the acquisition of a competitor. For one other big gainer, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, the honour must be a mixed blessing. It leapt 164 places to 199th, thanks to a takeover bid during the summer from ING, the Dutch group that straddles banking and insurance. But after the cut-off date for the FT500, the bid fell apart in a dispute over the price to be paid, and the bank's chief executive resigned. Had the ING takeover gone ahead, it would have joined two other big mergers among banking sector constituents of the FT500. The UK's Midland Bank was bought by HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the merged company was ranked 19th, compared with Midland's 140th place the year before. In Spain, Banco Central merged with Banco Hispanoamericano to form Banco Central Hispanoamericano, ranked 92nd, the fifth-highest ranking among Spanish companies. One striking feature of the list of new entries was the large French contingent, many of them famous names. Christian Dior, floated in December 1991, entered in 257th place, joining LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Richemont and L'Oreal among the small group of 'luxury' companies in the FT500. Other well-known French additions to the list included Remy Cointreau, Moulinex and Fromageries Bel. Among those companies that fell sharply there was one common theme: the European property slump. This took a string of British property companies - including Slough Estates, British Land and Taylor Woodrow - out of the FT500, and it also played a part in the decline of such proud Swedish banking names as Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Handelsbanken. A year ago, these ranked 193rd and 183rd respectively. This time around, loan losses had pushed S-E Banken out of the ranking altogether, and Handelsbanken - traditionally regarded as one of Europe's best-managed banks  -narrrowly escaped the same fate, falling to 467th. The two companies run by Italy's Carlo De Benedetti also did badly. Both Olivetti and Compagnie Industriali Riuniti left the FT500. In the 1990 ranking, Olivetti was 178th, valued at Dollars 2.8bn and CIR was not far behind at 207th, valued at Dollars 2.4bn. This year, neither was valued highly enough by investors to get into the FT500. Olivetti's market capitalisation had slid to Dollars 673m and CIR's to Dollars 376m. Another prominent entrepreneur, the UK's Tiny Rowland, was also one of the year's big losers. Lonrho, the conglomerate of which he is chief executive, dropped from 177th to 478th this year; its market capitalisation fell from Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 753m. This year's list throws up the usual collection of surprising comparisons. Abbey National, the UK retail bank that was until recently a humble building society, is ranked 66th, two places higher than CS Holding, the much more glamorous holding company for Credit Suisse. Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel, is ranked 102nd, ahead of such stalwarts of global manufacturing as LM Ericsson (103rd), Michelin (107th) and Akzo (124th). Thanks to its rapid rise, Institut Merieux, with only Dollars 1.1bn of turnover, is ranked only two places below Lufthansa (251st), which has a turnover nearly 10 times higher, at Dollars 10.8bn. Saddest of all, perhaps, is British Aerospace, ranked 464th, surpassed in market capitalisation by Spring Ram, the UK kitchen furniture supplier and by Elf Gabon, the Gabon subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine.  -----------------------------------------       500 CAPITALISATION BY COUNTRY  -----------------------------------------                                 Dollars m United Kingdom                  711,564.3 Germany                         263,539.8 France                          259,067.1 Switzerland                     147,188.9 Netherlands/UK                  107,639.3 Spain                            62,774.7 Sweden                           53,562.1 Netherlands                      53,118.1 Belgium                          51,225.1 Italy                            50,578.2 Denmark                          18,843.8 Norway                           12,268.2 Sweden/Switzerland                9,967.3 Austria                           8,727.7 Ireland                           6,697.0 Luxembourg                        5,194.6 Belgium/Netherlands               4,206.4 United Kingdom/France             3,775.1 Portugal                          2,089.4 Finland                           2,081.4  -----------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------           EXCHANGE RATES AGAINST USDOLLARS  -------------------------------------------------      (monthly averages Oct 1992 &amp; Sept 1991)  ------------------------------------------------- Currency                  1992    1991   % change  ------------------------------------------------- Austrian schilling      10.454  11.924     12.33 Belgian franc             30.6   34.91     12.35 Danish kroner           5.7323  6.5465     12.44 Finnish markka          4.7137  4.1285    -14.17 French franc            5.0408  5.7668     12.59 German mark              1.486  1.6944     12.30 Irish punt             0.56527  0.6338     10.81 Italian lira           1310.73 1267.28     -3.43 Luxembourg franc         30.6    34.91     12.35 Netherlands guilder    1.6727   1.9095     12.40 Norwegian kroner       6.0597   6.6301      8.60 Portuguese escudo      132.21   145.08      8.87 Spanish peseta         105.85   106.32      0.44 Swedish kronor         5.6028   6.1685      9.17 Swiss franc            1.3192   1.4809     10.92 UK sterling            0.6051   0.5795     -4.42  -------------------------------------------------</p>

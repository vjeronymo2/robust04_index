			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 20/5/1994 -- A group of  terrorists from Vilnius came to Dniester, at the invitation of  Vadim Shevtsov (Antiufeev), chairman of the Dniester Security  Committee, stated Col. Mikhail Bergman of the 14th Army to Asket  TV in Tiraspol and retranslated by the "Teleradio-Moldova" state  company. According to Bergman, "through Dniestrian security's  help and support, criminals who conceal their real name are  coming into the region." Thus, a certain Gudyma who came  recently from Moscow at the security minister's invitation had a  passport indicating two years' Dniester citizenship. Bergman  also pointed out that Tiraspol officials illegally issued 900  permits for weapons to ministers and company managers. Among  those who receive the permits were Galina Andreyeva, an OSTK  [expression unknown] leader, Anatoli Bolshakov, Vladimir  Vorobiov, managers of large industrial enterprises, Aleksey  Tokarev, manager of an Austrian joint firm and currently an  Austrian citizen, etc. Col. Bergman mentioned that over 24  carbines were stolen from 14th Army weapon storage during the  Dniester conflict. Ten of these carbines were bought by the  prosecutor general, Boris Luchik, Tiraspol leader Igor Smirnov,  Vadim Shevtsov (Antiufeev) and Belusov, respectively chairman  and deputy chairman of the Security Committee, Aleksandr  Karaman, Dniester vice president and other Tiraspol officials.  The guns were simply given to them as gifts for which they  would later receive special permits, added Bergman. According to  him, Aleksandr Karaman possesses six guns. Bergman said that  Smirnov opened in Austria an account for $5 million and during a  recent visit in this country he withdrew $1.5 million. He also  said that Smirnov is building a villa on the "Uzbekistan"  sanatorium's property in Yalta, Crimea, using construction  materials from Dniester.</p>

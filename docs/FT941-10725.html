			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Dalgety Dalgety is insulated from UK supermarket price wars by its involvement in the farm sector and in food distribution in the US. Even so, its consumer food business suffered during the the first half, and not just because of a shortfall in sales of Pot Noodles. Market share in crisps has been bought only at the expense of margin, and there has clearly been some anxious squawking in the Homepride hen house following Unilever's aggressive launch of Chicken Tonight. Even if the new range of Pot Noodles proves successful, such pressure seems bound to continue. That leaves Dalgety stuck with a reputation of limited scope for growth, which is reflected in its yield of over 5 per cent. Nor does it help that acquisitions will leave gearing close to 40 per cent at the end of the year. Dalgety's latest purchases have pushed it more towards specialisation in the farm business and in the European pet food market. The latter, in particular, may hold out growth prospects if continental owners can be persuaded to stop feeding their animals scraps and dish up some real pet food instead. There may also be attractive opportunities in the ingredients sector which would help shift the emphasis away from consumer foods. Dalgety has a history of abstinence where rights issues are concerned, but it might consider financing some future acquisitions by sales from its consumer foods portfolio, even if that does involve throwing a few succulent noodles into the pot.</p>

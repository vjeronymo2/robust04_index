			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEEJAY, 84, IS STILL SPINNING PLATTERS;  </P> <P> AT HIS AGE, HE'S SOME KIND OF RECORD HOLDER IN THE BUSINESS  </P> <P> When Frank Meyers dusts off an oldie from his record collection and slaps it on  his turntable, it's a real oldie. Frank Meyers is 84 years old. That's young  for a piece of classical music, perhaps, but pretty old for a disc jockey still  trying to make toes tap and joints jump.  </P> <P> Dick Clark, for instance, was a schoolboy when Meyers started spinning  platters. Glenn Miller was still a struggling band leader. Wolfman Jack's voice  had yet to change. And the long-playing record hadn't been invented.  </P> <P> Meyers is a performer who knows his audience. When he spins records tonight at  a Valentine's dance at the Hotel Knickerbocker in Hollywood, hundreds of  retirees are expected to attend.  </P> <P> Meyers said his 1,000-record collection is filled with romantic songs and Big  Band ballads that can set the oldest of hearts beating and toes tapping. And if  that doesn't work, he'll even toss in "a little rock 'n' roll" -- tunes from  the '50s.  </P> <P> "None of this hard-rock stuff," Meyers said. "I play real music. Things that  really swing."  </P> <P> The energetic Meyers has been doing that kind of swinging since he purchased  his first portable sound system in 1941, signed up for a night school  announcing class and began playing at parties, weddings and dances.  </P> <P> He had worked in Canada as a carnival shooting gallery operator, welder and  accountant before deciding that music was his life.  </P> <P> "I was playing records for $7 a night. Pretty soon, I got so many jobs that I  had to hire four other boys to help me out," Meyers recalls.  </P> <P> As his fame as a Toronto disc jockey grew in the 1940s, Meyers rented a small  ballroom and staged his own dances for adults. In the 1950s, he launched a  nightclub for teen-agers. By 1960, he was running a discotheque called  Frankie's Surf Club, large enough for 600 dancers at a time.  </P> <P> Meyers sold out and moved to California in 1965, working for an aircraft parts  company and as an apartment manager while continuing part-time jockeying of  discs.  </P> <P> "Playing at bowling banquets was a big thing then," he recalled. "I was never  on the radio. I never made a name for myself like Dick Clark. That's my big  regret.  </P> <P> "After night school, I got a radio job offer at a little 2-by-4 station for $80  a month. But at the time I was buying a convertible for $85 a month, so I  couldn't afford it."  </P> <P> Although no piece of officialdom seems to keep track of party disc jockeys,  Meyers figures he is this country's oldest active deejay. Officials of the  National Assn. of Broadcasters said Tuesday they know of no one on the air who  is older -- although legendary New York radio personality Hal Jackson is  celebrating his 50th year in the business this month.  </P> <P> Because of space problems in his one-room, 12-by-16-foot apartment at the Hotel  Knickerbocker, Meyers has converted about half of his albums and 78 r.p.m.  platters to tape cassettes for his shows. His collection includes  Charleston-type music popular in the 1930s, Big Band music of the '40s, ballads  of the '50s and "soft" pop music from the '60s.  </P> <P> There's not a Beatles tune in the bunch. Or disco or heavy metal.  </P> <P> Or rap.  </P> <P> "I never went in for any of that," he said. "That stuff leaves me out in the  cold. I don't speak that language."  </P> <P> That's music to the ears of those who will be in Meyers' Valentine's dance  crowd tonight.  </P> <P> "I'm too old for romance," joked 73-year-old Mildred Feldman, a Glenn Miller  fan who will be there. "But I still love his music."  </P> <P> Lester Lees, 78, said he will be listening for "the old-time" tunes from the  '50s. "That's my kind of music," he said.  </P> <P> Dave Maier, a 1928 Golden Gloves boxing champion, said he will also be there to  listen. "I'm 81. I don't dance anymore," he said with a laugh.  </P> <P> But Meyers figures that his dance contest prizes will lure the crowd to its  feet, even if his music doesn't. Along with cash, he'll give away bags of  groceries.  </P> <P> "That's what older people need," he said.  </P></p>

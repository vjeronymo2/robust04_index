			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Iraq 'promises multi-party poll': Ruling council to be scrapped, Kurdish leader claims A KURDISH leader claimed last night that Iraqi officials had agreed to abolish the ruling Revolutionary Command Council and hold multi-party elections within six months. Jalal Talabani, a member of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front which has been holding talks with Baghdad on Kurdish autonomy, told the BBC from his base in northern Iraq that 'a freely-elected parliament will function instead of all other bodies'. The Iraqi government has been promising in recent weeks to introduce more democratic systems but has not previously outlined specific proposals nor suggested scrapping the Revolutionary Command Council, which is essentially an instrument of the ruling Ba'ath party. There was no confirmation of the report from Baghdad. The ruling party has come close to admitting that it has failed to address ethnic and sectarian problems but an official announcement of plans to democratise the country would still be treated sceptically by many Iraqis, given the history of repression at the hands of the Ba'ath party. Party officials were seized and killed during the unsuccessful Kurdish and Shia rebellion against President Saddam Hussein in March following the Gulf war. Concessions to democracy in Baghdad would be regarded as a big step forward by Kurds in their battle for autonomy. Jalal Talabani also said he had won an amnesty for Kurdish and Shia prisoners captured during the rebellion. He said last week agreement in principle had been reached with Baghdad on implementing a 1970 autonomy accord between the government and the Kurds, who form a fifth of Iraq's 18m population. Distrustful of Mr Saddam, the Kurds want international guarantees for any final agreement.</p>

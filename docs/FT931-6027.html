			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wm Sinclair down 18% WILLIAM SINCLAIR Holdings, the Lincoln-based supplier to the garden leisure and pet markets, attributed an 18 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.39m to seasonal changes in its sales profile. Earnings fell to 4.4p (5.8p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p. Turnover of Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 16.3m) included a Pounds 1.5m contribution from Secto, which was acquired last April. Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, said the fall in profits was due to a shift in sales towards the earlier half of the year, and that turnover and profit levels would improve for the full financial year. The company was is looking for acquisitions to strengthen its pet, aquatic and household division. Mr Sinclair will resign as chief executive in July, remaining as chairman. Mr Peter Barton, currently managing director, will succeed as chief executive. Analysts are forecasting full-year profits of Pounds 5m, slightly up on last year's Pounds 4.61m, assuming fair weather conditions.</p>

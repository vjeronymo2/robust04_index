			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (18): Exit the liquidator / Profile of Birgit Breuel MRS BIRGIT BREUEL is particularly fond of three public comments which she made in her years as head of the Treuhand agency, which has privatised, liquidated or rationalised the former state properties of the German Democratic Republic. Her first was her description of how she started work at the agency in October 1990. 'We had very few experience people. We had no rules. We did not even have a list of companies, let alone balance sheets,' she said. Her second bon mot concerned the Treuhand's philosophy: 'Our aim was not so much to sell the enterprises, but to buy management for the east German enterprises.' But her most famous (or notorious) comment was in reply to journalists' questions about about her past, her future or about sensitive investment contracts. 'No Comment. I do not have to answer that question,' she would say. Recently, however, she has suddenly become more forthcoming. This is not surprising. With the Treuhand due to wind up most of its work by the end of the year, Mrs Breuel is preparing to try her hand at something new, as Commissioner General of the World Fair Expo 2000 to be held next year in Hanover. It will be a relief from the daily grind of the Treuhand where Mrs Breuel, a former finance minister of Lower Saxony, has put in at least 12 hours a day. 'She comes into the office at about 7.15 and leaves between 8pm and 9pm,' a colleague says. 'And when she leaves, she carries a big bag with her - full of work.' Mrs Breuel, who read politics at Oxford University, does not drink, smokes moderately, and lives in a small 75 square meter apartment in Mitte, the heart of east Berlin, with a view of the Brandenburg Gate. 'She goes home to her family at the weekend, but more often than not, her husband and two sons visit her,' her colleague added. Her third son died from cancer in December 1990, three months after she joined the Treuhand board. Her commitment to the Treuhand meant foregoing many official functions. Indeed, when Queen Elizabeth visited Berlin in 1992, Mrs Breuel, who had been invited to one of the receptions, politely declined. 'She stayed in the office because she work to do,' her colleague said. In the early days of the Treuhand's existence, east Germans loathed the agency because it closed so many factories and sharply reduced factory manning levels. Some foreign investors saw the Treuhand as a west German mafia intend on keeping foreign investors out of east Germany. Politicians blamed it for the ills of the east German economy. Mrs Breuel herself admits it was a convenient scapegoat. 'But no politician could have taken our decisions,' she says. The end of her stint at the Treuhand means that Mrs Breuel will perhaps have more time to pursue her hobbies, such as gardening. With a little luck, she might have more time to do this after December 30 of this year, her last working day at the Treuhand.</p>

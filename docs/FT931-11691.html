			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE DECLINE of sterling and the subsequent hopes of a cut in interest rates led to a strong showing in the derivatives sector, on the first day of the new equity account, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, trading in the March contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,843, which some traders took to indicate an uneventful session. However, speculation that the UK government would be forced to cut interest rates led to strong buying by both US and UK houses, driving March strongly forward to trade at a healthy premium for most of the day. Dealers said there was some good arbitrage activity at the higher levels. In the afternoon, a strong Wall Street only served to boost further buying of the March contract and it closed at 2,870, up 48 from the previous finish and at a 17-point premium to the underlying cash market. The recent decline of interest rates now means that fair value has fallen to between nil and -1 for this account. Turnover was a healthy 10,018 contracts. The traded options were also busy and saw turnover of 51,866 contracts by the close, with strong two-way business in Asda making a large contribution to the total. It had 19,579 lots transacted, and was followed among stock options by British Steel with 3,668 contracts and Hanson with 2,437 lots. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,162.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (10): The jargon explained - A glossary of venturespeak, from 'burn rate' to 'vulture capital' EVERY trade has its own jargon and the venture capital industry is no exception. The venture capitalist hopes that his plums will more than outweigh the lemons in his portfolio and help him get over his hurdle, writes Charles Batchelor. The entrepreneur meanwhile must keep a wary eye open for the vultures who may attempt to deprive him of the sweat equity he needs to make the deal worthwhile. Some of the more colourful expressions which crossed the Atlantic along with the techniques themselves in the 1970s have fallen out of use - death valley curves* and grey waves no longer form part of daily venturespeak - but a flavour of venture capital's pioneering days remains. (* Death valley curves means the decline in a start-up company's equity base, as cash flows out and before profits start coming; grey waves refers to a company or sector with such distant prospects that they will not be realised before the investors' hair has turned grey.) Here and on the following pages is a glossary of other terms: Burn rate: this is the rate at which a business uses up the funds provided. Business angel: a private investor who not only finances small companies but who also gives them the benefit of his or her own expertise. Most angels are retired executives or entrepreneurs who have sold their own business. Business Expansion Scheme: a scheme to encourage investors to engage in risk investment by offering them tax relief at their top marginal rate, for up to Pounds 40,000 invested a year. There is now a Pounds 750,000 annual investment limit for each investee company to channel investment to smaller businesses. But recent cuts in tax rates have reduced the attractions of the BES for investors while special encouragement for investments in residential property have diverted funds away from non-property ventures. The Treasury's long-running dislike of the scheme finally carried the day in the March 1992 budget and the BES will come to an end in December 1993. Business plan: the document put together by managers to justify their application to financiers for backing. A business plan should contain summaries of past and projected profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. It should also have details of products and services, markets, future strategy and profiles of the managers - but don't get too carried away: most financiers will not go beyond the two-page executive summary. Captive funds: venture capital organisations which form part of larger financial services groups. Usually they do not raise their own discrete funds but draw on the resources of their parent groups. Carried interest: shares or an option on shares taken by the venture capitalist in the investee company as part of the financing agreement. Usually the stake taken is 20 per cent. See also 'Hurdle rates,' explained on the facing page. Corporate venturing: this is the practice of a large company taking a small equity stake or establishing a joint venture with a smaller business to benefit from the smaller firm's specialist expertise. The large business can provide finance, management back-up and distribution outlets which would not be available to the smaller partner. The small company brings its innovative skills and allows the big company a ringside view of the new products and technologies it is developing. Corporate venturing links can lead to the bigger partner acquiring the smaller. Many US and some Continental companies have practised this technique though it has failed to appeal to large British companies. Deal flow: the number of investment propositions which come to the venture capitalist. Development capital: later stage venture capital invested after two or three years when the business has become established and needs extra funds for expansion. Most venture capitalists are in fact providing development capital. The rewards are lower but the risks are correspondingly less than for early stage investments. Exit: the point at which the venture capitalist realises all or part of his investment by either arranging a flotation of the company or, more commonly, selling it to another company or 'trade buyer.' A growing range of exits is becoming available and the list also includes a refinancing of the company by another g roup of venture capitalists or the purchase of all the shares by the company's own management. Hands on/hands off: some venture capitalists take a very close interest in their investee companies and will provide management expertise to help them get started and in times of difficulty. It is rare to find a venture capitalist who does not claim to be 'hands on,' but many, in moments of honesty, will admit to being 'hands off' or passive investors. Hurdle rates: institutional investors have grown restive at the fees venture capitalists earn and have started to insist that funds achieve a basic return before managers can claim their carried interest. They often set hurdles based on a return on gilts or one of the leading stock market indexes. Independent funds: these do not form part of larger financial groups. They raise their money from institutional and other investors. Internal rate of return (IRR): different people calculate this in different ways but it basically means the compound annual rate of return to the investor. It includes dividend distributions and profits from disposals or the profits shown on a fair valuation of an investee company. Inevitably, venture capitalists differ over when investments should be written down, up or off so the figures are rarely strictly comparable. Most venture capitalists set themselves a target IRR of 30 to 40 per cent on their portfolios though the return to investors may be much lower. Lemons and plums: bad investments invariably go wrong before the good ones produce the profits. The lemons usually ripen before the plums. Living dead: a portfolio company which is just about trading profitably but which shows little sign of ever meeting the venture capitalist's early high expectations. Management buy-in: the purchase of a business by an outside manager or team of managers with the help of a group of financial backers. Management buy-out: the purchase of a business by its existing management with the help of a group of financial backers. Buy-outs are funded largely by loans secured on the assets of the company itself. Most of the equity comes from the venture capitalist or other financial backer. The management puts up a small amount of finance for a disproportionately large percentage of the equity. Management fee: an annual charge normally amounting to 2 1/2 per cent of the sum invested. Some investors have insisted that the larger funds making later stage investments should charge less because their portfolio companies are less time-consuming. Others argue that the fee should decline as a fund matures and fewer new investments are being made. Recovery or turnaround financing: supplied to companies in difficulties where the venture capitalist sees an opportunity to beef up or change the management and return the company to profits. Some venture capitalists have employed insolvency specialists to identify and manage such investments. Refinancing: can be a sign of either failure or success. If a company performs poorly it may need an extra injection of funds. Equally, if it does very well, the management may decide to refinance the business on terms more favourable to themselves with their original venture capital backers or sometimes a new team of financiers. Replacement capital: funds provided to allow an existing shareholder to sell some or all of his shares. Second-round financing: venture capitalists rarely expect the first injection of funds to meet a business's needs. A second or even a third round of funding will almost certainly be needed later as the business grows or unforseen problems arise. At this stage the original venture capital investor may reduce his holding and bring in others to spread the risk. Seed capital: usually quite small amounts of capital provided to turn a good idea into a marketable product or service; the riskiest form of venture capital since the concept, the technology, the entrepreneur and the market are all unproven. For this reason, seed capital has been in very short supply. Some venture capitalists argue seed capital should not really be necessary since most people should be able to raise, say, Pounds 25,000 from savings or bank borrowings secured on their home. Spin-out: a new company set up by a larger established group to exploit new developments or fresh market opportunities and in which the management team and a venture capital backer also take equity stakes. Star: A company which is so successful that it pays for all the failures and humdrum performers in the venture capitalist's portfolio. Sweet equity: the extra percentage of a company's equity which is allocated to the managers over and above the shareholding their own relatively modest financial investment would qualify them for. The extra shares are seen as an additional motivation and reflect the fact that it is the managers' hard work which will ultimately make the venture succeed. Sometimes also referred to as 'sweat equity' to reflect hard work by the managers. Trade sale: the sale of a company to a corporate buyer. This is the most common exit route (qv) for venture capital backed companies. Venture capital: Equity finance provided usually to young, unquoted businesses to enable them to get started or to expand. Equity funds provide a basis for the company to raise further bank finance and provide a cheap source of funds in the early stages of the business because dividends can be delayed until the company starts making profits. Venture capitalists say they bring not only money but also management and industrial expertise to their investee companies, but see Hands On. Vulture capital: the derogatory term applied to an offer of funds or a deal which gives the venture capitalist an unfairly large equity stake in a company.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S RAIL PATROL READY -- AND WAITING;  </P> <P> SECURITY: MINOR FLAREUPS ARE MET BY A SHOW OF FORCE ON THE BLUE LINE. BUT THE  RELATIVE PEACE HAS BEEN A PLEASANT EARLY SURPRISE.  </P> <P> The first sound of trouble Monday came from the mobile radio perched on the  shoulder of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Oxley. A fellow officer  had stopped some gang members at the 103rd Street station and was calling for  backup help -- fearing a potential disturbance.  </P> <P> On board the southbound Blue Line, Oxley was still several stops away as the  train glided along the tracks at 55 m.p.h. But by the time his train had  arrived, the crisis was over. The gang members had dispersed and the emergency  call had been canceled.  </P> <P> The 103rd Street platform, however, was still bustling with a dozen sheriff's  deputies who, like Oxley, had suddenly materialized like some kind of transit  cavalry.  </P> <P> From trains, foot patrols and radio cars, they had responded swiftly to the  emergency call. Now, they were waiting to re-board the trains and resume their  patrols.  </P> <P> Monday's incident was typical of the first three days of Blue Line operations,  a minor flareup met by a major show of force.  </P> <P> "It's been that way all along," said Oxley, who has spent 40 hours over the  last three days moving from station to station as part of the Blue Line  security force.  </P> <P> "The problem with gangs hasn't happened," he said. "The crime problems haven't  happened. It's all been pretty peaceful."  </P> <P> The relative tranquillity has been a relief to transit and sheriff's officials  who have acknowledged that Los Angeles County's successful return to a commuter  rail system will rely heavily on whether people feel safe riding the trains.  </P> <P> The 19-mile line traverses some of the most crime-ridden and gang-plagued  territory in the county, but none of that was in evidence over the first few  days.  </P> <P> "It's like making football plans to attack your opponents and the opponents  never show up," said Lt. Jim Holts of the Sheriff's Transit Services Bureau,  formed especially for the job. "You've got the field to yourself."  </P> <P> After three days and more than 100,000 passengers, Holts said there were only  three arrests -- for trespassing, public drunkenness and disorderly conduct and  battery when a passenger slapped another rider during an argument.  </P> <P> For many passengers, the highly visible presence of deputies was a reassuring  sight -- especially on the weekend when deputies from other stations, mounted  patrolmen and undercover officers beefed up security to about 200 officers --  well above the normal complement of 120 sworn officers assigned to the transit  bureau.  </P> <P> "They're going to have to get the word out to the public that it is safe and  they have to demonstrate that it's safe because a lot of people are concerned  about that," said Mike Hinton, a certified public accountant who was commuting  Monday from his home in Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Other passengers voiced the same concern, noting that some criminals may be  biding their time until the hoopla and security wane. Gazing at the army of  deputies around her, one Compton woman scoffed. "Let's see if these guys are  around like this six months from now when I'm riding the train at night," she  said shaking her head.  </P> <P> But Sheriff's Capt. Frank Vadurro, who heads the transit bureau, said he is  confident that the department will keep up a high level of security long after  the fanfare dies down.  </P> <P> "We're here to stay," he said. "We are going to maintain this as a crime-free  line to the greatest extent possible. That's what we're about."  </P> <P> When the month of free fares is over, sheriff's deputies will be involved in  checking fares as well as ensuring that radios are silent and nobody is  smoking, eating or drinking on the trains -- "quality of life" issues that  sheriff's officials say will make up a major share of violations on transit  properties.  </P> <P> But it is the specter of violent crime and the shadowy presence of gangs that  worries many passengers. And on the inaugural weekend, deputies kept a special  eye out for gang members, even those merely out to enjoy a free train ride.  </P> <P> "As long as they're peaceful, they have a right to ride the trains," Deputy  Oxley said. "As long as they don't break the law, it's OK. And we're here to  make sure they don't break the law."  </P></p>

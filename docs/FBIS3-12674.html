			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mahfoud Nahnah, leader of the Algerian </F> Islamic Society Movement (HAMAS), by 'Abdallah al-Hajj in  Jeddah; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Hajj] It seems that the confrontation  between the regime and the Islamists is escalating, despite  Zeroual's appointment as president. What are the direct reasons  for the escalation?    [Nahnah] We expected an escalation of violence because  political rivalry is not based on rules that guarantee power  rotation or participation in power so as to safeguard security  and property and prevent bloodshed. The swelling of the tide of  violence remains natural as long as some people are pursuing the  policy of breaking bones and destroying the country, its present  and future, even at the expense of values, virtues, and  achievements. [passage omitted]    Liamine Zeroual's arrival is another experience to be added  to the other experiences. However, what attracts attention is  the fact that the man has the presidential and defense powers  and does not need to hesitate as much as those before him did.  This is why we saw him move toward dialogue and toward  expanding it and securing mechanisms and a date for it -- which  is indeed a glimmer of hope. But the armed party -- so it seems  -- felt that the rug had been pulled from under its feet, so it  decided to increase the tide of violence so as to attract  attention to the claim that it is the party concerned with the  dialogue of negotiation, not anyone else. Especially as the  Islamic Salvation Front realized that the policy of  confrontation would lead to the required outcome, so it  displayed a degree of reason, which armed parties tend to  ignore. These parties tend to threaten or criticize anyone who  insists on adopting reason, which most regrettably came after  the devastation of the country. Had the conflicting parties  accepted dialogue from the first day, we would not have reached  the verge of this painful devastation. [passage omitted]    [Al-Hajj] Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Socialist Forces  Front, has said that a civil war will break out in Algeria and  that the more extremist will win it. What is your opinion?    [Nahnah] Numerous hands are involved in the Algerian  situation, because of the explosive issues which have found a  good climate for explosion in the critical situation. Even  before this crisis erupted, our movement warned about the  serious situations which could develop in Algeria along the  lines of what is happening in Lebanon, Afghanistan, or Somalia.  Especially since some people are working to kindle the  political, religious, and frontal sedition in Algeria. Anyone  who says that the most extremist will win is actually openly  calling for more extremism, which damages the image of Islam and  political Islamist movements. Muslims rushed into many battles,  but the sly reaped the fruits. The policy of decay pursued by  the Algerian and foreign octopuses serves only the idea of  settling scores at the expense of the nation and its constants.  [passage omitted]    [Al-Hajj] Preacher Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani was  assassinated recently. Do you believe that this will lead to  inter-Islamic confrontations inside Algeria?    [Nahnah] Martyr Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani, may God have  mercy on him, was a man of knowledge, call [al-da'wah], and  reform for 30 years. He was killed by the hands of treachery,  sin, and recklessness. They have ignorantly assumed the task of  shedding innocent blood directly or indirectly in order to  exploit the critical situation. We cannot say that this action  is the result of the understanding of Islam. Not at all. The  Islamic banner is exploited to achieve cheap and base  objectives, namely to spread terror, plant despair, expand the  circle of frustration among citizens, and push the Algerians  toward infighting and sever their necks and ruin their homes  with their own hands. [passage omitted]    [Al-Hajj] Do you believe that President Zeroual is the man  of the hour in Algeria? And how can he succeed in salvaging the  country?    [Nahnah] The country's success and extrication from the  crisis cannot be achieved by putting diluted ointments on  malignant tumors, but by abandoning deception, falsification,  and the policy of playing for time, and turning to the people,  respecting their will, and opening channels to express their  ideas and proposals without any compulsion, domination,  subservience, arrogance, or marginalization.    I welcome Liamine Zeroual's endeavor to ease the crisis by  expanding the dialogue, alleviating the citizens' suffering,  hastening to hold elections, and not taking any notice of the  voices of the crows of socialism, secularism, and ignorance, who  are the cause of the calamity and the bankruptcy. They promote  French influence and Marxism. And I urge President Zeroual to  shorten the transitional phase as much as possible. And if  necessary, he should at least be a fair tyrant in this period.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Arts: A pot pourri of pleasures - Art There is nothing quite like the Bowes Museum at Barnard Castle. With its massive stone facade, 100 yards long and 100 feet high, it looks as if an ornate French chateau - or some grand, provincial Hotel de Ville  - has been transported, formal park and all, to the edge of a small market town in County Durham in northern England. Inside the imposing granite hall, the first object that the visitor encounters is a life-size silver swan automaton devised by JJ Merlin, an eccentric 18th century 'Mechanick' and inventor whose other contributions to the pleasures of mankind include the pianoforte-harpsichord and the rollerskate. In daily performances the graceful silver bird appears to swim in a glass pool that convincingly creates the illusion of moving water. It preens its feathers and swoops to catch a fish which is seen wriggling in its bill. The swan raises its head, displays its trophy, and then gobbles it up. That this is no ordinary museum is apparent from the start. Automata, toys and clocks form one of many lesser collections. The Bowes is a pot pourri of period rooms, remarkable Old Master pictures, French porcelain, furniture and textiles, metalwork and glass, books and manuscripts. Here, outstanding 17th century Flemish tapestries and a glorious GB Tiepolo rub shoulders with a mass of lesser wares hoovered up wholesale at the great international exhibitions. It is a fascinating period piece reflecting the eclectic taste of its founders, John Bowes, and his French wife Josephine, and of the opportunities afforded by the art market in the mid and late 19th century. A visit to the 29 paintings currently on loan to the National Gallery in London while the Bowes picture galleries are closed for re-wiring is a pale substitute for a trip to Teeside. Yet even this small selection succeeds in reflecting the quality and breadth of this highly unusual collection. Moreoever, the show brings to the capital pictures of a type not to be found elsewhere in England. John Bowes began his collecting career conventionally enough. (As the illegitimate son of the 10th Earl of Strathmore he was to inherit his father's estate but not his title, in spite of the latter's death-bed marriage.) His first purchase, aged 19, was a Temptation of St Anthony believed to be by Teniers; his second, a boar hunt by Snyders. The 1840s saw him branch out into the Italian school, paying, for instance, Pounds 25 for the grandiose and mannered 'Rape of Helen' by a follower of Primaticcio, and 9.5 guineas for Solario's delightfully fantastical 'St Jerome in the Wilderness'. Sassetta's glowing 'Miracle of the Holy Sacrament' was a mere Pounds 6 15s. This Sienese predella panel of the 1420s presents an account of a Carmelite lay brother struck dead at Communion, presumably because he doubted the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. While the Host gorily bleeds on its paten, a black devil flies in through the window to pull a ghostly soul out of the brother's mouth. Sassetta's church interior, studded with gold-ground altarpieces, and his elegant group of onlookers in contemporary dress, provides an informal insight into the life of the time. The unexpected was provided in 1862 when the collection of the late Conde de Quinto, formerly director of the National Museum of Paintings in Madrid, became available on the Paris market. Bowes had already begun to entertain the idea of establishing a public museum. Some 75 out of its 217 predominantly Spanish pictures were eventually acquired through the dealer Benjamin Gogue. Many of those acknowledged today as masterpieces were bought as wall-filling job-lots to the now discredited heavyweights. Witness the most compelling picture in the show. In 'The Tears of St Peter', El Greco reproduces through oil and pigment the anguish and repentence of the faithful disciple overcome with sorrow for having denied Christ. This is no typical Counter Reformation performance of sentimental, dewy-eyed hand-wringing. El Greco spurns the standard histrionics. Instead, he exploits the tension of contrasts, the painterly gesture and the emotive power of colour - harsh blues and sulphurous yellows - to give force to the anguish of St Peter's soul. To our eyes, it is a profoundly sincere and affecting image by this most idiosyncratic of painters. For Bowes, El Greco was an artist whose star had not yet soared into the ascendant. He purchased the canvas for 200 francs, around Pounds 8. Two small Goyas also find their way to London. There is the sensitive portrait of his friend, the poet and lawyer Melendez Valdes. 'An Interior of a Prison' is a grim indictment of man's inhumanity. The last great treat of the show is the 18th century French painting - not only the highly decorative Boucher and Hubert Robert (seen through blue- and rose-tinted spectacles respectively) but the classical landscapes and genres by the likes of the wonderfully named Achille-Etna Michallon and Granet, artists most familiar in this country for their fresh, outdoor oil sketches. An appropriate postscript is Courbet's 'View of Ornans', purchased the year after it was painted in 1864 and perhaps the first work by the Realist master to enter a British collection. The exhibition continues at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, London, until June 20. The picture galleries at the Bowes Museum re-open at the end of October.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Federal Judge Nerio Bonifatti has  formally acquitted former presidential audiences director and  the President's sister-in-law Amira Yoma in the notorious  "Yomagate" scandal.    Amira Yoma has been summoned to appear in court this  afternoon to receive the official notification that she has been  definitely cleared.    President Menem yesterday [13 April] said that he regretted  the way his sister-in-law had been treated since she was first  accused of being part of the drug money-laundering scheme. Menem  also accused the press of blowing up the statements of  drug-dealer Andy de la Cruz Iglesias.    Bonifatti, who has been tipped for promotion to the Federal  Appeals Court, is thought to have quashed the case on the basis  of insufficient evidence.    Last week Federal Prosecutor Carlos Stornelli had  recommended  the acquittal of Yoma and other co-defendants. Stornelli is  reportedly in line to succeed Bonifatti when he steps up to the  Federal Court.    In 1991 Amira Yoma along with her then husband Ibrahim  al-Ibrahim were accused by various witnesses of having been seen  at Ezeiza International Airport with suitcases allegedly full of  drug earnings from the United States.    The money passed through Customs without difficulty due to  Amira's position as Presidential Audiences Secretary at  Government House and her husband's senior Customs position, even  though he hardly spoke Spanish and held a Syrian passport.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Filippov: "Accepted With a Period of </F> Probation"]    [Text] Russia has subscribed to NATO's "Partnership for  Peace" program. At NATO Headquarters in Brussels Wednesday  Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign affairs,  signed a framework document on the general principles of  participation in this program, whose aims have already been  supported by 20 European states.    International observers have unanimously called Russia's  signing of this program a most important stage in the new  relations of security which have taken shape since the end of  the "Cold War." Although the program might be far from perfect,  it will, nevertheless, significantly strengthen mutual trust and  openness in the interests of all European states. As a  transitional form of cooperation, the program will provide both  NATO and Russia with time and opportunities to formulate more  clearly the terms of Russia's joining the North Atlantic  Alliance.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has called the  signing of the treaty one more stage on the way to uniting  Russia with the West. In actual fact, however, it is, rather,  part of a policy based on the "wait and see" principle. If in  time it becomes clear that the economic and democratic reforms  in Russia are becoming stronger, then there will be no  difficulties in the way of further rapprochement; if not,  however, there will be no need for NATO to regret that caution  was displayed in the past, the BBC points out.    Russia has been granted special status with due regard to  the  fact that its joining NATO is not envisaged in the long term,  Radio Deutsche Welle reports. But Russia has had to make  concessions not only on this point. The NATO alliance has  denied Moscow a rigid consultation mechanism and the right to  vote on the alliance's affairs.    But, however positively Russia's subscribing to the  "Partnership for Peace" program is evaluated, it is clear that  this certainly does not mean the elimination of the  contradictions between Russia and NATO over the aims of this  cooperation.</p>

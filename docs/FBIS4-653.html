			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign minister, who was contacted this  morning, has called on all Burundians in Kigali to gather if  possible at the Burundian Embassy to await their imminent  repatriation. According to a high-ranking official of the same  ministry, negotiations on the repatriation of our compatriots  from the Rwandan capital began last weekend. Those who were in  Gisenyi have left Rwandan territory. There are around 40 people  left. Two planes will leave Bujumbura soon for Goma, eastern  Zaire, to where these people were evacuated.    A special flight is planned in the next few hours for those  who are in Kigali and who are able to reach the Burundian  Embassy. The high-ranking Foreign Ministry official told us  that at the Burundian Embassy in Kigali, 30 Burundians are  awaiting repatriation, and will receive French and Belgian  military assistance.    Those who cannot easily reach the embassy are asked to join  any Belgian or French citizens residing nearby to be evacuated  with other expatriates. In case of problems, they can call the  Burundian Embassy in Kigali on the following number: 75512.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Mandate to mend a broken system: Italy must reform or face relegation within Europe The fall of the Berlin wall has claimed its last victim, Italy's Christian Democrat party. The party's dominance of post-war Italian politics, unprecedented in Europe, relied in the last resort on its appeal as a bastion against the powerful Communist party winning power through the ballot box. The collapse of communism has robbed the Christian Democrats of this protective clothing. Italian voters in Sunday's general election revealed the Christian Democrats to be a corrupt political machine, hungry for power but bankrupt of ideas, and led by an ageing elite which has lost touch with a groundswell of opinion clamouring for change. With their support dropping below the psychological barrier of 30 per cent for the first time, an era has ended. The Christian Democrats, though still the largest party, can no longer exercise their extensive rights of patronage and orchestrate the political system to their advantage, which they have done for 46 years. Italy now faces a profoundly new political geography, and uncertainty as to who will form the next government. The election result will take time to digest. But politicians realise that an agenda has been set by a combination of popular demand and the dictates of the European Community in Brussels. If Italy is to fulfil the obligations contracted at the Maastricht summit to converge with its EC partners, urgent and decisive measures are needed to reduce the country's huge public sector deficit, now approaching 11 per cent of gross domestic product, and to revive a stagnant economy which grew at 1.4 per cent last year, the lowest since 1983. A precondition for such measures must be a government backed by a broad-based consensus from the political parties. This is only likely if common ground can be found for reforming the electoral system to favour larger government majorities. Last June's overwhelming endorsement of a referendum abolishing the much-abused system of multi-preference votes was the first signal. Two other referendums, proposed by Mr Mario Segni, one of the few new Christian Democrat faces, and introducing elements of a first-past-the-post system, are being considered by the courts. And a significant cross section of the new deputies committed themselves before the election to ensuring these reforms prosper. The dangers of ungovernability are real. The country's complex system of proportional representation, grafted with the best democratic intention of accommodating every shade of opinion, has produced a parliament so fractured as to be almost unworkable. In Italy's 11th post-war legislature no fewer than 16 different parties will be represented in the chamber of deputies. Of these, 12 possess less than 6 per cent of the vote, and of the remaining four only the Christian Democrats have more than 20 per cent. However, voters were well aware that they were stepping into the unknown on Sunday. The problem they confronted was the absence of a clearly defined opposition. Hence it was not surprising that votes were widely spread: nor that the greatest upset came in the north where the populist Lombard League (see below) burst on to the scene. The latter stages of the election campaign devolved into a simplified version of 'them' and 'us'. On one side were the Christian Democrats and their junior partners in the outgoing four-party coalition - the Socialists, the Social Democrats (PSDI), the Liberals (PLI) - arguing they alone were capable of managing the economy and reforming the electoral system. On the other were nine groupings with a chance of serious parliamentary representation. These included such disparate forces as the neo-Fascist MSI, the small centre-left Republicans, the Lombard League, the Sicilian-based reformist movement The Network (La Rete), and the former communists split between the mainstream new Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the hardline Reconstructed Communism. Although they were united in wishing to break the government coalition, they had no common platform. Their spoiling role worked, however, reducing the four-party coalition to 47 per cent of the vote. The coalition can muster a 16-seat majority in the 630-seat chamber, but on the admission of its own supporters it has lost the credibility to form a government, let alone to last a five-year term. The 73-year-old Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing Christian Democrat prime minister, bears much responsibility for the party's slide from 34 per cent to 29 per cent. Mr Arnaldo Forlani, a potential prime minister, has offered his resignation as Christian Democrat party secretary in the wake of the result. Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, has also lost face, as his party's vote fell below 14 per cent. He had previously said this would be the minimum necessary for accepting the job of forming the next government. In addition to the damage done to the reputation of the main political figures in the outgoing government, too many contentious social and economic issues were ducked because they were liable to split the coalition. At the top of the list comes reform of Italy's generous state pension scheme, which has been under consideration for more than five years and is one of the main causes of the budget deficit. Privatisation has been written in to provide significant funds to hold down the budget deficit this year but no party has been able to agree on what should be privatised and where the proceeds should go. The question of reducing aid to the south, which involves cutting political patronage, has been sidestepped, while a proposal to shake up the armed forces to produce a more professional military is on hold. Any permutation of governing coalition to meet these challenges is now possible. Even the Christian Democrats, Socialists and former communists (PDS) could link up, in a group which would command the strongest cross-party support. But any of the new partners will demand electoral reform as its price for support and an end to the Christian Democrats' hegemony. A consensus of the main parties could decide that the most viable way forward is to treat the next parliament as a form of constituent assembly, exclusively concerned with initiating electoral reforms for a new legislature on which the electorate would vote within two years. President Francesco Cossiga will have a significant role in the uncertain weeks ahead. He is determined to form a government as quickly as possible before his old mandate expires on July 3. His unpredictable nature, canny sense of popular sentiment and desire to knock heads together could produce an unpredictable coalition or even a temporary government of technocrats. But in the last resort everything hinges on the ability of the politicians to recognise the seriousness of Italy's predicament. The Christian Democrats and their Socialist allies claim the commitment to Europe at Maastricht was the outgoing administration's greatest achievement. If they do not now show a sense of unity, Italy will fail to heal a dangerous north-south divide and risk being relegated to Europe's second division.</p>

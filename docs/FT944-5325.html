			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: A rich, heady brew Anthologies, like Christmas parties, are great fun, but exhausting, over-crowded, and leave you with a morning-after sense of having indulged too greatly. Oxford has made a corner in this kind of publishing. Pride of place among its offerings this year is John Gross's The Oxford Book of Comic Verse (Pounds 17.99). Gross scattered invitation cards across several centuries, from Anon and Chaucer in the Middle Ages to Victoria Wood and Vikram Seth in our own time and he received 100 per cent acceptances to make an hilarious event. Comic verse he defines as 'verse which is designed to amuse' and that includes an awful lot of verse; but it stops short, in Gross's eyes, at full-blooded satire. Pope and Swift are there, sure enough, but not fulminating. They are in lighter vein alongside some people we do not normally think of as poets at all, Max Beerbohm, Ronald Knox, CS Lewis, John Updike, Cyril Connolly. Nor has Gross neglected verse designed initially to be sung including WS Gilbert, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Michael Flanders. All in all, Gross has done an excellent job. So has DJ Enright in tackling a subject of equally formidable scope in The Oxford Book of The Supernatural (Pounds 17.99). His method is to break the supernatural up into a dozen or more categories that include such vast areas as 'Loving Revenants', 'Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies and Other Monsters', 'Miracles and Prognostications' 'Art and Intellect' and 'Dreams, Coincidences, Telepathy'. Familiar passages and highly abstruse ones lie cheek by jowl as in 'Animal Spirits' where the disappearance of Hamlet's father's ghost - 'It faded on the crowing of a cock . . .' - precedes a passage from AE Waite's The Occult Sciences that cites many instances of the belief that a crowing cock acted as a curfew for visitors from the other world. I am not really qualified to pronounce on Patricia Craig's The Oxford Book of Modern Women's Stories (Pounds 17.99), but let me say that it contains 40 stories chosen by a compiler who has worked tirelessly for the recognition of popular fiction. The Impossible Art of Golf: An Anthology of Golf Writing (OUP, Pounds 16.99) is selected by Alec Morrison, captain of Rye Golf Club in 1990. In this instance I can personally vouch for the impossibility. (I currently play off 24 or, if I am lucky, the grass). Here are such veterans as Bernard Darwin and Henry Longhurst, Alistair Cooke, the American sports journalist Herbert Warren Wind and PG Wodehouse. Ian Fleming is in - Bond's round with Goldfinger is here in toto - and so is Julian Barnes but not, surprisingly, Patrick Hamilton nor Morrison's fellow member at Rye, Henry James, whose few comments on the game are worth heeding.</p>

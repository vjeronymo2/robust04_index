			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by B. Cani: "Defection or Theft of `Brains'?"] </F>   [Excerpts] Belgrade -- "The emigration of experts from our  country has assumed worrying proportions recently. We would  like to establish the exact number of those who have left the  country, try to reduce this number, and create the conditions  for their return." This was stated yesterday by Ratko Uzunovic,  assistant republican minister for science, technology, and  development at the consultations devoted to this problem at the  Institute for International Politics and Economy.    According to the information collected by this institute,  1,060 scientists have left the country in the last 15 years.  However, as Dr. Vladimir Grecic said, this figure is not  definite. There are many institutions and organizations that  have not filled out the questionnaires that were sent to them.  It is estimated that some 1,400 experts have left the country.  These experts were mainly at the age considered to be best for  creativity; 251 of them hold PhD's, 215 hold masters degree, and  another 594 hold various degrees. The greatest number of those  who have left are experts for electronics, physics, mathematics,  chemistry, and medicine. [passage omitted]    The largest number of experts has gone to the United States  (277), followed by Canada (194), Australia (82), Switzerland,  Austria.... As stated yesterday, particularly worrying are the  indications that some countries will increase the number of  entry visas for experts in certain fields. According to the  representative of the republican Ministry for Education, this  represents additional (deliberate) form of sanctions against  Serbia and Yugoslavia. It should be mentioned that Canada, for  instance, has announced that it would grant around 10,000  immigration visas this year.</p>

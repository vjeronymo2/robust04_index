About a thousand troops backed by air and sea cover returned  to base in coastal Trincomalee following the operation over the  weekend against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  rebels in the region, officials said.    Troops destroyed an abandoned LTTE camp that included 15  well- fortified bunkers and ten small accomodation units, a  military spokesman said. They also recovered about 50  anti-personnel mines from the rebel camp, he said.    "The Tigers left the camp to avoid confronting advancing  troops. One soldier was wounded when he stepped on an  anti-personnel mine," the spokesman said.    The latest offensive was part of a military campaign to  flush  out LTTE rebels in parts of the island's north and the entire  east ahead of key local government elections in the region on  March 1.    The LTTE, which is fighting for a separate state in the  northeast for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils, have vowed to disrupt  the polls in northern Vavuniya, in Trincomalee and the  neighbouring districts of Batticaloa and Ampara.</p>

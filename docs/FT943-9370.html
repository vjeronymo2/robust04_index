			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Thailand's distribution revolution - Cash-and-carry group Siam Makro is floated today With their warehouse-like interiors, computerised stock management systems and vast car parks, Makro cash-and-carry stores look much the same in Thailand as they do in Europe, even if they sell more noodles than potatoes. But in Thailand they are still a novelty. Siam Makro, the joint venture between SHV of the Netherlands and Thailand's CP group which is being floated on the Thai stock exchange today, is at the forefront of a revolution that is transforming distribution of food and other consumer products in south-east Asia. Makro's first store in Asia opened in Bangkok only five years ago. Open-air markets, small shops and traditional distribution networks still dominate wholesale and retail trade in Thailand, including Bangkok with its estimated population of 9m. Over the next two years, however, the capital will see the opening of numerous superstores, hypermarkets and modern convenience stores and some of the world's largest shopping malls. In the wholesale cash-and-carry sector, Siam Makro is investing furiously to maintain its dominance and is going public - the first Makro unit worldwide to do so - in order to finance its rapid expansion. Speed is important in provincial towns which may be able to support only one such store and where land costs are rising sharply. 'If we can get there first, it will be profitable for us,' says Mr Ian Hamilton, Siam Makro president. 'If our competitors get there first, it won't be profitable for either them or us.' Siam Makro has raised nearly Bt2bn (Dollars 80m) with its initial public offering of 40m shares - just over 18 per cent of the company - at Bt50 a share. The offering is regarded as a test case by SHV and could be emulated elsewhere if the flotation is deemed to be a success; Makro runs 120 stores in 16 countries. There are already eight stores in Thailand, and Siam Makro intends to expand at the rate of two or three stores a year to counter expected competition. A local cash-and-carry company, Saveco, recently opened its first outlet and is poised to open more. Siam Makro expects to increase sales this year to more than Bt18bn and to make a net profit of more than Bt300m. Two of its stores in Bangkok are in the top five Makro stores worldwide measured by sales per square metre, a remarkable record given that average purchasing power is still much lower than in the west. The balance of power in Thailand appears to be shifting to consumers. Previously manufacturers have been able to dictate prices to small distributors, but now find themselves dealing with powerful chains such as Makro. Siam Makro says it takes 6 per cent of Unilever's products in Thailand, and the share is growing. 'We are the first one in town really to break into what was a supplier's market,' says Ms Yaovanee Tulyasathien, Siam Makro finance director. Siam Makro will avoid competing head-on with the emerging superstore retail sector and focus on its core business of wholesaling high volumes of food to small retailers - all 450,000 Makro members in Thailand have business licences - but the company's managers have been surprised by the success of non-food products sold to customers for personal use. About 45 per cent of Makro's turnover in Thailand is currently accounted for by sales of these items, such as televisions and clothes, and the gross profit margin of 12 per cent is double the margin for food items, the company says. This partly reflects the inefficiency of the existing retail sector in Thailand and may not last. But Siam Makro is confident enough to be planning to open separate retail outlets for office equipment, starting in the first quarter of next year. Small businesses will remain the main customers of Siam Makro, Mr Hamilton believes. If corner shops are squeezed by big retailers as they have been in Europe, there will be new customers for cash-and-carry stores as service industries such as bars profit from the country's growing wealth.</p>

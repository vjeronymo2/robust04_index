			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the National People's </F> Congress Standing Committee: "Make a Thorough Study of the  Position and Functions of Finance in the Market Economy  System"--excerpt of speech at the 1993 annual meeting of China's  Society of Finance and the 11th National Symposium on Financial  Theory]    [Text] The 14th National Party Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee definitely  pointed out: The aim of establishing a socialist market economic  structure is to make the market play a basic role in the  allocation of resources under the state macroeconomic regulation  and control. Everybody knows that, as an action of  distribution by the government, finance itself is an activity of  resource allocation as well as a means of macroeconomic  regulation and control. Under the planned economic  structure in the past, allocation of resources was realized by  taking planning as a foundation and the activities of  departments including finance, material supplies, and others.  How then under the conditions of a market economy following the  gradual change from the planned economy to the socialist market  economy, will finance play its role in the allocation of  resources and how will finance exercise regulation and control  at the macro level of the state? This is an important  theoretical and practical issue at present.    The decisions adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee pointed out that "there must be a  sound macroeconomic regulation and control system for the  socialist market economy," proposed that "a coordinating and  restraining mechanism between planning and monetary and  financial policy should be established and comprehensive  coordination in economic operations enhanced," and stated that  "finance should use the instruments of budget and taxation to  concentrate on regulating the economic structure and social  distribution, use monetary and financial policies to regulate  the basic equilibrium of total social demand and supply, and, in  coordination with industrial policies, bring about a coordinated  national economic and social development." The above expression  is very clear, that is, finance shoulders the task of  regulating the economic structure and social distribution and of  regulating and controlling total demand and supply.    Taken from the formation of money, the allocation of  market resources is, in essence, a kind of distribution and  circulation of financial resources. Markets play a basic  role in the allocation of resources, but they cannot cover  everything. The problems that markets are unable to or  cannot very well resolve in the allocation of resources must be  settled through financial distribution and other economic means  to ensure coordinated social development. For instance,  the resources allocated to satisfy public requirements,  including the portion of resources necessary for government  organs to maintain normal operations and institutions to provide  public services, can only be allocated through government  financial distribution rather than through markets. This is not  substitutable. However, economic development is always a  fundamental mission of a socialist state. Although the  allocation of resources under the conditions of a market economy  takes markets as a foundation, because there are weaknesses in  markets themselves, not only must investment in the  construction of infrastructural facilities and social welfare be  made by state finance through overall planning, but the economic  structure and social distribution must also be regulated through  the financial means of budget and taxation. Therefore, how to  adjust the structure of financial revenue and expenditure and  the policy of financial distribution to suit the needs of market  economic development is a subject that we should study with  concentrated efforts. For example--how should we  rationally regulate the structure of distributing financial  resources, and properly handle and regulate in a timely manner  the extent of concentrating and distributing financial resources  as well as the departmental and regional structures of  distributing financial resources, according to the requirement  that markets should play a basic role in the allocation of  resources? Again, there are other examples--in the areas of  financial taxation structure and distribution policies, how  should we ensure the ability of the central authorities to  appropriately concentrate financial resources and enhance its  ability in macroeconomic regulation and control under the  conditions of the market economy; and how should we correctly  handle the distribution relationships between the state,  enterprises, and individuals according to the principle of  giving priority to efficiency while taking account of fairness?  All these should be studied in theory, and experience pertinent  to them should be repeatedly summarized in practice.    Certainly, the position and task of finance in the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure are not  limited to the above content. The five major links in the basic  framework of the socialist market economic structure sketched in  the "Decisions" are an organically integrated entirety, which  has set new tasks and demands for financial work. Other parts  of the "Decisions," including in-depth structural reforms in the  rural economy, foreign economic relations, science, technology,  and education, the intensified building of the legal system, and  so on, have set new tasks and demands for financial work as  well. All these also call for us to conduct studies in theory  and practice.    Great and spectacular achievements have been scored in  China's reform and opening up. In the entire historical  development process, financial taxation reform is always placed  in an important position. It not only facilitates the  development of the reform and opening up undertaking with  financial and material capabilities, but also coordinates and  promotes other economic structural reforms on its own. The  reform of financial taxation before the 14th National Party  Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee was chiefly aimed at eliminating the malpractices of  the old structure and at changing the conditions of highly  concentrated financial resources and financial powers. Now, the  aim is to readjust the distribution structure of financial  resources, provide necessary financial resources and powers to  enterprises for becoming the main body of the market economy,  and provide financial resources to localities for accelerating  economic development and the rapid growth of the economy as a  whole, in accordance with the development track from the planned  economy to the planned commodity economy and finally to the  market economy. In short, it aims at realizing the  objective of laying a foundation of financial resources for  markets to play the basic role in the allocation of resources  and at correspondingly carrying out reforms of some financial  management systems that do not suit the requirements of reform  and opening up, through the readjustment of the distribution  structure of financial resources. At present, in line with  the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, positively accelerating reform in financial  taxation has been taken as a major aim in the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure, and the introduction of  three reform programs on financial taxation in 1994 has been  planned. Today, China's reform of financial taxation has  entered a new stage. The characteristics of this stage are to  straighten out the relationship of financial taxation,  standardize its conduct, and establish a financial taxation  structure and operational mechanism that are suited to the  socialist market economy. This is a significant change calling  for us to transform our concept on financial resource  management, improve our management modes and methods, and  gradually form a set of financial taxation and policy  theoretical systems suitable to the socialist market economic  structure. This is a mission entrusted by the times to our  financial theoretical and practical workers.    In order to be suited to the requirements of this  development, it is necessary to once again stress the importance  of financial theoretical study. Just as Engels put it: Only  when people stand on the theoretical height can they take a  broad and long-term view to charter the right course and take  the initiative in work. It can be said that leadership work  cannot be well performed if serious attention is not paid to  theoretical study and scientific research, and that  one-sidedness and blindness in work is unavoidable and  opportunities are apt to be bungled if theory and scientific  research are ignored. Hence, we must take theoretical  study of finance very seriously, consider some strategic,  overall, and long-term issues earnestly, and give impetus to  initiating a new situation in financial work with infiltrating  studies of scientific theories and policies. Reform of  financial taxation will enter a crucial year in 1994. Although  the reform plan has been set, there are still many problems to  be solved and many new conditions to be studied in practical  work. This calls for comrades in business and scientific  research departments to coordinate with one another and strive  to enhance the theoretical level of the entire rank of cadres on  the financial taxation front and their ability to solve  practical problems, through intensified investigation and  research and the conscientious study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

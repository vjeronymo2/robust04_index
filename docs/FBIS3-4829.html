			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Suva, March 2 (AFP) -- Fiji's newly re-elected  Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka demanded complete honesty from  his streamlined cabinet of 12 ministers at their first meeting  here Wednesday. [passage omitted]    Rabuka also stressed that his ministers must discharge their  duties impartially and serve the government and the people of  Fiji to the best of their ability. The prime minister also  requested the ministers disclose in confidence a full list of  their holdings of stocks in companies and shares they have  acquired after taking office.    His moves followed reports last year that Rabuka's wife and  one of his cabinet ministers had shares in a construction  company which had won a five million Fiji dollar (3.2 million US  dollar) contract to upgrade Fiji's international airport at  Nadi, on the western edge of the main island. At the time Rabuka  denied he had anything to do with the awarding of the contract  to the company, whose bid was the lowest, and later his wife and  the cabinet minister sold their shares.</p>

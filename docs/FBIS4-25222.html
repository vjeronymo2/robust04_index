			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Cooperation With China Is World Trend"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has announced the  separation of human rights from trade and the unconditional  renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status,  which shows an adjustment of U.S. policy toward China. This is  the trend of the times and the desire of the people. Although  Sino-U.S. relations are still full of contradictions and  maintaining the improving trend requires effort, this is an  important step. In particular, the U.S. Government has  recognized the importance of cooperating with China and has  realized that linking human rights to trade will lead itself  into a dead end; regarding this point, it is praiseworthy.    In the international community today, some major economic  powers are particularly willing to become partners in  cooperation with China to develop economic and trade relations,  and this has already become a world trend. Please look at the  following:    Japan: Entrepreneurial circles have a strong desire to  strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and a China fever  is sweeping across the Japanese islands. Last year,  Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations created three  first's, that is, Sino- Japanese trade volume set records and  Japan ranked first among China's trade partners, Japan's exports  of technology to China ranked first among China's technology  imports, and the realization rate of capital invested in China  by Japanese entrepreneurs also ranked first.    Germany: With Chancellor Kohl's China visit last October as  a landmark, Sino-German relations entered a new period of  thorough development, and many large enterprises marched toward  the Chinese market like an army, with Germany becoming China's  largest trade partner in Europe. Kohl said Germany was willing  to become China's "real partner" and hoped that relations  between the two countries would "resemble ever-flowing steams  and rivers."    France: Owing to arms sales to Taiwan by the French  Government, Sino-French relations were hurt. After going  through some twists and turns, the French Government changed its  mind and took the initiative to mend ties with China. In April  this year, Prime Minister Balladur visited China and said he  wanted to "open a new chapter on Sino-French relations." After  the leaders of the two governments held summits, a joint  communique on the restoration of relations was issued, and,  since then, relations between the two countries have entered the  track of normal development.    Russia: Earlier this year, Russian President Boris Yeltsin  proposed building a "constructive partnership" with China. Not  long ago, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin visited China, the two  countries signed seven agreements involving many areas, and  bilateral relations took a big step forward.    Some big powers have one after another adjusted their China  policies, and this can be regarded as the result of a re-  interpretation of China by those governments. Whether they are  willing or unwilling, politicians in Western countries,  including the United States, must admit: first, China is a  giant, and no pressures or sanctions of any kind can have an  impact on it; second, China has the fastest economic growth in  the world and has a great impact on the world's economic  development; third, China is a market with great potential and  is opening to every trade partner, who now find it provides the  best opportunity to enter the Chinese market and develop their  own economy. If a country looks down on China or even confronts  China, the one which will be hurt is not China but itself. The  French prime minister openly admitted that he had neglected the  development of the Asia region in the past and had now  discovered the consequence of such negligence, and that from now  on, he must pay special attention to China's development and  strengthen cooperation with China. The French foreign minister  also said that France "regrets the quarrel with China caused by  the matter of arms sales to Taiwan," and asked "should we bet on  a region of 20 million people or a country which has 1.1 billion  people and is probably the world's third largest economic power?  To us, the choice is very obvious."    Economic factors are the determining factors about whether a  regime can be consolidated and whether society can develop. If  a country's politicians do not look at the economy, do not put  economic development in the first position, and do not consider  their country's long-term interests, they will lead their  country into decline and chaos and they will be abandoned by the  people. The contemporary Western world generally faces economic  depression, and it must put economic factors in pole position  when handling international relations to cast off this difficult  situation. This is an important reason why some of the major  powers are seeking cooperation with China.    There is also another point, that is, more Western countries  feel that it is not feasible to deal with China by exerting  pressure on it or imposing economic sanctions against it in  order to achieve political aims. The United States has even  failed to score results by imposing sanctions against some small  countries, let alone China, which has 1.1 billion people! In  the 1950's, armed intervention and economic blockade by the  United States failed to bring China to its knees; after "4  June," the United States joined hands with some Western  countries to impose economic sanctions against China, but failed  to make China lower its head; in recent years, the United States  has waved the human rights stick but has failed to scare China.  Clinton linked human rights to MFN status and was strongly  opposed by various circles, especially commercial circles in the  United States; therefore, he could not but admit that the effect  of linking the two had vanished.    In handling relations with China, even France and the United  States have bowed their heads to reality and to economics; they  have rid themselves of erroneous ideas of their own and have  made choices which conform to their long-term interests and to  the world trend, and this cannot but deal a blow to the British  Government, which continues to insist on confronting China. Up  to now, Britain still hopes to see turmoil emerging in China,  hopes to use the human rights stick to scare China, and hopes to  see its allies and the United Nations exert political pressure  on China so that it can achieve its goal of extending its  colonial interests in Hong Kong; this is really absurd. We can  certainly say that in Hong Kong, while the British side is  staking its chips on a small handful of pro-British elements who  are trying to cause chaos in Hong Kong, it is doomed to failure.</p>

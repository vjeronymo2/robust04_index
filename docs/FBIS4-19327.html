			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet by </F> unattributed correspondent; place and date not given: "GATT --  A Victory for France"]    [Excerpt] [PARIS MATCH] Are the GATT agreements to be  signed this week in Marrakesh a source of great satisfaction to  France?    [Longuet] We have two reasons to be happy: France, which is  already the fourth-ranking export nation in the world, is seeing  new markets open up. Thanks to French-U.S. cooperation, we will  now be able to introduce the famous social clause for which we  have been calling. As it will take time before such a clause is  adopted, it is better to raise the issue right away. It will be  included of the work schedule of the World Trade Organization  (WTO), that will see the light of day in 1995.    [PARIS MATCH] Will this agreement help us find a way out of  the crisis?    [Longuet] It does constitute a serious boost for our  economy.  Thanks to the rules of the game accepted by all the signatory  countries, we will have a stable economic framework which is  more beneficial to the development of trade. The growth rate of  world trade is twice that of the world economy.    [PARIS MATCH] Are you not worried by that many of our  companies will relocate in the future?    [Longuet] Companies must get used to a permanent  reallocation  of roles. We must help certain sectors, those that are more  exposed than others, to adapt. Take the clothing industry, for  instance. We will help this sector to become more upmarket and  to protect its brand name policy. There are many positive  aspects of the GATT agreement in this connection, notably the  respect for intellectual property.    [PARIS MATCH] And what about the negative aspects of GATT?  Are there any?    [Longuet] I regret that countries like India and Pakistan  did  not join with us in opening up their markets to a greater  extent. They want to benefit from the advantages without  accepting the discipline.    [PARIS MATCH] Is the United States not the clearest winner  out of GATT?    [Longuet] No, the clearest winner is Europe! Admittedly, the  United States is more powerful in economic terms. They wielded  a very large stick which enabled them to have their way. From  now on, the stick will be more in the hands of the future WTO,  which will become the policeman of world trade.    [PARIS MATCH] The French foreign trade surplus in 1993 (89  billion francs) is vast. Will that performance be repeated in  1994?    [Longuet] Our surpluses will not be as large in 1994. As our  economy improves, companies will invest in new equipment, some  of which we shall purchase from abroad. This will further  reduce our trade surpluses, but, at the same time, our companies  will continue to conquer new markets. Consequently, we will  again achieve a significant surplus in 1994.    [PARIS MATCH] Changing the subject, as president of the  Republican Party, were you happy with the choice of Dominique  Baudis as the majority's top candidate for the upcoming European  elections?    [Longuet] We would have preferred to see Jean-Francois  Deniau  nominated, but now we have Dominique Baudis. Since he was  designated, he will be our candidate. We shall support him  loyally so that the RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-Union for  French Democracy] union scores the best possible result in the  European elections.    [PARIS MATCH] That hardly sounds enthusiastic.    [Longuet] It is support without any reservations....  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A shoot-out in an El Toro jewelry store left the owner wounded as four bandits  escaped in the latest in a series of "smash-and-grab" robberies in the  Southland. Bob Gossett, the owner of Gossett Jewelers, was shot once in the  shoulder after three men and a woman -- armed with a handgun, hammers, tire  irons and crowbars -- entered his store, Orange County sheriff's officials  said. "They started to smash the (display) cases, and the owner came out with a  handgun," Lt. Richard J. Olson said. "A gunfight ensued, and the owner got hit  and went down." It appeared that none of the robbers were injured.  </P></p>

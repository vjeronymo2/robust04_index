			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (1): Battle for recovery - At least 3.5m people will flock to Cornwall this year to enjoy some of Britain's finest scenery. But behind the jollity of its famous cream teas, the Duchy is fighting hard to recover from the collapse of some of its oldest industries, writes Anthony Moreton IT IS one of the great certainties of the British summer that once more the holidaymakers will flock down the M 5 motorway this year into Cornwall. The duchy, with its incomparable beaches, magnificent surf, cream teas and warm weather, is just about everything the average holidaymaker wants from the annual break. Two fine hot summers in succession have brought back the attractions of British resorts generally and Cornwall confidently expects a bumper time especially following the Gulf war, the collapse of companies catering for the Costas trade and the rise in package-holiday prices. Some 3.5m people visit Cornwall every year and the indications are this number will be topped before autumn arrives and the deck chairs are stacked away, the last ice-cream consumed, the oars put away on the boats taking trippers around the bay. What few of the trippers will see, though, is a county in transition, one that has been badly affected economically and searching, not without success, for a more diversified economy. 'Cornwall has been hard hit by the recession,' says Mr John Caff, director of the Devon and Cornwall Development Company. 'A broad and realistic consensus of what can be done and what needs to be done is now essential if it is to realise its potential.' Mr John Rees-Evans, the county's economic planning officer, goes a stage further. 'Cornwall continues to be biased towards the primary industries and tourism but there is a very positive trend towards a more balanced economy,' he states. 'Growth is coming from manufacturing and financial services.' The two agree that reducing dependence on traditional industries such as tin mining, fishing, agriculture and engineering will be made easier by the increased emphasis being placed on what Mr Caff calls the 'quality of life' factor. 'Until the late 1980s,' says Mr Rees-Evans, 'industry was all about the company. Now it is increasingly about where that company exists. This is where Cornwall will score because the quality of life here is far superior to that in most of the rest of Britain. This will allow us to attract the new companies that want a clean environment and a good workforce.' And Mr John Berry, managing director of the Cornwall Enterprise Board, adds that the county is 'a serious place from which to do business. It's as cheap to export from here in small parcels as anywhere else in the country.' Cornwall's economy is characterised by small firms, low pay, high unemployment and, because of its dependence on tourism, a seasonal nature to the work available. Unemployment is significantly higher than in the rest of the UK. In January, the figure was 10 per cent against a British average of 6.7 per cent and 6.1 per cent for the south west as a whole. The figure has been sustained by closures in the Camborne-Redruth area which have turned this part of the county into a black spot, by ECC International cutting its job force in St Austell by 750 and several smaller job losses. The nearby Saltash area, too, has been affected by the run-down in numbers in Devonport dockyard. Some 90 per cent of the businesses in the duchy employ fewer than 25 people, the sort of concern that Mr Richard Goldring of English Estates describes as being in the forefront of the recession. Between 1984 and 1987, the last year for which figures are available, the numbers in agriculture and fishing dropped by 6.2 per cent, in mining by 33.7 per cent and in construction by 8.4 per cent, all significantly above the national average. Mr Rees-Evans believes the trends contained within these figures have continued. According to the 1990 New Earnings Survey from the Department of Employment, men's wages in Cornwall averaged Pounds 241.90 a week last year, 81.8 per cent of the British average and 87.2 per cent of that of the south west generally. Earnings for women, at Pounds 166.80 a week, showed a similar discrepancy and the earnings figures were the lowest for any county in Britain. These bleak figures, though, do not show the way in which Cornwall has been adapting. If tin mining has disappeared, there remains a buoyant china clay industry. Fishing is producing a good income for its skippers and crew and the efforts to diversify the economy have been successful. Banking, finance and insurance as a sector grew by 24.6 per cent between 1984 and 1987 against a national average of 16 per cent and others to outperform the British figure were distribution, tourism, transport, printing, communications and 'other manufacturing and services', which includes the food industry. Newquay Steam Beer, Ginsters' Cornish pasties and Rodda's ice cream have won national markets. 'We have been able to attract new companies,' says CEDO's Mr John Rees-Evans, 'through having a good workforce, a pool of trainable labour and low absenteeism rates.' The county also has a growing population. Numbers rose throughout the 1980s and look set to continue to do so, despite the falling school rolls, until the next century. The present population of 450,000 is expected to grow to 500,000 by the year 2001 and a decade later it could be up to 650,000. Unlike counties such as Dorset or Sussex, and despite popular misconceptions, this growth is not coming from pensioners looking to move into the county at the end of their working lives. The growth is coming from economically mobile and active people who want to live and work in a clean environment. Between 1981 and 1989 there was a net increase of 34,000 jobs to absorb the growing population and Mr Rees Evans says between 1984 and 1987 'we were, and we believe we continue to be, more successful than the rest of the country in creating jobs in manufacturing. We boosted employment in this area by 3.4 per cent at a time when Britain, climbing out of the depression, dropped by 4.7 per cent. We are having to create around 3,000 net new jobs a year just to meet population growth.' If Cornwall is to take full advantage of this growth then it needs to improve its infrastructure. The word 'infrastructure' normally conjures up thoughts of roads and while improvements are necessary it is equally important to update water supply, sewage treatment and disposal, recycling facilities and development sites. Roads, though, are crucial. Cornwall is one of the few English counties without an inch of motorway. Its most important spine road, the A 30, will have dual carriageway by the mid-1990s but, as Mr Graham Lovering, managing director of ECC International, points out, one vital road is not sufficient. 'Roads into and out of the county have improved enormously', he says. 'But there are still too many businesses within the county that have to use what are little more than country lanes to get their goods to market. Taking clay from our 35 pits in the county, and we produce 3m tons a year, to port in Fowey or Par means travelling along narrow, country roads. It would help enormously if these were upgraded, too.' Other links are important. British Rail has just brought forward the last train of the day from Paddington into Cornwall and there is resentment that most of the fast services end in Plymouth. There is concern that Brymon Airways' flights from Newquay might be squeezed out of London's Heathrow. Greater use of Falmouth as a port would be welcomed - though here introduction of a Ro-Ro facility is a possibility. To minimise the economic disadvantages of distance from markets Cornwall has joined the Atlantic Arc, a grouping of areas on the geographical perimeter of the European Community. Cornwall College and the county's chamber of industry have established links with mainland Europe and tourism links have been encouraged with Brittany, northern Spain, Portugal and southern Ireland. Two weeks ago, work began on converting an old gasworks in St Ives into an outpost of London's Tate gallery. St Ives, with its incomparable bay, was the home of Barbara Hepworth and a host of other artists and the gallery will contain 80 of the Tate's collection of 300 works by the St Ives school. The Pounds 2.75m project is among a number of new investments within the vitally-important tourism sector. Mr Peter de Savary's Land's End project and housing schemes at Falmouth and Hayle may have caught the eye but just as important has been the golf-course-and-housing development at St Mellion and hotel improvements at St Martin's on the Scilly Isles, Talland Bay, between Looe and Polperro, and St Keyne. Cornwall may be looking to new niche industries to transform its industrial economy but it is not ignoring those activities which, however unquantifiable, have added immeasurably to the richness of its character.</p>

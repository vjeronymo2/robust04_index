			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium in cars 'to double' ALUMINIUM USAGE by the car industry can be expected to more than double, from 2.4m tonnes in 1990 to 5.7m tonnes by 2006, according to the Commodities Research Unit consultancy organisation. Shipments of new or primary aluminium will rise at an even faster rate, from 770,000 tonnes to 2.8m tonnes, because of the development of 'all-aluminium' or 'aluminium-intensive' vehicles, it suggests in a new study. Some of the necessary aluminium smelting capacity is already in place but this market alone will call for five or six new smelters by 2006, the CRU points out. The trend will also increase demand for secondary (scrap) aluminium, put upward pressure on the price and increase the importance of the London Metal Exchange's new aluminium alloy contract, which can be used by manufacturers for hedging against price fluctuations. The CRU made a detailed, component by component analysis, and says that the increased use of aluminium will be mainly at the expense of steel and cast iron because the switch 'will be driven by the need to reduce the weight of cars and improve their fuel economy'. By 2006 the aluminium content of an average European car will have risen from 55 kg in 1990 to 98 kg. Usage in Japan and the US will almost double, says the CRU. Aluminium's relatively high price compared with that for steel will mean that it will be used most intensively in luxury cars, where buyers can afford to pay for it, and, later in this decade, in electric cars where weight savings will be essential. The study forecasts a growing use of aluminium 'space frames,' (skeleton-like car bodies) and aluminium hang-on and structural panels. But it sounds a note of caution about investment in aluminium rolling mills specifically for the car market. The CRU expects that improvements in plastics recyclability and recycling systems within the 15-year period, will enable plastic body panels to become highly competitive in non-load bearing applications and 'the window of growth for aluminium body panels will probably then be closed'. The study assumes a 1.8 per cent annual growth rate in car production and no further oil price shocks. 'Any sharp rise in the oil price, or much more stringent legislation on fuel economy in the US and elsewhere, would considerably increase future demand for aluminium from the car industry,' it concludes.

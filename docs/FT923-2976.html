			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Bloodied, but not too bowed THE BUNDESBANK has given virtually the smallest possible interest rate cut in return for devaluation of the lira. Unless soon followed by more, such a cut is unlikely to make the fate of other participants in the ERM significantly easier. Nor is it likely to do much for the German economy. Yet this cut is being hailed, and condemned, as a sign of rot in the Bundesbank. For that reason, further German interest rate cuts are, in the absence of another foreign exchange crisis, likely to be postponed. The quarter-point cut in the Lombard rate and half-point cut in the discount rate may be the last for a long time. Those who do view the bargain as showing that the Bundesbank is crumbling are right only up to a point. The Bundesbank has re-established a principle it has always believed in - that the ERM allows for exchange rate adjustment. Only the lira was shaken off this time, but the game is not yet over, however many times British officials may state that the chances of a sterling devaluation are zero. In any case, the notion that the Bundesbank is entirely independent of politics is a fantasy. A political decision put the D-Mark in the European Monetary System; political pressure forced the Bundesbank to cut the discount rate to its all time low of 2 1/2 per cent soon after the stock market collapse of October 1987; politicians decided the terms of German monetary union and may, depending on the fate of the Maastricht treaty, consign the D-Mark to oblivion. Appearances matter Exchange rate policy is the Achilles heel of an independent central bank. That has always been true for the Bundesbank, just as it would be true for a European central bank. Anything, certainly a small interest rate cut, had to be better than continuation of intervention which had already cost the Bundesbank DM24bn (Pounds 8.5bn) last week. As the Bundesbank's chief economist, Mr Otmar Issing, remarked yesterday, 'you can forget all about things like M3 (broad money) if a situation such as we had last week were to continue. We are much better off now than we were last Thursday.' Domestic economic circumstances could also be called in aid. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's doughty president, insists that the Germany economy is not in recession, but it is far from blooming. The collapse of the east German economy makes prolonged stagnation unacceptable. Yet even if there are good reasons for these decisions, appearances matter too. The Bundesbank appears to have bowed to political pressure and not even from domestic politicians, but from France, the UK and Italy. Its dented image will make the Bundesbank even more determined to nurture the credibility it retains. Question of time It may take either another currency crisis or a steep decline in German monetary growth to persuade the Bundesbank to lower interest rates again. German interest rates may have passed their peak. But they are likely to be cut slowly, leaving German short term interest rates rate close to their all time highs for quite a while. The question now is for how long the ERM will stay out of the crisis zone. Sterling managed a 2 1/2 pfennig gain on the day, helped by the soaring dollar, but it is in the firing line. Ultimately, its fate will be decided by whether the present parity seems compatible with recovery. If the prospect remains remote, a downward spiral of credibility could force a larger yield gap over the D-Mark, further undermining chances of recovery. More imminent still is the French referendum. A No vote is bound to encourage speculators, especially after the huge gains that have been made in speculation against the lira. But a marginal Yes might not settle the matter. The prospect of a long, doubtful and controversial journey to economic and monetary union would hardly ensure the stability of the ERM. The Bundesbank has been seen to blink. That is bound to be costly to its credibility. But the Bundesbank will not pay the price alone. Other Europeans will pay too, as it struggles to restore what has been weakened in recent years - its reputation for preserving the value of German money. Governments have also blinked. With the ERM adjustable once more, lira devaluation is not the end of the excitement in the European currency markets.</p>

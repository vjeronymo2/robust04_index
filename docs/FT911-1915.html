			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Scots see no sign of upturn SCOTLAND'S economy may have passed the moment of steepest decline in the current recession. That is the view of the latest quarterly survey conducted by chambers of commerce throughout Scotland and interpreted by the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University. It adds that there is no sign of an upturn, and shows a continuing downward trend in orders and sales in all sectors except for wholesale distribution. The survey says demand for manufactured goods in England is depressed, but that export markets are holding up better. It speaks of a relative improvement in general business optimism, though levels are still low. The improvement is attributed to the ending of the Gulf war and the fall in interest rates, and is not matched by companies' reported sales and orders. Much of the increased optimism is reported in Glasgow, but the Aberdeen area shows the greatest buoyancy thanks to the oil industry's strength.</p>

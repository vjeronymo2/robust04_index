			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Move against lawmakers fails Taiwan's first vote to eject lawmakers failed yesterday, thanks to low turnout. Only 18 per cent of the 2m eligible voters in Taipei county went to the polls in an attempt to oust four lawmakers from the ruling Kuomintang for their support of a controversial nuclear power plant which the state-owned Taiwan Power Company plans to build. The leading opposition Democratic Progressive party, which controls the county, also invited voters to cast their ballot in a referendum on whether the country's fourth nuclear facility should be sited in Taipei county. But Taiwan's Central Election Commission, which supervises polls, has ruled the vote not legally binding as a law governing referendums has yet to be enacted. The poor turnout could reflect badly on the DPP ahead of municipal and provincial elections to be held next Saturday, as opponents are likely to accuse the DPP of wasting taxpayers' money.</p>

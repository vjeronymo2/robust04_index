			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Futures lead a good recovery in the blue chips - Market Report A recovery in government bond prices yesterday, encouraged by better inflations news on both sides of the Atlantic, helped UK equities recoup a good part of the losses of the previous session. However, blue chip share prices were influenced by pressures linked to the expiry this morning of the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100-share Index. Today also brings similar futures expiries in New York and Frankfurt and equity strategists were wary of reading too much into trends in stock markets yesterday. An early advance in the Footsie was trimmed at one time as investors took aboard the news of an unexpected fall of 0.3 per cent in August retail sales in the UK. This was good news for bond prices, however, and at the same time failed to upset shares in the leading store groups. The Bundesbank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged was no surprise to the London markets and had little effect on government bonds. Gains were extended steadily as bonds moved higher, and the final reading of 3,112.7 gave the FT-SE 100 a net gain of 32.9. The recapture of the 3,100 mark was clearly led by the futures market; the September contract must stand in line with the underlying Footsie reading at the futures expiry just after 10.00 this morning. Shares received a further boost in the afternoon when Wall Street put on 14 Dow points in its early response to a sharp fall in the pricing content of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's diffusion index. The Philadelphia Bank ascribed the fall to lower prices for oil and other raw materials, factors known to rate high on the Federal Reserve's list of inflation pointers. This indication of reduced pressures for a further tightening in credit policy boosted global investment sentiment. The Footsie was helped by strength in the leading oil issues as Shell Transport increased the dividend payout and analysts responded very favourably to a briefing by the directors of British Petroleum. The recovery spread across the broad range of the stock market, taking the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by 20.5 to 3,648.9; however, on Wednesday, this index lost 50 points as second line issues were marked lower in the wake of the drop by the blue chip sector. Trading volume, as recorded by the Seaq electronic system, picked up to 589.9m shares, but was still unexciting by recent standards. Non-Footsie stocks made up a fairly high portion, around 60 per cent, of total business. On Wednesday, when the Footsie plunged 41.6 following an unexpected gain in the headline rate of domestic inflation, retail business in equities was worth only Pounds 1.24bn, suggesting that selling had been modest. Retail stocks closed higher on the day as many non-City economists suggested that the equity market had overreacted to the modest dip in the retail price index announced in the previous session. Sentiment was not upset by new comments on competitive pressures in the food industry from United Biscuits. Bank shares also staged a successful rally from the previous day's losses, although traders admitted that the outlook for domestic interest rates had not changed overnight. Market analysts still divide into two camps - those who believe that this week's half-point rise in base rates will soon be followed by a further increase as economic recovery strengthens, and those who maintain that rates will not need to rise again this year. Fund managers are beginning to position their portfolios ahead of the closing of investment books on the third quarter of the year. This implies a greater focus on minor adjustments to portfolio weightings rather than on new investment directions, according to traders.</p>

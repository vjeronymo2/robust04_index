			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen weakens on agency report THE YEN enjoyed a modest advance against the dollar at the start of European trading yesterday, but later fell back on reports that the Bank of Japan would cut its discount rate today by 75 basis points, writes James Blitz. The Japanese currency has appreciated against the dollar in recent days amid suspicions that the US administration has been disappointed by the Japanese fiscal stimulus announced last week. Although the headline figure for the package of more than 6 trillion yen was a little larger than had been expected, dealers have been concerned by the lack of tax-cutting measures in the proposals. That sentiment would partly explain why the yen appreciated against the dollar at the start of European trading yesterday, rising from an opening of Y104.50 to a high of Y103.80. Today's move on the official discount rate (ODR) will be critical for determining the near-term course of the dollar/yen exchange rate. A cut in the ODR by 50 basis points, to 2 per cent, has been fully priced in by the market, and is unlikely to have much impact on the yen. But Japanese news agency Jiji press excited dealers in currency and fixed interest markets yesterday by saying that the ODR could be reduced by 75 basis points at today's meeting of the Bank of Japan, to a post-war low of 1.75 per cent. The press report triggered an immediate rise in the value of the dollar, which closed at Y104.25. It finished in New York at Y104.65. 'A 75 basis-point cut could be the thing that stops the US criticising the economic package at this week's meetings with the Japanese,' said Mr Mike Gallagher of IDEA, the financial market consultants. 'Anything less would force the US to make it clear that the overall package has been insufficient.' The dollar was a little firmer against the D-Mark. Some dealers sold the German currency in the wake of the local election results in Hamburg, which saw all three of Germany's main political parties suffering heavy losses. The D-Mark may also have come under pressure from expectations that the latest figure for German M3 money supply growth, due this week, will be a great deal lower than expected. At the end of last week, there were strong expectations that the figure could fall into the Bundesbank's target range for annualised M3, of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent. Those expectations have faded a little. But some dealers were still wondering yesterday whether the Bundesbank would introduce a variable rate repo in this week's money market operations for the first time since the latest crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. The dollar peaked at DM1.6215 from a previous DM1.6095. It later fell back on fears that central banks would sell dollars for D-Marks and closed at DM1.6125. Sterling held at DM2.4700. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6100.</p>

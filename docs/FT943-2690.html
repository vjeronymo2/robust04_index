			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (3): It's the services that make them different - Private banking / The emphasis is on financial planning, rather than current accounts Within the UK, the term 'private banking' conjures up images of smart cheques rather than 'smart' cards; discreet offices in Knightsbridge not the high street; and the bank manager as old family retainer. The reality is both less entertaining and more useful. The emphasis is on financial planning rather than forelock-tugging. And despite the term, the service provided by a private bank may not involve basic banking facilities at all. Even those private banks that offer a current account and cheque-book admit that there is only a limited amount of extra service they can bring to a relatively straightforward account. James Cooper is head of private banking at the Lloyds Bank group, which is among the banks offering a current account and the use of a branch network. 'We look at the whole financial situation. The core is investment, not the current account,' he explains. At Coutts - a long-established name in private banking, which is now part of National Westminster Bank - Michael Maslinski, head of business development, says that most of its personal customers do have a cheque account. The service is more expensive than for a current account at an ordinary high street bank, with free banking only if your average credit is at least Pounds 3,000. 'If somebody never has any cause to phone their bank, and simply has a salary going into an account and about six standing orders coming out, the amount of added value must be questionable,' Maslinski says. There must be some demand among private banking clients for this facility, or else Hill Samuel would not be thinking of extending its service to include cash dispensers run by the TSB, of which it is a part. But there is, of course, no need to go to a private bank if you want a basic current account. There is some evidence that high street banks are trying to provide better services to all their customers. It is also clear that they are trying to improve their relationships with high net worth individuals - if only to be in a better position to sell other financial products. So if you are the sort of person who might be a private banking client, you are also the sort of customer that high street banks desperately want to please. The question then is whether you believe there is much to be gained from the more personalised service that a private banking arm would give you, especially if you feel that decision-taking in the high street branch is increasingly being centralised. Beyond the current account lies the bulk of private banking services. According to Paul Cattermull, head of Hill Samuel private banking, these fall into five broad categories: other banking facilities; investment management and stockbroking; accountancy and tax; legal advice; and financial planning. Private banks themselves are divided about why a customer should go to them for these services rather than to the range of other professionals queueing up to advise the wealthy. Some argue that, quite apart from providing a good quality of service, they are also able uniquely to offer the convenience of one-stop finance. They say that this avoids the risk of not getting consistent financial planning, and saves customers' time by enabling them to put their affairs in the hands of one set of advisers. 'The more you get to know customers' circumstances, the more you get to understand them better, and the better the ideas you come up with,' says Maslinski. Others, however, argue that customers who end up getting all their financial advice from one organisation may be getting advice in areas where the organisation does not have such specialist expertise. George Alford, head of private banking at Kleinwort Benson, is among those who are somewhat sceptical of the 'one-stop finance' line of argument. 'Lots of people have a deposit account they don't tell their main adviser about,' he says. 'The number of people who truly use only one adviser for everything is very small.' On investment management, there is more agreement. Although banks are reluctant to be tied down to a figure for the minimum investment that they will handle for a private client, there is general agreement that it does not make much sense to have managed services for less than Pounds 75,000, and some would put the floor on investments at around Pounds 100,000. Charges for investment management are likely to be within the 0.75 per cent to 1.5 per cent range. They may be negotiable, but this is not a part of the market which is very price-sensitive. Insofar as price is important, it is more likely to come through in private banks making sure they provide added value, rather than cutting their costs. Below those amounts, a private bank would offer unit or investment trusts - either their own, in the case of Kleinwort Benson, for example, or on the basis of independent advice. So leaving aside the argument about using only a single source of advice, where is the advantage in private banking over getting advice from a good independent financial adviser? The banks themselves underline two elements in particular. The first is the international dimension. This can make them particularly well-suited in areas such as handling complex currency transactions, identifying opportunities in overseas markets, and arranging affairs for people moving to the UK from elsewhere. The other aspect that they all emphasise is continuity of the bond with the customer. 'We're selling relationships, not products,' says Cooper. So if you're thinking of choosing a private bank, along with questions about investment performance, charging structures, and the range of services available, it may well be worth also asking about staff turnover.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): Post script RUN YOUR eye over the five-year performance figures. They are terrible. Many people claim that the problems of the unit trust industry are attributable to poor marketing. There may be something in this, but its current success in selling unit trust Peps suggests otherwise. Unit trusts' biggest problem, judging by these figures, is the underlying performance of their product. If any performance figures are quoted in marketing material these must, under Lautro rules, include five-year performance. Over the past year, this has become a heavy millstone around the industry's neck. This is because a bull market peaked in July 1987, to be followed by a precipitate share price collapse on Black Monday in October. Five years is now the least flattering period which could possibly be chosen. The scepticism of financial laymen towards the stock market is understandable. It seems like sophistry indeed to argue that one should put money into unit trusts when the average UK General unit trust can manage only 7.9 per cent growth over five years - with income reinvested. To cap that, the UK Growth sector seems ironically named, as it shows an average loss of 3 per cent. Income funds, helped by the assumption that they reinvest yields generally in excess of 5 per cent, still only averaged a 7 per cent increase. A current account could beat these figures. And investment trusts are scarcely any better. Over five years, the average UK General trust has increased by only 10.5 per cent, while UK Capital Growth trusts logged a decline of almost 10 per cent. In both sets of tables, the 10-year figures (available for investment trusts for the first time in this Review) tell a different story. These figures exceed anything a building society could offer. While the averages are quite adequate, some performances are astonishing - for example, Pounds 1,000 invested in Capability Special Situations unit trust in 1982 would have grown to Pounds 8,397. No past performance was in any way a perfect guide to the future - but which, out of the five- and ten-year figures, does a better job? The circumstances of the 1985 bull market and the ensuing crash seem wholly exceptional - if five-year equity market figures were ever as bad as this again, the world economy would be in dire trouble. But can the outperformance of the early 1980s be repeated? Many now believe that the exchange rate mechanism will ensure lower yields and interest rates for the next decade. This does not mean abandoning equities altogether, but it helps to explain the concentration, in this issue of Review, on fixed-interest investments. The real challenge for unit trust managers will come in October, when Black Monday passes out of the five-year figures. Then, at last, their marketeers will have a product the public may want to buy.</p>

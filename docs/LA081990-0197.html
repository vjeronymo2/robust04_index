			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WHAT AM I DOING HERE BY BRUCE CHATWIN (PENGUIN: $9.95)  </P> <P> The last book by the author of "In Patagonia" and "The Songlines" is a  collection of miscellaneous short pieces. Bruce Chatwin's profiles have a  vitality that conveys the personality of the subjects, particularly the  interview with the aged Madeleine Vionnet.  </P> <P> But the essays on the visual arts lack the spontaneous ease of his other  writing; Chatwin seems unsure of himself and nervously documents every  assertion he makes. The sections on travel showcase the writer at his best,  capturing the essence of a family dinner in Yunan or life in a small village in  Tibet (where he investigates the rumors of Yeti) in a few well-chosen words. A  trip down the Volga with a group of German veterans culminates at Stalingrad,  with the lugubrious spectacle of former enemies mourning their dead. Chatwin  died in 1989 at age 47, of a rare disease he contracted in Asia, and the art of  travel writing is the poorer for his passing.  </P></p>

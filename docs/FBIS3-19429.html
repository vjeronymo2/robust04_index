Another single item that strongly affects the  bottom line of the Credit Guaranty Agency is the annual payment  pertaining to the settlement of Wartsila Meriteollisuus.    The export recovery increased the demand for the agency's  services by more than 25 percent. The agency's total guaranty  commitment for last year was FMk53 billion, of which the export  guaranties' share was 86 percent.    The objective of the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency  has  been defined as the promotion of exports and strengthening the  operating conditions of small and medium-size industry. The  tools available to the agency to further these goals are export  guaranties and state guaranties, which can be granted to  businesses and financiers.  <H5>  Credit Guaranty Payments -- 145 Million </H5>   Compensation received from state guaranties and export  guaranties amounted to FMk145 million. Based on these, the  Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency paid FMk206 million in  compensation. This was FMk72 million less than in 1992. The  guaranties issued for trade with the former USSR resulted in  compensation payments of FMk536 million.    On the other hand, last year the compensation transfers  involving Wartsila Meriteollisuus showed in the books of the  Credit Guaranty Agency as a revenue of FMk65 million, which was  unusual. The outstanding amounts have been factored, and during  the legal proceedings, part of the compensation paid was  returned.    This spring the Credit Guaranty Agency will close its books  on an accrual basis, and the outstanding debts will be estimated  in the same manner as insurance companies do when they close  their books. This is expected to provide a clearer picture of  the agency's cash flow than the currently used cash-based  accounting system.  <H5>  3 Billion Total Liabilities </H5>   At the beginning of last year, the total liability for trade  with the USSR was less than FMk3 billion, which had accrued  during the 1980's as a result of long-term financing. The Credit  Guaranty Agency submits payments for interest and principal to  the banks as they become due .    The loans will later be collected from Russia, in a manner  which will be determined by the international conference of  creditors or the so-called Paris Club.    The Paris Club is planning to extend long-term credit and  low  interest rates for trade with the East. Due to the fact that the  procedures for collecting these debts have still not been set in  place, it has not been possible to carry them forward.    According to Matti Vuoria, section head and chair of the  board of directors for the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency,  there is also great demand for new guaranties for trade with  Russia, "but the decisions must wait until the creditor  countries have made their final decision regarding debt  consolidation."    According to CEO Ilkka Niemi, the Credit Guaranty Agency's  opportunities to conduct business are not dependent upon the  methods of collecting outstanding debts, which are accrued from  trade with the East. At the beginning of the current year, the  book risk ceiling of export guaranties was increased to FMk45  billion. According to Niemi, this allows for FMk70 billion in  trade guaranties. Also, according to Niemi, disregarding the  credits issued for the trade with the former USSR and the  commitments to Wartsila Meriteollisuus' incidental traffic, the  profits generated by the Credit Guaranty Agency are on a good  international level. Balancing the approximately FMk200 million  in other compensation are FMk145 million of guaranty payments.    During the year, the metal industry has greatly increased  its  share of export guaranties, and its share of all guaranties is  now 65 percent. The strongest growth for export guaranties was  to the Far East, where China is rapidly becoming the largest  target for export guaranties.  <H5>  Slight Decrease in Estonia's Risk Level </H5>   So far, guaranties have not been issued to Baltic states,  which were formerly part of the USSR. However, the agency's  board of directors decided last Thursday [10 February] to adjust  Estonia's risk rating to the extent that short-term letters of  credit could be guaranteed.    According to Ilkka Niemi, small and medium-size businesses  are beginning to learn how to utilize various forms of state  guaranties. Starting last July, the Credit Guaranty Agency began  issuing special debt consolidation credits to businesses that  are in debt but considered viable. The agency has received  consolidation applications valued at FMk1.3 billion in credits.  <H5>  Banks Eager To Transfer Risk </H5>   Banks have shown an eagerness to transfer risks for  individual companies to the Credit Guaranty Agency. In  connection with debt consolidation guaranties, the commercial  bank maintains half of the risk, and counterguaranties are  divided the same way.    Last year, small and medium-size businesses received  financing guaranties that amounted to a total of FMk917 million.</p>

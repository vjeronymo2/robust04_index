			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR A WIDER DEBATE ON WELFARE STATE;  </P> <P> REAGAN COULD STIMULATE AN EXAMINATION OF THE POVERTY TRAP  </P> <P> The best of Ronald Reagan may be yet to come. He wants to break new ground in  defining the role of a former President. In that new role he may be able to  make a contribution as great as any he has made as President.  </P> <P> With a new career on the "mashed potato circuit" Reagan wants to "fight for the  principles in which I believe." He hopes to stimulate a "great debate" focused  on the need to "help America find a way out of the trap of the welfare state."  "Twenty years ago" says the former President, "the government declared war on  poverty and poverty won." "Too many people became dependent on government  payments and lost the moral strength that has always given the poor the  determination to climb America's ladder of opportunity."  </P> <P> With 32.5 million Americans in poverty, with more than 20% of our children  living in poverty, the former President is certainly right to call our  attention to "poverty and the welfare state." Let's consider some of the  questions that a debate should include.  </P> <P>  -- With sustained economic growth over the last six years, why is the poverty  rate now higher than in any year in the 1970s. The average poverty rate during  the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations was 11.9%. Why has the poverty rate  averaged 14.2% over the last eight years? Why has the increase in poverty  rates, for all families including black families, occurred among both  married-couple families and female-headed families? Why has the poverty rate  for the black elderly risen from 31% to 33.9% and for the Latino elderly from  22.5% to 27.4% over this last year when the poverty rate for white elderly has  declined?  </P> <P>  -- Are the welfare programs that are intended to aid the poor a major cause of  the poverty they are intended to relieve? More than 20% of all American  children live in poverty. The welfare program intended to assist poor children  and their families is called Aid To Families With Dependent Children (AFDC).  Given the low cash benefits provided, that program removes only 3% of poor  children from poverty. It is difficult to imagine a less successful  anti-poverty program. Yet, indignation about the growing impoverishment of the  nation's children is hardly detectable in the criticism one hears about  welfare. Are we more offended by the "dependency" of families who rely on  government than we are by their "poverty"? In 1986, 52 of every 100 poor  children received an AFDC benefit. In 1979, 72 of every 100 poor children  received such aid. Those offended by "dependency" will find "progress" in these  numbers. Those offended by unrelieved poverty will see these same numbers as a  serious deterioration in social responsibility.  </P> <P> We need a great debate to consider which is the greater evil, the unrelieved  poverty of our children or their reliance upon government for assistance.  </P> <P>  -- There is a growing consensus among liberals and conservatives that the  current welfare system is inadequate. That consensus was apparent in the recent  enactment of welfare-reform legislation by Congress with the support of the  President. The new law speaks of getting people to work, of promoting  self-reliance and independence through education, training, child care. Are we  really prepared to go beyond criticism to genuine welfare reform? Or, are we  satisfied to criticize what exists so we can cut budgets while avoiding real  change because it costs too much, thus leaving the poor with criticism and  little else? If we examine what Congress and what the state of California have  done recently in the name of welfare reform the answer becomes evident. In both  cases, much is promised but very little is given. Education, training, child  care, transitional medical care, real work and independence from the dole  provide the imagery. With $3.35 billion federal dollars provided over a  five-year period we have $700 million per year to change welfare from a program  of hand-outs to a program that will promote independence and get people to  work. Who is kidding whom?  </P> <P> To imagine what $700 million per year will buy for the nation's welfare  recipients, it is useful to consider that in the implementation of California's  welfare-reform legislation Los Angeles County estimated the annual cost of  providing work-related education, training and social services to its AFDC  population at $200 million per year. Los Angeles has 3%-4% of nation's  population.  </P> <P>  -- Much has been made of the need to require people to leave welfare and to go  to work. The popular imagery is of a welfare system that "sucks people in, saps  their moral strength, and leaves them dependent and unmotivated." It is hard to  find that attitude when you talk to real people. In 1,046 random personal  interviews conducted by UCLA with AFDC recipients in Los Angeles County 85%  wanted to volunteer to participate in a program that would help them prepare  for and find work. With attacks from the political right on their dependency  and moral degeneracy and promises from the political left unsupported by  resources it is easy to wonder who is using welfare to cheat on whom.  </P> <P> We need a great debate on poverty and the welfare state. We need to understand  the cost to the nation of having 32.5 million of our citizens and 20% of our  children living in poverty. The cost of doing nothing is much more than zero  and when considered in the long run may exceed the cost of genuine reform.  Still it is difficult to focus our attention on what seems so complex and so  remote from our daily lives.  </P> <P> We need a charismatic leader, a great communicator, someone unfettered by  political ambition who can command public attention to what is surely one of  the most important and most actively avoided subjects in our public life.  </P> <P> We need a former president.  </P></p>

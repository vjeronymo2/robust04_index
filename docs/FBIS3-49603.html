			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Czech trade union and  employer groups met respectively yesterday, and reached  decidedly different judgments regarding the General Agreement  negotiated by the tripartite (composed of unions, employers, and  the government) in December. The collective of labor unions  expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement, while the employer  collective supported it.    (The General Agreement concerns work conditions and  relationships, wage issues, business conditions, employment, and  social policy, and is the basic instrument for maintaining  social peace.)    At yesterday's meeting of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of  Trade  Unions (CMKOS), labor representatives decided that they would  not sign the proposal for the General Agreement, calling it a  basically political declaration which did not guarantee the  fulfillment of unions' demands. The representatives suggested  that their social partners in the tripartite (that is, the  government and employers) were positioning themselves against  the spirit of the prepared agreement.    The CMKOS Board recommended that the union representatives  negotiate the agreement further, and also drafted a letter with  concrete suggestions to be sent to Finance Minister Ivan  Kocarnik, the government's tripartite representative, and to  employers.    However, employers also assembled yesterday at a meeting of  the Confederation of Employer and Entrepreneurial Unions, and  expressed a willingness to ratify the agreement.    The employers had obtained a request from labor unions, said  confederation president Jan Fencl, for guarantees protecting  real wages and their growth, and also for a renegotiation of the  collective agreement. But according to Fencl, employers cannot  guarantee real wages because their feasibility depends on the  progress of economic reform, the development of the  entrepreneurial environment, and the quality of employees' work.    A joint tripartite council had approved the General  Agreement  text on December 20, to be then approved by each individual  social partner. The government approved the agreement last week.</p>

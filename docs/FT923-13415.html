			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Stakis sells Aviemore leisure complex STAKIS, the hotel and healthcare group, has sold the Aviemore Centre, a leisure complex in the Scottish Highlands, to Berkeley de Veer, an unquoted investment company based in Sheffield. The sale is part of Stakis's disposal programme which is aimed at reducing its Pounds 200m debt and slimming the company to its core businesses of hotels, casinos and healthcare. The sale, the value of which is not disclosed, involves 100 acres in Aviemore and includes a conference centre, timeshare complex and development land. However, it does not include the Four Seasons and the Badenoch hotels which Stakis will continue to operate, as well as the Coylumbridge hotel three miles away. Stakis bought the Aviemore centre and the hotels from House of Fraser in 1986 for Pounds 800,000 and had plans to modernise the entire complex. But it never had the money to proceed with its plans. In May it was expected that Stakis would sell the Aviemore centre to Co-ordinated Land and Estates, the property company to which it has also entrusted the management and disposal of its commercial property portfolio.</p>

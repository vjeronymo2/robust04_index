			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: CHEAP AS THE SHOTS MIGHT BE, AT LEAST THE PRICE IS RIGHT  </P> <P> Deep thoughts, cheap shots and bon mots . . .  </P> <P>  At the official retirement ceremony of Oklahoma football Coach Barry Switzer,  will his former players honor him with a 21-handgun salute?  </P> <P> You knew that when Switzer announced his retirement, there would be those who  would portray him as a courageous martyr to the flawed and antiquated National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. system. If you knew that, you probably also knew that  the first person to portray Switzer that way would be Switzer.  </P> <P> He says he was frustrated by NCAA rules that do not "recognize the financial  needs of young athletes."  </P> <P> Judging from the behavior of many of Switzer's players, the NCAA rules also do  not recognize the sexual, automotive, pharmaceutical or ballistic needs of  young athletes.  </P> <P> In announcing his retirement, Switzer said, "I finally decided the time has  come for new leadership."  </P> <P> I agree with that statement, except that Barry should have left out the new.  </P> <P> Attention Dodger management:  </P> <P> You have a wonderful stadium, clean and pretty. You have a scoreboard that is a  delightful dinosaur in that it always displays the game's linescore, never  gives way to commercials, as does the annoying scoreboard in a nearby stadium  that I won't name because I wouldn't want to embarrass the Angels.  </P> <P> You also have a nice video screen-message board, on which you show us amusing  baseball blooper footage of players diving into grandstands and impaling  themselves on umbrella tips.  </P> <P> You even took my advice years ago and installed TV monitors over the concession  stands, to make more bearable those three-inning waits for nachos.  </P> <P> All you need to complete the package is a large board displaying  up-to-the-minute scores of other games. I know, you flash the scores on the  message board, but I'm always looking away and wind up having to ask five  people before I find one who saw the Giant-Astro score.  </P> <P> With the Dodgers in a title race, and many fans interested in the big baseball  picture, you really need an other-games scoreboard. For a state-of-the-art  example, you might want to check out Wrigley Field in Chicago, which installed  such a board about six decades ago.  </P> <P> Also, on the video screen, between innings, how about showing us videotape  highlights of other games being played that very night? Thank you, thank you so  much.  </P> <P> On the Detroit civic traitor scale, the only person higher up than a guy who  drives a foreign car would be a beloved local sports superstar who has an  endorsement deal with Toyota.  </P> <P> I'm speaking, of course, of Isiah Thomas. He signed with Toyota last year to  appear in their ads, explaining that he tried to sign with an American auto  company but was rejected. Many other Detroit sports figures do auto ads,  including Sparky Anderson and Chuck Daly, but for American cars.  </P> <P> One Detroiter expressed his disapproval with Isiah last year by dumping 20,000  Ford truck tires on Zeke's front lawn. The tires clashed with the landscaping,  so Thomas had them removed.  </P> <P> The day after the Pistons had won their recent championship, Toyota ran a  full-page ad in each Detroit newspaper, featuring an enormous photo of Isiah --  a congratulatory tribute from one king of the compacts to another.  </P> <P> A famous name in Laker history was in the news recently. It didn't rate big  headlines, except maybe in Milwaukee, but the Bucks elected not to renew the  contract of veteran guard Sidney Moncrief.  </P> <P> Sidney had a very nice 10-season career in Milwaukee, showing great leadership  and averaging as many as 22.5 points. But he is 31 years old and has been  plagued with injuries in recent seasons, so he will slip away, either to  another club or into retirement.  </P> <P> Moncrief has a special place in Laker lore. It is all but forgotten that the  Lakers, up first in the 1979 draft, weren't sure who to pick. Should they go  with Moncrief, a great-attitude young man from Arkansas, a truly beautiful and  high-flying off-guard type who would perfectly complement the Lakers' young  point guard, Norm Nixon?  </P> <P> Or should the Lakers go for a teen-age kid who had played only two seasons of  college ball, who had questionable National Basketball Assn. speed, jumping and  shooting ability, and whose ballhandling skills might well clash with those of  Nixon?  </P> <P> At least one high-ranking Laker executive held out for Moncrief. But Jack Kent  Cooke, in his last official duty as Laker owner, ordered his staff to draft  Earvin (Magic) Johnson.  </P> <P> It's really not a bit funny that some NBA writers covering the finals were  referring to the leg-injury-stricken Lakers' quick exit as "swoon over my  hammy."  </P></p>

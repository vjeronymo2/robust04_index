			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] on Thursday [17  February] rejected the Economic Ministry's proposal to build  direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait. The Economic  Ministry recently proposed that direct shipping links between  specific ports in special zones in Taiwan and Mainland China be  allowed, first to reduce transportation cost and time mainly for  mainland-bound shipping from Taiwan and vice versa. But in a  study report released Thursday, MAC said the cost of direct  shipping links between specified ports or cities across the  Strait is virtually the same as the cost of across-the-board  direct shipping links between Taiwan and the mainland. The  council argued that cross-Strait direct shipping links will be  most likely accompanied by several major problems. These  include Taiwan's greater reliance on Mainland China on the  economic and trade front, a more rampant smuggling of Mainland  Chinese products, and the illegal entry of mainlanders into  Taiwan.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TISCH ORDERS OVERHAUL OF CBS NEWS DIVISION;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: SOME SEE THE 'POOLING' OF TECHNICIANS, EXPECTED TO CUT OVERTIME  COSTS, AS A MOVE TO CENTRALIZE THE NEWS OPERATION.  </P> <P> CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A. Tisch has ordered a major restructuring of  CBS News that severely undercuts the authority of CBS News President David  Burke at a time when Burke has been trying to make up for ground lost during  years of upheaval at the news division.  </P> <P> The changes ordered by Tisch come when CBS is already reviewing its staffing  levels and may eliminate about 50 positions, many inside the news division, as  well as cut back on the use of free-lance producers and crews.  </P> <P> According to CBS sources, Tisch wants to put authority over hundreds of network  engineers into the hands of a corporate-level executive who could freely assign  them to the news, sports and entertainment divisions as needed rather than have  them work exclusively for a particular show or division, as currently is the  case.  </P> <P> Such a move, the reasoning goes, would save the network millions of dollars  annually by limiting overtime pay for technicians. Cameramen, for instance, can  and do earn over $100,000 a year because of overtime charges. The  reorganization is also intended to raise the productivity of engineers and  technicians by better scheduling their time.  </P> <P> The plan is not being greeted with open arms inside the news division because  CBS News producers believe that the skills of a news editor or a sports editor  -- to take one example of the positions affected -- are not necessarily  transferable. "What the newspeople are concerned about is some mega-event  breaking and their (cameramen) are all off shooting a soap opera," explained  one CBS official, who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Under the current system, each program such as "CBS Evening News with Dan  Rather" or "CBS This Morning," as well as sports broadcasts and daytime soap  operas, has its own crew of tape editors, audio engineers and control room  technicians who work solely for those shows or within their respective  divisions. The new system would create a "pool" of technicians who could be  dispatched to work on any particular program regardless of its division.  </P> <P> Programs such as "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours" are said to be exempt from the  plan because of special skills required of people who work on "long form" news  programs. Also, most of the technicians would continue to be associated with  specific programs to preserve the current system as much as possible, and job  cuts are expected to be made primarily through attrition.  </P> <P> Although Burke was brought aboard with a mandate to revitalize CBS News and  shut down damaging leaks to the press, his 30-month tenure nonetheless has been  plagued by setbacks. The flagship "CBS Evening News" program fell from first to  third in the ratings and "CBS This Morning" suffered heavy turnover among  producers and talent while continuing to languish in a distant last place.  </P> <P> Tisch's decision points up the growing frustration of Burke in running CBS  News. The former No. 2 executive at ABC News, Burke was accustomed to division  heads being given great latitude in management decisions and not being  overruled by corporate bosses. This has not been his experience at CBS, where,  for example, he recently had to reverse himself on "60 Minutes" commentator  Andy Rooney's suspension after a ratings dip in the program forced Burke to  reinstate Rooney.  </P> <P> More than simply a new policy on work rules, however, the technicians' pool is  aimed directly at what Tisch believes to be the unbending ways of CBS News:  that the division, despite repeated calls to adapt, has ignored changes in the  marketplace that make its way of doing business outdated.  </P> <P> Each of the three networks spends about $250 million annually to gather,  produce and broadcast news. But a revolution in technology over the past 10  years has made it possible for viewers to get most of the top stories of the  day before the evening network news programs come on the air.  </P> <P> Only technicians and engineers at CBS Broadcast Center in New York will be  affected by the plan. Crews in CBS News domestic and foreign bureaus routinely  work for a variety of programs.  </P> <P> Some old guard CBS News producers see Tisch's order to further "centralize" the  news operation as a refusal by him to acknowledge that the process of  collecting, editing and transmitting news is by nature difficult to plan  because it cannot take into account events like the upheaval in Eastern Europe,  which caused CBS News' budget to balloon last year.  </P> <P> "This is like electing a President because he says he's going to cut waste and  fraud in Washington," said a CBS News producer who did not want to be named.  "But Reagan left office with a record deficit, and this is really not any  different."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's </F> Liberal Democratic Party, by Vasko Gigov; place and date not  given: "The Main Thing Is To Change Bulgaria's Political  Leadership"]    [Text] [Gigov] What, according to you, is the state of  Bulgarian-Russian relations today?    [Zhirinovskiy] We think that Bulgaria must be a key country  in the Balkans and that Macedonia and Thrace could be ceded to  its territory. They are ancient Bulgarian lands. However, the  main thing for us is the fact that the country's political  leadership must be changed. Your current president, Zhelyu  Zhelev, is a figure of the transitional period, which is about  to end. The state leaderships of many East European countries  are being replaced, and I would like to see Mr. Svetoslav  Stoilov as your president. I think that this will also be  beneficial for Russia. Mr. Stoilov is a well-known economist  and our European consultant on all economic issues. Bulgaria  needs such a president in the new year. The process of  stabilizing relations throughout the entire Balkan peninsula  with the participation of Russia will begin only after he comes  to power. Then the violent actions and armed conflicts will  end. Naturally, the help of the UN Security Council  member-countries is necessary for this.    The status quo in Yugoslavia will be preserved and the  variant of a not very "rigid" federation on the territories of  former Yugoslavia is possible. The Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes  will remain in their places and refugees from various republics  will no longer be mixed. Thus, every possibility of armed  clashes will be eliminated.    I think that this confederation among the Balkan states  could  be expanded by the inclusion of Romania and Hungary, but no  state will have priority. Every nation has the right to live in  the Balkans and discrimination based on nationality or religion  is necessary. There have never been Muslims in the Balkans.  Whoever claims the opposite lies. Slavonic and Christian  peoples, predominantly belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church,  but also Catholics, lived here. The lie about the Muslim nation  is a pure game on the part of certain centers.    This all could be regulated and I think that the new Russian  parliament, the Duma, will support the Liberal Democratic Party  plan on peacefully and finally stopping the conflicts in the  Balkan peninsula. However, for the time being, the main thing  is to change Bulgaria's political leadership, and I think that  this will happen soon.    [Gigov] Does the Kuril Islands problem exist for you?  What do you think about the concerns of Poland and Finland with  your election success?    [Zhirinovskiy] All stories that, in my political program, I  threaten the sovereignty of Poland and Finland are lies. In the  past, many people said that the CPSU's [Communist Party of the  Soviet Union's] regime was almost criminal and had to be  eliminated. However, I, as a jurist, always claimed that I was  born under that regime, and I do not consider myself a criminal.  Generally, this was a normal state, but its leadership made  mistakes.    Even at that time, I said that if the West thinks that the  Russian regime is criminal and must be eliminated, then the  borders established by that criminal regime must also be  eliminated and returned to the situation before the October  Revolution. Now the Finns could ask: What about our  independence?    Look, we do not question at all the fact that Finland is now  a sovereign state. It was they that raised the issue. They  became scared. We do not talk about returning Finland to  Russia. We do not need this. Let Finland be. The same applies  to Poland.    The USSR is another matter. We think that, in the long run,  Russia's borders could be the borders of the former USSR, but  this could happen only if the relevant territories, which today  are viewed as independent, want this.    [Gigov] What do you think about the military blocs?    [Zhirinovskiy] We oppose them. If the Warsaw Pact was  dissolved, we think that NATO should also be dissolved as a  military bloc. However, it is very possible that the East  European peoples form an economic and cultural alliance with  Russia, similar to the European Community, without attributing  any military aspects to this alliance.    [Gigov] In certain countries you were described as a  fascist....    [Zhirinovskiy] Look, I want the entire Bulgarian people to  understand through you that our party has no relation to fascism  or communism. We are a moderate centrist party with a  liberal-democratic program. Now, in the former USSR and the  former republics, nationalism is the main ideological weapon,  and in certain regions anti-Russian emotions intensified.    We say that various nations should not be opposed to each  other, because we are against every discrimination.  Nevertheless, they try to slander us and say that we support  Russian nationalism. We say that Russia is the motherland for  all and that we oppose the idea of restoring the USSR and CIS.  We support the existence of a Russian state, a great Russia,  but as a motherland for all nations that live on its territory.  It is their common motherland as a geographical entity. And  what are they trying to do? They try to prove with their tales  that we are Russian nationalists, that we want a pure Russian  state, and so on.    We do not want this, and since they had no arguments to  oppose us, they decided to use lies. Lies became their  political weapon.    [Gigov] How do you think that the conflict in former  Yugoslavia will be resolved? Do you think that Mikhail  Gorbachev is responsible for this conflict?    [Zhirinovskiy] Gorbachev is the main culprit of everything  bad that happened in the USSR and East Europe, and which began  in April 1985. In December 1991, he himself understood that he  made a mistake and resigned. However, I think that the period  of transition in Russia and East Europe ended and that, soon,  new political leaderships will come to power in those countries.  Conditions of lasting peace and democracy for all, rather than  for a nation of a group of citizens, will finally be established  in the near future. The man is in the first place. He will be  even above the state.    [Gigov] What is the basic goal of your visit to Bulgaria?    [Zhirinovskiy] I assumed the commitment to lay a wreath at  the monument of the King-Liberator [Alexander II] of the Balkan  peoples, which is in Sofia's center. I will do it on 28  December at 1500 [1300 GMT], but prior to this, I would want a  military band of the Bulgarian Army to play a Slavonic march.  Afterward we will give a news conference for Bulgarian and  foreign reporters. I will not hide from them. I support the  free press and I am ready to talk to anyone, as I did in Germany  and Austria.    In addition, I will take the opportunity to meet certain  representatives of Bulgarian political parties.    The basic goal of my visit to several European countries is  to renew my business contacts and present our party's positions.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Former eastern bloc 'could pose food threat' Successful economic reforms in the former Soviet bloc could turn those countries into net food exporters and depress world food prices early in the next century, a report predicts today. 'If the policies that currently distort food markets are phased out, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union would shift from a net food deficit to a surplus of 30m to 50m tonnes of food per year,' says the report by the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute. The study says international grain prices could drop by up to 20 per cent as food from the former communist bloc enters the world market. Increased food production in eastern Europe could upset predictions of higher world prices resulting from the Uruguay Round world trade agreement to reduce subsidised exports by western European countries. Lower world prices would hurt both big exporting nations and poor farmers in developing countries, who would suffer if food imports become cheaper than domestic production, the report says. The institute carries out research into sustainable food production, improved incomes and nutrition, and better agricultural trading conditions for developing countries. 'The majority of the world's poor subsist on agriculture and agricultural-related activities in the rural areas of developing countries,' says the author, Mr Rod Tyers, an economics professor at the Australian National University. 'Cheaper food would decrease the level of economic activity from which they earn their living.' His report highlights the impact of the sharp decline in consumer demand for meat in the former Soviet bloc, which has led to a fall in the number of cattle and pigs and cut the amount of imported grain needed to feed them. 'This change alone has caused so substantial a reduction in net food imports, it could potentially reverse the direction of the whole region's net food trade,' it says. Eastern European nations are expected to be self-sufficient in food by 2000 on average, a sharp turnaround from the 1980s when the Soviet bloc was a net food importer. However, the report emphasises that the shift towards self-sufficiency and net exports of staple foods will take place only if collective farms are broken up into smaller, more efficient units and if transport, processing and marketing systems are reformed successfully.

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA GENERAL PUTS 31 WEEKLIES ON THE BLOCK  </P> <P> Thirty-one weekly newspapers in Orange County and the San Gabriel Valley were  put up for sale Tuesday by Media General Inc., the Richmond, Va.-based media  conglomerate that last year fended off a bitter hostile takeover attempt by  Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman.  </P> <P> Media General said it was selling the community newspapers because they were  geographically too far from the company's base in the Southeast and  strategically too far from the firm's focus on daily newspapers.  </P> <P> The papers put on the block include nine titles published by South Orange  County News in Mission Viejo, and 22 titles run by Highlander Publications of  the City of Industry. Together, the two groups constitute Golden West  Publishing Inc., which will be sold as unit rather than in pieces.  </P> <P> Ron Redfern, chief executive of Golden West, said the 31 papers, all but one of  which are distributed free of charge to community residents, had a combined  circulation of 487,000 and gross revenues of about $15 million. While he would  not disclose the price Media General is asking, he said that weekly newspapers  normally sell for one to two times gross.  </P> <P> Lee Dirks &amp; Associates, a newspaper broker based in Birmingham, Mich., has  been retained to handle the sale.  </P> <P> Media General said in a statement that "management demands for the West Coast  operations are no longer prudent," and that "we prefer to concentrate our  efforts on daily newspaper operations." The company's major properties include  daily newspapers in Richmond and Tampa, Fla., and television and cable systems  in the Southeast, and paper interests.  </P> <P> Media General's only other West Coast operation, a paper mill in Pomona, was  sold to Sugarman last year after his bid to take over the entire company  failed. The exceptionally bitter takeover fight attracted wide attention as a  test case of the legality of some types of Class B stock, which can confer  extra voting rights and are used by many family-owned media companies to thwart  unwanted suitors. But Sugarman dropped his challenge of the stock structure  when he abandoned his takeover attempt.  </P> <P> The Golden West Publishing group was put together by Media General in 1980 and  1981 with the purchase of several small weekly newspaper chains. Redfern said  the company initially had planned to convert one or more of the papers to  dailies, but ultimately chose not to take the risks and make the huge  investments that would have been required.  </P> <P> Golden West employs about 350 people, Redfern said, and operations will  continue as normal pending the sale. He said a number of companies had  expressed interest in buying Golden West, but he declined to identify them.  </P> <P> Community weeklies have been a strong growth niche in the newspaper business  over the last several years, industry analysts say, although they rarely rival  dailies in financial resources or editorial clout.  </P> <P> Redfern said the strength of the different Golden West weeklies closely tracked  the local economies, with strong growth for papers such as the Laguna Niguel  News in booming areas of South County and flatter performance at the San  Gabriel Valley titles.  </P></p>

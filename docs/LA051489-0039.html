			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FOCUS OF ANTI-TOBACCO CAMPAIGNS SHOULD SHIFT TO PUBLICATIONS THAT CARRY  CIGARETTE ADS  </P> <P> The article describing the moral issues faced by the advertising companies that  create ads for tobacco products was interesting, but I felt that it was a bit  off the mark. ("A Matter of Conscience: Doonesbury Strip Draws Ad Agency  Creative Types Into Moral Fray Over Assignments," May 2.)  </P> <P> The real focus of the article should have been on the thousands of magazines  and newspapers that publish the slick ads created by the advertising companies.  After all, it is these newspapers and magazines that really do the work of  spreading the messages of the tobacco companies and thus help perpetuate the  use and addiction to the most deadly drug in our country.  </P> <P> The tobacco industry knows that the $2.4 billion it spends each year on  promotion and advertising can buy the conscience and loyalty of almost any  publication or group. An advertising manager who would be aghast and outraged  if a major cocaine dealer tried to run an ad for cocaine thinks nothing of  taking huge sums of money from the tobacco industry, whose products kill and  injure thousands of times more people than illicit drugs ever will.  </P> <P> A related, and highly disturbing issue, is the way tobacco companies have  branched out into hundreds of non-tobacco industries. This now allows them to  subtly blackmail magazine and newspaper editors with the implied loss of  non-tobacco advertising if any articles are published that are overly critical  of the tobacco industry or if the publications refuse to carry tobacco ads.  </P> <P> Your article also quoted a tobacco industry spokesman giving the standard line  that the tobacco industry does not want kids to begin smoking. What hogwash!  With the tobacco industry losing more than 300,000 of its best customers every  single year to tobacco-caused illnesses, it must recruit young replacement  smokers to stay in business. Many tobacco ads are so obviously aimed at the  youth market that only the hopelessly naive or tobacco company executives  themselves could really believe that the industry doesn't want to seduce young,  impressionable kids into becoming tobacco addicts.  </P> <P> I think that all magazine and newspaper editors should take a hard look at  themselves and ask themselves if they have sold out their morals and  consciences to the tobacco industry, and thus become accomplices in thee deaths  of over 300,000 people each year in this country.  </P> <P> WILLARD T.

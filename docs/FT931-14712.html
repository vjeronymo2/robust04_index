			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate rise hope overrides inflation fear SHARE prices ended a busy trading session in positive territory but not before a fierce struggle to shrug off the effects of some slightly disappointing domestic inflation numbers and the absence of a rumoured reduction in UK interest rates. A late rally in the equity market followed a sudden surge of mostly overseas-sourced buying interest amid suggestions that this weekend could bring a co-ordinated round of Europe-wide interest rate cuts. Significantly, dealers said there had been exceptionally heavy demand for leading French stocks, especially the banks, which they said was a strong pointer to a move to reduce French interest rates. Sentiment in London was additionally boosted by a healthy performance on Wall Street. The Dow Jones was up around nine points early in the session after a heavy batch of US economic data. The last session of the account began with marketmakers opening share prices marginally below overnight levels. The Footsie registered an early three-point decline after confirmation of the first relatively sizeable rights issue of the year, a Pounds 45m cash call from First National Finance. The absence of any other rights issue saw a burst of buying in the Footsie future which dragged the cash market with it. Then, support tapered ahead of the inflation news. The marginal increase in the underlying inflation rate was widely expected and put paid to any lingering hopes of a UK rate cut. Subsequent flurries of small selling drove the Footsie to its lowest level, down 9.8 points, just in front of Wall Street's opening. It then began to recover, eventually closing 5.9 higher at 2,765.1. Over the week, the 100 index has fallen 34.1, or 1.2 per cent. The Footsie Mid-250 edged up 2.5 to 2890.6, a fall of 42.1, or 1.4 per cent, on the week. Senior dealers were guardedly optimistic about the near-term outlook for the market. 'The feeling at the close was that perhaps we have seen the worst of the pull-back in equities; the market has a good feel about it,' said one trader. But he warned that there remained a strong possibility of a big rights issue hitting the market in the short term. US broker J P Morgan is among the more bullish of the London market. It sees it outperforming other European markets because it offers real earnings and dividend growth. Strauss Turnbull, however, says the market's earnings multiple of around 17 times discounts too much good news. Turnover was 611.1m shares yesterday. The value of business on Thursday was Pounds 1.2bn. The value of market business has topped Pounds 1bn on every trading day so far this year.</p>

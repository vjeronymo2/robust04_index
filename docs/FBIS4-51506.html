			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Masato Sano; from the "The Hata Administration: </F> Mounting Problems" series; part one of a three-part series:  "`Tax System' and `Food Control System' To Be Factors of  Uncertainty"]    [Text] The Hata administration will begin on 25 April by  taking over the tasks Prime Minister Hosokawa left unfinished,  along with the confrontations and confusion of the coalition  parties. When we trace the problems which the new administration  has to face, we realize the new administration's future is full  of difficulties.  <H5>  Contradictions Have Erupted Simultaneously </H5>   During the two-week period beginning 8 April, from when  Prime  Minister Hosokawa expressed his intention to resign to when  Foreign Minister Hata was elected his successor, the coalition  government opened itself to the public. Though we could imagine  that the government was facing a complicated situation--as a  result of confusion involving the national welfare tax and the  movement to exclude Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura--we now  realize the contradictions that were smoldering within the  coalition government for the past eight months erupted  simultaneously, ignited by the confusion created over the past  two weeks as represented by the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  maneuver to bring former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister Watanabe into their camp. The most serious  contradiction is the ineradicable confrontation between  Shinseito and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. As  far as economic policy is concerned, the two parties are in  complete disagreement about an increase in the consumption tax.    To Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who advocates  the consumption tax rate being raised to 10 percent, the SDPJ  appears to be a snake in his bosom. At the beginning of April,  the SDPJ's Research Commission on the Tax System announced its  policy to allow an increase of the consumption tax. However,  the leftwing group within the party and local organizations  strongly opposed this policy, and as a result the move of the  "compromising group" was weakened. With the start of the Hata  administration close at hand, the coalition parties have agreed  to express their policy "to aim at total tax reform centering on  an increase in indirect taxes, including revision and abolition  of the consumption tax." However, this agreement did not mean  complete concession to Shinseito. There are still a number of  ways to roll back Shinseito.    For example, as it used to do in the past, the SDPJ may  propose tax exemptions on foodstuffs and tax reductions on  necessities. These proposals alone will be enough to bring about  confusion in the discussions on tax reform. There are many  disturbing factors contained in the coalition parties'  discussions on tax reform. Needless to say, confusion will be  created in discussing when and to what extent the consumption  tax rate is to be increased. Besides, confusion will be created  in discussing such matters as use of the increased portion of  the consumption tax; introduction of consolidated taxation on  acquired assets; introduction of a numbering system applicable  to taxpayers; ways of dealing with the local consumption tax;  and so on. Each of these disturbing factors cannot be removed,  even if the coalition parties try to explain their consistency  by using the words "policy agreement." On the other hand, the  government has almost given its commitment to the United States  that income tax reductions will be effected on a full scale, and  that the basic plan for public investment in the amount of 430  trillion yen will be increased. Under the circumstances, it is  necessary for the government to draw its conclusion in June,  prior to the opening of the meeting of the heads of state and  government of the G-7 major industrial nations.    Since the days when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] was  in  power, the consumption tax, administrative reform, and  rationalization of finances have been regarded as inseparable  problems. After failing to introduce general a consumption tax  at the time of the Ohira cabinet, the government could introduce  the consumption tax in 1989, supported by its policy "of  realizing financial reconstruction without tax increases" and by  the administrative reform carried out by the Nakasone cabinet.  Of course, the coalition government is aware of this, and its  recent policy agreement also refers to administrative reform and  rationalization of finance. However, the new administration  faces many difficulties.    Administrative Reform Is Shopworn    If Prime Minister Hosokawa had continued in power, he would  have exerted himself in carrying out administrative reform. He  himself assumed the post of head of the Administrative Reform  Council's headquarters and framed the outline of administrative  reforms aiming to remove 682 regulations and review 92 special  corporations. The outline was about to be adopted at a cabinet  meeting in the middle of February. Presently, the outline is  lying on the shelf. The lack of a sense of crisis on the part  of the bureaucracy is the best evidence that the outline is  shopworn.    The coalition parties have not yet definitely established  their policy on how to deal with reform of the foodstuff control  system which is considered the largest among the 682 items to be  deregulated. With the "Heisei rice confusion" taking place, the  argument that Japan should supply rice for itself is regaining  influence among the people. Besides, with domestic rice being  sold with imported rice, and with enforced pricing of imported  rice which disregards the price differential between domestic  and foreign rice, distrust of the foodstuff control system is  spreading among the people. It is considered inevitable that a  heated discussion involving both government and nongovernment  parties will take place when the partial liberalization of rice  is ratified at the national Diet.    Rationalization of finances is also a difficult problem. The  coalition government is considered a positive financial policy  group in that it appeals more enthusiastically than any other  government in the past to the "necessity of dealing with an  aging society," and in that it is trying to improve both the  social infrastructure and welfare. However, presently every  cabinet member is considered to be merely trying to defend the  interests of his ministry, and the coalition parties' Diet  members are more conspicuously trying to induce interests to  their constituencies than did the LDP's Diet members. Under  such a situation, it is difficult to foresee to what extent the  coalition government is going to thoroughly review the method of  distribution of public projects.  <H5>  Budget Enactment Also a Difficult Problem </H5>   We should not easily conclude that it is wrong to adopt a  positive financial policy since the United States is requesting  Japan expand its domestic demand, and since the Japanese  economy, with the collapse of the bubble economy, has become  more dependent on public expenditures. Enterprises are not  likely to moderate their efforts for restructuring and for  inventory cutbacks, even if their profit may be recovered to  some extent. The shifting of production to foreign countries  due to a strong yen is directly hitting local enterprises, thus  making them more dependent on public projects.    No evil influence has so far surfaced in the business  condition due to the considerable delay in the budget debate.  However, the budget debate should not be postponed for an  unlimited period. It has already become difficult to carry out  in advance the national projects for the first half of the  current fiscal year; large projects also remain untouched.    However, what is more important is to see the situation from  a medium-range viewpoint. Formulating the budget bill for 1995  is to be started as soon as the 1994 budget is approved by the  Diet. The basic figures in estimating the budget for the next  fiscal year are not likely to be easily determined. If at the  time of determining the basic figures, the pace of the business  recovery is considered stable, then the government has to decide  if it should follow the traditional pattern restricting  government spending or if it should continue to increase its  spending to avoid the shock that may be created by reduced  expenditures. The government is required to make a severe  choice. On one hand, the government should fear that  enterprises might become physically weak, thus causing  industries to leave the country. On the other hand, the  government must face the problem of financial deficits and  prevent the bubble economy from occurring again.    Every determination is to be made by Prime Minister Hata. In  any event, decisions should not be made by Ichiro Ozawa. The  role of the prime minister is to make "decisions" and not  coordinate or make preliminary consultations.</p>

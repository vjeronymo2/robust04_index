			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa recovery gathers pace with Pounds 1.56m Havelock Europa, the store-fitting company, trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.56m in the first six months of this year, on turnover ahead 24 per cent to Pounds 15.7m. The results, up from Pounds 505,000 previously, continued the recovery in the Scottish-based company's fortunes, which began last year after two years of losses. The shares rose 18p to 188p. Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, said Havelock was profiting from increased demand from retailers and financial services companies, and gaining market share in its industry, from which a number of players had dropped out. Mr Hew Balfour, chief executive, said the company had added Tesco to a list of clients which included Boots, Woolworths, Safeway and House of Fraser. Financial services customers made up 20 per cent of turnover, compared with 11 per cent in 1991. Mr Balfour said the company was seeing the success of a strategy devised in 1992. It was benefiting from improvements in manufacturing efficiency, additional investment in computer-aided design and alliances with other companies, such as AT&amp;T, which is a sizeable force in automated cash machines. The company had net cash of Pounds 2.4m on June 30, compared with net debt of Pounds 2.1m a year earlier. It is to pay its first interim dividend since 1991, of 1p, and a total of not less than 2.75p (2p) is forecast for the year. Earnings per share improved from 1.9p to 5.2p. Mr Lessels said that the second half would, as usual, be stronger in terms of turnover than the first, although the imbalance between the two halves would not be as pronounced as in 1993. The order book was buoyant. Allied Provincial, the company's broker, is forecasting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 4m and earnings per share of 12.4p for the full year, rising to Pounds 5m and 14p respectively in 1995.</p>

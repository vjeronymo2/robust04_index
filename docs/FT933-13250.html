			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Marriott opens Dollars 1.5bn offer to swap bonds MARRIOTT Corporation, the large US lodging and food services group, yesterday announced the start of its offer to exchange Dollars 1.525bn of existing bonds for new high yielding debt securities, common stock and cash. The offer stems from Marriott's plan to demerge its main operating interests  -the lodging business and food services operations, to be known as Marriott International - from its property assets and the bulk of the group's debts, in a business to be known as Host Marriott. The demerger plan sent the value of Marriott's bonds plunging and angered its bondholders, who pressured the company into the exchange offer. However, some investors, led by a subsidiary of the UK's Prudential insurance group, are pursuing court action against Marriott for alleged fraud in connection with the demerger. The demerger will be considered by Marriott shareholders at the company's annual meeting this Friday. Consummation of the exchange offer - which runs until August 17, but can be extended - is dependent on shareholders approving the demerger. Deere &amp; Co, the US farm equipment group, filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for up to Dollars 350m of debt and equity, Reuter reports. The offering may consist of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, warrants to buy debt securities, currency and other warrants. Net proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Virgin wins French union battle THE British-owned Virgin megastores opened in France yesterday, following another victory in their Sunday trading battle, writes John Ridding in Paris. A Paris tribunal on Saturday rejected a complaint by the CGT, the French union organisation, which demanded Virgin's Paris and provincial stores be closed for the day under the country's 1906 Sunday trading law. The dispute arose after the government refused to renew a one-year 'derogation' which had allowed Virgin to open its megastores on Sunday. Virgin is appealing against the decision.</p>

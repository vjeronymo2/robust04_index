			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First News" section] </F>   [Text] Official sources with first-hand access to security  matters say that the bomb planted in Sayyidat al-Najat Church  was brought from Israel and assembled at a Lebanese Forces'  center in Lebanon.    [A related item from the same "First News" section adds:  "Ministerial quarters have expressed puzzlement over the  insistence of U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley in his private  discussions that Israel had nothing to do with the bombing in  Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il, a position that  conflicts with the evidence accumulated by the security organs  and judiciary."]</p>

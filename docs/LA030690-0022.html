			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOSE WHIZ KIDS OF SCIENCE  </P> <P> One way a society defines itself is in its decisions about behavior it will  punish and behavior it will reward. More often than not these days, public  discussion about reward, punishment and America's values is focused on making  points in political campaigns and not on identifying merit. So it is refreshing  to think of values in the same frame of reference as that used by such rituals  as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, whose winners were announced late  Monday with appropriate fanfare.  </P> <P> The Westinghouse contest is an annual event of more consequence, if less  celebrity, to the American future than the Oscars or any of a dozen other  spotlights on achievement. Students who have yet to see their high school  diplomas are formally feted for their wizardry in fields from genetics to  microbiology. The thrilling accomplishments of these young hotshots inevitably  serve to reassure the nation's almost always-hysterical older folk that the  future of the nation is not in such bad hands after all.  </P> <P> This year two Southern Californians stood out. David Ruchien Liu, 16, from  Riverside, and Royce Yung-Tze Peng, 17, of Rancho Palos Verdes, finished among  the top 10 winners, the first time in four years that state students finished  in that stratospheric elite. No doubt the impressive achievements of Liu and  Peng say more about the brains and determination of these ambitious teen-agers  than anything else and scarcely provides us with the right to crow about  California. That would be to trivialize this grand moment. Still, it's nice to  know that such talent is flowering here, among teachers who have not given up  and fellow students who cannot but help be inspired by the excellence of the  achievement. And among adults who can be moved by recognition of such young  talent even after many years and much cynicism have left them generally moved  by little else.  </P></p>

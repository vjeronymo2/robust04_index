			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Taba, 14 Feb (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of  the Palestinian delegation in the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, described the first day of negotiations as positive.  He said that the Cairo agreement of 9 February helped to make  today's negotiations positive.    In statements he made to correspondents at the conclusion of  the second negotiating session today, Dr. Sha'th said that they  discussed the tasks, number, and deployment of the Palestinian  police in the areas from which the Israeli forces will withdraw.  Sha'th refused to specify the size of the Palestinian force that  the Palestinian delegation is asking to be deployed in Gaza and  Jericho, noting that the Palestinian delegation had submitted a  number of questions to the Israeli delegation and it is waiting  for answers to them. The Israeli delegation also submitted a  number of questions and is waiting to receive the answers to  them.    Official Palestinian sources said that these questions  pertain to the types of weapons that will be supplied to the  police forces, the [words indistinct] in the various areas, and  everything pertaining to the maintenance of security in the  Palestinian self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho.    Dr. Sha'th emphasized the need to reach agreement on the  structure and number of the Palestinian police force, because  there are many issues that must be dealt with. He noted that  the entry of the Palestinian police into the Palestinian  self-rule areas must precede the Israeli withdrawal and not come  after it in order not to create a security vacuum in these areas.    The head of the Palestinian delegation said that they also  discussed issues pertaining to Palestinian-Israeli coordination  and cooperation in the security sphere.    Sha'th added that the two delegations have began drafting  the  general agreement that will be signed by Palestinian president  Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo.  He affirmed that no specific problems emerged during today's  two sessions, and that there was general progress.    Regarding the issue of the Palestinian detainees, Sha'th  said  that this issue was not discussed today because not all the  members of the Palestinian delegation were present. He  indicated that it will be discussed at tomorrow's session.    Asked about a timetable for the release of the Palestinian  detainees from Israeli prisons, Sha'th emphasized that a final  agreement will not be signed before a timetable is prepared for  the release of all the detainees, including those who belong to  Hamas. The head of the Palestinian delegation explained that all  the detainees will be released in stages until next July.  [passage omitted]    Sha'th said that the final size of the Jericho area will be  discussed at the next meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin, noting  that the Palestinians expressed reservations regarding the maps  pertaining to the Jericho area when they were signed in Cairo.    The head of the Palestinian delegation added that an era of  peace has begun, and all the problems pertaining to Israel's  security fears must end, because when war ends, peace must  begin. [passage omitted]    Sha'th expressed the hope that the negotiations will be  concluded during the month of Ramadan, noting that the delay  that occurred in the past two weeks was political and not  procedural.    Asked whether the negotiations will be held in Cairo or Taba  next week, Sha'th said that they have not discussed this issue  yet.    It has been learned that the Palestinian delegation wants  the  meetings to be held alternatively in Taba and Cairo while the  Israeli delegation wants the negotiations to take place either  in Taba or Alexandria, but not in Cairo.</p>

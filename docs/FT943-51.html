			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (20): Strategies build upon knowledge base - Globalisation / Stephanie Flanders examines the explosion in cross-border investment flows Contrary to popular belief, the globalisation of capital is nothing new. In fact, relative to world output, cross-border investment flows are only now approaching the level reached before the first world war. Foreign direct investment represented 9 per cent of world output in 1913, according to some estimates, compared to 8.5 per cent in 1991. Historians, it seems, would be unimpressed with the explosion of international investment flows described in the chart. Why is it that pundits and policymakers are impressed? One answer is that today's high degree of capital mobility contrasts sharply with that of the more recent past. In the inter-war period, the world's leading economies turned inwards, and international markets for goods and capital largely collapsed. In a sense, recent trends have simply rebuilt them. But this more recent push towards economic integration also differs from the earlier one in important respects, and it is the differences which most concern governments. Technological change and deregulation have not only opened up the world market; they are increasingly changing the global production process itself. Individual countries worry that they can no longer choose their role. The first difference is that the production and sale of goods is internationalised at a deeper level. This year's United Nations World Investment Report states that as much as a third of world output is now directly controlled by transnational corporations (TNCs); 'their indirect influence is almost certainly much greater'. As in the 19th century, a UK company, can set up a factory in Brazil, either to meet home demand or to gain access to the Brazilian market. In 1993, there were some 206,000 foreign affiliates of multinational companies located worldwide: up from 3,500 in the early 1960s. Their combined sales in 1991 exceeded world exports by more than 20 per cent. But that same multinational can also opt for making just one input at the Brazilian plant, co-ordinating the process of making and selling the final product across countless national borders. Indeed, more than a third of world trade flows in 1989 were within companies, compared to one fifth in the early 1970s. Economist David Levy calculates that the value of US 'intra-firm' exports rose by 70 per cent in the 1982-9 period alone. The second difference lies in the nature of the goods themselves. Information technology has enabled companies to co-ordinate their traditional activities worldwide, as outlined earlier. But exploiting the latest computer and communications technology to do so means that the 'knowledge' aspect of their operations is more important. It is not surprising that financial organisations were among the first to exploit the globalising potential of the 'information revolution'. Communicating information efficiently has long been at the core of their business. But even in old-fashioned sectors, such as automobile manufacturing, companies are finding they must compete as much on their ability to deploy knowledge as on their simple capacity to make cars. In these global industries, 'the new barrier to entry is not volume or price', argues Robert Reich, former Harvard academic and now US secretary of labour. 'It is skill in finding the right fit between particular technologies and particular markets. Core corporations no longer focus on products as such: their business strategies increasingly centre upon specialised knowledge.' What does this imply for public policy? For one, governments will have to get used to the fact that a significant part of the workforce works for a company headquartered abroad. Mr Reich has argued that this makes traditional industrial policy redundant: public aid for 'national champions' may just as well end up creating jobs abroad. Others claim nationality still dominates a company's outlook. Yet there is now a more tenuous link between where a corporation is registered, and where its workforce is located. According to the OECD, nearly two thirds as many people are employed in the foreign affiliates of Dutch multinationals as hold jobs in the manufacturing sector at home. Statistics like that one raise the fear that internationalisation spells fewer jobs in rich countries where labour is expensive. But international league tables based on wages alone can be highly misleading. Even if a company makes its location decisions solely on the basis of cheap labour (which is rare), what matters will be the productivity of that labour, not merely its price. Developed country workers can compete if they have the skills and equipment to justify the higher price. Nevertheless, rich country worries about employment relate to a broader concern about the global power of TNCs. If communication and transport links allow firms to operate where they like, the fear is that governments can only aspire to keeping out of their way. Nations can no longer plot their separate economic paths. The authors of the World Investment Report, among others, dispute this interpretation. Recent experience, they argue, shows that both 'governments and geography still matter'; and only part of the policy recipe for national success will be laisser-faire. Admittedly, some of the diversity of that experience across countries comes from misguided attempts to go it alone. Oppressive and insular regulations and taxes can deter foreign direct investment and employment from a country, just as wiser policies can encourage it. Fully three-quarters of all foreign direct investment in developing countries in the 1980s went to 10 countries. State-led liberalisation efforts were a key factor attracting outside investors. But countries will continue to differ for more positive reasons in a global economy, all allowing a wide scope for government activism. For, paradoxically, perhaps, a globalised strategy tends to make local networks even more important to a firm's ability to 'add value', whether it is in creative research and development, team-based 'just-in-time' production, or locally tailored product marketing. The state has a crucial role in providing the necessary environment for such networks to thrive: not least, an educated and flexible workforce and sound public infrastructure. Thanks to the globalisation of their appeal, the national rewards of doing so are larger than ever.</p>

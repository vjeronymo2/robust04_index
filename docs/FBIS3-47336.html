A total of 13 members -- 9  members including former Dietmen from the SDPJ and 4 members  from Sakigake -- attended the meeting.    Yoshito Sengok, who is a former member of the House of  Representatives and affiliated with the SDPJ, and Kenichiro  Sato, chief of the Election Bureau of Sakigake, will play the  role of contact points. The study group will be called about  twice a month in order for members to exchange views on ways to  pass political reform bills in the Diet and prepare campaign  strategies for the combined electoral system of single-seat  constituency and proportional representation under debate in the  Diet.</p>

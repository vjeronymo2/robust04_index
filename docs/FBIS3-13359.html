			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 14 Mar (INA) -- The AL-'IRAQ newspaper has  asserted that both the Security Council and the UN Special  Commission, led by Rolf Ekeus, are making a grave mistake if  they think that they will not be held accountable for their  continued attempts to avoid giving a specific date for the  lifting of the embargo. They are also greatly mistaken if they  think the Iraqi people will accept remaining at the mercy of the  inspection agencies and their unfair conditions.    In an editorial today, the newspaper wonders: Does the  Security Council think that the Iraqi leadership will continue  to wait for unspecific and vague dates as to when the unfair  embargo will be fully or partially lifted?    The paper adds: Do the United States, world Zionism, and the  clique of agents and traitors think they can maintain the  embargo indefinitely through delaying tactics and  procrastination? Do they think they can achieve this by  obstructing any positive stand the Security Council should take  in return for Iraq's fulfillment of its obligations toward  Security Council resolutions, despite the fact that these  resolutions are harsh, severe, and illegitimate?    The paper highlights the important, valuable speech made by  President Saddam Husayn when he received cabinet members and  well-wishers on the 'Id al-Fitr. The paper cites his excellency  as asserting that whatever the degree of Iraq's cooperation,  commitment, and response, the party representing the Security  Council will continue to be evasive, disregard facts, and give  tendentious explanations and lame excuses to weasel out of its  commitments to close the file of the embargo once and for all.    The paper says it is laughable that the Security Council,  which is influenced by the United States, claims that it is  concerned about the sovereignty of Iraq at a time when the  members of the Security Council violate this sovereignty and  draw their own lines of latitude and longitude in order to  achieve familiar, malicious objectives that threaten the very  concept of our sovereignty.    The paper notes Rolf Ekeus's procrastination, saying it is  another part of the ugly game. The chairman of the Special  Commission is a senior diplomat and international official who  is supposed to keep his word and respect his decisions and  dates. This situation arouses sorrow and regret over the moral  deterioration of the Security Council. One time Ekeus says that  Iraqi compliance should be tested for three months; on another  occasion, he says six months; and sometimes he says not less  than a year. However, Ekeus has so far not told us when this  probationary period will begin in order for us to know when it  will end. Despite all of this, they talk about our credibility.  Have you ever known greater hypocrisy or worse maneuvering  tactics?    The paper adds: In light of our bitter experience with the  Security Council, we realize that the ugly game aims, first and  foremost, to exhaust the people of Iraq and manipulate its  resources. The greater conspiracy -- whose features were clear  even before the U.S.-Zionist aggression -- targets our  development, cultural progress, the future of our generations,  and our legitimate right to keep pace with the age and look  forward to the 21st century and to achieving progress and  development on all levels.    AL-'IRAQ says: After a few days, the Security Council will  begin its periodic discussions on lifting the sanctions. The  patient and steadfast Iraqis will not be affected or weakened if  the Security Council again fails to comply with its commitments  under pressure from the United States and Zionism. Our people  and leadership will face any such situation in a way that  maintains the momentum of their earnest work to face challenges.    Concluding, AL-'IRAQ stresses that the lofty Iraq will not  go  back on its national and pan-Arab course. It will remain the  edifice of faith, honest principles, and genuine values. Iraq  will not be shaken by treacherous storms or forces of evil,  despotism, or falsehood. That is how we are and that is how we  will continue to be. However, the enemies of God and humanity  will harvest evil, disgrace, and misfortune.</p>

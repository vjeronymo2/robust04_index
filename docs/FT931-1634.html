			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (5): Known for know-how  -Morgan Stanley bucks the trend THE OFFICES of Morgan Stanley Japan, in central Tokyo, are protected by dour security guards, placed there after the company received bomb threats. As the Tokyo stock market has continued to slump, Morgan's Japanese operations have made the US securities house one of the few to buck the trend. But its high profitability (using the newest computer technology, innovative but complex strategies, large capital backing) has faced criticism from frustrated local brokers who see their losses mount. For the six months to September, Morgan Stanley reportedly made Y12.6bn in pre-tax profits, seven times as much as that of Daiwa Securities, the second largest Japanese broker. Japanese brokers rely heavily on commission from clients; they have been hit by the plunge in trading volumes. On the other hand, the leading American brokers make profits on trading stocks, currencies and bonds for their own accounts. Morgan Stanley has dominated the stock index arbitrage market, securing profits from the difference in the cash stock and futures markets. Japanese brokers do not have the technology in risking their own capital in the same way; they have been left behind. Moreover, local financial authorities have quickly blamed stock index arbitrage trading and derivatives trading, including futures and options, as the reason for the sluggish stock market. Trading volatility and volumes for the derivatives markets have declined as fees have been raised and trading restrictions implemented over the past two years. The government's support operation for the stock market - pumping in public funds, including postal savings and public pension money - is also watering down share price movement. Mr Takeo Kani, chairman of Morgan Stanley Japan, says the fall in profit chances is inevitable. 'It's the economic fundamentals which are hurting the stock market, not derivatives trading,' he says. However, Mr Kani says the company has developed strategies from its experience in the past bear markets of New York and London. It also has expertise in structured products - and a large investor base in the US and Europe. Such skills were recently sought by the Bank of Tokyo, which issued a perpetual subordinated bond structured with a convertible option which allows investors to exchange the bond with the bank's shares during the first 10 years of issuance. Not only was it the largest yen-denominated overseas offer, but the issue was also the first capital raising programme by a Japanese bank to be placed with genuine European and Asian investors, instead of affiliates and companies with close business ties. 'Morgan Stanley is known for its know-how in equity related products, and has an excellent placement ability,' says a Japanese banker. Morgan Stanley has also bravely broken into the local corporate bond market, becoming the first foreign securities house to lead a domestic issue. Morgan introduced the fixed-price re-offering system, to enhance the transparency in fixing the price of bonds placed with investors. Last year it began market-making NTT shares, activating a secondary market which previously was almost non-existent. Morgan Stanley's future profitability in Tokyo will depend on the speed of financial deregulation. The slowdown of deregulation in the debt securitisation market has disappointed leading US houses in the area. 'The potential of Tokyo as an international financial market is very big,' says Mr Kani. Regulatory restraints, however, have hampered the growth of the market: the number of products allowed is limited. The Tokyo market's importance among global capital markets relies heavily on the willingness of the financial authorities to accept further financial innovation, especially from foreign securities houses.</p>

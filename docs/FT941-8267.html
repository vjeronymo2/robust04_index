			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Monday Interview: Turning the moribund into mainstream - Ron Brown, the US secretary of commerce, talks to Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne in Washington There used to be a faintly down-at-heel air about the commerce department. It put out a lot of economic statistics and data about people and the weather but it rarely appeared a big player in government when matched against the powerhouses of treasury, state department and even, as it developed in influence over the last 20 years, the small office of the trade representative. Commerce secretaries were often political hacks or comfortable businessmen who came and went, leaving not too much of a trace behind. To enter Ron Brown's quarters is instantly to detect a difference. They are as stylish and smart as the secretary himself, perhaps the most elegant man in Washington. They resemble those of a plush lobbying law firm, one of which, the aggressive Patton, Boggs and Blow, was his home for much of the 1980s. They are the offices of a quintessential Washington insider, right down to the fish tanks, the computer terminals and big pictures, beyond number, of Ron Brown and his many friends, from his president on downwards. Simply because Ron Brown was just such a person, it puzzles that he should have opted for dear old moribund commerce when, as one of the major architects of Bill Clinton's election victory, his selection must surely have been wider. 'Well, I won't say I wanted to be secretary of commerce from the day I was born, but one of the things I always noticed was that this was a department of enormous untapped potential. Anyway, something about me likes challenges, it was enticing. And our campaign was all about the economy and I thought this department could have an impact on it.' That impact was certainly seen just last week when Ron Brown stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his president to announce triumphantly the Dollars 6bn contract for the sale of commercial jets to Saudi Arabia. He was a serious player in administration strategies for Nafta, the Uruguay Round and the latest fraught negotiations with Japan. His proudest achievement so far has been the establishment of a national export strategy, which, if European reactions to the Saudi deal are anything to go by, already has US competitors deeply worried. Its goal is Dollars 1,000bn in exports by the end of the century, nearly double current levels, generating, he calculates, 6m new jobs at home. 'Government should not initiate contracts,' he says. 'That is up to the private sector, but if it makes that judgment there should be aggressive action on government's part to help them.' And why not, he goes on, for that is exactly what the main US trading rivals have been doing for years. He can come over as a supersalesman (he prefers the word 'advocate"), though this would be grossly to misread his talents. His career has been varied enough - and only his colour makes it relatively unusual. He grew up in the Theresa Hotel when Harlem glittered and where his father was manager. His education was at the better private schools in the north east and by 21 he was a commissioned army lieutenant. . A law degree from St John's University in New York got him on board the civil rights movement, with the Urban League. He moved on to be chief counsel of the Senate judiciary committee under Edward Kennedy, worked for his abortive 1980 campaign and then moved on to Patton, Boggs and Blow, where his clients ranged from Japanese corporations to Haiti's Duvalier family and where he began to make serious money - and some enemies. (The New York Times came close to opposing his nomination a year ago mostly because he had been that ultimate object of mistrust, a lobbyist). In 1988 he managed the Rev Jesse Jackson's bid for the presidency, and he was still seen mostly as a tool of the Kennedy-Jackson liberal axis when, against many odds, he was elected Democratic Party national chairman early in 1989. This induced undisguised delight among Republicans. George Will, the conservative columnist, wrote at the time: 'Democrats are already turning briskly to the business of losing the 1992 election and some of them believe that the coming election of Ronald Brown as party chairman will be a big step in that direction.' Four years later a Democratic president was inaugurated. What he did in those four years as party chairman - raising money, giving Democrats a sense of purpose and ultimately uniting the many warring factions behind the man he saw as a winner - he is now seeking to replicate in government and inside the commerce department. He did not have to demand a seat at the administration high policy table, because Mr Clinton's theological belief in collegiality gave him an automatic place. Like a good cardinal, his opinions are pretty indistinguishable from the rest. 'We've been consistent for 13 months, we want targeted, results-oriented trade policies.' On Japan, this most political of operators expresses interest in Tokyo's unfolding drama but adds that US policy prior to the summit 10 days ago could not be determined 'to the depths of interpreting every nuance in domestic Japanese politics.' More important was the necessity of getting Japan to abide by its agreements - in the framework negotiations that broke down at the summit and over Motorola's cellular phone exports. But it has not been all guts and glory for Ron Brown. It was only a few weeks back that he was cleared of charges that he had solicited money in return for helping to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam, finally ended February 3. He claims he was not 'deterred or distracted' but then says Washington, which he knows like the back of his hand, 'is getting meaner and worse.' Still, 'I don't feel victimised, I'm the kind of person that moves on.' To the state department perhaps? Ron Brown also knows when to smile and say nothing.</p>

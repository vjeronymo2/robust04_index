			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Siddons hits out at Pacific BBA bid The board of Siddons Ramset, the Australian building materials group, yesterday described the ADollars 87m (Pounds 38m) bid by Pacific BBA as 'opportunistic'. The offer does not reflect the full value of Siddons, they said. Pacific BBA, 63 per cent owned by BBA Group of the UK, is offering seven of its shares for every nine Siddons or seven shares plus ADollars 16.40 for every 18 shares. Siddons directors also said that in view of the uncertain future of the Australian car and components industries it would not be in the best interests of shareholders to swap Siddons shares into shares in Pacific BBA, a car parts maker.</p>

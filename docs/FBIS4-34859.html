			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marieta Cabrera from the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] The Western Army's Moncada II 94-1 exercise  concluded today as an overall part of the command's operation,  combat, and political preparation. The exercise sought to  prepare general staff and command members to handle troops, as  well as to organize the cooperation of regular forces and  municipal defense councils in the region defended by the Western  Army.    Moncada II 94-1 was based on a series of complex tactical  exercises, which included ambushes, airborne landings by the  enemy, and joint actions by the regular troops and other types  of forces. Today's activities included a naval maneuver at the  western base of Cabanas, preceded by maneuvers at the Jejenes  shooting range with the participation of land and antiaircraft  artillery and support troops. The exercise proved commanders'  expertise in the deployment of small units which operate  independently, their maneuverability, their accuracy, and  efficient fulfillment of missions. Supported by initiatives,  troop instruction programs were qualitatively carried out, which  helped save materials and improve combat techniques.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Kohl puts jobs at top of Germany's priority list Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday called for a 'national alliance' of business, industry, and trade unions to create more jobs. He also pledged to reduce the bureaucracy and introduce cuts in social spending. In a speech outlining the government's programme for the next four years, Mr Kohl said it was crucial to speed up the integration of central Europe into the European Union. 'It is in the interests of the Germans, but also in the interests of Europe, that the western border of Poland does not remain the eastern border of the European Union,' he said. 'At the European Union summit in Essen, (next month) we want a strategy to advance the young democracies of central, east and south-eastern Europe,' he added. Mr Kohl, last week re-elected chancellor by one vote for a fifth term, told the Bundestag: 'We have to bundle all our energies to make Germany fit for the 21st century. We need an alliance for the future. I invite everybody to join us daring to renew our state and society. Work for everyone must be our common goal.' Mr Kohl said jobs must be created for the long-term unemployed as well as the disabled. But he stressed that part-time work should be made more attractive and flexible as one of the means to open up the job market, now considered to be the government's top domestic priority. But Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, ruled out any form of 'grand coalition'. 'Our opposition will aim to make life better for people in this country, not to keep you (Mr Kohl) in office. Every day you are in office is one day too long for us,' he said. The SPD is determined to exploit the government's slim majority of 10. However the opposition in the Bundestag, which includes the Greens, the SPD and the reformed east German communist Party of Democratic Socialism are for the moment too disunited to present a serious challenge to Chancellor Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union-led coalition. If anything, CDU officials believe the immediate threat to the coalition, which comprises the Christian Social Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, comes from the Free Democrats, the junior partner. The FDP had its number of seats reduced by 32 to 47. 'Kohl had to be careful in this speech not to provoke the opposition,' a CDU senior official said. 'He needs the SPD in the Bundesrat (upper house) to get any legislation through. This will be a tough period for the government.' He added that the stability of the government will be tested during state elections in Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia next year. 'We are in big trouble if the FDP fail to get above the 5 per cent, the minimum required to enter parliament.'</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PILOTS BACK MONEY FOR EASTERN STRIKERS  </P> <P> Members of the Air Line Pilots Assn. voted to continue a special dues  assessment that gives financial support to workers in the eight-month Eastern  Airlines strike, the pilots union announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> A vote against the special assessment would have effectively forced the union  to pull down its picket lines in surrender to Eastern and its chairman, Frank  Lorenzo.  </P> <P> Pilots at other airlines are being assessed 3% of their gross pay to a special  fund that has allowed Eastern pilots to collect an average of $2,400-a-month in  strike benefits.  </P> <P> In announcing the vote, ALPA said "the reaffirmation means the continuation of  extraordinary strike benefits for Eastern pilots and the special membership  assessments to fund the benefits."  </P> <P> The balloting of the 40,000 ALPA members was conducted last month by mail amid  reports that contributions to the fund were declining.  </P></p>

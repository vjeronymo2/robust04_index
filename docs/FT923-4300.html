			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / 800 pairs of fake Levi jeans seized A POSSIBLE cross-Europe racket in fake brand-name jeans has been uncovered with the seizure of more than 1,000 pairs of jeans marked as Levi 501s in London and 300 pairs in the Netherlands, Richard Evans writes. The seizure followed a joint operation between the central detective agency of the Dutch economic investigation service and the trading standards office of Haringey Borough Council in London. Haringey put the goods found in a London wholesale warehouse on display yesterday. Mr Tony Northcott, the council's trading standards officer, said they had a street value of around Pounds 50,000. Mr Northcott added that the jeans were of sufficient quality to sell for Pounds 30 a pair, but with the fake Levi logo the price would be Pounds 45.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FRY Discreetly Supports Greek </F> Blockade"]    [Text] The economic sanctions of Greece against Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] still  remains without any public reactions from official Belgrade.  The exception is only the party SK-DJ [Communist League  Movement for Yugoslavia], which condemned this uncivilized Greek  act, and emphasized that the consequences would mostly be felt  by the innocent citizens.    However, the most obvious demonstration of the policy of  double standards is best represented by the attitude of the FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], which, at a state level, came  out against the UN intention to impose sanctions against  Croatia, while it silently supported an illegal and damaging  Greek measure, otherwise, immediately condemned throughout the  world.</p>

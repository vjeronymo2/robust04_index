			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPACE GOALS VS. EARTH GOALS  </P> <P> With his speech proclaiming a lunar base and a trip to Mars as goals for  America's space program, George Bush's vision of presidential leadership comes  into focus (Part I, July 21). It is one of Potemkin politics, a grand facade of  great intentions thrown up to hide a paralysis of will. Although Bush cannot  offer us a clue about how to reduce the present deficit, and while even basic  scientific research withers on the vine for lack of funding, and the health of  America's poor deteriorates due to decimated public health budgets, he proposes  that we embark on an extravagantly expensive space expedition.  </P> <P> We deserve more from a President than mere rhetoric devoid of reason or  responsibility. Great visions may be part of being a great leader, but without  the courage to make hard choices, to face national problems head on and offer  solutions, there is no leadership at all.  </P> <P> CAREY P. SUBLETTE  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

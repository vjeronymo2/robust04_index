The meeting was held at La Primavera preserves  factory in the provincial capital. The assembly was chaired by  Politburo member Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation [CTC], who said that these issues would be  analyzed throughout the month of January by the country's more  than 485,000 labor union leaders, and later by the workers,  although in some collectives, the analyses would be done  simultaneously.    Ross pointed out that even though certain procedures were  bothersome at first, they were necessary for everyone's  well-being and for the future. The labor union leader said that  with this meeting, held at the factory in Pinar del Rio, they  were beginning a consultation process to fight this new battle  together.</p>

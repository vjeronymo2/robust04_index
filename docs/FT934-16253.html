			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Direct sales of goods and services to Israel not subject to boycott Sir, Your recent article ('A wait for hidden fruit', September 20) predicting the slow demise of the Arab economic boycott of Israel is timely and can only be helpful to British exporters. They continue to be concerned about adverse reaction from customers in Arab states who still might be applying aspects of the boycott to their trade in Israel. Nevertheless, your blank phrase 'companies are supposed to certify to Arab countries that they have no dealings with Israel' may continue to reinforce the perception of an all-encompassing boy-cott. Our understanding, supported by the recent Department of Trade and Industry guidelines, is that direct sales of goods and services to Israel are not subject to any compliances. This is apparent in the remarkable British trade record with Israel. With its small land mass and 5m population, Israel is in the top 30 of UK customers worldwide. Exports from the UK to Israel could reach Pounds 700m if this year's trend of a 50 per cent increase in the first seven months continues. This is for visible exports only and excludes the considerable business in financial services and tourism despite the pervasive psychological pressure of the boycott. The DTI and our trade advisory group can offer confidential advice to companies with residual concerns. For many hundreds of successful British exporters, the Israel market is already an important and successful one. The Dollars 60bn gross domestic product contrasts starkly with Jordan's GDP of Dollars 4bn. Hopefully, the West Bank and Gaza will now have the opportunity to develop economically, too, giving benefits to its inhabitants and hopefully bringing peace and tranquillity to the region. As an important trading partner, Britain, through its world-famous exporting companies, can help this process.

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXING IT UP WITH PETER SELLARS  </P> <P> After reading Peter Sellars' commentary in "The Big Mix" Feb. 5, I nearly fell  into a suicidal despondency because I'm culturally anemic, American and white.  </P> <P> But before I reached for a razor blade, I began reviewing my recent cultural  experiences to see how many could be categorized as ethnically themed. I tried  to visualize how many involved a different skin color, hoping desperately that  Thai food would count.  </P> <P> Is this what Sellars wants? With his separatist attitude, he is defeating his  own purpose, building partitions instead of breaking them. To pinpoint any art  as black, Asian, Hispanic, etc., is a disservice to the artists, who probably  like me would have never given it a thought and have taken for granted that it  was simply American art.  </P> <P> BOBBIE DEARING  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

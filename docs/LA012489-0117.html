			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CALTRANS ORDERED TO PAY VICTIM $1.5 MILLION  </P> <P> An Orange County jury has ordered the state to pay $1.5 million to a former  mayor of Fullerton who was injured in a 1983 car accident on a freeway in  Anaheim Hills when another car blew a tire, crossed the median and struck his  car.  </P> <P> The judge in the case, however, has not yet entered a judgment because he is  considering whether to deduct $300,000 in uninsured motorist's benefits paid  out to Everette C. Farnsworth from the jury award, said Larry Danielson,  assistant chief counsel to the California Transportation Department.  </P> <P> "There is no obligation to pay anything until the judgment becomes final,"  Danielson said.  </P> <P> Farnsworth declined comment Monday on the case.  </P> <P> The jury issued its ruling in Superior Court in Santa Ana on Friday. Danielson  said he expects the judgment to be entered within the next 10 days.  </P> <P> Caltrans is also considering an appeal of the verdict or asking for a new trial  because the agency disagrees with the plaintiff's contention that the accident  site was dangerous and that a barrier should have been erected there, said  Anthony J. Ruffolo, deputy chief counsel for Caltrans.  </P> <P> While undergoing brain surgery, Farnsworth, 68, suffered a stroke that left him  blind and partially paralyzed on the left side. The accident occurred on the  Riverside Freeway about a mile east of the Imperial Highway exit.  </P> <P> Farnsworth served on Fullerton's City Council from 1958 to 1966 and as mayor  from 1964 to 1966.  </P></p>

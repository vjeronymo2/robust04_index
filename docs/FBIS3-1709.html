Nguyen Xuan Phong, acting director of American affairs in  the  Foreign Ministry of Vietnam and head of the Vietnamese  delegation, told reporters that the U.S. Government should make  a comprehensive account of former South Vietnam Government  properties which were frozen by the U.S. after 1975.    The U.S. delegation is headed by James Hall of the East Asia  and Pacific Affairs Bureau of the U.S. State Department.    The Vietnamese Government estimates the worth of the frozen  properties of former South Vietnam at around 250 million U.S.  dollars.    The U.S. attorney general has received 192 requests from  U.S.  companies and individuals asking the government to seek  compensation of around 230 million dollars from Vietnam.    The two sides will also work out a detailed schedule for  setting up liaison offices in each other's capital, as agreed  upon following the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against  Vietnam in early February.</p>

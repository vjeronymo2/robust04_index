			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    The situation on NKR's front line continues to be unstable.  Regardless of the protocol Azerbaijan signed in Bishkek, that  Republic has violated the cease-fire by intensely firing on the  Armenian defense positions with various types of arms.  Furthermore, it has launched extensive attacks with armored  vehicles every day. The situation in Mardakerskiy and Agdamskiy  Rayons is tense. However, it must be stressed that the effort by  the Azerbaijan Military Command Headquarters to take the  initiative at the front line has not achieved its objective. As  usual, the NKR defense forces have repulsed the enemy attacks  and forced Azerbaijan's units to retreat after suffering  casualties and losing military equipment.    A short while ago the NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press  Service disclosed that Azerbaijan's military forces had attacked  the NKR defense positions in Agdamskiy Rayon this morning. A  wave of artillery shelling preceded their onslaught. However,  they failed to achieve their goal. The NKR units rebuffed their  attack and forced them to retreat after suffering casualties and  losing military equipment.    According to the NKR intelligence units, Azerbaijan has  begun  to deploy additional military units in Mardakertskiy Rayon's  northern areas. [passage indistinct]    An enemy infantry unit made up of 300 men attacked [place  name indistinct], Yarymdzha, and [place name indistinct] in  Mardakertskiy Rayon yesterday. Their attack was preceded by an  intensive wave of artillery fire. Violent clashes took place in  the region. The NKR forces not only blocked the attack, but  also counterattacked. Initial reports from the area said the  Azerbaijani units lost 60 men, while two men were killed and 11  were wounded on the Armenian side.    Clashes occurred in the western side of [place name  indistinct] in Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday afternoon. Meanwhile,  the enemy shelled the NKR defense positions in the direction of  the Omar Pass in the northern part of Fizulinskiy and  Kelbadzharskiy Rayons with artillery. No one was hurt. The  Armenians [words indistinct] return the fire. The military  operations continued throughout the day. The NKR military units  launched counterattacks. They completely liberated [place name  indistinct] in Mardakertskiy Rayon.    In short, [words indistinct]. But no noticeable change has  occurred in the operations zone.    The situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan  has been relatively peaceful during the past few days.</p>

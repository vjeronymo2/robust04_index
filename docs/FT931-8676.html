			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / BT deal on private circuit charges BUSINESSES that make extensive use of private telecommunications networks will be able to predict their costs with greater confidence following an agreement between British Telecommunications and the industry regulator Oftel. The organisations have agreed to a formula controlling the prices BT will charge for private circuits for the period 1993 to 1997. It sets a cap on the rate of inflation on three families or 'baskets' of private circuit - national analogue circuits, national digital circuits and international circuits. The agreement brings to an end a period of controversy over the control of private circuit prices. Businesses, many of which have extensive and long-established private analogue circuits, had been concerned about prices which changed from year to year and made budgeting difficult.</p>

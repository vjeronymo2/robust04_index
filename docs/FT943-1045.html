			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: All eyes on the Federal Reserve - New York It is abundantly clear this morning that sentiment on Wall Street in the final week of the third quarter will hinge on the outcome of tomorrow's Federal Reserve policy session. It is much more difficult to divine how investors will react to any decision forthcoming from Washington. But analysts are not expecting stocks to make much progress in the short term, whether or not Mr Greenspan and company come down in favour of an immediate move to tighter money. 'The market is facing a lot of head-winds these days,' says James Solloway, an analyst at Argus Research in New York and one of Wall Street's more bullish pundits. 'It all comes down to the realisation that whether the Fed raises rates or not, it's certainly going to raise them sooner or later, and the next time won't be the last.' The best hope of most strategists is that share prices can regain their balance this week after hitting the skids since September 15, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average came within striking distance of its record high of 3,978. 'The strength of the rally was an illusion, and there is now risk on the downside,' says Robin Griffiths, technical analyst at James Capel Strategy in New York. What if the Fed opts to hold off on the cycle's rate increase, as a somewhat shaken consensus of economists foresees? Mr Solloway says equity investors will probably feel a mixture of relief and anxiety, with the latter dominating. If there is no action, bonds are likely to tumble. Traders are already worried that the central bank has fallen behind the inflationary curve. Though stocks have not moved in step with the Treasury markets in recent weeks, a downturn in bond prices, and a concurrent increase in long-term returns, will tip the balance more in the favour of bond investments. 'We are now reaching a point where the increase in bond yields is having a negative effect on stocks,' says Mr Solloway. What if the Fed decides to act immediately, as predicted last week by Mr Wayne Angell, a former Fed governor who now serves as chief economist for Bear Stearns. Mr Angell, known for its hawkish stance on moving aggressively against inflation, says there was a 60 per cent chance that his old colleagues will vote to lift short-term rates by 50 basis points. When the Fed acted in a like manner in mid-August, stocks surged, as Wall Street put the best possible spin on an accompanying statement which said the rate increase should 'be sufficient, at least for a time'. A month later, pundits will not be as generous in their interpretations.</p>

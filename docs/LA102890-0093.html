			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. CONGRESSMEN: TIME FOR ASSESSMENT;  </P> <P> RANTINGS OF SOME OBSCURE DELEGATION'S ACHIEVEMENTS  </P> <P> Orange County's five representatives in Congress are without significant  opposition in the Nov. 6 general election, all Republicans occupying "safe"  seats in heavily GOP districts. They will be returned to Washington without the  inconvenience of having to defend their records. Nevertheless, the election  provides an occasion to assess the incumbents' service to their districts,  Orange County and the nation during the last two years.  </P> <P> As a group, the delegation has one major achievement: gaining approval of  long-awaited federal funding for the $1.5-billion Santa Ana River flood-control  project. The project is vital to Orange and other counties in the event of a  catastrophic flood, thought to be inevitable in the next century. But finding  federal dollars required hard work and cooperation to push the project through  the budget process.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Orange County's delegation is better known in Washington for the  rantings of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Long Beach about the National Endowment  for the Arts. Or the homophobia of Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton,  apparent when he takes the microphone to speak about AIDS. Or the excessive  oratory of Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove on just about anything. They have  made Orange County somewhat of a joke in the Capitol.  </P> <P> What tends to get lost in the shuffle are the accomplishments of Orange  County's other two legislators, Rep. Ron Packard of Carlsbad, who is up for his  fifth term, and Rep. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach, who is seeking his  second.  </P> <P> Packard, who represents South County, is a good-government legislator who does  his homework and has something to show for it. A member of the Public Works and  Transportation Committee, he has made his mark on water rights and aviation  legislation.  </P> <P> Cox was quickly identified as a leader among the 1988 crop of new congressional  members. He has focused on much-needed federal budget reform and brought energy  and conviction to an office that his predecessor, Robert E. Badham, used  primarily as a resting point between trips abroad.  </P> <P> Dornan is the hardest to assess. He blusters and is melodramatic and corny. And  he has angered homosexual groups with his invective on them during floor  debates. But he's charming and shows a surprising ability to work with members  of Congress on the opposite side of the aisle. Recently, for example, he and  Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) co-authored a bill that would create an ROTC-like  Police Corps to train and educate law enforcement officers. It's a good idea  that is still on track in Congress.  </P> <P> As for Dannemeyer, he has undermined his legitimate concerns about the health  community's response to the AIDS epidemic by dismissing all gays simply as  "sinners" in need of redemption and perhaps even punishment. It's a cruel and  simplistic approach to a disease that is killing people in all socioeconomic  groups.  </P> <P> That leaves Rohrabacher, who seems to be trying to take the path from Orange  County to political fame first blazed by Richard M. Nixon as a congressman:  adopt an extreme position on one issue and demagogue it to death. Having no  Alger Hiss to kick around, Rohrabacher joined with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to  try to dismantle the NEA. So far, Congress has wisely resisted their efforts,  but much damage has been done to artistic expression.  </P> <P> All in all, it's a mixed bag of representation for Orange County, which  deserves better.  </P></p>

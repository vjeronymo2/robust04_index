			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux set to endorse Messier The succession struggle at Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utility, appears to be over. Next week's board meeting is expected to endorse Mr Jean-Marie Messier, a 37-year-old Lazard Freres investment banker, as heir to Mr Guy Dejouany, the 73-year-old chairman. The only clear dissenter in the 13-man board remains Mr Jacques Calvet, the head of the Peugeot car group, who at the November 23 board meeting is expected to carry out his public threat to resign from CGE if Mr Messier is 'parachuted' in at such a high level. He said he did not doubt Mr Messier's ability nor his character but complained that the Lazards banker had no industrial experience. Mr Calvet's reservations were initially shared by a few other CGE board members. However, they have since decided that to repudiate Mr Dejouany's strong desire to make Mr Messier his heir would provoke a boardroom row that the group could ill afford.</p>

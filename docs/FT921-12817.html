			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Enthusiasts may spoil the scenery - Investment Trusts / Still the new issues come. Can the good times last, or will supply exceed demand? IS THE investment trust industry over-doing it? The recent enthusiasm of private investors for the sector has provoked a flurry of new issues, many of them linked to personal equity plans. Eventually this supply will overwhelm demand. The question is: when? It might have been thought M&amp;G's success in raising Pounds 246m for its income trust last year would have soaked up the bulk of private-investor demand. Obviously, even M&amp;G did not think so and it is launching yet another trust - based on its Recovery fund. And another major trust is currently being launched - the Fleming Income and Capital Investment Trust. Fleming is aiming for a minimum of Pounds 50m, with a possible maximum of Pounds 250m. Like many other recent trust launches, Fleming Income and Capital has a split structure, with zero dividend (for steady capital appreciation) and ordinary income (for yield and a geared capital performance) shares. The hope is that the split structure will prevent the trust from trading at a discount - traditionally the great barrier to investment-trust new issues. The trust will aim for an overall yield of 6.9 per cent, which will result in a yield on the ordinary income shares of 9.3 per cent - highly attractive if they can be held in a Pep. And, indeed, the trust is deliberately launched at a time to exploit a loophole in the Pep rules - a full Pounds 6,000 of shares can be placed in a Pep in each of the 1991-92 and 1992-93 tax years. The enthusiasm for investment trusts has been supported by their manifest outperformance of unit trusts over the past few years. However, it is doubtful whether this is repeatable. A large part of the share-price outperformance has been attributable to the narrowing of the discount to net assets on which shares trade. In a neatly virtuous circle, the narrowing of the discount has, in turn, been prompted by the return of the private investor. Although it is arguable that the discount will not widen to its old levels of over 25 per cent, there is less scope for it to narrow further. Many trusts still have institutional shareholders which are willing sellers. In addition, investment trusts are also losing part of their cost edge over their unitised rivals, now that trusts are paying 3 per cent commissions to advisers. Risk is also a factor. Investors who have bought some of the recent split-capital issues may not understand the nature of the risk/reward profile of their shares; and the fact that the discount may widen, and that investment trusts can 'gear up' by borrowing, may also have eluded them. In short, there is a danger that investment trusts will suffer the 'tourist syndrome'. They were delightful havens when only few people knew about them; but now that they have been discovered by the whole world, they may get spoiled by over-development.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 14 May PAHAPAEVALEHT, RAHVA HAAL, HOMMIKULEHT, pp 6, </F> 1, 3; "News Bulletin" No. 93/94]    [Text] Foreign Minister Juri Luik held a news conference  on Friday [13 May], describing his visits to Warsaw, Brussels,  and Luxembourg last week.    The admission of the Baltic states in the Western European  Union [WEU] as associated members is a clear sign that the  European Union considers them its future members, Luik told the  news conference. He stressed that the decision had been made at  the initiative of the French and German foreign ministers,  although the associate membership agreements are to be concluded  in the autumn only. The foreign minister added that the WEU is  an increasingly defence-oriented organisation, whose membership  will increase the security of the Baltic states.    Most European states demand the withdrawal of the Russian  forces by 31 August Luik went on. He stressed that support to  the claim had been expressed by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej  Olechowski and the representatives of the Council of Europe  Committee of Ministers at the Strasbourg session of the  committee.    The Polish foreign minister also recommended that the Baltic  leaders should take advantage of President Clinton's visit to  Poland in July and meet the U.S. President.    Luik also mentioned the hope of Russian Ambassador Aleksandr  Trofimov that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will  attend the meeting of the Baltic Sea countries' foreign  ministers meeting in Tallinn on 24-25 May.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO OPINIONS ON NAVY'S SEAL TRAINING  </P> <P> After reading Nora Zamichow's series on the Navy SEALs, I, like the men  described at the conclusion of the story, was in tears.  </P> <P> I have heard that it is considered quite an accomplishment to have become a  SEAL; however, until now, I never knew what it took to achieve such an  accomplishment.  </P> <P> The excruciating pain, both physical and emotional, these men endured should  humble the most powerful of men. For true power is not in how much money,  prestige or influence one has; rather, it is in courage, strength, perseverance  and humility.  </P> <P> The men who joined the SEAL program are the epitome of this description, and  those who survived the seemingly insurmountable completion of "Hell Week" are  beyond adjectives. They are miracles.  </P> <P> ANIKI COOLEY  </P> <P> Ridgecrest  </P></p>

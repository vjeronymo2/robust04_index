			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Kiev row over rise in fuel prices THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday moved to block big domestic energy price rises by imposing a moratorium on the increases until May 18, when the government's powers to rule by decree will run out. Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister and architect of the government's economic reforms, told the legislature its ban on price rises - resulting from higher rates Ukraine must pay for Russian oil and gas - had no legal validity. His assertion reflects a dispute between parliament and government about the extent of the government's authority to rule by decree. He also pointed out that in the face of increases in the cost of Russian fuel, Ukraine had no choice but to raise domestic prices. Russian officials have said that later this month they will increase the price Ukraine pays for gas by 50 per cent, bringing it to within 60 per cent of world prices. The Ukrainian government boosted electricity prices fivefold and raised coal prices by up to 300 per cent. Mr Ivan Herts, minister for foreign economic relations, said that on the prime minister's instructions he was preparing to shift to world prices in all trade with Russia on July 1. Ukrainian prime minister Leonid Kuchma, and his Russian counterpart, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss bilateral economic relations. But the Ukrainian parliament's rejection of the price increases has put it and the government on a confrontation course likely to break into open conflict over faltering economic reforms on May 18. Mr Kuchma has said he will insist not only on extension of his present authority but will demand the right to legislate without parliamentary approval and that the central bank and State Property Fund, the privatisation body, be brought under cabinet control.</p>

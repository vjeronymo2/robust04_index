Therefore the question of  the new labor compensation has become no less crucial for the  "State Duma boys" than the question of their rights and  authority.    It was decided by a majority of votes to make deputy's  salaries equal to minister's salaries. But as it turned out not  all of the voters knew how much a minister makes. In order to  reveal the secret the speaker had to invite Ye. Gaydar to the  podium. And when the speaker gave the figure of 157,000 rubles  [R] certain deputies "got out their calculators" and decided to  make adjustments. N. Parinov suggested making the salary of a  deputy equal to two ministerial salaries, and A. Volkov  evaluated the monthly work of a deputy at $3,000 (and that is  about R5 million today). But modesty still won out. After all,  increments still have to be added to that salary: 50  percent--for the special nature and intensiveness of labor and  40 percent...for length of service. (Although deputies of the  first convocation were elected for only two years.) In general  the labor compensation for a deputy at first will be almost  R300,000. If parliamentary correspondents had had the right to  vote at meetings of the State Duma I would have suggested 1.5  ministerial salaries because the less a bureaucrat makes the  more inclined he is to take bribes.    It was decided that each deputy would receive the same  amount  (with the exception of the speaker; he is to receive 40 percent  more). And this being the case, the deputies cannot take their  eyes off the fact that A. Chubays, A. Zaveryukha, E. Pamfilova,  S. Shakhray, A. Shokhin, V. Danilov-Danilyan, and Yu. Kalmykov  hold two seats at the same time: in the State Duma and in the  Government. And, in keeping with the proclaimed equality  (monetary), they handed down a "sentence" for the government  minority: "Work in the Government of Russia shall be carried out  on a nonreimbursable (unpaid) basis."    After the question of the deputies' credentials, which give  them the right to immediate reception by leaders and other  officials of organs of state power and local self-government and  the question of the diplomatic passport, and after the solution  to the money problem, naturally, there arose the question of  office and dwelling space. According to the "Temporary  Provisions" adopted by the State Duma on supporting the activity  of deputies, each one is granted office space, and for those who  have become "legal indigents"--dwelling space with furniture and  a telephone although, true, without the right to privatize it.    For now the people from out of town have moved into hotels.  All costs and also the cost of the travel of the deputy and his  family to the capital are at state expense. In Moscow and Moscow  Oblast the people's elect will travel on official transportation  assigned to them personally, and in the outlying areas they will  be given automotive transportation of the local administration,  and in public transportation the deputy will arrange for his own  travel using his credentials. Medical treatment of the deputy  shall be provided at the government level. Vacations last 48  working days. A deputy of the State Duma must be given all kinds  of assistance in the local areas. In order to carry out his  tasks successfully he may appoint up to five assistants and,  naturally, they will not work for free (for five subordinates  there will be two "State Duma" wages).    Before working in parliament even two weeks the deputies  added to the "Temporary Provisions" a point about the  termination of their authority. Upon termination of his  authority the deputy shall move at state expense to the region  (where he came from) and must receive work equal to his previous  work. Following the logic of the temporary document, it would be  possible for S. Shakhray and A. Shokhin upon termination of  their deputy authority to return to their previous posts which  have already been eliminated today--posts of deputy prime  ministers. But the fate of the "Temporary Provisions" which give  the aforementioned benefits will depend on the decision of the  Government of the Russian Federation.

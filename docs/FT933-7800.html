			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Ted Turner expands empire into Hollywood film production MR TED TURNER, the creator of Cable News Network which has transformed television news around the world, has finally satisfied his desire to expand into Hollywood. Mr Turner's Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System is to buy two independent film studios, Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema, for Dollars 672m (Pounds 450m) in cash and shares. TBS will also assume roughly Dollars 170m of the studios' debts. The combination of the two successful studios gives Mr Turner, who is married to the actress Jane Fonda, new muscle in the entertainment industry. He will be able to produce and distribute top quality theatrical films as well as stock his cable empire with fresh programming. Castle Rock has produced hit films such as In the Line of Fire and A Few Good Men. New Line, best known for its low-budget series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Nightmare on Elm Street, has also produced films such as Glengarry Glen Ross. TBS has agreed to acquire privately-held Castle Rock for a reported Dollars 100m in cash plus the repayment of Dollars 46m of debt to Westinghouse Electric, which owns 15 per cent of the studio, and Dollars 15m in debt to Sony Pictures Entertainment, which holds 44 per cent. Turner will also assume another Dollars 100m worth of debt, secured on Castle Rock's future production. The remaining 41 per cent interest in Castle Rock is divided among its five principals, including veteran Hollywood executive Mr Alan Horn and the film director Mr Rob Reiner. Sony will continue to distribute the studio's films until 1997. The acquisition of New Line, a listed company, involves Dollars 511m worth of Turner shares and the assumption of about Dollars 70m in debt. The studio's founder and chairman, Mr Robert Shaye, who owns 27 per cent of the company, stands to make a profit of more than Dollars 100m. Each of New Line's 22m shares will be converted into 0.96 shares of Turner Class B common stock. Based on Turner's closing price of Dollars 24.12 on Tuesday, Turner will issue some 21m Class B shares for the merger. Both deals were announced after the US market closed on Tuesday. Yesterday Turner Class B shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 23. New Line's shares rose Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 19 1/2 .</p>

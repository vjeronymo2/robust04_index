			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MEGA-OPTIMISTS' ARE PART OF A 'CON ACT'  </P> <P> It seems to me that inanities like "Mega-Optimists" (Jan. 17) ought to be  relegated to the astrology column where they belong. While people like the  Naisbitts ("Megatrends 2000" authors John Naisbitt and Patricia Aburdene) try  to put a veneer of respectability on their crystal ball by using computers to  make their predictions sound like science, anyone who knows anything about  computers or science knows that futurism is a con act.  </P> <P> The reason people like the Naisbitts are popular is the same reason ancient  kings hired prophets and modern rulers hire "experts." They tell them what they  like to hear, and they help them sell their policies to their constituencies by  supplying an aura of wisdom and inevitability to whatever nonsense they want  the people to believe.  </P> <P> Most of the forecasts are rather banal stuff that any thinking person can  predict, but let us consider a couple of the "trend" items that these people  are so optimistic about.  </P> <P> The first "trend" item that Naisbitt is trying to sell us is the idea that some  great cosmic evolutionary force is moving us in a direction that will shift us  from being an industrial society into one of service that is based on the  creation and distribution of information. He even wants us to believe that we  will benefit from this change.  </P> <P> Of all the inane ideas that have been sold to the American people, the one that  tells us that we can prosper as an economic power without making things is the  dumbest. Information is not an end, except at universities, and information  without a purpose is just useless gossip.  </P> <P> People who think that it is OK to turn us into a service economy haven't  thought about what a service economy really is. A trip to Mexico will make the  issue very clear. The Mexicans know the real meaning of a service economy: They  live in one. It means waiting on tables and shining the shoes of rich  foreigners who can afford to do things in your own country that you can't.  </P> <P> The other optimistic trend that these people keep pushing is the notion of a  "world economy" instead of a "national economy." Again, people who think that  this is a good direction haven't thought about the implications involved. While  it is true that turning the world into one gigantic free market benefits  multinational corporations because it provides them with bigger markets and a  cheaper labor pool, it is hard to see how it can possibly be good for the rest  of us who end up trading good paying production jobs for minimum wage work at  fast-food stores.  </P> <P> Contrary to what Naisbitt claims, these trends are neither inevitable nor are  they good for most of us.  </P> <P> SANFORD THIER, Irvine  </P></p>

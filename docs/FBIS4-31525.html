			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 9 Jun (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Lukic, prime  minister of the Srpska republic, today sent a letter to Yasushi  Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy for former Yugoslavia,  expressing concern over the provocative conduct by UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] soldiers in the area of Gorazde.    The letter reads:    Your Excellency,    I would like to express profound concern over the situation  in the three-kilometer exclusion zone around Gorazde, created by  hostile conduct by UN personnel toward the Serb civilian  population. This problem was also present before, but it has  exacerbated with the arrival of the Canadian troops in this  area. On several occasions our civilians were ill-treated, even  surrounded by armored vehicles and UN personnel, held at  gun-point, had their personal belongings searched without  authorization, and generally exposed to crude treatment. The  most serious of all these problems is that the Canadian soldiers  demand that the Serbs leave this zone, thus evicting them from  their houses using brutal methods. We fear that such behavior  is leading toward armed incidents with unforeseeable  consequences.    The agreement on Gorazde does not authorize such treatment  of  Serb civilians. The prevailing impression among the civilians is  that they will be gradually evicted from the area, which the UN  will then hand over to the Muslims. Such unhealthy conditions  can easily lead to incidents, and we believe that it is only a  question of time when incidents will start occurring.    We are therefore suggesting that you forward this protest to  the UNPROFOR military command and instruct the command to issue  orders for the fair treatment of civilians in the  three-kilometer exclusion zone around Gorazde. The situation is  so serious that if no radical change takes place, we will either  provide police escorts for our civilians or allow events to  dictate the situation on the ground. Please treat this problem  as one of exceptional importance. Thank you for your  understanding.    Yours sincerely,Vladimir Lukic</p>

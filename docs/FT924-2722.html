			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Senate committee approves debt deal THE Brazilian Senate commission on foreign debt yesterday approved the text of a Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.9bn) debt agreement with commercial creditors. Approval of the agreement, which was reached in July and finalised in September, had been held up by the ousting of President Fernando Collor and objections to the text by some left-wing senators. Delays caused the price of Brazilian debt on the secondary markets to fall to less than 27 cents this week. The 27-member commission voted by an absolute majority to approve the text, although four senators recommended a delay for further studies on Brazil's capacity to pay. It goes to the plenary for approval. Senator Jose Fogaca, rapporteur of the commission, said: 'Today's vote. . . is an important step towards Brazil's full re-entry into the international financial community and should encourage new flows of foreign capital.' However, a New York-based debt trader said he did not expect the price to rise much 'because of the general lack of good news out of Brazil'. There is considerable doubt over the future of the agreement. The new economic team cancelled talks with the International Monetary Fund over the Dollars 2.1bn accord signed in January which has lapsed because of the country's failure to meet targets. An IMF agreement is considered crucial for the deal and its absence is blocking the disbursement of credits.</p>

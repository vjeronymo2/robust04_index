			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Arts: Adelaide Festival Lithuanian actors throwing sugar lumps around the stage; Japanese actresses ensnaring each other with scarlet cords; Australians gang-banging an Aboriginal girl - it must be an arts festival. Indeed it is, and still one of the leading runners in an over-crowded field. The Adelaide Festival has been around long enough to get most things right. It happens every two years, which allows time for anticipation; it changes its director each festival, which stimulates fresh ideas; it is held in a city with a reputation for puritanism, which encourages creative conflict; and it takes place in a beautiful place in late summer, which ensures the enthusiastic co-operation of international artists. This year's director, Rob Brookman, reckons that Adelaide has the edge over Edinburgh. It is certainly larger - a turnover of ADollars 8.5m finances 700 performances - than its northern rival, but it does not quite have the same buzz. Its fringe is smaller and less effervescent, and Adelaide does not attract the street performers, the specialist book, film, and television festivals running in tandem, the foreign tourists, the excesses which make Edinburgh supreme. But on three successive nights in Adelaide I saw plays which for intensity and variety could not be matched anywhere in the world. The Square, by the State Theatre of Lithuania, seems at first to be a caricature of East European drama. It is set in a Gulag, features an unnamed, uncharged, prisoner, and even has a goose-stepping, klaxon-honking guard to dictate the stage. Then there is the girl, who perhaps exists in his fantasy, whom he somehow communicates with, who eventually comes to visit him. There is thankfully little respect for reality in Woven Hell by the Japanese writer Rio Kishida, which pursues a fascinating path between the arcane ritual of Noh and Kubuki and modern Japanese drama which has drunk deeply from western Expressionism. From the mesmerising music, through the darkness penetrated by spotlights on the actors faces, with poetic repetetive chanting, a tale of revenge is enacted in another prison, this time a silk factory where young women are forced to weave by day and entertain men by night. Into this mysterious dungeon wanders Cocoon, a young women clutching a knotted cord. Undo the knots and you regain your memory, and control over your life. Cocoon is seeking her mother among the spinners, but as she manages to unravel the cord she remembers that her mission is to kill her mother in revenge for the murder of Cocoon's lover. The linguistic metaphors may be lost on westerners, although the plangent music and knell like voices convey enough symbolic meaning, but the visual metaphors are very powerful as Cocoon offers the cord to the trapped and numbed women. Eventually it is grasped by her mother, who, as Cocoon pulls her remorselessly towards her, remembers her crime. The cord becomes a cats cradle that suffocates the mother, and eventually the guards, as the women recover their histories and their freedom. There is no interval either in funerals &amp; CIRCUSES: instead the audience is treated to a talent contest complete with raffle. This is a good example of the Australian love of walkabout, a peripatetic performance of a play by the aboriginal Roger Bennett to music by Paul Kelly, reckoned to be Australia's leading contemporary singer-songwriter. We start at the bar of the tiny Theatre 62 then jostle into a room decked out as a chapel where Ben Bean, played by Bennett, is to marry his young, white girlfriend, much to the disgust of her policeman father and the other residents of a small outback town. Then it is back to the main auditorium. What follows is a dissection of Australian society you don't see on the television soaps: the racial conflict on the edge of the bush with the aboriginals very much the outsiders. While the whites enjoy their circuses, the blacks put all their life into funerals as the body of a murdered youth is carried, with ritualistic moaning, back to the 'chapel' for another ceremony. Some of the performances were soft; the plot was pretty predictable (very black and white), but the emotions underlying the piece obviously gripped the players and the audience. All three plays should travel the world. They demonstrate Adelaide's success in delving below 'high art', capturing ground from the so called 'Fringe'. Perhaps in reaction the Fringe here goes totally ape, forming a boisterous, convivial, non-stop party, based around the Lions Arts centre. Here you find familiar Edinburgh faces such as Dillie Keane, Lily Savage, and Stomp, along with acts preparing for Edinburgh like Syudney Front, a performance art troupe which threatened to go beyond the limit but actually stayed very structured. OK, so in its version of Don Juan, an actor stands naked while an actress powders and primps his penis while an actress strips off beseeching someone to ravish her. But all the time the audience is shepherded carefully around the acting space and the barrier between performers and punters is never bridged. When a member of the audience is persuaded to strip naked and stand stationary for two minutes while the cast disappear for a break the feeling of control becomes paramount. The confined space, the darkness, the physicality of the players, promise tension but, performed against a distorted recording of Mozart's Don Giovanni, what begins as a threatening experience degenerates into an organised walk.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Bundesbank signal ignored THE D-MARK failed to make any new headway against the dollar and European currencies in Europe yesterday despite the fact that the Bundesbank failed to change official rate policy at its council meeting, writes James Blitz. In the run-up to the last two Bundesbank council meetings, the failure to change policy has been followed by a sharp wave of D-Mark buying in the markets. However, earlier this week, the Bundesbank repeatedly signalled that policy would remain tight and this expectation had already been priced into the market. Dealers continue to assume, however, that the direction of German rate movements is firmly downwards and that there will be another cut in the discount rate before the end of the year. Against this background, the dollar closed at DM1.5415, up from a previous close of DM1.5385. It suffered a set-back later on in American trading, however, dropping back to DM1.5380. Though the general expectation is for downward moves in German interest rates, creeping fears are starting to emerge that the speed at which the Bundesbank will ease policy will be a good deal slower than the market expects. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, pointed to several factors yesterday which underlined this view. One was the rise in annual consumer price inflation to October in the western part of Germany by 3.8 per cent, an increase of 0.4 per cent on the month. A second concern was the continuing debate in the German government over whether the budget deficit - and subsidies to east German industry - should be cut, or whether there should be increased taxes. Mr Lyons believes that some currency turbulence could return if German policy does not become clearer in the next few weeks. Yesterday, though, there were increasing signs that the currency tensions have eased. The Bank of France managed to reduce the rate at which it lends through its 5-10 day lending window by 1.5 percentage points, back to 10.5 per cent where it was 5 weeks ago. The franc was unaffected by the move, closing unchanged at FFr3.3920. The lira also continued to rally as key parts of the Italian government's emergency programme received parliamentary approval. In New York last night, it was trading at L853.75 from a previous close in London of L862.4, adding to speculation that the lira could re-enter the European exchange rate mechanism before the end of the year. As financial markets waited for news of the chancellor's Mansion House speech, sterling continued to lose ground on speculation that another cut in UK base rates was imminent. The pound closed down  3/4 of a pfennig against the D-Mark at DM2.4200.</p>

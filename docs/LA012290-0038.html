			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CHEST PAINS TERMED TREATABLE  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of American women diagnosed each year with chest pain and no  signs of heart disease may be suffering from a treatable disorder of the small  arteries, a researcher said last week.  </P> <P> Many of these women, who often experience intense pain, are being treated for  psychiatric disorders because no physical symptoms can be found with  conventional tests, said Dr. Richard Cannon of the National Heart, Lung and  Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> His studies have shown that many of the patients are suffering from a disorder  he calls microvascular angina, in which blood flow may be blocked in very tiny  arteries that nourish the heart. A variety of treatments exist to relieve the  pain, Cannon said, including many of the standard heart drugs.  </P> <P> Although microvascular angina is not a psychiatric condition, some psychiatric  drugs also appear to relieve the chest pain, perhaps because they alleviate a  disorder in the nervous system's regulation of certain muscles.  </P> <P> His current hypothesis is that the condition may be the result of improper  signals being sent from the body to the brain, or a problem in the brain's  analysis of those signals.  </P></p>

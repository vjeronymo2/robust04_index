			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Former President Jose Sarney was defeated twice  on 18 May at the Federal Supreme Court [STF]. By a 10-1 vote,  the STF first turned down a petition filed by the Social  Christian Party [PSC] requesting an extension of the period in  which a prospective candidate can join the party for which he  will be running. The STF thus dismissed the PSC contention that  the deadlines established by the electoral laws are  unconstitutional. By a unanimous decision, the STF also ruled  that incumbent senators are not, by virtue of their office  alone, entitled to seek their party's nomination to any elective  office at the party convention. As a result of those two  rulings, Sarney will not be able to join another party to seek  his presidential nomination. [passage omitted]    Through his aides, Senator Sarney announced that he will not  leave the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party [PMDB]. He has  already decided, however, not to attend the PMDB convention  scheduled for 22 May. He has concluded that the situation  within the PMDB remains favorable to Orestes Quercia. Sarney is  determined, however, to continue participating in the succession  process, but he will only decide how he will do this within the  next few days. [passage omitted]    Sarney will wait for the Sao Paulo Superior Court ruling in  Quercia's case before deciding to support the presidential  candidacy of Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Brazilian Social  Democracy Party). Quercia is facing charges of fraud in  connection with electronic equipment imported from Israel during  the final stage of his tenure as Sao Paulo governor. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Guys and Dolls - Theatre Royal, Plymouth Anglo-German relations have taken a theatrical turn with a joint production of Guys and Dolls by the Theatre Royal, Plymouth and the Deutsches Schauspielhaus, Hamburg, backed by the Arts Council of Great Britain. Why the two companies should have chosen an American musical for what is billed as the theatre's first venture into the single European market is their business; there can be little no doubt, however, about the universal appeal of the piece, if it is well done. In Plymouth, it is spectacular. A great deal of talent has been assembled. The director is Michael Bogdanov, who has his connections with the German theatre as well as the English Shakespeare Company. Adelaide, the girl who has been engaged for 14 years and still cannot quite get Nathan Detroit to the altar, is played by Barbara Windsor, who will be forever remembered for her performances in the early Joan Littlewood productions at Stratford East. The Schauspielhaus provides the sets and properties, and very striking some of them are. The English provide the players. A first impression is simply of the sheer ambition of the production. Here is a large stage well filled with West 46th Street. The skyscrapers tower; the neon-lighting does whatever it is supposed to do. On the ground, and under, the Salvation Army competes for space with the crap game and the law. None of that seems in the slightest way incongruous. Then there is the attention to detail. Look at the men's jackets, the gloriously gaudy colours of their suits, sometimes waistcoats, hats and ties. The gamblers twitch physically while waiting for a game that may not take place. The production is superb when it comes to highlighting a particular incident: see the look on Sky Masterman's face when luck really does turn out to be a lady, or Lieutenant Brannigan's expression on entering the mission hall only to find the gamblers turned holy. Again, there is the strength of the ensemble playing. Ms Windsor still has a lot going for her. She has the old unmistakeable squeaky voice and way of moving. At Plymouth on Saturday her legs became entangled with a microphone cord; she got out of it admirably. She is a star in her own right, but when she sings 'Take Back Your Mink', it is the ensemble as a whole that you will look at just as closely. Much the same goes for the even bigger number 'Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat'. It comes when the gamblers are assembled with the brothers and sisters in the mission hall. There are no stars because everybody on stage performs with such precision and co-ordination. It has always been a moot point whether the top couple in Guys and Dolls is Adelaide and Nathan (played by Gareth Hunt), or Sky the gambler and Sarah Brown of the Salvation Army. Here let us call it even, while adding that Paul Greenwood as Sky and Jacinta Mulcahy as Sarah turn it into a race worth watching. Top of the lot is Steve O'Hara's Nicely-Nicely Johnson. How could anyone resist a name like that? He joins the Salvation Army in the end and plays the drum. The production is at Plymouth until May 4, then tours the English regions.</p>

Mission Trail is affiliated with Coast Oil Company (Coast), a firm that previously received a full small purchaser refund of $5,000 in principal in the ARCO proceeding. In the case of multiple refund applications filed by affiliated firms in the same proceeding, the submissions are consolidated in considering the applicants' eligibility for a refund. Therefore, the Mission Trail refund was calculated based upon the consolidated Mission Trail and Coast volumes under the mid-range presumption less the previous refund of $5,000 that had been granted to Coast. Thus Mission Trail was granted a refund of $9,194, representing $5,463 in principal and $3,731 in interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Gulf Oil Corporation/ M.A. and M.T.

Moon, operators of Moon and Sons Gulf. Under Case No. RF300&hyph;10430, Gary Towerville, manager of Moon and Sons Gulf and stepson of M.A. Moon, previously applied for and received a refund based on estimated purchases of 2,569,360 gallons. This Application for Refund was granted in full on November 9, 1989. Under the Case No. RF300&hyph;16446, Resource Refunds, Inc. filed an Application for Moon and Sons Gulf, claiming that the station should receive a refund based on 2,703,870 gallons. This Application incorrectly stated that the applicant had not previously filed for a refund in this proceeding. Because the second Application claimed a refund for 2,569,360 gallons previously included in the earlier filing, it therefore was granted for purchases of only 134,510 gallons. Furthermore, this Decision discusses the responsibility of filing agents to maintain the accuracy of their case files, and it reminded Resource Refunds, Inc. of this obligation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Gulf Oil Corp./Ripley &amp; Fletcher Co. RF300&hyph;14073, C.N. Brown Co., 12/15/93, RF300&hyph;16858 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two affiliated Applications for Refund filed by Wilson, Keller &amp; Associates, Inc. in the Gulf Oil Corporation special refund proceeding. In the first application, Ripley &amp; Fletcher Co. (Ripley) claimed a refund as a reseller based on the purchase of 193,564,655 gallons of Gulf petroleum product. In the second application, C.N. Brown Co. (CNB) claimed a refund based on its purchase of 8,623,679 gallons under consignment. As both applicants were under common ownership and control during the Gulf refund period, they were considered together and approved for the maximum principal amount of $50,000 under the 40 percent presumption. Ripley and CNB could not take advantage of the consignee presumption because it would have raised their combined principal amount beyond the $50,000 limit and both applicants had chosen not to prove injury. Accordingly, the DOE granted Ripley a refund of $86,250 ($48,000 principal plus $38,250 interest and CNB a refund of $3,594 ($2,000 principal and $1,594 interest). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Gulf Oil Corporation/Southern Jersey Airways, Inc., 12/17/93, RF300&hyph;19732 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund submitted in the Gulf Oil Corporation special refund proceeding by LK, Inc. (LK), a filing agency, on behalf of Southern Jersey Airways, Inc. (Southern). In considering the refund claim, the DOE noted that LK was authorized to represent Southern, a firm in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. The DOE found that this arrangement would provide restitution to Southern's estate. Accordingly, a refund in the amount of $7,716 was granted to LK, which will notify the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of its receipt of the refund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

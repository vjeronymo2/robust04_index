			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Ford workers 'in battle for sheer survival': Robert Taylor is told about job fears at Dagenham THE MOOD earlier this week among car workers at a branch meeting of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union across the road from Ford Motor Company's paint, trim and assembly plant in Dagenham was both angry and anxious. 'There is a lot of fear in the plant,' said one. 'Nobody feels safe.' Another added: 'It's getting very brutal in there. Workers are being fingered and told they are going to lose their jobs whether they like it or not.' Whether this truly reflects what the majority of workers think about the company's threat of sackings if voluntary redundancy targets are not met may be questionable. Ford wants 560 production workers out of 7,500 at Dagenham to go and it is believed to be half way to that figure. Some workers, however, see Ford's threat as the thin end of the wedge. 'We are in a battle for sheer survival,' explained one electrician over a pint in the Mill House social club after the union meeting. 'The very future of Dagenham is at stake. For every job in the plant there are another three outside dependent on the company.' Ford's sprawling complex in east London once enjoyed a reputation for industrial militancy. In the 1950s and 1960s it became a byword for unofficial strikes, tough shop stewards and wage-push inflation among the emerging affluent working class. It inflicted the last Labour government's first defeat in the 1978-1979 'winter of discontent', when Ford workers burst through the 5 per cent incomes policy. Now workers are very much on the defensive. 'We feel we have been pushed around long enough,' said one maintenance worker. 'Men are being called off the line and told they're going to have to go,' added another. 'One bloke I know on a training course was informed he was on his way out.' In other plants workers have received individual letters to tell them they have no future in the company. But in spite of the outpouring of complaints Ford might get its way. The company will not disclose the general terms of its voluntary redundancy scheme but it is telling workers individually they would be better off to take the money while it is on offer. Mr Seamus Riley, a 28-year-old electrician from County Galway, has worked for Ford at Dagenham for nearly 4 1/2 years. A single man and a shop steward, he does not want to give up his job but has been told he is on the list of those who will have to go. Like others he faces an invidious choice. If he agrees to leave before the end of this month he will receive just over Pounds 6,650 in severance pay. But he has been told that if he turns it down and is then dismissed he will receive only Pounds 820 from the state redundancy scheme. 'The company are not offering me enough and there are no other jobs in this area for electricians,' he argues, waving his redundancy note. But for many older workers the choice between cash in the hand now or a pittance from the state next month may well prove decisive. 'It is bribery but it has worked in the past,' admitted one local union official.</p>

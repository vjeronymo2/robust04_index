			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / US investors nurse bruises from peso crisis The devaluation of the Mexican peso and the country's financial crisis have left US financial institutions - the largest investors in Mexico - nursing some nasty bruises. Economists are worried that US mutual funds, banks, and securities houses may shy away from investing in Mexico. There is already evidence that some are withdrawing altogether, at least temporarily. One US mutual fund is said to have decided to liquidate its peso-exposed investments after seeing the value of its Mexican holdings decline as much as 20 per cent. According to a debt trader at one US bank, the fund is selling the securities in anticipation of redemptions that may come in after the fund sends out its year-end statement in several weeks. The trader said that the fund had bought at least Dollars 150m of the debt of a large Mexican company at an issue price of Dollars 102. After the crisis broke, it tried to sell the paper for Dollars 92, but had trouble finding buyers. For another fund group, Massachusetts Financial Services of Boston, the currency crisis meant a loss of about Dollars 11m across several funds with total assets of more than Dollars 3bn. Mr Jeffrey Kaufman, who manages emerging market debt for several of the company's mutual funds, said that in the wake of uncertainty about the government's economic plan the company pulled all its peso-exposed debt out of Mexico. But, he added, 'I don't view our exit as permanent because I think the Mexican government can take steps to rebuild its credibility.' According to the latest figures from the Securities Industry Association, US investment in Mexican stocks totalled more than Dollars 1bn in the middle of this year. In the Mexican debt market, US investors held more than Dollars 2.2bn as of last June. On the equities side, analysts calculate that the dollar value of US investments in Mexican stocks would have declined more than 30 per cent if they had been held throughout the week-long crisis. Lipper Analytical, a research firm, said that open-ended Mexican equity funds in the US declined an average 25 per cent between December 16 and December 23 and open-ended bond funds fell by an average of 16 per cent over the same period. In spite of these losses, however, most US funds dedicated primarily to Mexico or emerging markets appear to have decided to see out the crisis. Mr William Truscott, assistant manager of the Scudder Latin America Fund, which held about 30 per cent of its Dollars 726m in assets in peso-denominated securities, said he would stay the course in Latin America although the fund had lost about 20 per cent since the first devaluation on December 19. Like many other managers, Mr Truscott expressed anger over the way the month-old administration of Mr Ernesto Zedillo chose to execute the devaluation. 'There is general shock,' he said. 'The handling of this problem by the current administration stands in stark contrast to the Salinas administration where there was always a plan and a contingency plan if that plan didn't work.' Mr Truscott and others are now waiting to see the economic plan Mr Zedillo is scheduled to outline on January 2. Mr Lawrence Goodman, an economist who specialises in Latin America at securities firm Salomon Brothers, warned that investors should expect volatility in the markets until the plan is announced. 'What we are seeing now is that, independent of a programme, there are waves of speculation that are leading to massive swings both in the currency and the equity and fixed income markets. There is a fair amount of concern among investors related to credibility that has been jeopardised,' said Mr Goodman. For US commercial and investment banks, meanwhile, the immediate fallout from the peso devaluation has been the losses incurred on their portfolios of Mexican debt securities. Mr James Hanbury, banking analyst at Wertheim Schroder in New York, said the peso's decline ensured that a difficult trading year for banks ended on a suitably bleak note. 'In a quarter where securities trading and bond trading profits have been terrible, this will be another piece of bad news.' Not all US banks suffered trading losses. Although shares in Citicorp fell last week after the peso was floated because of concern about the earnings of the US bank with the biggest exposure to Mexico, analysts said the bank was protected because it had a big local currency business in Mexico and so did not need to take risks trading Brady bonds and Latin American debt in New York. Bear Stearns, a big trader in the secondary market for Mexican securities, was also said to have fared well last week. One analyst said the firm told him that it had broken even on its Mexican debt trading during the crisis. Although he was not sure how the firm managed to survive the devaluation unscathed, the analyst said of Bear Stearns: 'They're smart. Also, this (the devaluation) did not exactly come as a total surprise to everybody. They could have been short, or flat. And they could have been lucky.' Now the big questions are, said Mr Hanbury, 'What happens to Mexican credit in 1995? What will the economy do? How will Mexican companies pay their debts when their earnings are in pesos and their debts in dollars? What is the knock-on effect of all this? We just don't know.' The crisis also had serious implications for Mexico's capital-raising ability, he said. 'A good deal of Mexican stocks and bonds are owned by outsiders. That puts them at risk in raising capital, because foreigners will be frightened for a while.'  ----------------------------- MEXICAN TESOBONOS  ----------------------------- Short-term dollar securities falling due in 1995 (Dollars)  ----------------------------- January         3.62bn February        3.49bn March           3.23bn April           1.85bn May             2.72bn June            1.94bn July            3.75bn August          4.14bn September         650m October           864m November        2.20bn December          715m  ----------------------------- Source: Bank of Mexico  -----------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Now we have an interview on the eve of an event.  The first official visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to  Russia begins on 12 January. In this connection our commentator  Lidiya Podolnaya interviewed Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, who made  the preparations for several summits and took part in them in  various capacities, including that of USSR foreign minister.  Aleksandr Aleksandrovich now heads two nongovernmental  organizations, Russia's Foreign Policy Association and the World  Council of Ex-Foreign Ministers. Let us hear the conversation.    [Begin recording] [Podolnaya] Sensations and some kind of  breakthrough are always expected of such summit meetings. Are  there any grounds for expecting something similar from the  present meeting?    [Bessmertnykh] I don't think so -- and that is the good  thing  about it. This summit meeting is one of those rare meetings  which are not overloaded with bureaucratic agenda items.  Officials tend to delight in talking about the 20-25 odd  agreements which presidents are going to sign when, sometimes,  these selfsame presidents have not even set eyes on them. This  means that the presidents have an opportunity, after making each  other's acquaintance in Vancouver and, I think, getting to like  each other, to discuss what kind of Russia Washington wants to  see in the near future ...    [Podolnaya, interrupting] As its partner?    [Bessmertnykh] As its partner, and what kind of America  Moscow would like to see. In other words, the presidents are to  discuss, for the first time perhaps, a strategically very  important task: How these two great powers are to live together  in a changing world. Naturally -- and you are quite right --  they must build this concept on the basis of the premise that  they remain partners, and that they must be partners, but it  will be very important, I think, for the presidents to strip off  the declarative veneer of politics, something which was  achieved, for instance, on Malta, when the presidents of our two  countries frankly told each other that certain events in Europe,  the reunification of Germany, the disappearance of the Warsaw  Pact, the liberation of East Europe, and so on were all possible  in present circumstances. They should say roughly the same  things now about the future development of world forces and the  place of the United States and Russia in this new set-up.    [Podolnaya] Security issues usually dominate talks of this  kind. Of all the questions to be discussed by Clinton and  Yeltsin, which are the ones which require a quick solution in  spite of being the most complex and sensitive?    [Bessmertnykh] I think that this time security should be  examined in a slightly different light. In order to study the  problem of security the two presidents will have to sort out  questions connected with the two states' own national security.  Not everything is clear-cut here. There is still quite a lot  of suspicion, notably among the U.S. political elite. These  people talk with rather surprising frivolity about the revival  of Russian imperialism and accuse Yeltsin's Russia of engaging  in such imperialism. I witnessed this myself during a recent  visit to the United States. This shows that there is no clear  understanding of what Russia's vital interests are and what they  are not. The way in which these vital interests are defended is  another matter. Our president could well assure his American  counterpart that this will be done within the framework of  international law and existing principles governing the conduct  of great powers, as permanent members of the Security Council.  After that has been done, it will be easier to talk about what  is to be done next with nuclear weapons.    It is absolutely vital to reach agreement on the  desirability  of a further reduction in the level of nuclear armaments. The  question of how to complete work connected with nuclear  armaments in the Ukraine is bound to come up, of course, but the  main topic will, nevertheless, be the subject of European  security, notably in the context of the fairly lively debate on  the future of NATO. I think that in this area, too, both sides  should tell each other fairly clearly what they expect of the  North Atlantic organization, NATO, and what they expect of the  future system of European security. Here Russia has its own  interests and it would be no bad thing if the U.S. leadership  was made to understand that these Russian interests must be  respected. But these Russian interests certainly do not  contradict the tasks of pan-European security.    [Podolnaya] On the contrary, the two things actually  coincide.    [Bessmertnykh] They coincide. In practice they complement  each other. If Russia's security interests are adequately  safeguarded, one can safely say that pan-European security has a  chance of surviving. I personally consider that the question of  NATO membership, expansion of NATO, has been prematurely  inflated to unbelievable proportions. Nobody in the West really  wanted to expand this organization by bringing the East and  Central European states into it. In my view President Yeltsin  was absolutely right when, on one occasion, he said that Russia  has no objection, in principle, to certain states joining this  alliance, but in the first place, Russia's interests plainly  decree that this process should take a certain period of time.  Second, the NATO organization must itself be transformed.  After all, this was something we agreed on. It was agreed that  NATO would be transformed into an organization more in keeping  with the present international political and strategic  situation. So, the Russian interest stipulates that this  organization should first be transformed and given new functions  and status. The expansion of this new organization will not  then be a problem.    This range of questions is bound, of course, to be very  important. Here I would also like to mention the problem of  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The year 1995 is  approaching. This is the year when the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty comes up for renewal. I think that, as before, the  United States and Russia should stand side by side on this  question, coordinating all their actions in perfect harmony.  [end recording]</p>

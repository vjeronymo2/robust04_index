			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the "Information Service" newscast] </F>   [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa has stated  that his country has not set political conditions for  reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba at the embassy  level while consular links continue to increase as a result of  tourism, investment, and trade. Figueroa recalled that he had  invited Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to visit Chile  this coming August.    With respect to the decision by eight Cubans to forcibly  remain inside the Chilean Consulate in Havana, the minister  stated that the important issue is to observe international law.  He also reiterated that Cuba does not condone the forceful  occupation of diplomatic missions as a mechanism to leave the  country.    Figueroa stressed that the Cuban authorities had guaranteed  that there would be no reprisals against those who voluntarily  decide to leave the Chilean Consulate and begin normal  procedures to leave the country.</p>

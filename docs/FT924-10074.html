			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: AB Foods With bone-crunching competition in milling and baking, Mr Garry Weston, Associated British Food's chairman, must be glad that his protracted fight to buy British Sugar eventually succeeded. All the more so because the full-year figures show how falling interest rates have eaten into ABF's investment income. Profits of Pounds 139m from sugar this year fully justify the Pounds 880m which the company paid for British Sugar, and while the best of the rationalisation improvements must now be past, some further progress can be expected. Which is more than can be said of the bread business. Arguments rage about whether Ranks Hovis McDougall, ABF or the independent bakers are stoking the price war. But the strong position of the supermarket chains means that the flexible independents are moving to take over the own-label cheap loaf market, while the large groups need that volume to keep unit prices down. So everyone has an incentive to keep the battle for market share going. The woes of this commodity business are only increased by devaluation. If as expected the 'green pound' is devalued within the EC this January, UK wheat prices will rise, but bakers are unlikely to be able to pass on much of the price increase. Thinly-sliced margins will thus be cut further. Fortunately for ABF, its balance sheet is strong. While it too is cutting capacity, it is likely ABF will emerge from the rationalisation process with a higher market share than it went in, whoever wins RHM, But that trench war and the longer-term uncertainties over EC policy in the sugar market make earnings prospects dull. Investors have cut ABF's rating heavily in the last two years. There is little reason for that to change.</p>

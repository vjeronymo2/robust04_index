			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: A route to raising Lloyd's efficiency and giving Names a better deal Sir, As an undergraduate at City of London Polytechnic, I took on the task as part of my third-year thesis of doing an analysis of the problems Lloyd's of London insurance market is facing. I concluded that the following recommendations might be feasible: 100 per cent is too high for stop loss; the limit should be two-thirds of overall premium limit; A diversification rule should be made compulsory of a limit of 10 per cent on each syndicate to limit large losses; Profit-related pay for underwriters should be introduced in an attempt to cut costs; Efficiency of markets can be achieved through consolidation of syndicate agencies; Corporate Names should be encouraged. These would give the existing Names the option to participate with limited liability in companies that have analysts who can advise on the best syndicates. This would undoubtedly improve profitability for Names; Lloyd's should be regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry and NOT be self-regulated. This would sustain public assurance and attract more potential names; Computer technology must be introduced in the market-place, with brokers and underwriters transmitting business via screens. Specialist business could continue on a face-to-face basis. Labour costs would be reduced drastically; Two-year, rather than three-year accounting should be introduced to make the system more efficient; The position of Names should be improved; ie they should have more access to syndicate information through regular circulars; Lloyd's must ensure there is a reasonable spread of internal and external names on all syndicates whereby ALL syndicates must have a maximum 30 per cent of internal names; The Council of Lloyd's should consist of an 80 per cent majority of external representatives, acting totally independently since the present situation proves to be too cosy. I am sure such recommendations will be warmly received by those Names who have suffered heavy losses. Alpa Raja, City of London Polytechnic, Moorgate, London EC2M 6SQ</p>

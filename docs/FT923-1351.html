			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD rallied late on the London bullion market as rumours swept the currency markets of a possible ERM suspension or realignment. Dealers said Australian producer selling had emerged around Dollars 350 a troy ounce as the weakness of the local currency was making sales an attractive proposition. A clutch of LME warehouse stock increases helped to send base metal prices lower from the outset. Three-month COPPER was unable to regain the Dollars 2,420 a tonne support level, and by the close a test of Dollars 2,400 was on the cards. London COCOA closed down from from an earlier one-month high, which had been prompted by chart-based buying. Dealers said there was definite - although not significant - origin selling on forward positions. Analysts Landell Mills Commodities estimated a 188,000 tonne deficit for 1992-93, sharply above last week's Gill &amp; Duffus forecast of 25,000 tonnes. Robusta COFFEE closed down but above support levels after profit taking following a technically driven five-month high of Dollars 826 a tonne for the November contract. 'It looks as though its gone far enough at the moment unless we get some constructive news from the ICO,' one dealer said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

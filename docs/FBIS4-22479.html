			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korneyeva under the rubric "Situation": </F> "Building a House Is Not a Big Deal--or Is It?"]    [Text] Many participants in a republic-wide  conference of builders, which was held last Friday by Tatarstan  Republic Prime Minister M. Sabirov, termed the current condition  of the construction complex of the republic critical.  <H5>  Awash in Debt </H5>   In 1933, only seven facilities were commissioned out of the  30 that had been slated to be commissioned. The capacity that  would have made it possible to increase the output of foodstuffs  and construction materials failed to be commissioned; we did not  succeed in increasing the commissioning of residential buildings  and facilities for social, cultural, and consumer services,  despite increasing the proportion of funds invested in that  sphere.    Last year, buildings with an area of 1.275 million square  meters were built, which comes to 88 percent of the 1992 level.    The main failures in the commissioning of housing occurred  in  Naberezhnye Chelny. Out of 148,000 square meters promised by the  mayoralty of Naberezhnye Chelny, the city checked in with only  32,400 meters. A projection of the KamAZ Joint-Stock Company did  not come true. The main customer for housing in the city failed  to commission a single square meter. The problem in Naberezhnye  Chelny lies in a genuine energy crisis which has developed  there. The shortfall in heat generation comes to 37 percent.  This prevents not only the hooking up of new consumers of heat  but even the normal operation of the existing housing stock.  However, work at the complex of the central boiler plant, which  is slated for commissioning, proceeds at a slow pace.    The output of the construction materials industry continues  to decline. Last year, the decline came to 18.6 percent compared  to 1992. Difficulties in the placement of products in  conjunction with reductions in the volume of construction are  one of the reasons.    Tatarstan Republic Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov, who  made  a report at the conference, referred to the high rate of  inflation, a cutback in budget expenditures, and the striving of  many managers in the construction complex to manage in the old  way and maintain the strength of the work force through, among  other things, "eating away" at the fixed assets as the causes  responsible for the slump in investment activities.    The crisis of nonpayments by customers, which is growing  worse, is a most serious problem. As of 1 January 1994, the  indebtedness of customers came to R185.1 billion, out of which  about one-half was defaulted debt. The rate of growth of  nonpayments and the proportion of defaulted debt in construction  were the highest in the national economy.    Just as in construction, the nonpayment crisis has become  aggravated in the construction materials industry. As of the  beginning of 1994, the indebtedness of buyers for goods, work,  and services came to R19.2 billion, and the debt to  suppliers--to R18.9 billion (of which the debt in default  accounted for 45 percent).    In response to numerous questions from participants in the  conference concerning prospects for the elimination of the debt,  M. Sabirov promised to pay all debts of the Republic of  Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers UKS [Capital Construction  Administration] by the beginning of April. However, he did not  support the notion of introducing mutual-offset arrangements,  citing the extreme technical difficulty and, correspondingly,  ineffectiveness of this procedure.    The main task, said the speaker, is to modify the mechanism  for attracting and using financial resources. In the current  year, priority support will be granted to the sectors which must  ensure the stabilization and steadiness of functioning of the  economy of the republic. We must be prepared for the scope of  financing out of budgetary funds to diminish. Investment out of  the funds of enterprises will not increase, either. It has been  proposed to use the funds of commercial banks and foreign  investment in order to stabilize the volume of capital  investment.  <H5>  Are `Projects in Progress' Forever? </H5>   M. Sabirov called the growth of "projects in progress" a  heavy burden on the economy of the republic. As of the beginning  of 1994, roughly R1.3 trillion in prices in effect were "tied  up" in such facilities. The prime minister stressed that there  is only one way out of this situation: to commission, whatever  it takes, the facilities under construction at which work is  highly advanced and whose operation can generate profits  quickly. Some of the "projects in progress" can be sold to  domestic and foreign entrepreneurs on a competitive basis.  However, developers are not interested in such sales because the  lion's share of proceeds frequently does not end up in their  wallets but rather, for example, in the privatization fund of  the republic. This was the case with the sale of a concert hall  in 1993, when the administration of Kazan received only 30  percent of the cost of the facility.    Enterprises and organizations are in no hurry to put up  "projects in progress" for auctions because of, among other  things, the rapidly growing prices of real estate. In turn,  potential buyers are restrained because of the absence of  property rights to the parcels of land under the facilities  purchased. Apparently, it is necessary to develop and introduce  a package of regulatory documents which will stimulate the  commissioning of facilities, impede the growth of the volume of  construction in progress, and invigorate the market for  construction products. In conjunction with this, the proposal  was aired at the conference to lay a tax on idle property at all  facilities whose construction is in progress.    The State Property Committee of Tatarstan is now preparing a  draft decree on measures to reduce the number of facilities at  which construction is in progress. As was stated, the decree  will envision devices to influence enterprises and their  managers.    All of this may be commendable, but it is worthwhile to  recall that in the USSR, they were fighting "projects in  progress" in capital construction with all their might over the  last 30-40 years; meanwhile, their volume increased year after  year....  <H5>  Housing Policy </H5>   The bold and quite controversial idea that it is precisely  housing construction that can restore the health of the  republic's economy as a whole within a short period of time was  stated at the conference. To this end, a special-purpose  program, "Housing," is being developed in the Republic of  Tatarstan; single-family housing construction should become one  of its main areas.    Well, those wishing to build their own housing are indeed  numerous here. However, as M. Sabirov noted, given its current  cost, the population of the republic is unable to build  single-family dwellings without support from the state. Such  support is envisioned; it will be expressed in the allocation  and sale of parcels of land, easy loans (interest-free and  low-interest), tax relief, and the introduction of mortgage  financing. It is expected that a family of average affluence  will be able to buy out housing built on credit, on the pledge  of real estate, within 25-30 years. M. Sabirov stated that easy  loans for those wishing to build housing will be issued very  shortly.    However, it is important in principle that the right of  low-income citizens to improve their housing conditions in  keeping with waiting lists will continue to exist at the same  time. The only question is with what funds such housing will be  built and, correspondingly, to what extent. The introduction of  preferences for investors is envisioned, in view of the fact  that we cannot manage without attracting off-budget funds into  housing construction. The preferences include the transfer of  residential buildings to be remodeled to entrepreneurs on the  terms of 100-percent financing, with the subsequent transfer to  them of up to 30 percent of the total space as their property;  the sale of dilapidated and unoccupied housing stock to  entrepreneurs and the use of up to 30 percent of the space at  their discretion; the construction of housing and allocation of  parcels of land through tenders.    The "Housing Initiative" corporation which has been  established in the republic is developing a program for  attracting off-budget entities and mortgage investment systems  to housing construction and to the upgrading of the dilapidated  housing stock. The first Joint-Stock Mortgage Bank in the  republic is already being created (founded by the Tatsotsbank,  the "Housing Initiative" corporation, and the  Kazzhilgrazhdanstroy PSO [Production and Construction  Association]). This bank will extend long-term credit for the  construction of civil and industrial facilities on the pledge of  real estate. "Housing Initiative" proposes to build commercial  housing, sell it at auctions, and reinvest the proceeds into new  construction.    The switchover to low-rise buildings is one of the  directions  of the new housing policy. This will it make it possible to use  cheaper local materials more extensively and to use less  expensive small-size construction equipment. It is necessary to  change the output mix of some facilities at prefabricated  concrete plants and other industrial enterprises in the  construction sector which are geared toward medium- and low-rise  [as in the original] housing construction.    As a result, the tenor of the conference turned out to be  approximately like this: Everything is bad, but we cannot just  lay down and die. We must work and look for a way out. Well, the  ability of builders to "take the blows" of fate is commonly  known. It is a pity that with every passing year it is becoming  increasingly difficult to answer what was once a humorous  question: Is it a big deal to build a house?</p>

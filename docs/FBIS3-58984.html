			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 24 (AFP) -- Over 1,000 bee-keepers  converged on European Community headquarters here Monday [21  January] to demand aid for the declining European  honey-producing industry and protection from cut-price honey  imports.    The bee-keepers, mainly from France and Spain, presented a  petition to Greek Agriculture Minister Georges Moraitis,  chairman of the European Community's Council of Agricultural  Ministers, ahead of a meeting of the Council later in the day.    They were protesting the scheduled phase-out of tariffs on  cut-price honey imports, particularly from China, Argentina and  Mexico.    The bee-keepers also want honey to be reclassified as an  agricultural rather than an industrial product so that they can  claim a share of EC agricultural subsidies.    They carried signs such as "Saving the bees means saving  jobs" and "Do not let European agiculture die." There was also  a threat. "Today we bring honey (to Brussels). The next time we  bring the bees," one poster warned.    John Horn, a member of the British Bee-keepers Association,  said the decline of the bee-keeping industry meant that the  pollination of flowers and hence their cultivation was at risk  throughout the European Community.    "Honey bees are responsible for 85 percent of all flower  pollination," he said, adding that the European honey-bee would  perish if bee-keepers were driven out of business and could no  longer protect it against parasites.    The bee-keepers have rejected a European Commission proposal  for anti-dumping tariff protection against imports because this  might disqualify them for direct financial aid, an EC official  said.    Farmers' associations claim there are about 450,000  bee-keepers in the European Community -- including 16,000  full-time professionals.    The demonstration was timed to coincide with the first  meeting of EC agriculture ministers under Greece's six-month  presidency of the Community because Greece is considered  sympathetic to the bee-keepers' cause.    EC officials predicted that the European Commission would be  asked to look at ways to help protect the local apiculture  industry.</p>

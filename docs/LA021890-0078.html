			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKERY FINED $8,610, TOLD TO MAKE CAKES FOR NEEDY  </P> <P> Hansen Cakes Inc. has been fined $8,610 and ordered to donate enough cakes to  feed 2,400 needy youngsters after being convicted of health violations stemming  from "filthy and unsanitary conditions" at its Fairfax area headquarters.  </P> <P> City Atty. James K. Hahn, in announcing the penalties last week, also noted  that the specialty cake baker has spent $11,000 to renovate the bakery, where  it also makes cakes for its outlets in Beverly Hills and Tarzana. Hahn said  owner Gary Hansen has cleared up all public health problems "and turned this  bakery back into an asset to the community."  </P> <P> The cake company, which for 40 years has been a principal caterer to Hollywood  and the entertainment industry, was sentenced Feb. 13 by Los Angeles Municipal  Court Commissioner Joseph Spada. Attorneys for the bakery had pleaded no  contest to four Public Health Code charges.  </P> <P> When filing charges against the bakery in December, Hahn said Hansen Cakes has  had a history of problems over the past 10 years, including cockroach  infestation, deficient housekeeping and occasional vermin infestation.  </P> <P> Hansen said the penalties were extreme, and many of the problems identified by  state health inspectors came during renovations, when the bakery was in  disarray. "On some of the counts, I'm upset," Hansen said. "They did a number  on us."  </P> <P> As part of the penalty, the bakery must donate enough cakes to feed at least  100 people each month at Para Los Ninos, a nonprofit organization assisting  children in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles, and the MacLaren Children's  Center, a county juvenile facility in El Monte. The value of the cakes must  total $1,920 and ultimately feed 2,400 people, Hansen said.  </P> <P> In sentencing Hansen, Spada also placed the company on three years summary  probation and ordered it to pay $5,860 in fines and penalties and $2,750 in  restitution to the state Department of Health Services to cover its  investigative costs.  </P> <P> Health officials say the bakery is one of the largest in the Los Angeles area,  estimating its revenues at about $1 million a year.  </P> <P> The bakery also was cited Dec. 27 by county Health Services inspectors, who  reported finding "active cockroach infestation," and ventilation and  cleanliness problems during a routine inspection.  </P></p>

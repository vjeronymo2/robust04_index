			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Political Editor Danny Gittings] </F>   [Text] Legislation enacting Hong Kong's last two budgets  plus the preliminary stages of Governor Chris Patten's political  reforms may be invalid because of a major constitutional  blunder, the Sunday Morning Post can reveal.    It has emerged that changes allowing John Swaine to replace  the Governor as President of the Legislative Council last year  did not complete the process of becoming law until seven weeks  after his election. As a result the validity of up to 125 Hong  Kong laws, including the sensitive electoral reforms that form  the basis of Mr Patten's on-going row with Beijing, has been  questioned by legal experts.    The Hong Kong Government and the Foreign Office yesterday  denied there was any reason for such doubts, but constitutional  experts warned that the unprecedented situation had potentially  devastating consequences. A clerical error in the Foreign  Office meant the necessary amendments to the Letters Patent and  Royal Instructions had not undergone essential parts of the  process of becoming law, understood to include being signed by  the Queen, before they were gazetted in Hong Kong on February 18  and 19 1993. Mr Swaine was elected President on February 19.    Constitutional experts said this suggested the gazettal --  and Mr Swaine's subsequent election -- were invalid. Since the  amendments only come into effect when properly gazetted, that  would mean they are still not in force. It would also mean Mr  Patten constitutionally remains Legco President, and raises  doubts about the validity of the 125 laws passed under Mr  Swaine's stewardship.    "This is not just some technical irregularity, it means Mr  Swaine is presiding over Legco without any legal authority,"  said University of Hong Kong senior law lecturer Dr Nihal  Jayawickrama, who spent seven years handling such amendments as  secretary for justice in Sri Lanka. "Law making is a very  formal process. The whole point of the rule of law is that  there are steps which have to be taken in the correct order:  what they seem to have done is mistakenly take the final step  too early, and then tried to fill in the blanks afterwards."    Constitutional expert Professor Peter Wesley-Smith, also a  University of Hong Kong law lecturer, said only the courts could  now decide if the 125 laws were valid. "There's never been a  case on anything like this before: it could go all the way to  the Privy Council," he said.    The Government yesterday denied that the blunder had "any  effect on the validity of anything done in Hong Kong". A  Constitutional Affairs Branch spokesman admitted "formalities"  relating to the Royal Instructions amendment were only completed  on March 24, 1993, and the Letters Patent amendment was  finalised even later, on April 15, 1993. However, the spokesman  insisted this did not affect the amendments' validity since they  were approved in draft by the Queen -- the first stage of the  process towards becoming law -- at a Privy Council meeting on  December 17, 1992, more than two months before Mr Swaine's  election.    Despite the spokesman's statement, government officials are  known to be privately concerned that the blunder leaves local  laws open to challenge in the courts, although they insist any  such challenge would be unlikely to succeed. It is understood  the administration -- which has known about the problem for more  than a year -- privately urged the Foreign Office to correct the  blunder, but was rebuffed.    Constitutional experts said that only a special Act of  Parliament, or a fresh Letters Patent listing all 125 laws,  would remove the uncertainties caused by the error.    Legislators who, until now, have been told nothing about the  blunder, are expected to quiz Deputy Secretary for  Constitutional Affairs Leung Chin-man about it at a  Constitutional Development Panel meeting tomorrow morning.  Panel chairman Andrew Wong Wang-fat said while the mistake was  understandable, the cover-up was inexcusable. "This is truly a  major foul-up," he said. "They should have rectified it as soon  as they discovered the error: the more you try to cover up, the  graver it becomes. We now have to see how we can validate  everything Legco has done since then (February 1993). Until  that is done there will always be uncertainty: this puts all  the constitutional reform bills in jeopardy."    Legislative Council legal adviser Jonathan Daw, also  previously unaware of the blunder, said: "The facts, as  presented, appear to be of concern and no doubt members will  wish them to be investigated."    In London, Labour Member of Parliament Gerry Bermingham will  this week table urgent questions in the House of Commons,  seeking more information from Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  about the blunder. Mr Bermingham, whose attempts to obtain  information on the amendments from the British Government have  so far been rebuffed, said he wanted "to dispel the cloud of  mystery which the Foreign Office seems to have thrown around  this subject". "It is becoming increasingly difficult to  ascertain the date the orders came into force. Nobody seems to  have copies of the original documents," he said, after the House  of Commons library informed him copies of the amendments "seem  to be missing". "Questions need to be asked as to when the  orders were actually signed by the Queen and what, if any,  legislation was passed through Legco in accordance with the  terms of the orders. If there was, then there must be a serious  constitutional question over the legality of such legislation.  [no close quotation mark as published]    A list of constitutional amendments, recently issued to  legislators in Hong Kong, carefully concealed the error but did  admit that: "following approval by the Privy Council, a number  of formalities have to be completed before the amendments are  ready to be gazetted in Hong Kong". Listed as examples were  receiving Her Majesty's signature, affixing of the Great Seal  and passing under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet". [no begin  quotation mark as published]    Dr Jayawickrama predicted the Government would resist taking  action to correct the blunder, in the hope that no court would  be prepared to strike Hong Kong laws down. But he warned this  would send the wrong sort of signals to Beijing. "This is very  dangerous, these are constitutional matters and you can't just  treat them so lightly," he said.</p>

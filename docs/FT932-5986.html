			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Commercial leases caught between flaws: How the business property market might be reformed IN THE wake of controversy over new powers for residential leaseholders, the government is turning its attention to commercial leaseholders. Last week the Department of the Environment published a consultation paper in response to 'concerns about the operations of commercial property leases'. Tenants have attacked leases lasting for 25 years, with upward-only rent reviews. They say they are inflationary and inflexible, and the system for agreeing rent charges has forced up their costs when they are fighting for survival. The paper was welcomed by the Property Market Reform Group, a lobbying organisation, which said: 'It opens up the whole issue of the commercial leasehold system and its outdated and inflexible practices. We are hopeful that a better system will come out of it.' The topics under scrutiny are: Upward-only rent reviews. These clauses, which became standard in commercial leases in the mid 1970s, can lock tenants into paying rents well above the market rate. Critics argue that they are inflationary, they expose tenants to unreasonable risk and they lead to more insolvencies. Defenders say the clause balances the risk between tenants and landlords and its abolition could cause a steep fall in capital values. Reforms could include measures such as the prohibition of upward-only review clauses. Other measures, such as allowing rents to move downwards, subject to a floor set by the initial rent, may be considered. Confidentiality clauses. These are used to keep rent agreements secret, so that concessions granted to one tenant are not quoted against the landlord in another negotiation. Critics say that such clauses distort the market and can lead to rents being set higher than they would be otherwise. Supporters say that as the law does not prohibit confidentiality clauses generally, it would be unreasonable to ban them in the property market. Moreover, many property experts say that in practice these clauses have little impact on the market. The options available to the government include banning confidentiality clauses and requiring the details of leases to be registered at the Land Registry. Dispute resolution procedures. Disputes about rent reviews are generally resolved by the appointment of a third party. Some critics say that the system acts against their interests because the third parties - generally surveyors appointed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors - are too closely involved in the property market. The dispute system is also criticised as being too slow and too costly. Supporters of the existing system deny that arbitrators show bias, saying that if they did they would be exposed to claims for professional negligence. They say that the costs of the existing system may well be lower than they would be if a new body were introduced. The department believes there are three options: to take no action; to introduce regulations to control the content of rent-review clauses; and to allow disputed rent reviews to be referred to a government-appointed tribunal. A reasonable degree of support is likely to be received for some of these options. The institution believes 'a fresh look at confidentiality clauses is long overdue'. But, in general, government intervention in commercial leases is likely to be resisted. Most landlords say that the existing system reflects freely negotiated contracts. They say that the market is adjusting of its own accord - few tenants are now prepared to sign 25-year leases with upward-only rent reviews. Landlords fear that any attempt to favour tenants at their expense will deter investors and reduce the property available to rent. Parallels are drawn with the decline of the rented housing sector following legislation supporting tenants' rights. The existing system helps underpin the value of commercial property. Changing leases could lead to further difficulties for banks and financial institutions which have suffered from falling lease values. Indeed, ministers' comments on the subject suggest they will be cautious about legislation. They have already said that no legislation will affect existing contracts - unlike measures in the residential sector in which existing leaseholders are being given new rights to buy. There may be an unwillingness on the part of the government to interfere in freely negotiated contracts. Mr Tony Baldry, junior housing minister, recently stressed that distortions invariably resulted from statutory control. 'The terms of a private contract . . . are entirely a matter for negotiation,' he said. Another reason for caution on the part of the government is that it has already proposed legislation which could have an important impact on the relationship between landlord and tenant. Changes to the law of privity of contract, announced at the end of March, will limit a tenant's responsibility for paying rent throughout the duration of a lease. As a result, it is likely to reduce the security of a building's income and the value of a landlord's investment. The government may be forced to balance the risk of inflicting further damage on the property industry against the opportunity to reform a system which has demonstrated severe flaws in recent years.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Aguilo ousted as chairman at Iberia A SIMMERING boardroom row at Iberia over management of Latin American operations came to a head yesterday when Mr Miguel Aguilo was ousted as chairman of the Spanish national carrier and replaced by Mr Javier Salas, chairman of INI, the state holding company which owns Iberia. Mr Salas, who will continue to run INI, will be seeking to redirect Iberia's Latin American strategy where a string of acquisitions, notably that of Aerolneas Argentinas, has placed onerous burdens on Iberia's already fragile balance sheet. Mr Aguilo's departure was not unexpected. The airline posted pre-tax losses of Pta47.2bn (Dollars 349m) last year and losses are estimated at Pta30bn for this year's first half. INI recently injected Pta120bn of extra capital into Iberia. The outgoing chairman has been blamed for failing to weld Iberia's Latin American operations to those in Europe. 'We haved been unable to make Madrid the European entry point to Latin America and we have frittered away potential economy of scale profits from our Latin American investments,' an Iberia executive said. Aerolneas, Iberia's chief asset in a Latin American arm that includes shareholdings in Venezuela's carrier Viasa and in Chile's Ladeco, is estimated to be losing Dollars 200m a year. Mr Aguilo's exit was foreshadowed earlier this year when Mr Salas appointed Mr Manuel Moran, a senior INI executive, as chief executive of the Argentine airline. About 50 managers and senior technicians have since been sent from Spain in an effort to turn around Aerolneas.</p>

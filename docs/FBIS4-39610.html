			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Two or 3,000 Russian blue helmets in Abkhazia and  more than 1,500 in the Armenian-Azeri conflict zone may be  introduced by Russia in the near future. They will help the  cease- fire and the disengagement of the combatant sides. This  is primarily what Defense Minister Grachev will talk about. An  informed source in the Georgian leadership does not rule out the  possibility of the peacemaking operation in Abkhazia starting  during Grachev's visit to the republic. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: When success is not enough - The Bottom Line Record numbers of Britons are expected to go abroad next year, despite not liking foreign countries very much. A recent survey by travel retailer Lunn Poly found that rainy UK summers were the main reason 9m people were likely to book summer package holidays through agents in 1994. Only 8 per cent had any curiosity about the countries they planned to visit. Investor opinion on Airtours, the second biggest holiday company, bears some resemblance to the British traveller's ambivalent view of foreign parts. There is something undeniably attractive about a company which, in a year still tinged with recession, could increase profits by 49.2 per cent before tax and the costs of an unsuccessful bid. Yet, as with the tourist's fear of strange food and locals who speak English only when they feel like it, there is something which prevents the stock market from embracing Airtours wholeheartedly. The ambivalence is not so much about Airtours as about the package tour sector as a whole. Memories of price wars and corporate collapses have not faded. Nor has the feeling that this is a sector which newcomers can enter without much more than a telephone and a computer. A newcomer, Inspirations, made its debut on the Unlisted Securities Market this week. The company has more than a 'phone and a computer; Vic Fatah, its chief executive, has been in the travel business for over 25 years. Fatah founded Sunmed Holidays, which merged with the package tour arm of British Airways to create Redwing Holidays in 1987. He sold Redwing to tour operator Owners Abroad in 1990. Inspirations appears to be doing well, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m for the 11 months to September 30 compared with Pounds 749,000 for the year to October 31 1992. Airtours, however, should serve as a warning to Inspirations that not even consistent success is enough to impress the stock market. Airtours' pre-tax profits in 1993 were Pounds 45.5m, after Pounds 9m spent on a failed attempt earlier this year to take over Owners Abroad. Profits before bid costs were Pounds 54.5m, up 49.2 per cent on last year. After bid costs, they were up 24.6 per cent. This year's figure after bid costs is an increase of 65.5 per cent on profits of Pounds 27.51m in 1991 - and 774 per cent higher than the 1989 figure of Pounds 5.21m. Airtours' shares have not done badly. From a low of 39p at the end of January 1991, they closed yesterday at 467p. But with expected profits of Pounds 63m next year and earnings per share of 42.3p, the shares are on a prospective multiple of only 11, a little mean for a group that has shown such growth through the recession. The package tour industry does seem established far better than in 1991, when Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, then the second biggest operator, collapsed. Indeed, Airtours - like its larger rival, Thomson - now has its own retail chain, ensuring distribution outlets for its holidays. Inspirations has learned the benefits of vertical integration from its larger competitors. It has struck a deal with with AT Mays, the fourth-largest travel retail chain. This guarantees that around 10 per cent of the shelf space in Mays' 328 outlets will be occupied by Inspirations brochures. In return, Inspirations has undertaken to acquire 50 retail outlets by the end of next year, which will be run by Mays for a management fee. Fatah says the position of independent travel agents is so poor that he can buy them for 3 to 5 per cent of their turnover, compared with 10 per cent a few years back. But however hard tour operators try, investors still fear disaster is around the corner. When Owners Abroad beat off the Airtours bid it promised shareholders a rosy future. Soon after, it announced that profits this year would be half market expectations and that the chairman and managing director were resigning - guaranteeing sickly p/e ratios for the whole sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna by Robert </F> Kotian; place and date not given: "The Crime Rate Is a Common  Phenomenon Today"]    [Excerpts] According to public opinion polls, Slovaks  consider the crime rate to be one of the greatest problems in  Slovakia right now. We spoke about some reasons and certain  interesting cases with Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna.    [Kotian] What are the main reasons for the growing crime  rate, in your opinion? Is the weakness of the new state a  reason for that?    [Tuchyna] We need to look at several sides to this problem.  The high crime rate is not only a Slovak problem; it is a common  phenomenon today in advanced, postcommunist, or totalitarian  countries. We are distinguishing four main reasons for the  growth of the crime rate--socioeconomic, legislative,  international, and personal. After we introduced the market  economy, many people became uneasy because they lost social  guarantees and did not know how to tackle the new situation. On  the other hand, other people are abusing this situation. Many  legal standards at present overlap--the new ones and the  socialist ones. Many are imperfect because they have been  drafted in haste. The people should know the law, but they  often do not know it at all. We are building a law-abiding  society, but we have a disparity here between people's awareness  [of the law] and their actions. From the international  viewpoint, I would like to stress that Slovakia is facing a new  situation, where migration is going hand in hand with the  internationalization of crime. This is a very serious problem  and should be solved at all levels, not only at the level of the  Interior Ministry and the police. We have to search for a  solution and not only in the socioeconomic sphere and the  material security of the people. We also have to complete our  legal system and establish the legal awareness of the people,  which is a long-term affair. The Interior Ministry is much  engaged in international cooperation. The perfection of the  school system, family activity, churches, and social  organizations have positive influence on the development of  personality. Unfortunately, we did not manage to introduce into  our schools lessons on crime, drugs, and their impact on human  personality. [passage omitted]    [Kotian] What is the situation with the readmission  treaties? Do you know how many refugees have been returned from  the Czech Republic?    [Tuchyna] This era is one of movement of nations. Last  year, some 40 million people went through Slovak territory.  More than 10 million transportation vehicles were checked in.  A total of 1,041 people were apprehended when on their way in,  and 1,140 on their way out. A total of 2,422 people were  apprehended because of falsifying or tampering with travel  documents. A total of 82,600 people were returned because of  flaws in travel documents. This is why the international norms  and readmission treaties are important to us. We have concluded  such treaties with practically every country except Hungary. We  want to conclude a standard international treaty with them, as  with all other countries. We cannot conclude a treaty on the  readmission of only Hungarian citizens, which is what they would  like. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The press service of the Defense Ministry has  stated: The Black Sea Fleet command has ordered the dispatch  today of an amphibious warfare ship to Odessa, thus ignoring  emphatic objections by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. The press  service reports that the fleet headquarters previously informed  our Ministry of Defense of the move, arguing that it was caused  by the necessity of bringing a group of officers from the  disbanded 318th division from Odessa to Sevastopol. The request  was denied, since Ukraine's Ministry of Defense is perfectly  capable of transporting the officers itself, either by sea or by  air. Official assurances to this effect have been given to the  Black Sea Fleet command.    The press service stresses that Admiral Baltin and his aides  have now resorted to a step that could aggravate the already  complex situation concerning the Black Sea Fleet. At the same  time, the press service notes, there is concern at the fact that  the fleet command allocated a specialized mobile ship for the  action, which is normally used for amphibious assault landing.  Besides, an escort ship and two fully armed antisubmarine ships  have cast off in Sevastopol today. The Admiral Golovko rocket  cruiser and other combat vessels of the Black Sea Fleet are also  being put on alert.</p>

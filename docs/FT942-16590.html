			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / To Concorde: a dominatrix daughter?: Daniel Green on whether the figures for a second generation of supersonic aircraft would ever add up Concorde's daughter could be a seductive creature. She could combine the slender graceful lines of her parent with the power to dominate the world of business travel. With her extra endurance she could reach across the Pacific Ocean and link Europe with Asia in five hours. Her extra strength could lift 250 people instead of the 100 that cram into her aged ancestor. So it is not surprising that British Aerospace, together with Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace, proposed on Thursday to bring her closer to reality. They now want government money and European Union funds to continue feasibility studies. They are asking for most of the Pounds 60m they say is needed to step up such studies. Independent experts and airline chiefs, however, believe that few of the other numbers add up. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the market for Concorde's daughter is of the order of 100 aircraft - far short of the 500 to 1,000 that the three partners regard as necessary to set up a profitable production line. The calculation runs as follows: Concorde's daughter would attract almost entirely business passengers. At a capacity of 250, that is the equivalent of roughly 2 1/2 Boeing 747 business-class cabins. Because she would take less than half as long to do the journey she is twice as productive. You can double again because, at an optimistic guess, half the current business-class passengers on a route such as Los Angeles to Tokyo might be prepared to pay for a premium-priced ticket. That gives each new Concorde the capacity currently satisfied by 10 Boeing 747s. The 747 is the standard aircraft for long-haul flights and there have been 1,000 sold since 1970, giving a market of 100 for Concorde's child. These kinds of calculations convince City analysts that there is no real chance of the project taking off. Nor do the airlines who would buy her believe the project should be taken too seriously. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, which has been the world's biggest carrier by sales for several years, dismisses the idea of a new generation of supersonic passenger aircraft principally because the project would be too expensive. Mr Sash Tusa, an analyst with stockbroker UBS, says that the commercial cost of each of Concorde's daughters would be 'several hundred million dollars' compared with the price of a subsonic 250-seater of less than Dollars 100m. Mr Crandall adds that there are too many environmental issues to be overcome. These include the sonic boom and damage to the ozone layer from an aircraft that flies much higher than conventional aeroplanes. Mr Rod Muddle, director of planning at British Airways, says that the market estimate of 100 aircraft is reasonable but only a radical design breakthrough would make the aircraft a commercial proposition. 'If it had running costs about 20 per cent higher than a conventional aircraft then we could offer tickets at a small premium price and enough passengers would switch,' he said. Running costs per passenger for today's Concorde are 'several times' those for a Boeing 747, he says. British Airways and Air France would probably be the first buyers of a new supersonic passenger aircraft because their Concorde fleets will become too old to continue flying soon after the year 2005, which is when British Aerospace says the new aircraft would be ready. However the real need for BA and other airlines, especially the Asian operators, is not for glamour but size. Airports are already overcrowded. Larger aircraft would allow more people to fly without trying to trying to cram in more aircraft. 'The timing of the new supersonic aircraft project is bad,' says Mr Muddle. 'The investment is going to be tens of billions of pounds. It should be first spent on a 600-seater aircraft that flies at less than the speed of sound.'</p>

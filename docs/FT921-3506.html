			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / A free trade disagreement: Bernard Simon examines the deterioration in economic relations between Canada and the US Canadians are famous for preferring compromise to conflict, but now they are gearing up for a confrontation. There is no mistaking their anger that their country, the US's biggest trading partner and traditionally among its closest allies, has become one of the prime targets of the rising protectionist tide in Washington. The tensions between the US and Canada may lack some of the spice of Washington's spats with Japan. No Canadian politician or businessman has, for example, excoriated American workers for laziness. Nonetheless, the lengthening list of trade disputes between the world's two biggest trading partners - with two-way trade of more than CDollars 200bn (Pounds 97bn) a year - has important ramifications. The US's actions, most recently directed against cars and softwood lumber, Canada's two biggest southbound exports, have raised questions in Ottawa about Washington's commitment to the spirit, if not the letter, of the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA). It also carries several lessons for the current talks to expand the FTA into a North American Free Trade Area, including Mexico. The friction has particularly worrying implications for Canada's efforts to woo foreign investors with the promise of an open border to the huge market to the south. From Ottawa's point of view, new duties and non-tariff barriers put up by the US send a signal that, despite the free trade agreement, investors might be better off locating factories in America, rather than in Canada. While the federal government in Ottawa remains committed to the 1989 pact, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that 'somebody is taking a tremendous instrument, vitiating its effectiveness, and diminishing its attractiveness for others. I find it penny wise and pound foolish what the Americans are up to.' The US administration's recent actions against Canadian exports could further damage the popularity of the Mulroney government. Mr Mulroney, who receives less than 20 per cent of support in opinion polls and who faces a general election within the next 18 months, has made trade liberalisation with the US one of the cornerstones of his eight years in office. When Canada negotiated the FTA with the US, Mr Mulroney sold the deal to a sceptical electorate as a sort of insurance policy which would give Canadian companies more secure access to their biggest export market. Besides eliminating all customs tariffs by 1998, the FTA provides for a continent-wide market for Canada's oil and gas exports, and a fair and speedy mechanism to resolve trade disputes. The problem for Canada, however, is that the domestic economy was not ready for the shock therapy of free trade. After years of being cosseted by inter-provincial trade barriers and free-spending governments, Canadian businesses and workers have found themselves ill-equipped to go head to head with bigger, lower-cost and more productive US competitors. As a result, the FTA has taken much of the blame for Canada's recession. Falling customs duties have put especially heavy pressure on its food, textile and furniture manufacturers. Many companies which used to have factories on both sides of the border are integrating production in the US. Several Canadian manufacturers, especially of automotive parts, have moved their plants to southern US states. The recent rulings against cars and lumber have reinforced the impression among many Canadians that, far from being favoured trading partners, they are victims of the free trade agreement. Mr Gordon Ritchie, who was Canada's deputy chief negotiator in the FTA talks, observes that 'by any objective measure, you can demonstrate that the Americans have bashed their Canadian cousins harder than their former Japanese enemies'. Earlier this month, the US customs service ruled that Honda cars assembled in Ontario fail to meet the 50 per cent North American-content threshold required for duty-free access to the US under the FTA. The definition of local content is fuzzy and complex and is subject to varying interpretations. Honda and the Canadians are angry that the customs service decided, for instance, that engine blocks assembled in Ohio and shipped north to be installed in Honda cars do not qualify for local content status. At the same time, US trade negotiators are trying to convince the European Community that Hondas made in Ohio are North American and not Japanese cars. The dispute over lumber, involving trade of more than CDollars 3bn a year, has compounded the Canadians' anger. An interim duty imposed on Canadian softwood lumber last October marked the first time the Commerce Department had initiated a subsidy ruling under section 301 of the US Trade Law without calling for evidence of injury to domestic producers. Last Friday, the Commerce Department replaced the interim duty with a 14.5 per cent tariff on Canadian lumber after ruling that sawmills north of the border are subsidised by low tree-cutting fees in provincial forests and by curbs on log exports. These high-profile cases are by no means the only Canadian complaints. Mr Ritchie says some Canadian exporters have found that US duties on their products have gone up, rather than down, since implementation of the FTA, thanks to reclassification of items under different tariff headings. He adds that the tighter inspection of Canadian meat shipments at border crossings begun last year 'is clearly contrary to the understanding of the FTA'. Despite these concerns the Canadians have no intention of backing away from the FTA. The pact has brought one principal advantage: an innovative mechanism to settle disputes. Since the FTA came into force, about two dozen complaints, covering products as varied as raspberries and steel rails, have been referred to arbitration panels comprising relatively independent trade experts from both sides of the border. Most cases have involved Canadian complaints against US agencies, and Canada has won some significant victories. A long dispute over pork ended last year with a panel overturning a decision by the US International Trade Commission that the American pork industry was threatened by imports from Canada. The panel found that the commission had committed errors of law and that its finding of 'imminent material injury' was not supported by the evidence. Both the Honda and the softwood lumber disputes are likely to end up in the laps of dispute settlement panels. The recent bout of trade friction also holds lessons for the negotiations now under way with Mexico to create an expanded, North American free trade area (Nafta). The Honda row, for instance, has persuaded both the Canadians and Mexicans of the need for clearer rules of origin than exist in the FTA. Dr Sylvia Ostry, Canada's former ambassador for multilateral trade negotiations, says the Nafta will require a detailed dispute settlement process to cover not only trade disagreements, but also other issues that have become crucial concerns in the negotiations. Two obvious examples are Mexico's environmental standards and labour laws, which could easily become targets the next time the protectionism bandwagon starts rolling in the US. Trade unions and environmental groups in the US and Canada fear that free trade will encourage many industries to move to Mexico, where wages are lower and pollution standards less strict. With the US election campaign gathering steam, it is unlikely that either President Bush or the US Congress will push hard for a free trade pact in the months ahead. Mr Mulroney is confident that any protectionist tide will ebb once the US election campaign is out of the way. 'As the political season winds down, I think you are going to see a lot of this stuff wind down with it,' he says. Despite the friction with the US, the prime minister says he is still committed to free trade. 'It wouldn't bother me in the least to sign a free trade agreement with Mexico two weeks before an election,' he adds.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Howard yields to critics of police reform The government will today announce that it intends to dilute its proposed police reforms following strong opposition in the Lords last month. Mr Michael Howard,home secretary, will surrender his right to appoint people to chair police authorities in England and Wales as part of a package of changes intend to appease critics and save the police and magistrates courts bill. The bill proposedreplacing police authorities - now made up of two-thirds local councillors andone-third magistrates - with smaller, 16-strong bodies, each containing eight councillors, three magistrates and five other members who would be appointed by the home secretary. Under the changes to be announced today Mr Howard will, as well as surrendering the right to appoint the nominee for the chair, move away from the principle that all committees must be 16-strong. The government now believes that the precise size should be determined by local conditions, but with councillors always having parity with the other members. This means that, on authorities with an uneven number of members, one of the councillors could expect to take the chair. Without this change, local authorities wouldhave regarded the abandonment of the right to appoint a chair as meaningless if, after an 8-8 tie, the decision reverted to the home secretary. The needto amend the bill on matters of central principle will be an embarrassment for the government. Senior police officers and local authority representatives have consistently opposed the changes to police authorities since they were outlined last March. But ministers did not appear to recognise the full depth of concern until the bill came under attack from such heavyweight figures as Lord Whitelaw,the former home secretary and deputy prime minister. It remains unclearto what extent today's concessions will eliminate opposition to the bill. Some critics oppose giving the home secretary any direct powers of appointment to police authorities. Although an arms-length selection process is planned, and Mr Howard has stressed that appointees will not be party-political, there are concerns that it could become a step towards a national police structure under government control. The bill also faces attack over proposals which critics say would reduce the independence of magistrates' clerks.</p>

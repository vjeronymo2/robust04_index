			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Epidemics swamp ailing health system: Chrystia Freeland finds grim prospects for the sick at Moscow's Municipal Hospital No. 32 A young blond man in khaki army fatigues lovingly fondles a machine gun under a sign which announces, in large, hastily scrawled block letters: 'The Toilet Does Not Work'. This is the reception area of Moscow's Municipal Hospital No 32, a stone's throw away from the sparkling, recently restored White House, which is the seat of the Russian government. Bleak conditions like these in state hospitals throughout the former Soviet Union are the daily consequence of a health care crisis which has been dramatically exposed this summer by outbreaks of cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, anthrax and Siberian malignant anthrax. These infectious diseases, which have sprung up everywhere from the Leningrad region on Russia's north-western rim to cities on the Pacific coast, have become so prevalent that one Moscow newspaper has created an 'epidemics' column, which informs readers of the day's newest sickness. Some Russian doctors say that diseases long eliminated in the west have always been prevalent in the Soviet Union but that in the past the Communist regime suppressed news of outbreaks and swiftly imposed a quarantine on infected regions. However, statistically, many parts of the former Soviet Union appear to be suffering a health crisis on a scale normally seen only in wartime. In Russia, Ukraine and Estonia the population is now shrinking, with deaths outnumbering births in some regions by 2 to 1. The shortcomings in Russia's health care system are apparent at Municipal Hospital No 32, an average hospital in the heart of Moscow. Ten people are crammed into each room and there is one bathroom for every 15 patients. Dr Boris Storozhilov, the chief doctor at the hospital, says that part of his hospital's malaise stems from the same fiscal squeeze which is bedeviling Russia's entire economy. When their often delayed wages are paid, the 12 doctors who care for the hospital's 170 patients earn 85,000 roubles a month (about Dollars 39), nurses earn just 65,000 roubles a month (Dollars 30) and nurses' aides get (Dollars 18). 'Obviously, these are miserable salaries given the prices booming around us,' Dr Storozhilov says. 'It is impossible for us to find new, young employees at these rates. Everyone is throwing himself into commerce.' Dr Storozhilov says that the hospital has only one tenth of the nurses' aides it once employed and the staff shortage is so acute that doctors race towards female visitors to the hospital with the hopeful question: 'You're coming about the job?' These 'miserable' wages are one reason why much of Russia's still nominally state medical system is being privatised by stealth. Dr Storozhilov says that 'because of the wild capitalism which is developing all around us and the inability of doctors to do well in this new environment, some doctors take money on the side from their patients for what they should be doing for free.' Hospital No. 32 is also suffering indirectly from the economic decline of Russia's state sector. The federal government finances the hospital's operating costs but in the past, typically in a country in which industry and government were part of a single monolithic system, local factories bought most of the equipment for the hospital. 'Now the factories are even poorer than we are,' Dr Storozhilov says. 'They are working at half capacity and laying workers off, so our medical equipment is rusting away.' Dr Storozhilov has noticed another effect of the collapse of the state factories whose employees his hospital treats. 'Today, sick people are afraid to admit it, in case they get laid off,' Dr Storozhilov says. 'They work until they drop and only then do they come in to the hospital.' When they do arrive, many Russians are now too poor to follow the old Soviet practice of bringing in food from home to supplement their bland hospital diets. 'All the refrigerators on our wards, which used to be over-flowing, are now empty,' Dr Storozhilov says. But if, at Hospital No. 32, it is the worst of times for some Russians things have never been better. About 10 per cent of Russians now buy private medical insurance which gives them the right to be treated at the elite Kremlin hospitals, whose state of the art facilities used to form the 'fourth administration' which ministered to the bodies of politburo members and their families.</p>

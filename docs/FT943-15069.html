			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Mexico's open door lets in winds of change: Damian Fraser on restructuring companies to compete - The New Economic Order The manager of the Nissan assembly plant in Aguascalientes, Mexico, which is the only Nissan plant to export cars to Japan, says he has little interest in learning how Mexicans run their companies. 'Here we do not care about the Mexican way of doing things. Anyone who works here has to think only about international standards and quality. Otherwise there is no way we can compete,' says Mr Yoshitake Fujikubo. A decade ago such comments may have caused offence. Now they can be heard throughout Mexico. To survive in the world of free trade with the US and Canada, and low-cost imports from Asia, Mexican managers are having to adapt to the practices of their international rivals, and abandon many of their traditional ways of doing business. 'In the past, when you did not have to worry about price competition and open borders, it did not matter so much how you ran your company,' says Mr Ramon de la Pena of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Advanced Studies, the management school based in Mexico's leading industrial city. 'But this is all changing. There is not a company in Monterrey which is not trying to slash layers of management, be more responsive to the customer, and improve productivity.' This corporate restructuring, under way since the late 1980s, has led to average increases in manufacturing productivity of about 5 per cent a year. According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, productivity in Mexican telecommunications increased by 24.1 per cent between 1985 and 1993, in steel mills by 42.3 per cent over the same period, and in the food industry by 12.5 per cent in the five years to 1992. The higher productivity has been achieved in large part by companies closing down unprofitable lines and firing unnecessary workers. This has contributed to higher unemployment and, over the past year and a half, a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector. The McKinsey study indicates that absolute productivity levels in banking, steel and food are still between 30 and 40 per cent of levels in the US, suggesting still more restructuring is necessary. The report concludes that Mexican companies can close most of the gap by improving management of their companies, adopting less hierarchical and less centralised organisational structures, and cutting bureaucracy and unnecessary tasks. Mr Roberto Batres, a consultant with Arthur D Little, says many foreign companies in Mexico have been able to reach international levels of productivity because of superior management. 'Foreign companies have learnt something most Mexicans have not learnt - the tremendous value in the Mexican worker,' he said. 'The Mexican workforce is a gateway to lean manufacturing, if treated right.' Set in a sprawling 200ha site a few miles outside Aguascalientes, Nissan would seem to demonstrate this. The Dollars 1bn plant has productivity levels close to those of plants in Japan and the US, according to Mr Fujikubo. And since Mexican wages are far lower than those in the US or Japan, Nissan Mexico is more competitive on a cost basis than other plants. Nissan attributes the high productivity to world-class technology in the plant and the heavy investment in training its work force, teaching it the importance of team-work, discipline and product quality. The plant is less hierarchical than most Mexican companies, with managers working on or next to the plant floor, and taking lunch with their staff, keeping costs down, and improving corporate communication. Mexican companies are adopting similar practices. Mr Ulrich Sander, head of corporate communication at Vitro, the glass producer and one of Mexico's largest industrial concerns, says layers of management are being removed so the company can cut costs, and compete better against international rivals. He says Vitro is reducing its workforce by 20 per cent to 30,000, with a heavy proportion of non-union workers losing their jobs, such as accountants and secretaries. Mr Sander notes that a few years ago he had 10 secretaries report to his division; now he has one. His responsibilities have grown as the company has sought for the first time to keep workers informed about what is going on at the corporate level. Even though Vitro is admired as one of the more modern and efficient companies in Mexico, the process has to go further, says Mr Sander. Earlier this year Corning, the US glass company, broke its joint venture with Vitro, subsequently saying that Vitro's management took decisions too slowly, was too hierarchical and insufficiently aggressive for the American company, criticisms partly accepted by Mr Sander. Vitro 'is caught between the demands of Mexico's emerging free-market economy and a corporate culture steeped in tradition,' said Mr Ernesto Martens, Vitro's chief executive, in an interview with Harvard Business Review. Mr Martens said that Vitro had to walk a 'tightrope' between losing its identity as a Mexican company with a unique culture, and being battered in the world market place for not changing fast enough.

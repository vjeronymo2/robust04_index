Canada's foreign minister, Andre Ouellet, and his Mexican  counterpart, Manuel Tello, met in Mexico City yesterday, and  they said it is time to convince the U.S. to end the isolation  of Cuba. Neither Canada nor Mexico observe the U.S.-led  embargo. The embargo has been in force since the 1960's.</p>

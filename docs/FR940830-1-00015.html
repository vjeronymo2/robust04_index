			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 124.111(c)(5) would be amended to further restrict excessive withdrawals from 8(a) Program Participants by their owners or managers. Specifically, a Participant could no longer claim that large withdrawals from the Participant should not be restricted where the concern's net worth has continued to increase throughout the period of time the withdrawals are made. Certain Program Participants have attempted to claim that excessive withdrawals could not be penalized where the Participant's net worth continued to increase because the withdrawals were not detrimental to the attainment of its business plan. The 8(a) program is designed to foster the development of business concerns owned by disadvantaged individuals. The fact that Participant's net worth has increased does not mean that it would not have increased more or achieved greater success but for excessive withdrawals by its owners/managers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.112(c)(2)(iv) would be amended to clarify the requirements pertaining to a joint venture between an 8(a) concern owned by an Indian tribe and a concern determined to be other than small. There has been some concern that this regulation required a majority of the performance of such a contract to be performed on an Indian reservation or land owned by the tribe. This was not the intent. This proposed rule would amend this provision to make it consistent with the same provision contained in &sect;124.321 which requires only that the tribally-owned 8(a) concern must perform most of its activities generally on the reservation or tribally-owned land in order to be eligible to joint venture with a large business. This provision contains no specific requirement that the work done through the joint venture must be done on the Indian reservation or tribally-owned land. However, it is necessary not to overlook two requirements which may perpetuate that requirement in some instances_that the concern must be located on the reservation or tribally-owned land, and that the 8(a) participant to a joint venture must meet the performance of work requirements imposed by &sect;124.314.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.321(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.113 would be amended by adding an exclusion from affiliation for concerns owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, by prohibiting a Native Hawaiian Organization from owning more than one current or former 8(a) Participant having the same primary industry classification, and by excluding from the one-time individual eligibility requirement any individual who merely manages a concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would add a new &sect;124.114 which would specifically authorize CDC-owned small business concerns to participate in the 8(a) program. The same amendments added to &sect;124.113 for Native Hawaiian Organizations would be added to this section regarding CDC-owned concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minor clarifying language would be added to &sect;124.206(c)(1) regarding the time frame for an applicant concern to request a reconsideration, and where such a request must be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 124.208(c) and 124.209(b) would be amended to streamline the procedures governing graduation and termination of 8(a) Program Participants respectively. This rule would eliminate the second letter of notification and the second 45 day response period provided in &sect;124.208(c) and &sect;124.209(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, this rule would change the time period in which the Division Director must make a recommendation on graduation to the AA/MSB&amp;COD. The rule would change the time frame for the Division Director's recommendation to the AA/MSB&amp;COD from 15 days to 45 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.209(b) currently provides the same procedures and time limits regarding termination actions as are discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program. This rule would make the same changes to the termination procedures as are discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would amend the procedures concerning remands of 8(a) eligibility appeals by OHA to the AA/MSB&amp;COD. Section 124.210(h)(2) would clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD would issue a decision in accordance with a remand order of the Administrative Law Judge within 10 working days of the remand, unless the AA/MSB&amp;COD requests and the Administrative Law Judge grants an extension thereof. An applicant or 8(a) concern could then appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's remand decision to OHA within 20 working days of the date that the decision is mailed. The failure of an applicant to file an appeal within the 20-day time frame would serve to make the remand decision the final agency decision and would not require any further action by OHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.210 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph (k) to specifically authorize reconsideration of 8(a) eligibility appeal decisions made by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals. Reconsideration would be specifically authorized where a petitioning party establishes a clear error of law or fact affecting the decision in the case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.302 would be amended to ease the restrictions on adding SIC codes once a concern is admitted to the 8(a) program. The proposed rule would permit SBA to approve an additional SIC code as long as a rational business explanation exists for acquiring the requested SIC code. SBA seeks to make it clear that the authority to make decisions regarding what types of business ventures an 8(a) concern should get involved in rests with the 8(a) concerns themselves. Thus, for example, an 8(a) concern may acquire or develop the capability to perform contracts in an industry not directly related to the 8(a) concern's primary business and seek to add the appropriate SIC code(s), or it may hire an additional key employee that opens up new avenues of work to the 8(a) concern and seek to add additional SIC codes. In addition, SBA proposes to shorten the time it takes SBA to respond to a request for a change in SIC code designations from 45 days to 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3) regarding what a Program Participant must demonstrate to qualify for an 8(a) bond exemption. As currently written, in order to qualify for a bond exemption, an 8(a) Program Participant must, among other things, demonstrate that it cannot obtain a bond for the performance of the specific 8(a) requirement at issued by submitting to SBA written denials from at least two sureties, one of which is a corporate surety and one of which is an individual surety. Based on experience with this provision, SBA believes that the requirement that two sureties decline to issue the required bond is unnecessary. As such, the proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3) to require a Participant to demonstrate only that it cannot obtain a bond from one corporate (Treasury-listed) surety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would revise &sect;124.305(c)(4) to provide that a Program Participant may be eligible to receive only two bond exemptions at any one time. In other words, although up to five bond exemptions per Program Participant are authorized, a Participant may not have more than two active 8(a) contracts at a time for which it has received a bond exemption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

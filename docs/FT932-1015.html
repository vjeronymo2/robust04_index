			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Leading Article: The future of social security MR PETER Lilley, the social security secretary, used this week's annual Mais lecture to launch a public debate on the future of the UK welfare state. To encourage informed debate, he promised to publish data on trends in social security spending and projections of future growth. Mr Lilley's initiative is commendable, and in marked contrast to the secretive approach so far adopted in the government's public expenditure reviews. In his lecture, Mr Lilley firmly focused on the growth in the social security budget. Excluding the cost of unemployment, real growth in social security spending has been 3 per cent a year for the last 14 years. The biggest increases have been in housing benefit, spending on long-term sick and disabled people and support for single-parent families. These have all more or less trebled in real terms since 1979. The increased cost of benefits for the elderly has been much more modest at 38 per cent over that period. However, the elderly consume nearly half the social security budget and 14 per cent of public expenditure. And while the growth of private pension provision lessens the demand for income-related benefits, the cost of residential care for the most elderly increased from Pounds 10m in 1979 to Pounds 2.5bn last year. The growth in the social security bill looks unlikely to abate. The government's forecast is a real increase in spending of 3.3 per cent a year to the end of the decade (though reducing unemployment would produce more manageable growth rates). A surprisingly small share of growth will come from extra spending on the elderly; it is benefits for the long-term sick and disabled and housing benefit that are the biggest factors. As Mr Lilley pointed out, some steps have been taken to curb the growth. The state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) was trimmed by the Fowler review. The Child Support Agency now pursues absent parents for the maintenance which only one in three single-parent families regularly receive. Steps have been mooted to ensure that invalidity benefit goes only to those who are genuinely unfit to work. More may need to be done if social security is not to eat up an unsustainable share of national income. Serps continues to increase by more than the rate of inflation. Child benefit should be reviewed, since government figures show that it is the least well-targeted benefit. Further efforts are needed to ensure that benefits paid to the unemployed help them return to work. The opposition may disagree with the government over priorities and the size of the social security budget. But they should resist easy party-political points in the debate that Mr Lilley seeks to encourage. If they were in power, the problems would be no different - as Labour recognised in setting up its Commission for Social Justice.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / The Markets: Japan in the doldrums - Global Investor The torpor induced by Japan's hot summer seems to have left the stock market becalmed. Since the end of June, the Nikkei has traded in an exceptionally narrow range between 20,000 and 21,000. Trading volumes, though still higher than they were in the dog days of 1992-93, have dipped to 300m shares a day on average, as investors and traders alike have succumbed to the lethargy. But the summer stasis owes more to harder economic facts than it does to the heat. The key lies in the financial lassitude of domestic investors. Share prices surged in the first half of the year, as foreign investors sensed a bargain. Japan was hovering on the brink of recovery, the yen was surging, and the rest of the world's stock markets were plunging, a treble chance that made Tokyo stocks understandably popular with foreigners. But in the course of the summer, that momentum has been lost as profit-taking has set in. After six straight months of heavy buying, foreigners became net sellers at the start of July. What is left is the uncomfortable truth, hidden by the foreign-led surge, that Japan's domestic investors have been equity-shy. In the first six months of 1994, while foreigners shopped for shares, domestic corporations recorded net sales of Y3.2 trillion of equities on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Individuals, who have been net sellers of stocks for all but one of the past 12 months, sold a net Y710bn worth of shares. Over the summer, the figures have changed little. If the yen has indeed peaked, and if 1994's global bond and equity rout has been brought to an end, the prospects for a resumption of Tokyo's bull market will depend heavily now on those investors rediscovering the charms of the Japanese blue chips. There is little evidence that this will happen soon. The main categories of investor remain very shy of a market which has burned them badly in the past few years. One broker says his domestic clients are so despondent they have no serious plans to buy equities 'for the rest of the century'. This is probably overdoing it. The past two months have seen a little nibbling at the market by some of the main investors, notably banks and individuals. But the prospects for large-scale buying by the institutions is minimal. Investment trust average equity weightings have been rising, but at over 65 per cent analysts think they now stand close to, or even above, their natural ceilings. Life insurers, hit by a steep decline in their return on assets that has rendered most of them technically unable to meet their liabilities, are still aggressively reducing their risk exposure. Nippon Life, the country's largest institutional shareholder, recently declared its intention to unload another Y315bn in equities. Industrial corporations, many of them engaged in restructuring programmes, are in no mood to return to the zaitech so fashionable in the 1980s. They have been net sellers of shares for the past 16 consecutive months. The really troubling element has been that these risk-averse investors have chosen to keep their funds in cash. Despite historically low short-term interest rates of less than 3 per cent, institutional cash weightings rose from 25 per cent to 32 per cent early this year, falling back only slightly in the spring. If the next move in official interest rates is upwards, the prospect of a significant shift back to equities will remain slim. The caution among the Japanese is understandable. The market's recovery in the first half of the year heavily discounted a big corporate earnings recovery in the current fiscal year, after four consecutive annual falls. In the spring, forecasters were expecting a pre-tax profits rebound of about 20 per cent this year. A stubbornly high yen has already forced most of them to revise that to less than 15 per cent. The preternaturally more cautious Japanese forecasters are now expecting profit increases in single figures in percentage terms. These poor profits presentiments are pushing valuations sharply higher. Prospective p/es, though not wholly reliable measures of value in Japan, are back to historic highs, as are earnings/yield ratios. Japan Telecom Lack of institutional demand is unlikely to be a problem when Japan Telecom, one of the country's three long-distance operators, comes to market next month. Only two other large telecommunications companies, NTT and DDI, are currently listed, and both have outperformed the market impressively this year. JT's entry into this limited market plus global enthusiasm for anything that passes for 'multimedia' is likely to ensure a good reception. Moreover, just 10 per cent, or 34,000 shares in the company, are being offered to investors this week - half of them in Thursday's auction that will set the price, the other half in a direct offering immediately afterwards. The issue has attracted additional interest because it is the first initial public offering ever to involve a separate international tranche. 5,000 of the shares will be offered to international investors. Bids must be received by close of business in London on Friday. Investors are limited to five shares each, a hangover from the Recruit shares-for-favours political scandal of the late-1980s. At a minimum bid price of Y2.41m, the 'five share rule' is a mite restrictive, so activity in the secondary market is likely to be brisk. But longer-term prospects are more doubtful. Though the company has the particular advantage of its own information super-railway - it was originally the telecommunications arm of Japan Railways, and JR still owns 50 per cent of the company - competition in the long-distance field is strong and growing. In addition to JT, DDI, and Teleway Japan are fast-growing operators. Earnings have been under pressure in the past year as competition has forced price cuts. The company already lags behind DDI in the cellular phone business, and as yet no-one quite seems to know what it is going to send along its much-vaunted fibre-optic cables. Stronger competition in these core businesses is likely to squeeze further JT's profit margins. Not that that will worry those lucky enough to win a ticket in the JT lottery this week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 18/8/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              % change over period                 US     Japan     Germany     France     Italy       UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week          0.08      0.04        0.09       0.10      0.16     0.10 Month         0.38      0.18        0.41       0.47      0.70     0.43 Year          3.50      2.78        5.94       5.94      8.31     5.50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week          0.35      0.06        0.04      -0.81     -2.71     0.04 Month        -0.22     -1.14       -1.36      -1.97     -3.81    -1.38 Year         -0.61      2.41        3.61       1.07      0.69     0.51  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week          0.59      0.24        0.17      -2.71     -3.60     0.38 Month        -0.30     -1.81       -2.45      -3.81     -6.68    -2.06 Year         -3.34      1.47        0.23       0.69     -4.73    -3.38  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week           0.9       0.0         0.0       -1.2      -4.0      1.3 Month          2.1       0.1         2.4        0.3      -6.9      3.9 Year           4.3       0.6        10.5       -0.7       2.4      7.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

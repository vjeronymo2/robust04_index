During the interview, he set forth systematically his  own views about the current state of agriculture and the rural  economy, as well as how to concentrate on the reform goals of  building a socialist market economy system, intensifying rural  reform, and steadily developing the rural economy. The substance  of the interview has been collated below for the reader.    Remarks in italics are those of this journal's deputy  editor,  Han Jun.    Remarks in regular type are those of Minister Liu Jiang.    Ever since 1992, China's national economy has been in a  new stage of making an all-out transition to a market economy  and high growth. During this period, some incongruities in the  development of agriculture have manifested themselves rather  strongly. Agricultural problems have once again become a focus  of general concern for society as a whole. Not long ago, the  Central Committee convened a special rural work committee  meeting in this regard, which studied strategic approaches and  specific actions to be taken to buttress the basic position of  agriculture, and to move China's agriculture and rural economy  another step upward in the course of building a socialist market  economy system. Against this background, how do you look at the  current situation in agriculture and the rural economy?    Overall, the situation in agriculture and the rural economy  throughout the country is good. Since the remarks of Comrade  Xiaoping during his travels in the south, and the Fourteenth  Party Congress' setting of the reform goal of establishing a  socialist market economy, the pace of rural reform and  development have quickened appreciably. In 1992, more than 2,000  counties, 282 prefectures and cities, and 29 provinces  (autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities  throughout the country decontrolled grain procurement and  marketing prices. In 1993, command-style plans in agricultural  production and plans for the allocation of grain among provinces  were abolished throughout the country. Second, a large number of  all sorts of new rural economic organization forms have come to  the fore. These include share cooperative system enterprises,  peasant vocational (and technical) associations, rural  cooperative funds, and organizations that integrate trade,  industry and agriculture. Third, agricultural production is  developing steadily, and readjustment of the internal structure  of agriculture has quickened further. A bumper grain crop was  harvested for 4 years in a row between 1982 and 1992. In 1992,  national grain output reached 442.66 million tons, up 1.7  percent from the previous year. Output of all crops except  cotton, which fell 20 percent due to natural disasters,  increased in varying degrees. Animal husbandry and aquatic  products production maintained a steady growth momentum, outputs  of meat and aquatic products nationwide increasing 9.1 and 15  percent respectively over 1992. During the first half of 1993,  summer grain production reached an all-time high, and the  outlook for grain production for the whole year is much better  than was estimated at the beginning of the year. Between January  and June, outputs of all major farm products increased in  varying degrees except for rape seed, which fell 12.5 percent.  Outputs of meat, dairy products, eggs, and aquatic products  increased 5, 3, 5, and 9.7 percent respectively over the same  period in 1992. Not only did total output of farm products  increase, but agricultural production began to change from  mostly efforts to increase outputs to gaining "higher yields,  premium products, and high returns." Output of premium quality  agricultural products increased steadily. Fourth, township and  town enterprises entered a new stage of high growth. In 1992,  the gross output of township and town enterprises totaled 1.76  trillion yuan, up 51 percent from the previous year. During the  same year, more than 9 million new people entered the rural work  force. Rural staff members and workers totaled 105.81 million,  which is more than the total number of staff members and workers  in state-owned enterprises. Foreign exchange earnings from  exports in 1993 broke the 119.2 billion yuan mark, accounting  for 42 percent of the total value of commodity procurement for  export nationwide. Tax payments to the state totaled 63.69  billion yuan, 18.23 billion yuan more than in 1992. Township and  town enterprises continued to maintain a high speed growth  momentum between January and June 1993, gross output value  increasing 70 percent over the same period in 1992. Fifth,  peasant income increased. In 1992, peasant per capita income  nationwide grew more rapidly than during the previous three  years, reaching 784 yuan. After deducting for price rises, this  was a 5.9 percent increase. After deducting for price increases,  peasant income increased by an actual seven percent between  January and June 1993. In short, advances in rural reform, and  rapid growth of the rural economy played a leading role, a  ground breaking role, and a model role in hastening the  development of a market economy nationwide. They lay a  foundation for promoting growth in the entire national economy,  and they provided the basic material support needed to enrich  the livelihoods of city and countryside residents alike, to curb  inflation, and to maintain social order.    While fully affirming the achievements in rural reform and  development of recent years, it is also necessary to understand  clearly that both the development of agriculture and the rural  economy are facing numerous deep-seated inconsistencies and  limiting factors in a new situation in which the national  economy is making a complete transition to a market economy and  high growth. The most conspicuous manifestation of these  inconsistencies are, first, city and countryside residents  incomes are not increasing at the same rate. The gap between  city and countryside income has widened further. Between 1989  and 1992, peasant per capita net income increased by an average  only 1.8 percent per year. This was very much out of line with  the annual average 5.2 percent increase in the gross output of  agriculture. The slow growth of peasant income contrasts sharply  with the income growth of city and town residents. The gap  between city and countryside income has increased from the  1.72:1 ratio of 1984 to a 2.33:1 ratio in 1992. Agricultural  production increases, but peasant income does not increase along  with it. In fact, it may even decrease. This is a grim problem  that China's agriculture has faced in recent years. Second,  industry and agriculture do not grow in unison. The danger of a  recurrence of unbalanced growth of industry and agriculture  exists. In 1992, the industrial growth rate was 20.8 percent,  making 1992 the highest growth year since reform and opening up  to the outside world. The growth rate for agriculture was 3.7  percent. This included only 1.2 percent growth in farming. The  growth ratio between industry and agriculture was 5.6 to 1.  During 1993, industrial growth momentum remains very strong. The  gap between industrial and agricultural growth remains very  great. The high growth of industry has led a large rise in the  prices of all intermediary input prices, the cost and price of  agricultural means of production rising greatly in consequence.  As of the end of June 1993, prices of the agricultural means of  production had risen 16.5 percent, while the procurement price  index for agricultural and sideline products for the same period  rose less than 6 percent. At the same time, driven by  comparative benefits, large amounts of agricultural development  funds flowed into non-agricultural industries. Consequently,  investment in agriculture --particularly medium and long-term  investment -- is seriously inadequate. Historical experience  shows maintenance of a between 2.5:1 and a 3:1 ratio between the  speed of industrial and agricultural growth to be about right.  The present state of affairs can go on for a short period, but  if it continues, the present fairly balanced supply of  agricultural products will be replaced by a shortage of supply.  If that happens, agriculture cannot be supported, and the whole  national economy will once again sink into a vicious cycle  requiring major readjustments. Third, rural regional development  is unbalanced. The gap between the central and western parts of  the country and the developed areas of the east coast has  widened. A look at the overall rural economy shows a gross  social output value ratio among rural villages in the east,  central, and western parts of the country to have widened from  the 1:.67:.3 of 1980 to 1:.44:.22 in 1991. Central and western  China have 36 and 23 percent respectively of the country's  population, but their rural social gross output value amounts to  only 25 and 12 percent respectively. Fourth, rural surplus  manpower movement pressure has increased. Statistics show a  surplus rural manpower of approximately 120 million in these  areas of the country. Because of the high population base  figures, rural manpower will reach a respective 490 million and  540 million by 1995 and 2000. The average annual manpower  increase will be more than 13 million. If 5 million members of  the rural work force move to the nonagricultural sector each  year for the next 15 years, by the year 2000, a newly added  surplus manpower numbering 64 million will remain in the rural  villages. When this is added to the existing surplus manpower of  approximately 120 million, total surplus rural manpower will be  close to 200 million people. How to find opportunities for such  a huge rural surplus rural manpower will be a thorny problem  that will dog us for a long time to come.    In short, we must take a comprehensive point of view, a  dialectical point of view, and a realistic point of view about  the situation in agriculture and the rural economy. We must not  overestimate the overall production capacity of agriculture just  because of the increase in agricultural products for several  years running. We must not overestimate the prosperity of the  peasants simply because their standard of living has improved  considerably. We cannot be blindly optimistic about the rural  situation just because great achievements have been scored in  rural reform. Nor should we be negative and pessimistic. We must  realize the tremendous potential and the favorable conditions  for sustained development of agriculture, and we must realize  that work in agriculture and the rural villages faces quite a  few new circumstances and new problems. There is potential,  opportunity, and hope for development of the rural economy, and  there are also contradictions, difficulties, and dangers.    Since 1992, the State Council has inaugurated a series  of policy measures aimed at buttressing agriculture and  protecting the peasants' interests. How well are these policies  being implemented?    The series of agricultural policies that the State Council  inaugurated were welcomed by the broad masses of peasants.  Governments and departments concerned at all levels devoted  major efforts to implementing these policies, and implementation  of these policies played a major role in stabilizing agriculture  and protecting the enthusiasm of the peasants. For various  reasons, however, results from various jurisdictions  implementation of policies have varied somewhat from the Central  Committee's expected goals. Take the issuance of the "two  monies," for example, the main problems with which were late  issuance and a low rate for getting the money to households. The  policy did not play its intended role. Take also implementation  of the policy of a floor price for peasant grain sales and a  ceiling price for peasant means of production purchases about  which every jurisdiction reported problems. One complaint was  that the standard used in setting the floor price of grain was  too low; thus, it afforded the peasants hardly any protection.  The second complaint was that since Central Committee policy  provisions protected only fixed procurement and grain slated for  storage, jurisdictions were uncertain as to whether the flor  price also applied to negotiated price grain. Third, the ceiling  price for agricultural means of production was subject to  change. In implementation, the ceiling price might even become  the floor price for the means of production. Implementation of  the grain and cotton "three links" materials price reform  additional price policy brought little real benefit for the  peasants. The way that summer grain and oil procurement funds  were handled meant that money was largely at hand in most places  for the procurement of state fixed procurement grain and oil,  and grain slated for storage, but in most places no arrangements  were made or money was not available for the procurement of  negotiated price grain and oil. In order to avoid issuing IOUs  for procurement, some places refused to buy. This meant that at  the state grain production and marketing meetings held to place  orders, and contracts for the allocation of grain among  provinces were also hard to implement completely. Every  jurisdiction also paid extraordinarily close attention to  implementation of the policy of lightening the peasants burdens,  but since the peasants burdens issue has such broad  ramifications and is so complex, true implementation of the  policy is very difficult, and the task is extremely daunting.    For a long time in China, lip service has been paid to  agriculture but little action taken. All sorts of policies  emphasizing agriculture have frequently been very difficult to  put into practice, so much so that many people refer to  agriculture as "slogan agriculture." This should make people  think long and hard. What do you think are the main reasons for  the "slogan agriculture" problem in China?    There are rather profound and complex reasons for the rise  of  the "slogan agriculture" problem. Historically, when neither  agriculture nor light industry was fully developed following  founding of the People's Republic, and per capita national  income was very low, we relied on the large size of the country  and the role of the planned economic system. We used the  exchange at unequal value of industrial wares for agricultural  products to take money directly from the agricultural sector,  giving priority to the development of heavy industry. This was  completely necessary given the special historical circumstances  of the time. However, despite no practical difficulties for a  long time, we have not changed our development strategy in a  timely fashion. On the contrary, in order to ensure long-term  implementation of this strategy, the state has adopted a series  of mandatory policies for the separation of industry and  agriculture, and for separating cities from the countryside.  Large amounts of money have been extracted from the rural  villages. At the same time, rural manpower has been confined to  rural villages and shackled to the land. The result is serious  imbalance between the development of industry and agriculture  and between the development of cities and the countryside. This  has led, in turn, to the formation of traditional agriculture in  China, a dualistic economic structure in which rural villages  and modern industry and cities coexist, and a bifurcated social  structure. This is an important reasons why development of  China's agriculture has been in a stagnant and backward state  for a fairly long time since founding of the people's republic.  The policy environment that emphasizes heavy industry while  slighting agriculture, and emphasizes the cities while slighting  the countryside has not been fundamentally changed today. It  continues to hamper seriously the development of China's  agriculture and its rural economy.    The insufficiently developed rural economic system is also a  basic reason for China's agricultural problems. After 15 years  of reform, an embryonic rural market economy system has taken  shape; nevertheless, the rural economic system is very much  incomplete both at the microeconomic and the macroeconomic  levels. One of the ways this is expressed is in the  insufficiently developed rural microeconomic operating system  and the rural property rights system. Peasant family authority  to make their own operating decisions is still not as complete  as it should be. The second way it is expressed is in meshing  single peasant household small scale production with domestic  and international markets. At the present time, the main  operating entities in China's agriculture are the more than 200  million peasant households that practice family contracting of  production, each household farming less than 10 mu of land. They  produce all kinds of farm products on a small scale. They  specialize but little. However, they face constantly expanding  markets. Because farm products markets are poorly developed,  because trading methods are backward, operating rules  rudimentary, the degree to which the peasants are organized is  low, and the development of intermediary organizations to link  peasants with markets lags, it is difficult for the peasants to  use effectively the information transmittal, and production  regulation functions that the market mechanism provides. Faced  with markets, many peasants are frequently at a loss. A third  way in which the incompleteness of the rural economic system is  expressed is in the process of making a transition to the market  economy system. Most of the regulation and control methods that  the government used in the past, which consisted mostly of  administrative means, no longer apply; however, no agricultural  macroeconomic regulation and control system that meets needs for  the development of a socialist market economy has been  established as yet. Government lacks sufficiently effective  macroeconomic regulation and control methods for implementing  agricultural policies.    Subjectively, neglect of agriculture is an important reason  for China's agricultural problems. The party and the government  have always devoted extremely close attention to agriculture.  Nevertheless, in actual practice, driven by the lack of  separation between government administration and agricultural  management, and their own interests, some local jurisdictions  and government agencies have single-mindedly pursued increase in  the scale of investment in industry and greater output value.  Manpower and material resources, as well as investment, have  been too much tilted toward non-agricultural industries. In  particular, as a result of the consecutive year bumper harvests  in agriculture of recent years, and the general difficulty  selling staple farm products, some comrades mistakenly suppose  that China's agriculture has turned a corner, or they are no  longer concerned about the overall situation. Influenced by such  thinking, some places have relaxed leadership of agriculture.  Today, when the central authorities are calling for stable grain  and cotton production to increase effective supply, to calm  peasant sentiment, and to maintain social tranquility in the  cities and countryside, local jurisdictions are primarily  concerned with development of the local economy and increasing  fiscal revenues. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to expect the  banks, grain agencies, and supply and marketing agencies, which  combine policy and business functions in a single body, not to  consider their own interests in carrying out government  policies. The mixing of government agency interests, the  interests of business concerns, and government functions has  produced distortions in the execution of policies. Delay in  issuing the "two funds," the diversion of funds, and the  substitution of materials for loans are examples. Some  grassroots level cadres and peasants complain that "the central  authorities provide the money; the local government makes an  effort; the peasants suffer; government agencies gain; and  everyone is dissatisfied."    So what do you see as the way out of China's  agricultural problems?    During the past several years, the Central Committee and the  State Council have held a series of important meetings on  agriculture and the rural economy. The Central Committee Rural  Work Conference, in particular, broke much new ground on rural  policy. It did much to increase investment in agriculture, and  this was extremely encouraging to our comrades who are engaged  in agriculture and rural work. It will, no doubt, play a  positive role in stirring the zeal of the peasants. If we just  act in accordance with the plans and policies that the Central  Committee and the State Council prescribe, firmly implement  them, do a solid job, and wholeheartedly do real deeds for the  peasants, there will be great hope for development of China's  rural economy. Specifically, this means using the  intensification of reform, expansion of deregulation,  optimization of the structure, and increasing investment to  solve fundamentally the various deep-seated inconsistencies and  problems faced in the development of China's agriculture. For  starters, we must first fundamentally change the longstanding  dualistic economic structure and bifurcated social structure  that emphasizes industry while slighting agriculture, and that  emphasizes the cities while slighting the countryside. We must  establish a development strategy for integrated development of  industry and agriculture, the cities and the countryside. Right  now, we must intensify macroeconomic regulation and control, to  hold the scale of social investment and the speed of industrial  growth within the limits that agriculture can bear. In addition,  we must enhance the basic position of agriculture in the course  of increasing macroeconomic regulation. We must also accelerate  the movement elsewhere of surplus rural manpower. This is a  major problem of strategic and over-arching importance in the  future development of China's national economy. Small cities and  towns must permit the peasants freely to enter and leave jobs in  industry or commerce. County seat city, market town, and small  city policies permitting peasant entry must be broadened. Doing  this requires rapid reform of the household registration, labor  employment, and social security systems, actively exploring new  population control measures that are in keeping with needs of a  market economy.    Second, further intensification of a rural microeconomic  operating system, rural ownership rights system, rural commodity  circulation system, and government macroeconomic regulation and  control system reform is needed to meet the reform goals that  the 14th Party Congress set for the socialist market economy in  order to hasten the establishment and perfection of the rural  economy's operating mechanism and control system based on the  market mechanism.    First the output-related household contract responsibility  system and the two tier operating system have become basic  systems in China's rural economy. They should be stabilized for  the long term. In order to encourage the peasants to increase  their investment in the land, the farmland contracting period  should be lengthened to permit farming rights on land to be  passed from one person to another for payment according to law.  The already formed land contracting relationships should not be  changed capriciously. In townships and villages having developed  non-agricultural industries where an overwhelming majority of  the work force has already left the land, subject to approval of  the masses, methods such as sub-contracting, transfer of  contracts, and services in partnership may be employed to obtain  various kinds of economies of scale. Farming that offers the  economies of scale must be practiced in places where conditions  warrant; the wishes of the peasants must be obeyed; and caution  employed in action. In no case may there compulsion and  commandism be used. For most places today, the most important  matter in perfecting the rural microeconomic operating system is  to provide the peasants with better services before, during, and  after production by improving the socialized service system for  agriculture. In particular, processing, and commodity  transportation and sales services are needed. Proper guidance  should be given in this regard that leads gradually to  family-based farming on a proper scale.    Second the stabilization and perfection of the microeconomic  system in agriculture should be used as the basis for exploring  actively reform of the rural property rights system. Currently,  quite a few jurisdictions practice the dividing up among  households of shares in collectively held assets. This  effectively handles the problem of maintaining collective  ownership of the means of production while also getting around  the difficulty of peasant households having no innate connection  with collectively held assets. It is an extremely beneficial  test. The joint stock cooperation system is currently being  developed very well in every jurisdiction. For the country as a  whole, it is still in the exploratory stage. It must developed  in a fairly standardized direction whether formed after the  former township and village collective enterprises convert to  some other form, whether its is formed by individual peasants in  partnership, or whether it is formed through lateral share  participation among various legal entities. The raising of  capital, financing, and organization of the elements of  production must be improved and, more importantly, the important  goal of clearly defining equity rights and transforming  enterprises operating mechanisms must be realized. The goal of  rural land equity rights system reform is to use clear  affirmation of ownership rights for collective land as a basis  for encouraging the transfer for compensation of land  contracting rights, thereby fostering markets for the  circulation of land use rights.    Third is greater reform of the farm products circulation  system to guide the smooth entry into the market of peasants and  agriculture. Deregulation of grain and edible oil prices is not  yet complete; we must press ahead with further deregulation.  Conditions must also be created for the gradual deregulation of  cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and silkworm cocoon prices,  procurement, and marketing. In addition, government can exercise  regulation and control that reduces market fluctuations by  establishing a reserve system and a price regulation system. A  large country like China with a population of 1.1 billion will  have to maintain the procurement of a certain amount of  important farm products such as grain. However, procurement  prices must be set equitably on the basis of the laws of value,  and with reference to farm product supply and demand, production  costs, and price ratios. In addition, all other farm products  should be completely deregulated and be bought and sold freely.  In order to stabilize the relationship between procurement and  marketing, it is suggested that production and marketing of  freely bought and sold products be linked, procurement and  marketing contracts signed.    Now that farm product prices and procurement and marketing  are being gradually deregulated, how to organize scattered,  small peasant producers for orderly entry into markets is an  extremely important question. In foreign countries, the  formation of cooperatives has been an effective answer. During  the 1950s, China also set up supply and marketing cooperatives  and credit cooperatives. However, for reasons known to all,  these cooperatives ended up being "government run." Since  reform, the flexibility in operation of these cooperatives has  improved greatly; however, they still lack a mass character  organizationally, and a democratic character administratively.  While persisting in reform of both supply and marketing  cooperatives and credit cooperatives, we should emphasize the  nurture and development of peasant cooperative organizations  such as various kinds of vocational associations, and operating  organizations that combine farming, breeding, and processing;  production, supply, and marketing; and trade, industry, and  agriculture.    Intensification of rural commodity circulation system reform  requires the further building of a market mechanism. If one sees  price deregulation as a quick variable [kuai bianliang] in  policy, then the building of markets is a slow variable [man  bianliang]. Without markets, fluctuations in production will  intensify. Therefore, continued development of all kinds of  country fair markets and specialized markets is necessary.  Specifically, major efforts should be made to develop wholesale  markets, and to foster futures markets to form a farm products  marketing system based on country fair markets in which  wholesale markets serve as the hub and futures markets play a  vanguard role. At the same time, close attention must be given  to various kinds of production element markets. At the present  time, special emphasis should be placed on the development of  manpower, financial, and information markets.    Fourth is greater government macroeconomic regulation and  control for the building and perfection of a social security  system in agriculture. In a market economy, as a basic industry  and as a weak industry, agriculture requires strong government  regulation and control, support and protection. Much work must  be done in this regard, but mostly in the following four areas:  1) Study and formulation of a development strategy. Government's  administration and control of agriculture must consist primarily  of administrative means of control transformed into close study  of a medium and long-term development strategy for agriculture  and the rural economy, and the drawing up of implementation  plans; study of the formulation of an industrial policy;  organization and coordination of the building of major  agricultural base facilities and agricultural product bases that  cut across jurisdictional lines, including management of  investment; issuance of prices for leading farm products and  market information; and directing overall balance between supply  and demand for farm products. 2) Use of fiscal subsidies. In a  market economy, government support for and protection of  agriculture is expressed mostly through fiscal subsidies. Every  country in the world subsidizes agriculture to some extent.  Formerly, the national treasury provided very few direct  subsidies to agriculture, most of which were applied to the  commodity circulation realm and to consumers. A change will have  to be made to mostly subsidize agricultural production and  industries that serve agriculture. 3) Use of price supports.  When government uses support prices for the procurement of  staple farm products such as grain, the support price must be  set on the principle of production costs plus a reasonable  profit. When the market price is lower than the floor price,  government must purchase at the floor price. Over the long term,  the state must institute support prices in agriculture, set up a  risk fund, including a production risk fund, a price risk fund,  and a reserves regulation fund. 4) Perfection of the major farm  products special reserve system. Government must set a  reasonable size reserve, and gradually separate special  government reserves from commercial stocks. 5) Support for the  development of socialized service organizations for the spread  of agricultural technology. Service agencies for the spread of  technology such as farm technology, farm mechanization, animal  husbandry and veterinary medicine, aquatic products, forestry,  and water conservancy technologies are government institutions  at the grassroots level. To a very large extent, they are like a  social benefit institution. They provide major backstopping for  the provision of socialized services to agriculture. If science  and technology are to play to the full a decisive role in the  development of agriculture, close attention must be given to  agricultural education, to scientific research, and to the  spread of technology. In a market economy, government fiscal  support is the key to scientific research in agriculture, and to  the survival and development of agencies that spread technology.  Right now, the spirit of the "Agricultural Technology Promotion  Law," and documents about stabilization of agricultural sector  institutions and teams issued by "the five ministries and one  commission" must be strictly enforced. The practice of using  reduction of fiscal burdens as a pretext for cutting  agricultural sector institutions operating expenses, or even to  "divest" or "wean" them must be resolutely halted. Continuity in  agricultural sector institutions and agricultural technology  promotion teams must be increased, and necessary fiscal support  provided for the development of endeavors such as agricultural  science and technology research and the spread of technology.  Making structure reforms should begin from what benefits the  development of agriculture. Problems with the subordination of  the "five stations" at the grassroots level of agriculture must  be solved, all jurisdictions suiting general methods to specific  circumstances and not acting with "arbitrary uniformity." In  addition, science and technology at the grassroots level must be  improved, the study of applied technology spread, and the  storehouse of science and technology increased, The storehouse  of high and new technology for "high yield, premium quality, and  high return" agriculture, and for the prevention and control of  livestock diseases and insect pests, in particular, must be  increased to enable science and technology to make agriculture  prosper.    Third, once grain and cotton production have been  stabilized,  the rural industrial structure should be boldly readjusted as  market demand requires. In adjusting the kinds of grain crops,  more wheat and corn, which are in short supply, as well as  readily marketable medium and premium quality rice should be  grown. In the farming sector, more high economic value raw  materials for industrial processing should be grown. In the  overall agricultural sector, animal husbandry, the breeding of  aquatic products, and forestry and orchards should be better  developed. In the rural economy, major efforts should be devoted  to the development of township and town enterprises,  particularly in the central and western parts of the country. In  the development of township and town enterprises, a policy of  "active support, rational planning, correct guidance, and strong  control" should continue to be employed. At the present time,  glaring problems requiring solution in the development of  township and town enterprises are the imbalance in development  between the eastern and western parts of the country, the  widespread dispersal over a wide area of such enterprises, and  their fairly low returns. The first requirement is improvement  of operating mechanisms, perfection of the contracting system,  and development of a stock share cooperative system that enable  the maintenance throughout of a flexible and effective operating  mechanism. Second is the development of small industrial zones,  development of small industrial zones powering the construction  of small cities and towns, which spur, in turn, the development  of tertiary industries, the conservation of energy, the  availability of transportation, the lowering of energy  consumption, and the reduction of pollution, while  simultaneously soaking up more manpower. Third is the need to  improve product quality in every way possible, succeeding with  quality and establishing a firm foothold in the market economy.  In the course of readjusting and optimizing the rural industrial  structure, one problem that must be given extremely close  attention is the need to tilt policies in favor of grain and  cotton production. Once grain and cotton production in major  grain and cotton growing areas has been substantially  stabilized, major efforts should be made to develop secondary  and tertiary industries to increase regional economic strength.    Henceforth the state must concentrate all kinds of  investment  in both agriculture and non-agricultural industries in the major  grain and cotton producing areas. It must also build a number of  namebrand, special, premium, and new product bases, poultry and  livestock bases, and livestock feed production bases, as well as  agricultural and sideline products processing bases in principal  grain and cotton growing areas. Henceforth, in general, the  state should no longer increase agricultural sideline product  processing and production capacity in non-production areas and  in cities. Agricultural and sideline product processing firms  already located in cities should also be moved to rural or  production areas in a planned way. Business concerns and  production and operating concerns in major grain producing areas  that meet requirements should be given exporting authority.    Fourth is greater investment in agriculture to raise  agriculture's overall production capacity. The key to improving  the position of agricultural bases lies in improving the overall  production capacity of agriculture. In view of the country's  agricultural development goals by 2000, overall production  capacity of China's agriculture must be increased. An  agricultural investment system must be formed in which the state  plays the leading role that encompasses the state, collectives,  and individual peasants. In accordance with the provisions of  the "Agriculture Law," the national treasury must annually  invest in agriculture an amount that is higher than the increase  in regular national fiscal revenues. Capital construction  investment in agriculture covered by state plan and within the  national budget, and investment in industries that serve  agriculture should be increased year by year to increase the  disbursement of funds for the capital construction of  agriculture as a percentage of all investment in capital  construction within the national budget. Macroeconomic control  of investment in agriculture outside of budget should be  improved for good management and use of development funds and  other special purpose funds for agriculture. The increase in  agricultural loans should be slightly higher than the increase  in bank loans nationwide, and the percentage of loans for policy  purposes, such as medium and long-term low interest loans for  agriculture should be increased.    Raising the overall production capacity of agriculture means  putting energies into the building of grain, cotton, edible oil,  and sugar production bases. While paying attention to the  building of the old bases, attention should be given to a second  group of commodity bases during the Eighth 5-Year Plan, the  overall production capacity of the country's commodity grain  base counties account for half the country's commodity grain. In  addition, a number of premium quality cotton bases, and a number  of sugar crop production bases should be newly built.    Comprehensive development of agriculture should be  continued.  Comprehensive development of agriculture has been a major  measure for strengthening agriculture pursued since 1988.  Central government investment, local government matching funds,  public fund raising, and special purpose agricultural loans for  this purpose total more than 5 billion yuan each year. The  development encompasses more than 900 counties and some state  farms throughout the country. Development during the past  several years has increased the production capacity of major  agricultural products, including more than 20 billion jin of  grain and more than 7 million dan of cotton. The comprehensive  development of agriculture must be conducted with greater  intensity in future, emphasis given to the improvement of  intermediate and low yield fields and cultivated land  reclamation, protection of agricultural resources, improvement  of the ecological environment, and the development of ecological  agriculture.    Finally is the lightening of peasant burdens, increasing  peasant income, and protecting peasant rights and interests. In  the final analysis, agricultural problems are peasant problems.  "When the peasants are poor, agriculture does not prosper."  Peasant income has increased only slowing in recent years. Not  only has this directly affected investment in agriculture  adversely and seriously dampened peasant interest in farming,  but it has also seriously limited overall national economic  growth. If the goal of a comfortably well-off standard of living  by the end of the present century is to be reached, peasant per  capita net annual income will have to rise more than 5.7  percent. The basic goal of China's future agricultural policy  should be synchronous increase in the supply of agricultural  products and peasant income. Increasing peasant income requires,  first, the broadening of sources of income, meaning development  of the rural economy. Second is checking the loss of peasant  income, meaning reducing peasant burdens. Reduction of peasant  burdens must be a task that is conducted unflaggingly over a  long period, the peasants' burdens gradually being standardized  and put under the legal system.    Thank you very much for the interview.</p>

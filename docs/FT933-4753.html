			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Israel soars on peace prospects - The rally in equities Israeli optimism about an imminent Middle East peace agreement, coupled with favourable economic indicators, has sent stocks soaring on the Tel Aviv stock exchange to record highs. The Mishtanim 100 blue chip share index closed yesterday at 229.04 - up 1.9 per cent over Sunday's close, continuing an massive upward trend. Since the revelation of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement eight days ago the Mishtanim index has climbed nearly 28 points from 201.09 on Sunday August 29, a cumulative increase of more than 13 per cent. The MOAF options index of the leading 25 companies has climbed even higher during the same period, up almost 34 points from 198.22 to 232.09 at yesterday's close, a rise of 17 per cent. The TASE has also experienced record volumes with trading on Sunday reaching an all-time high of Shk410m. Mutual funds have been leading the trading surge with huge stock purchases. 'What we are seeing is the reaction to the optimistic view of people in Israel about the economic aspects about peace,' said Ms Hanna Pri-zan, the head of Bank Hapoalim securities. 'The whole region is going to change. 'Although the market started in a little profit-taking yesterday, soon people decided they want to be in, not out and they are ready to pay.' Market analysts expect the surge to continue with a knock-on effect in the medium and small companies in coming days. Ms Pri-zan said investors, including foreign buyers, expected an imminent economic dividend from the peace agreement in vastly expanded trade with Arab countries, massive foreign investment in new projects and regional integration in fields like tourism. 'People waited to get in the market until they were sure that Syria, Jordan and the Gulf states were behind the peace process,' she said. 'If you go through the sectors of the economy almost every field, except high technology defence, is going to improve under peace - agriculture, telecommunications, infrastructure - and it is possible that Israel will become a financial sector for the Middle East.' Apart from optimism about peace, the market is also responding, say analysts, to expectations of higher economic growth in the last two quarters of 1993 and falling interest rates. Investors also expect better corporate results in the last two quarters of 1993, partly as a result of improvement in the bond market in which many Israeli companies have invested heavily. The market has also seen several extremely successful flotations of shares in large companies, like the recent placing of 20 per cent of Bank Leumi.</p>

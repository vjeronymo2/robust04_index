According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights, Moscow Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov, who had interrupted his vacation, did his utmost  to use the flight together with Russia's head of government to  get from the premier a firm guarantee: The federal government  will pay up its debts to Moscow.    Despite the declared intention to discuss at the conference  the prospects of interaction between central Russian regions in  resolving the problems of the agro-industrial complex, and  provision of food for big urban centers, the main topic of the  meeting will of course be the federal government's debt,  assessed at 8 trillion rubles [R]. The total federal government  debt to Moscow today is about R250 billion. The mutual  settlements debt accounts for R117 billion, the Finance Ministry  has failed to transmit R102 billion for the purchase of food,  and R33 billion is owed for the maintenance of Moscow's subway  system. The Moscow mayor's push seems to have yielded results,  which is likely to lend confidence to the heads of other  administrations. Although the regions, perhaps, are trying to  force an open door: Addressing the first session of the new  Russian Government, its head named as an immediate task the  payment of all government debts to the agro-industrial complex,  the military-industrial complex, and the budget sphere.</p>

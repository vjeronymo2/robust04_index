			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Raglan launches Pounds 20m rights - Property group to buy portfolio based in UK regional centres Raglan Properties, the development and investment company, yesterday announced its second rights issue in nine months, to raise funds to pay for the acquisition of a property portfolio valued at Pounds 96.7m. Raglan is paying Pounds 30.8m for Letinvest, a subsidiary of SPP, the Swedish Pension and life assurance company. It will also take on Pounds 70m of long-term debenture stock and Pounds 17.2m of cash. Raglan has undergone a complete transformation over the past 18 months, including a share consolidation, financial restructuring, and new management. The latest deal represents a threefold increase in its gross assets. The company is offering new shares at 32p, on a 3-for-4 basis, raising Pounds 20.4m net of costs. The share price closed 1p lower yesterday at 36p. In addition to Letinvest, Raglan is paying Pounds 6m for Melrose House, in London's Savile Row. Letinvest had a net asset value of Pounds 38.5m as at March 31, putting Raglan's purchase price at a 20 per cent discount. However, the debenture stock, which is listed in London and pays an 11.25 per cent yield, is to be retained. About 70 per cent of Letinvest's portfolio is based in regional centres, including London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Cardiff. It has an even spread between retail, office and industrial properties. The purchase price is adjustable against the difference between the net asset value at completion, and the Pounds 38.5m valuation. The company estimates the deal will enhance its net assets, with a net asset value per share of 38.5p after the purchase, against the current figure of 36p. In addition, it will provide a combined current rental income of Pounds 13.2m. Raglan is already conducting negotiations for the sale of some of the Letinvest properties, which would reduce gearing from its post-acquisition level of 126 per cent. COMMENT Mr Alan Fosler, Raglan's chief executive, transformed Swire Pacific's property arm into one of Hong Kong's most substantial property businesses, and the latest Raglan deal will give him a chance to prove himself in the UK. The rights are pitched at a 6.5p discount to net asset value, which should attract a good take-up. But it will be the first real test for the new management to see if Raglan can translate a highly mixed portfolio into profits.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Floating-rate sector stirs after dormant two years THE REVIVAL of the dollar floating-rate note market gathered momentum last week, with two more banks - Instituto Bancario San Paulo di Torino and Banco di Roma - raising funds in the international bond market. Other financial institutions which issued in May included Banesto, SBAB, Credit Lyonnais, Sumitomo Bank, Citicorp, and the World Bank. Together with a handful of issues earlier in the year, the deals suggest that the FRN market is spluttering into life after two years of dormancy. The FRN market is a natural source of wholesale funding for banks and, in the late 1980s, it provided a ready supply of cash. Bank treasurers usually prefer to take floating-rate funding as a matter of prudent balance sheet management: floating-rate liabilities linked to interbank interest rates are a good match for assets, since most loans are also Libor-linked. However, during 1990 and 1991 the FRN market dried up. As most of the large economies moved into recession, interest rates were cut. In this environment, few institutional investors wanted to hold floating-rate paper and take a diminishing return. Banks themselves, keen buyers of FRNs in the 1980s to use additional lending capacity, came under pressure to shrink balance sheets to meet strict capital-to-assets ratios. Liquid floating-rate securities were easy to dump into the market. Moreover, recession and loan losses led to a deterioration in the credit quality of most international banks. Investors demanded a higher return from bank FRNs and wider margins over interbank rates. There are signs that these conditions are now reversing. Although US interest rates may be cut again to stimulate a sluggish economy, six-month dollar Libor - the reference rate for most dollar FRNs - may not fall far below the current 4.25 per cent before rising again. In this environment, there are good arguments for fund managers buying floating-rate instruments as a natural hedge against higher interest rates in the future. While banks remain under pressure to meet the capital adequacy ratios, the pressure to shrink balance sheets has passed. Meanwhile, demand for loan finance in most economies remains very subdued. Buying FRNs is again seen as a way of using up any excess balance-sheet capacity. In this respect, the Basle Accord on capital adequacy actually legislates in favour of bank FRNs: they carry only a 20 per cent risk weighting, against 100 per cent for loans to companies. Hence a bank must set aside five times more capital against holdings of fixed-rate corporate bonds than against FRNs issued by another bank. Meanwhile, the credit quality of least, stabilised. Institutional investors are more willing buyers of paper issued by banks, whether fixed- or floating-rate. Little surprise that the first US bank into the Eurodollar FRN market this year was Bank of America - one of the few banks to have been upgraded by credit rating agencies last year. The bank's Dollars 200m issue launched in February was its first since 1987. Even for an improving credit, the cost of funds has risen sharply since the 1980s. In 1985, BankAmerica raised Dollars 400m 12-year funding at 6.25 basis points over three-month Libor. This year it paid 37.5 basis points over Libor for five-year funding. When demand for FRNs was subdued, banks and other borrowers could achieve better funding rates by issuing fixed-rate debt and arranging an interest rate swap to achieve a floating-rate liability. However, swap rates have deteriorated sharply over the past five years. Issuing fixed-rate bonds to achieve a floating-rate liability has become more and more costly. Certainly, all the banks which issued FRNs last month found it cheaper to pay the margin over Libor demanded by investors - even at new wider levels - than issue fixed-rate bonds and then arrange a swap. If swap rates continue to tighten, borrowers other than banks may find the FRN market a cheaper source of floating-rate funds than the straight bond market.</p>

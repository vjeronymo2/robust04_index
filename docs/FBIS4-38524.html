			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Akaki Asatiani, chairman of the Union of </F> Traditionalists, Giorgi Kobakhidze, leading member of the  National-Democratic Party, Lamar Chkheidze, leader of the Iliad  Chavchavadze Society, Redo Paatashvili, leader of Charter-91, by  Lila Gurbutashvili; place and date not given: "In Search of a  Foothold"]    [Excerpts] Akaki Asatiani, chairman of the Union of  Traditionalists, recently informed Parliament about the creation  of a new faction -- the "Center" faction. The statement was  made on behalf of the Union of Traditionalists, the Merab  Kostava Society, the Conservative-Monarchist Party, and  Charter-91. We talked on this subject to Akaki Asatiani, Giorgi  Kobakhidze, Lamar Chkheidze, and Redo Paatashvili. [passage  omitted]    [Gurbutashvili] The National-Democrats are in the  majority, the opposition, or.... What is your attitude  regarding "Center?"    [Kobakhidze] Let me, first of all, speak about the so-called  "Center." In general, I think it is premature to speak about  its creation (in spite of the fact that a statement has been  made). I doubt that this will be an influential faction. It is  one thing to be in a coalition and another to be in a faction  where responsibility is restricted within fixed limits. I  believe that, on account of the positions they adopt, the  factions united within it will be unable to tolerate these  limits. This is the first point. Second, when speaking of  positions and principles, there are many things that I find  incomprehensible.... For example, it is incomprehensible why  the "Traditionalists" view themselves as part of the opposition  when they have assumed responsibility for the implementation of  economic reform (I have in mind their submitting Basil as a  candidate and his appointment as deputy prime-minister [for  economic questions]). In general, such a step taken by someone  in the opposition is incomprehensible.... On the other hand,  another organization that is a friend of the "Traditionalists"  -- the Merab Kostava Society -- has a completely different  attitude from them toward the head of state who determines state  policy today. Proceeding from the rules of politics in general,  such a thing does not usually take place, but, as can be seen,  nothing comes as a surprise in Georgia.... As you know, society  is touchy today and any caustic remark or violent action has a  negative effect upon it. The word "center" (the very essence of  the word) has a calming and positive effect upon people and this  is precisely the reason why it was created. I repeat once more  that the Merab Kostava Society or the "Traditionalists" cannot  be in the "Center" because the former is completely opposed to  the head of state and the latter have basically manifested their  support for him (proceeding from the status of their member  Basil). The center generally takes shape itself, but not by  appropriating the name. The political center is not well-defined  today but it should be viewed as being made up of, first and  foremost, the National- Democratic Party [NAP] and the  Republicans and then the Liberal- Democratic National Party.  The center's course is charted in this way.    [Gurbutashvili] Do you consider yourselves to be in  the center?    [Kobakhidze] From the political point of view, the NAP is in  the center; there is us and then the two organizations that I  mentioned. The order in which I listed the organizations  corresponds to the level of their activity and their importance.    [Gurbutashvili] That means we can expect confrontation  between your center and the "Center" that has already been  proclaimed?    [Kobakhidze] We do not intend to wage a battle over the  name. We have our own firm position. We have never played this  type of game -- in this way or that -- and it is our intention  not to do so in the future. Our position is as follows: Early  elections to be held as soon as possible.    [Gurbutashvili] Are you in opposition to the head of  state?    [Kobakhidze] We are in opposition from the position of the  center. We disassociate ourselves from the majority [in  Parliament] and the [Liberal-Conservative] coalition and the  [Center] faction.    [Chkheidze] It is difficult and also probably incorrect to  say anything in advance. It depends upon how consistent a  position they adopt; proceeding from this, one can speak about  the "Center." Our society joined the [Liberal-Conservative]  coalition because we wanted to see all the opposition parties  united. Unfortunately, this has not happened; only some of them  have united. We did not view it as right that there should be  even greater integration with a part of them. We do not want  our organization to lose its identity. That is to say, we agree  to cooperate with all who adhere to national and democratic  positions. The center is a fairly relative concept in Georgia  today. If, before, radicalism was viewed as being politically  the most profitable thing (and everyone was laying claim to  this), today, centrism is, for some reason, viewed as such and  everyone is now following the trend of declaring themselves to  be centrists.    [Paatashvili] As regards the "Center" faction, what was done  a few days ago was a principled decision. These four  organizations are necessary for the normal functioning of  Parliament and overcoming the crisis (there were arguments among  them on this score).    [Gurbutashvili] Are you no longer in opposition?    [Paatashvili] I consider us to be representatives of the  opposition; we are opposed to the current policies and to the  majority who support the present authorities. "Center"  signifies the center from the political point of view; it does  not mean that representatives of the opposition should not be  united within it. Representatives of the majority can remain on  the right, representatives of a part of the opposition on the  left, and, at the same time, those in the opposition who are  opposed to the authorities regarding a whole number of questions  can remain in the center. As regards Charter-91, consultations  have been taking place. The creation of the faction, in  contrast to the coalition, signifies even greater cooperation.  Joint decisions should be taken here. This, as you know,  imposes strict limits upon the representatives of each  individual faction. Consultations are continuing on a whole  number of questions and nothing has finally been established.  Charter-91 has, for the moment, not committed itself to  becoming a member. The remaining three organizations are  continuing consultations. As regards Charter-91, from the  political point of view, we are in opposition to the  authorities, but there is an opposition that is more radical  than we are and that is demanding both the resignation of the  head of state and the dissolution of the majority. We want the  authorities to undergo a qualitative change but this should not  be to the detriment of the country and should not result in  Eduard Shevardnadze's fleeing or being driven out of Georgia,  which would cause even more instability.    We believe that there should be a change of power, which  should proceed from the good will of the majority, including  Eduard Shevardnadze; there should be a division of power and not  instability. There is potential even in this Parliament and, if  it is used correctly, it will be possible both to govern the  country in a better way and create a governing team that is  better than the present one (I have in mind both officials in  Parliament and a whole number of government representatives).</p>

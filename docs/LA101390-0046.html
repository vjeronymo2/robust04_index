			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACKS IN 'STREETCAR'  </P> <P> I want to thank Loynd for his observation that the setting is 1947, blue-collar  New Orleans and that the Hubbles are definitely written as white.  </P> <P> I had the misfortune to see a production of the same play in which Stanley was  cast as black! I even saw a production of "Henry V" in which Hal (the English  prince turned king) was played by a black man! We might as well play "A Raisin  in the Sun" with whites.  </P> <P> SHARON NOBLE  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

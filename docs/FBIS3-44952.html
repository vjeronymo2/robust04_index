			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Ng] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten yesterday said there was  confusion over China's stance on how Hong Kong residents with  foreign passports could obtain the right of abode after 1997.    "I think that many people in Hong Kong will be a little  puzzled by the various messages which have been coming out of  Beijing.    "There were, I think, two rather different impressions given  yesterday about future Chinese intention on right of abode," Mr  Patten said.    The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, Lu Ping, reportedly said on Thursday morning  that Hong Kong residents with foreign passports would not need  to go through another application process to acquire the right  of abode after 1997.    But he said later in the day that people with foreign  passports would lose their Chinese nationality, and a clear set  of criteria would be worked out to allow the recovery of  permanent resident status.    Mr Lu added China would adopt a more lenient policy towards  these people.    It is estimated there are 300,000 to 400,000 people whose  right of abode in Hong Kong will be in doubt after 1997 because  they own foreign passports.    Mr Patten said he was confused about China's stance, and the  Government was anxious to reach an agreement on the issue to put  to rest the anxiety of the people involved.</p>

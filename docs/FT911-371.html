			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (7): Technology transferred - Education and training MOTORISTS faced with delays due to road-widening schemes may at some stage in the future give thanks for the day when Ron Brindle, a civil engineer, walked into the University of Wales College of Cardiff. Mr Brindle came in with an idea which, developed in conjunction with the university college, has led to a soil-nailing machine which can drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to widen roads. The machine, which uses high air-pressure to fire nails into the soil at 200mph, has been patented and developed; and licencing arrangements have been made worldwide. The University of Wales College of Cardiff (UWCC) became involved through its commercial consulting arm, and a licence was given to the Welsh-based Ryan International group. The project is one of 12 licences in which UWCC is involved with the private sector. This story of the soil nailing machine illustrates the emphasis at UWCC on commercial services and technology-transfer schemes. The college, with 1,000 academic staff, 28 schools and departments and more than 9,000 students, is the largest of the colleges that make up the University of Wales. Its size and commercial contacts mean that it has a significant role in the life of the city. In 1989-1990, it won Pounds 2.1m worth of research contracts from British industry, and through other consultancy work generated an additional Pounds 1.8m. There have been several instances of high-technology companies being spun off by the university college, as a result of projects in which it was involved. Geraint Jones is the head of UWCC's commercial services section, and at the forefront of efforts to boost academic and industry links. 'There is often a difference in time scales, but our people are very appreciative of industry's ethos. It is important to retain a balance between pure research and the subsequent use of new knowledge,' he said. The section acts as a focus for liaison with industry. Companies involved in projects include such big names as British Steel, Ferranti, Procter and Gamble, as well as local companies. Links are further fostered through placements of Cardiff graduates in 15 companies, to help with research under the Science and Engineering Research Council's Teaching Company scheme. UWCC prides itself on a number of pace-setter departments which are generally regarded as centres of academic excellence. These include city and regional planning, aeronautical and mechanical engineering, maritime studies, nasal physiology, the semi-conductor and microelectronics centre, and the automotive industry unit at the Cardiff Business School, which is part of the university college. The mood at UWCC is one of cautious optimism, exemplified by a new Pounds 27m engineering faculty building scheduled to come on stream by 1993 and catering for 1,100 students. UWCC has also emerged as one of the UK's leading centres of Japanese studies with a number of Japanese joint honours schools introduced at undergraduate level where Japanese is combined with such disciplines as law or business studies. The university college's most direct contact with business in Cardiff is through the Cardiff Business School, the fourth largest in the UK with 1,000 students and 13 full-time professors. Its courses include both undergraduate and postgraduate work and the school tailors courses for managers in local companies. Recent research contracts include a study of the Principality's labour market, for Welsh Water. Professor Roger Mansfield, the school's head, sees a role for the school as a catalyst and enabler, to improve management skills in Wales. 'The rapid development of short courses is based firstly on serving the growing needs of the region, and secondly, developing courses in areas of particular research strength.' Cardiff is particularly strong in the automative industry, Professors Dan Jones and Garel Rhys having built an international reputation. Consequently, most of the big motor manufacturers have used Cardiff for consulting work. At a non-academic level, training and education for jobs in Cardiff is focused on the new South Glamorgan Training and Education Council (TEC), set up in February. It has a staff of 50 and a budget of Pounds 12m. Paul Sheldon, its chief executive, believes the tough decisions the TEC will be making on training-provision in Cardiff are bound to be controversial: 'Our primary client is the employer. We have to ensure that we are training people for real jobs. That means we will have to look carefully at the quality and scope of the training on offer at present.' The South Glamorgan TEC faces four priorities in determining the future of training in the Welsh capital: The TEC has to carry out a quality audit of training provision, and decide which courses and schemes to scrap. Mr Sheldon thinks the 60 organisations currently involved in training is too many. There needs to be greater targeting in training in Cardiff. Traditionally, the take up-rates for adult training in Cardiff is around 90 per cent of places filled, compared with 60 to 70 per cent nationally. However, if people in Cardiff are being trained for skills where there are no job prospects, such courses will have to be scrapped, and emphasis placed on market-led targetting. There are no models to forecast how the south-east Wales economy will perform - an obstacle to detailed labour-market planning. Discussions are being held with various groups in Cardiff to see if such a model can be developed. The public sector as an employer plays a crucial role in the Cardiff labour market, with nearly 50 per cent of jobs in the city coming from the public sector. Public sector orientated programmes need to be included in training provision.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "A Stability Pact For EU Aspirants"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 25 May -- On Thursday and Friday [26 and 27  May], several foreign ministers are meeting in Paris to prepare  the ground for a "stability pact." French Prime Minister  Balladur had suggested such a pact to help defuse border and  minority problems that could lead to conflicts in Central and  East Europe. Following initial doubts about the use of such a  comprehensive stability pact for the Central and East European  states wishing to join the European Union [EU], the EU agreed to  the French proposal last December. Now the EU considers this to  be one of its first "joint actions" since the Maastricht Treaty  came into force. The pact will not take the form of an  international legal document, but of a declaration of intent.  Bilateral and regional negotiations are to precede the document  and will be completed in about a year.    Taking part in the Paris conference will be the foreign  ministers of the EU, Central and East European states, the  United States, Russia, and other members of the CSCE. Prior to  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's departure for Paris, the Foreign  Ministry in Bonn said on Wednesday that basically all 53 CSCE  member states could participate in the pact. But the EU will  first concentrate its efforts on those Central and East European  states that can expect to join the EU in the foreseeable future.  After the opening conference, national minority issues and  cross-border cooperation are to be discussed at "regional  desks." The EU and other interested countries will have to  participate in these. The CSCE will have to fulfill a special  task in this, the Foreign Ministry said.    Bonn said the Federal Government regards the French proposal  as supporting measures to move Central, East, and southern  European states closer to existing European structures, such as  the EU and the Council of Europe. Balladur is right in  considering border and minority issues as the key problem in  European unification. The events in former Yugoslavia  illustrate this. What will be difficult, however, is putting  the plan into practice. So far, the ideas are still somewhat  vague. Prime Minister Balladur is thinking of a system of  agreements between neighboring states, like the one that was  established in West Europe after World War II. It is a matter  of combining individual bilateral agreements that are binding  under international law into a "stability pact for Europe" that  would not be legally binding as such. Germany will have the  task of helping to achieve this during its EU presidency  starting on 1 July. German efforts in Europe continue to  concentrate on moving the states of Central and East Europe  closer to the EU; the enlargement of European authorities should  not delay this process. The "stability pact" is only part of the  aspect. It is obvious that border and minority questions have  to be clarified before new members can join the EU, the Foreign  Ministry said.</p>

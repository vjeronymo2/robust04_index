			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRANGE OUT OF RANGE FOR THE AVERAGE DUFFER  </P> <P> In all my golf experiences I have never heard the expression a Red Grange,  which was referred to in the June 6 Morning Briefing.  </P> <P> Perhaps this is because, in my circles, if someone were to shoot a Red Grange  (a 77, after Grange's uniform number) he would be either deified or accused of  altering his scorecard.  </P> <P> Therefore, as the self-proclaimed voice of the average duffer, I offer a new  terminology to the world of golf, a phrase that might soon be heard on the  links of America with alarming frequency: I just had a Mark Gastineau (No. 99).  </P> <P> DANA MERINO  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

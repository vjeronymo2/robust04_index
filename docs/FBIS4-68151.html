			<p>BFN     [Text] The only place where the MRTA [Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement] still has some strength is the central  jungle. There it has a column that is allegedly headed by  Nestor Serpa Cartolini himself, and which allegedly has a  considerable number of weapons, according to two MRTA chiefs  arrested by the Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate]  and presented to the media on 6 May.    The area of influence of this armed group is located between  La Merced, Satipo, and Pichis, and in the jungle in Junin and  Pasco Departments. There they continue to carry out attacks,  although these are not as harmful as those carried out in the  past.    In the January and February issues of the MRTA mouthpiece LA  VOZ REBELDE, the MRTA claims responsibility for several attacks,  most of them in the central jungle, a few in the north, and a  few in Lima.    However, the group that acted in the north was deactivated  with the arrest of Juan Antonio Leon Montero, aka "Perseo,"  member of the MRTA national directorate.    The MRTA also suffered harsh blows in Lima, especially last  month with the Alacran 3 Operation carried out by the second  Dincote division, which arrested Emilio Villalobos Alva, aka  "Celso" or "Polo," and nearly all the members of its "Special  Forces" -- a detachment that specialized in kidnappings and in  collecting protection money from businessmen.    Dincote said that 20 MRTA bases in Peru have so far been  dismantled. In face of this the MRTA members who no longer have  a regional command have retreated to Lima and to the Central  Jungle area, as well as to Jaen and the surroundings of Huancayo.    This means that there currently remain only four MRTA  bastions. The main one is in the central jungle. Those in Jaen  and Huancayo are unstable, and the command in Lima is trying to  recover the time lost, this time under the command of the number  two man of the MRTA: Miguel Rincon Rincon.    Dincote has said that in general terms, the MRTA forces are  disbanding.    For example, the members of the "Martin La Torre Escalante"  platoon that carried out actions south of Peru, especially in  Puno, are fleeing to Bolivia, where MRTA leader Sonia Cuentas  supports them.    This platoon, which bears the name of one of the terrorists  who died in the Los Molinos operation in 1989, is headed by  Justino Soto Vargas, aka "Lucho Chico," among others    The MRTA members who remained in Trujillo and Chiclayo have  retreated to Jaen. Many MRTA members of Lima have also  emigrated to Tarma and Junin.    According to the documents that were found, the MRTA plans  to  take what remains of its military forces to La Convencion  (Cuzco), and Aguaytia (Ucayali).    According to Dincote detectives, this is a strategic retreat  with the purpose of recovering the control of the coca producing  zones as well as the financing for their actions.    Given the action of the forces of order, the MRTA has lost a  lot of its area of influence at a national level, especially in  the Huallaga region and in other coca producing zones that  constituted its emporium and had become its base of actions.    Now it will be very difficult for the MRTA members to return  to these zones, not only because of the Armed Force's actions,  but also because the voids it left were quickly occupied by the  Shining Path.</p>

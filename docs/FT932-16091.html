			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM in FFr2.5bn bid for computing services group IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, is launching a bid for Compagnie General d'Informatique, the French computing services company. The bid values the computing services company at just over FFr2.5bn (Dollars 461m), about 1.2 times turnover and 17.5 times CGI's net profit in 1992. It represents a further development in the trend for computer hardware manufacturers to move into computing services, where there is still vigorous growth and gross profit margins are larger. The area where CGI is strongest - integrated applications packages, customised software programs and consultancy - is also the area that would be most profitable for computing services companies over the next five years. CGI supplies applications software and computing services and is active throughout Europe and North America, where it has had a presence since 1982. It employs about 4,200 staff worldwide and was originally noted for creating software tools - software that makes it easier to write other software. It has a range of financial and manufacturing software and offers training in software development methods. Mr Claude Andreuzza, president of the board of IBM France, said yesterday that the company would offer one IBM France convertible bond with a nominal value of FFr355 for each CGI share. The bonds will have a 4 1/2 -year maturity and a 5.7 per cent annual coupon. Mr Robert Mallet, CGI chairman and managing director, Mr Bernard Chapot, general manager, and Mr Jacques Debuisson, vice-president of the board of directors, have already agreed to transfer their 25.3 per cent combined shareholding to IBM France. The bid is subject to authorisation by the French treasury and by the American Office of Fair Trading and conditional on IBM receiving acceptances from shareholders representing more than two-thirds of GCI voting rights.</p>

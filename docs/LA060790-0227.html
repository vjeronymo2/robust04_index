			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DIDN'T DROP BODY OF BREZHNEV, SOVIET GRAVEDIGGER SAYS  </P> <P> The man who lowered the nation's last four leaders into their graves laid to  rest today a rumor that he dropped Leonid I. Brezhnev's corpse.  </P> <P> "The sound people heard that day was the sound of the Kremlin clock and a  cannon salute," Georgy Kovalenko, gravedigger for Communist VIPs, told the  Sobesednik supplement to the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.  </P> <P> Ever since Brezhnev was buried Nov. 15, 1982, Soviet citizens have disputed  what caused a thud just as the Soviet leader was lowered into the grave.  </P> <P> One word-of-mouth story said the bottom of the coffin was faulty, like most  manufactured products during Brezhnev's time, and gave way under the bulky  Brezhnev. Another blamed the gravediggers.  </P> <P> But Kovalenko said he lowered the now-loathed Brezhnev "by the book" as he did  Nikita S. Khrushchev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko: "Quickly and  gently as if by a high-speed elevator."  </P></p>

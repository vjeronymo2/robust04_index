			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan will urge China  through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to cut  its tariffs and open its markets to foreign products, government  officials said Thursday [3 March].    The requests will be included in a list of recommendations  Japan will submit to a GATT working committee to help China join  GATT at an early stage, as it hopes to, the officials said. The  committee opens a meeting in Geneva on March 15.    China, on receiving such recommendations from GATT member  nations, is expected to submit a list of proposed tariff cuts to  GATT by next summer.    Under an agreement reached last year at the Uruguay Round of  global trade talks, Japan is to cut its tariffs by an average  1.5 percent and the United States and European nations are to  reduce theirs by 3.0 percent.    China's high tariffs have hindered its admission to GATT.    The Chinese tariffs are believed to average more than 40  percent, although China itself puts the average at 22 percent.    The Japanese-proposed tariff cuts for China are expected to  cover hundreds of items, including automobiles, machinery and  electronics products, the officials said.    The World Trade Organization (WTO), which is to replace GATT  in January 1995, is expected to impose stricter conditions for  admission than GATT.    All GATT members, however, will be allowed to join the WTO.</p>

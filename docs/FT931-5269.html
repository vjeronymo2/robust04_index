			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: US economy The rebound in US employment during February seems to confirm the evidence of a widespread and strong recovery. Recent purchasing managers surveys and sharp growth in the last quarter of 1992 point in the same direction. But care is needed in interpreting the figures. A large number of the new jobs were part-time and concentrated in the retail and construction sectors, while manufacturing jobs showed only a slight increase. And given that employment growth was unexpectedly weak at the end of 1992, the seasonal adjustment of the figures may be faulty. Consumer confidence has also been falling, which is hardly consistent with rapidly improving employment prospects. That decline has accelerated since President Clinton unveiled his deficit reduction plans. Individuals may already be retrenching in the expectation of tax increases, while the beneficiaries of his fiscal stimulus have not yet been clearly identified. Modest growth concentrated on construction, with productivity improvements providing most of the boost in manufacturing, may reassure the bond market. Long yields around 6.75 per cent would thus prove sustainable. If growth falters, they may even fall further. But equities will struggle harder. Prices have marked time for two years on the expectation of recovery. Ratings have fallen as earnings have recovered. On estimated 1993 and 1994 profits Wall Street does not look expensive, but neither is it a steal. With sustained growth elusive, there may be more waiting to come.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "Assumption of a Post," with </F> Mikhail Yakovlevich Lemeshev, chairman of the Ecology Committee  of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly,  conducted by Vladimir Mikhaylov; date and place not given]    [Text] Vladimir Mikhaylov talks with the chairman of  the Ecology Committee of the State Duma of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly, Mikhail Yakovlevich Lemeshev.    Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, first of all I  would like to congratulate you on assuming the post, your  election as chairman of the State Duma Ecology Committee. Even  though it seems to many people today that ecological problems  are not the most important thing in our present life and that  there are certainly things which are more important. Do you  agree with this assertion?    Lemeshev: I am deeply certain that the rebirth of  Russia and the Russian people, which everyone under the sun is  talking about now, is impossible without solving ecological  problems. This is determined by the fact that in itself the  ecological situation in the country is simply disastrous;  everyone understands that, there is no need to explain. In fact  today we are talking about survival. Take the demographic  aspect. It is an altogether depressing situation; essentially  the indigenous peoples of Russia are dying out. The scientific  research of prestigious scientists, in particular American and  Japanese scientists, shows that 40 percent of the children born  in recent times are already ill. What will happen to them later,  in their adult lives? Generally two-thirds of all diseases today  are linked to the bad state of the environment. This is more  urgent for Russia than for the West.    Above all it is environmental pollution in cities with a  population of more than a million inhabitants which causes  alarm. Here, as a rule, there is very bad water (and generally  it is bad everywhere in our country) and food products contain  pesticides, nitrates, and various biological additives. And what  is interesting is that this applies less to domestically made  products than to imported products. Propaganda, advertising, and  pretty packaging do their work here; we are still susceptible to  all this. The developed countries often sell us what there is no  demand for in their countries. Incidentally, there are fairly  strict nature protection laws in many countries of the Western  world.    In my opinion, that is where we must focus our activity, on  improving the health of our people. That is the primary task.  Yes, biological diversity and problems of protected territories  are important, and that is good, but the most important thing is  people's health.    Mikhaylov: But to do all this capital is needed,  and I would assume a considerable amount of it. Where is it  supposed to come from, at the expense of what and at whose  expense? After all, the only thing anyone talks about is the  meager state treasury and the incredible state budget deficit.  As a member of the State Duma, you are obliged to take into  account the conditions of our reality. Are all these things you  are so persuasively discussing realistic from a financial  standpoint?    Lemeshev: As an economist, I am simply depressed  by the very widespread opinion that once the economy is in  crisis, it is then impossible to work on economic problems. It  is just when such a crisis arises that we supposedly take up  ecology in earnest. And the saddest thing is that, in my  opinion, this is simply a bad idea -- it finds a response in  people's souls. That is certainly understandable: people are on  the edge of survival and this is the point where it is every man  for himself, as they say. And that is radically wrong. Without  solving ecological problems, we will never raise the economy  either, I am absolutely convinced of that.    Here is a clear example. With environmental pollution,  people  get sick more often and more seriously and hence do not  participate in production so actively. Does that have an effect  on the state's economy or not? In order to treat people, buy  medicine, and build hospitals, an enormous amount of capital is  needed. Does that really not put a burden on the economy? Only  altogether short-sighted people are unable to see that.    All right, let us take production of fabrics. For the fabric  to be good quality, we need not simply water, but clean water.  Isn't it easier and cheaper not to pollute the water from the  start rather than spend enormous amounts of money to  decontaminate it? Remember that it is impossible to separate the  economy and ecology -- it is a single metasystem. And I would  like to say one more thing: There are no ecological problems of  one state or another; ecological problems cannot be solved  within the boundaries of one state. Say the Scandinavian  countries have been very successful in solving ecological  problems, but 90 percent of the pollution of the natural  environment comes to them from other countries.    Mikhaylov: But that is putting the question in  general terms, so to speak; now what practical steps should the  committee begin with, in your opinion? What draft laws do you  consider paramount in the sphere of environmental protection?    Lemeshev: I would not want to complain right off  of lack of organization, but as of now for 15 deputies and just  as many apparat employees we have two small rooms, no  typewriters, no computers, and no organizational equipment. I do  not know how we are going to work.    As for the committee's legislative work, I believe preparing  a draft law on ecological disaster zones is most important.  True, all Russia can now be called an ecological disaster zone,  but there are the worst ones, say the Chernobyl disaster zone,  rayons where chemical and petrochemical production are  concentrated, and production sites of hydrocarbon raw materials  in northern Russia where a terrible blow is being inflicted on  the habitat of the small peoples. We are in dire need of a law  on the ecological expert study, not a departmental one, as is  customary now, but a federal state expert study with broad  public participation. Only in that way will we be able to put up  a barrier on the path of projects that destroy both nature and  humans themselves.    And isn't legislation on drinking water important? Must we  not make additions to the Criminal Code related to  accountability for ecological crimes? So there is a vast field  of work.    Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, looking over the  list of members of your committee, the fair degree of diversity  caught my attention: there are deputies from "Russia's Choice,"  and communists, and members of the Democratic Party of Russia,  and you yourself represent the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] faction. Doesn't it seem to you that this lack of  political uniformity will hinder the committee's normal  lawmaking work? Moreover, you must build constructive relations  with the Russian Federation Ministry of Protection of the  Environment and Natural Resources.    Lemeshev: As for the latter, I feel optimistic  because of the fact that the minister himself, Viktor Ivanovich  Danilov-Danilyan, is a member of our committee, and at least for  now, we have a mutual understanding on all issues. Although I  have heard plenty of the unbiased polemics between  Danilov-Danilyan and the chairman of the RF Interdepartmental  Commission on Ecological Safety, Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov,  which unfolded on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, personally I  do not quite like it when such disagreements arise between such  respected people. It is simply the scourge of our Russian  intelligentsia and we must discard departmental, political, and  professional ambitions when it is a matter of the common cause.  We must change our psychology. But I look at the work of our  committee with hope because I am certain that the task of  preserving the environment can unite people of the most diverse  political views.  <H5>  SPASENIYE Information </H5>   Mikhail Yakovlevich Lemeshev, born 1927, Russian,  doctor of economic sciences.

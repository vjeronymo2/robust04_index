			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Dresden Institute of Polymer Research (IPF) was  opened on 6 December by Secretary of State to the BMFT [Federal  Ministry of Research and Technology] Dr. Gebhard Ziller and the  Science Minister of the Free State of Saxony, Professor  Hans-Joachim Meyer. As one of the "Blue List" institutes, it is  financed half by the BMFT and half by the Free State of Saxony  (annual budget for 1993: 26.3 million German marks). With its  232 employees, the institute is one of the largest and most  productive polymer research facilities in the Federal Republic  of Germany.    The institute's work focuses primarily on  application-oriented basic research, major fields being:    -- polymer synthesis and characterization;    -- interface phenomena in polymers and multiphase systems  containing polymer matrix (with particular reference to polymer  blends and reinforced polymers);    -- polymer surface modification; and    -- shaping, processing, and inspection of polymeric  materials.    The institute is already working with numerous firms in the  plastics, automotive, and lacquer industries, mainly on the  development of environment-friendly lacquers for automobile  bodies. It is also working jointly with AKZO AG on the further  development of dialysis membranes for artificial kidneys and the  monitoring of their production.    Professor Hans-Joerg Jacobasch, a scientist of international  renown, was appointed scientific director of the Institute of  Polymer Research, thus acknowledging the value of his work to  date as head of the IPF in a commissary capacity.</p>

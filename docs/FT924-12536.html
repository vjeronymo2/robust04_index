			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: German minister agrees to takeover of Minol THE takeover of the east German oil company Minol by a consortium including the German steelmaker Thyssen and the French oil company Elf-Aquitaine, has been approved by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, Reuter reports from Bonn. The finance ministry said the takeover would secure around 7,000 jobs in eastern Germany. The Federal Cartel Office, which must make a final ruling on the venture, said it had no preliminary reservations. Mr Joachim Gruenewald, state secretary in the finance ministry, said: 'With planned investment of around DM6bn (Dollars 4.20bn) . . . this privatisation is one of the biggest planned for east German industry.' Under the agreement reached with the Berlin-based Treuhand privatisation agency, the Elf-led consortium pledged to invest at least DM4bn. Should it fail to do so, it would become liable to penalties, the ministry said. The core of investment would go towards building a new oil refinery in Leuna in east Germany, with an annual capacity of 10m tonnes of crude oil, for DM4.3bn. A Treuhand agency spokesman would neither confirm nor deny weekend press reports that claimed the agency had paid the consortium DM2.2bn to purchase Minol.</p>

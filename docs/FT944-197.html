			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians undecided on smelter refit plan Management at Russia's Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter has not yet decided which of two rival modernisation proposals from foreign companies it will accept, reports Reuters from Moscow. The Siberian plant's deputy director, Mikhail Vasilyev, said this week, however, that proposals by Alcoa (Aluminium Company of America) are less expensive than those of France's Pechiney. 'According to our experts, the French proposal is about twice as expensive as Alcoa's,' he said. Earlier this year, Pechiney submitted to the Russian state metallurgy committee a preliminary reconstruction plan for Krasnoyarsk. A Pechiney official rejected the cost comparison. 'The two projects are completely different,' he said. Much more ambitious than Alcoa's proposals, Pechiney's Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.3bn plan calls for the complete reconstruction of the plant in three stages with modern, less polluting technology. Mr Vasilyev said Alcoa, one of the world's biggest aluminium producers, was considering acquiring a 20 per cent stake in the plant. But the decision to sell these shares - held by the state - would not be taken soon. The state property committee and federal property fund last week ordered a temporary halt to selling shares in aluminium plants or registering new owners pending an investigation into share ownership and registration. This decision came shortly after Transworld, a British firm specialising in metal trading, said its 20 per cent stake in Krasnoyarsk had been crossed off the shareholders' register. But Mr Vasilyev said there was no link between negotiations over Alcoa's modernisation plans and the share issue.</p>

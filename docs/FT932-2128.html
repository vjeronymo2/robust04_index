			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / ERM should be reorganised The European exchange rate mechanism should be reorganised with wider currency fluctuation bands so that members can have scope to follow differing monetary and fiscal policies, a British bank economist has suggested, Peter Norman writes. Mr Patrick Foley, chief economic adviser at Lloyds Bank, said ERM countries would be better able to achieve economic convergence if exchange rate bands were widened to perhaps 10 per cent either side of their central rates, from the present 2.25 per cent. The planned European Monetary Institute (EMI) should be given the task of determining central rates in the new wider bands by assessing underlying economic fundamentals in the ERM countries, he said. The EMI, which is due to have a co-ordinating role for monetary policy when stage two of the Maastricht plan for economic and monetary union begins in January, could also orchestrate regular 'inflation realignments' to keep real exchange rates in the ERM relatively constant. Mr Foley's proposals would change the ERM into a 'crawling peg' currency system from one of fixed but adjustable exchange rates.</p>

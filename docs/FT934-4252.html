			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Support for banks continues The startling gains in bank shares this week, based partly on the market's reaction to the Budget, but also on Royal Bank of Scotland's sparkling preliminary results, were often extended yesterday as marketmakers scrambled to cover short positions. In a classic bear squeeze, Standard Chartered powered ahead to another all-time high, closing 43 up at 1153p, after turnover of 1.9m, while Abbey National also reached a peak, settling 15 better at 452p after big turnover of 9.4m. TSB continued to attract much higher than usual activity, the shares moving ahead to 237 1/2 p on 9m traded, with the market said to have been caught on the wrong foot. There was also speculation that the bank could be considering the sale of its United Dominions Trust business. TSB, the next big bank to report preliminary figures, announces profits in January. Royal Bank of Scotland rounded off a splendid week on a sound note, the shares edging up 2 to 430p, a week's gain of 46p, or 12 per cent, after the exceptional results which saw the dividend total increased by no less than 25 per cent. Bank specialists continued to highlight the substantial shift in sentiment in the bank sector, which it was said, could quickly respond to a steep decline in bad debt provisions and recent cost cutting. There was, however, significant profit-taking in Barclays, 5 lower at 609p, while HSBC was hit by bearish news on the Anglo/Chinese talks on Hong Kong.</p>

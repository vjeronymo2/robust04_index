			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrew North article: "Saddam Drains Life From Arab </F> Marshes"]    [Text] Southern Iraq's ancient marshlands, the largest  wetland ecosystem in the Middle East, and home to the Marsh  Arabs for nearly 5,000 years, will disappear within the next 10  to 20 years if the Iraqi government continues to drain them.    That is the conclusion of a study of environmental changes  in  the marsh region, an area slightly smaller than Wales, carried  out by a team of scientists. Of 5,800 sq miles of marsh and  lake in 1985, 57 per cent had been turned into dry land by 1992,  the authors claim. The evidence for this claim comes from  detailed study of satellite images. This transformation has  irreversibly damaged much of the wildlife of the marshland,  which is classified as of global importance by the World Wide  Fund for Nature (WWF).    The study dismisses Iraqi claims that the draining is  necessary for agricultural purposes. It concludes that the  engineering schemes "cannot result in any form of sustainable  development and cannot be regarded in any way as a wise use of  one of the world's most significant biological and cultural  resources".    The central Qurnah marshes "essentially no longer exist as  an  ecosystem", says the co-ordinator of the report, Edward Maltby,  head of the Wetland Ecosystem Research Group at Royal Holloway,  University of London. Water that previously fed this marsh has  been diverted since mid-1993 into a 42-milelong canal, known as  the Mother of Battles project, and now flows into the Persian  Gulf.    Dr Maltby's greatest concern is that the Hammar marsh, in  the  southern part of the region, will disappear. This would be a  disaster, he says, because it is biologically the most diverse.  More than half the flow of the Euphrates, which feeds this  area, is now diverted before it reaches the Hammar marsh. A  causeway constructed west of Qurnah in the last two years  prevents water from the Mother of Battles canal feeding the  marsh.    At risk in the Hammar and Hawizah marshes are 14 types of  rare birds. They include two endemic species, the Iraq Babbler  and the Basra Reed Warbler, according to Derek Scott, the  ornithological specialist in the study team.    The draining disrupts the area's role as an important  staging  area for waterfowl, migrating between breeding grounds in  Siberia and Central Asia, and winter quarters in Africa.  Two-thirds of the water-fowl that winter in the Middle East do  so in the Hammar and Hawizah marshes. Large flocks that would  normally stay in the marshes have been reported in Saudi Arabia.  Thousands of fish have died as the waters recede. Research in  the 1970s recorded 58 species in the marshland lakes and  waterways.    Further evidence of the scale of the changes in the  geography  of the marshes has come from recently released video footage and  infra red photographs, taken by RAF [Royal Air Force] Tornados  monitoring the southern no-fly zone that has been in place since  August 1992.    They show the exact layout of the engineering works, such as  the two diversions of the Euphrates near Samawah and  al-Nasiriyah, and the Mother of Battles project. The  photographs prove the existence of a new lake, which has formed  this year because of an overflow from the Samawah diversion.  This was first reported in February by Iraqi opposition groups.    Although the report pours scorn on the Iraqi government's  economic justification for the draining, it does not speculate  about alternative reasons.    Most observers believe that the engineering works have  become  part and parcel of Saddam Husayn's campaign to crush Shia  insurgents operating from the marshes. Draining the marshes has  allowed the Iraqis to penetrate their hideouts and use heavy  artillery.    Since the collapse of the 1991 Shia uprising, thousands of  people have been displaced from their homes in the region, or  killed by the security forces. The Tornado images released by  the Ministry of Defence back up these claims. They show large  numbers of marshland villages on fire.</p>

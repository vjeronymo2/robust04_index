Among them are  Commander Angel Izurieta, aide-de camp of President Aylwin; UDI  [Independent Democratic Union] Secretary General Domingo  Arteaga; and Interior Minister-designate German Correa. The  following is an updated report by our colleague Silvia Arteaga:    [Begin recording] [Arteaga] Yesterday, when Senator Frei  closed the seminar on Humanism and Democracy, nobody imagined he  had planned to be admitted into Las Condes clinic to be operated  on for an inguinal hernia on his right side which had been  bothering him for the past few months.    [Doctor Sergio Vaisman] This kind of pathology is, in  general, light and not very painful, which allowed him to lead a  relatively normal life. In fact, the senator went through his  whole presidential campaign with minor pain, but he knew he had  to undergo surgery and that is why it was scheduled for today.    [Arteaga] The operation, performed by Doctor Juan Reyes,  began today at 07:30 this morning. It lasted less than an hour.  Only his team, who accompanied him since early in the morning,  and his close aides knew about the surgery.    This morning Frei was visited by Senator Mario Papi, a  future  member of his cabinet, and Deputy Andres Palma. The doctors  believe the president-elect will be back to his normal routine  in 7 or 10 days. [end recording]    It is thought that President-elect Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle  will remain in Las Condes clinic for three days. The next  medical bulletin,the second of the day, will be released today  at 1730.</p>

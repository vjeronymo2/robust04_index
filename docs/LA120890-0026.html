			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> THE SHANGHAI ACROBATS: GIVE 'EM A TUMBLE  </P> <P> You think you had a rough day at the office? Got stuck in another freeway  traffic jam? Too bad.  </P> <P> Imagine squeezing though a barrel narrower than your shoulders. Or a keeping a  stretch of 21 porcelain plates spinning while executing some disco moves. Or  balancing 19 benches -- that's about 400 pounds -- on your head.  </P> <P> Night after night.  </P> <P> That's some of what the members of the Shanghai Acrobats and Imperial Warriors  of the Peking Opera did Thursday at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena.  Captivatingly. Enthrallingly.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the troupe had performed similar acts at the Bren Center at UC  Irvine, and the Chinese visitors faced further local appearances within days at  Caltech in Pasadena and El Camino College in Torrance. What a grind.  </P> <P> As usual, however, the seemingly impossible looked effortless. The challenges  multiplied quickly. Guesses about how complex things would get proved wrong.  </P> <P> Sure, Jing Ni could balance a stack of bowls on her head -- but upside down,  maintaining a single hand stand on the head of Jia-Cheng Zhang? Well, what  about balancing on both his hands while he turned over on the floor? And all  the while maintaining an impish smile. What about . . . oh, forget it.  </P> <P> Contortionist Wen-Tong Yu squeezed her way through a hoop -- and later a barrel  -- as easily as a loaf of bread rising.  </P> <P> Lian-Hua Pan took time for hot-stuff dance moves between rushing down a row of  tables to keep an increasing number of plates spinning.  </P> <P> Strongman Lian-Qing Pan hoisted up one, then seven, then 10, then 19  interlocking benches to balance them all on his head.  </P> <P> Probably the most breathtaking act, however, involved acrobat Wei-Zhen Zhu  balancing on a long, flexible metal pole held by Wei-Zhong Lu and Wei-Feng  Tang.  </P> <P> Get this. They would hold the pole at throat level, then jerk it upward until  their arms were fully extended. Zhu would shoot into the air where she executed  multiple somersaults -- some through a hoop -- with apparently endless time at  her disposal before returning to balance nimbly on the pole.  </P> <P> Chinese opera incorporates gymnastics in fight scenes, but the opera excerpts  presented Thursday probably were not seen to their best advantage taken out of  context and juxtaposed against the other purely gymnastic acts.  </P> <P> Sure, one could appreciate the split-second timing of the near misses in  "Fighting at the Crossroads," where two men fight one another in a pitch dark  room.  </P> <P> And one could rejoice in the wit and cleverness more than in the martial  process by which the Monkey King defeats his opponents in two excerpts from  "Havoc in Heaven." But the two forms somehow didn't really mesh. CHRIS PASLES  </P></p>

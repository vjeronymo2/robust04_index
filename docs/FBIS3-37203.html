John Major told reporters that Russia, the United States and  the European Community should use their influence to resolve the  conflict in Bosnia.    The British prime minister said Russia and NATO had the same  goal in this respect -- we want to put an end to the shelling of  Sarajevo and reach a long-term political settlement of the  conflict.    Chernomyrdin told journalists that the British prime  minister  and himself focused on the development of trade and economic  relations between the two countries and specific projects  relating, among other things, to the reconstruction of the  Moscow telephone network and some technologies for the Russian  fuel and energy sector. The British prime minister spoke in  favour of expanding European investments in the Russian industry.    Chernomyrdin said the two countries are enjoying the most  favourable climate for their trade and economic relations: in  1993, Britain came to rank third among Russia's western foreign  trade partners.</p>

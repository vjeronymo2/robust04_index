			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Fine Pinot Noir at Pounds 4.99 - Appetisers Not long ago 'affordable Pinot Noir' was rightly regarded as an oxymoron. Today it is quite possible to find charming, fruity, if relatively lightweight, Pinots from California for less than Pounds 5. Oddbins has done more than most to track them down and its Havenscourt Pinot Noir at Pounds 4.99 has considerably more interest (and less obvious sweetening) than most. But now they can also field a fine Pinot Noir at the same price from Chile, previously terra incognita as a source of delicate Pinot fruit. Hearty congratulations on Cono Sur Pinot Noir at Pounds 4.99 which shows all of the jewel-like appeal of simple young Pinot. The Reserve version is Pounds 5.99 and is also stocked by Tanners, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, but at the moment the cheaper wine is the more charming. (I assumed that Cono Sur was a pun, which only goes to show my ignorance of Spanish; it means 'southern cone' apparently.) An indication of how strongly the restaurant industry is growing is provided by the first issue of Tandoori, a magazine for the 7,500 Indian restaurants in Great Britain. It is now estimated that there are more Indian restaurants in the UK than in Bombay or Delhi. The magazine, founded by Karan Bilimoria, who established the successful Cobra Indian beer brand in the UK and its editor, Iqbal Wahhab, who set up East West Communications, to promote the growth of ethnic foods, includes features on how to market a tandoori restaurant and how Bangladeshi cuisine may develop in the UK. The publishers will no doubt be hoping to emulate the success of Patak, a company which makes Indian spices in Wigan, Lancashire and was named by Marketing magazine as the fastest growing brand in the UK last year with a 92 per cent growth in retail sales. Wine lovers should take advantage of the extremely serious wines Italy has been able to produce from recent vintages. Lea &amp; Sandeman, of Kensington Church Street, London W8 (071-221 1982) has a special offer of 1990 Supertuscans, of which Il Pergole Torte is a star at Pounds 21.74 while Oddbins Fine Wine Shops have fallen in love with Rocca Albino's 1991 Piedmont range, including two stunningly seductive Barbarescos, Vigneto Loreto at Pounds 12.99 and Vigneto Brich Ronchi at Pounds 13.99. Following the opening of its organic wholefood shop in Yaohan Plaza, Colindale, north west London, the Japan Centre group has opened another shop in the capital at 212 Piccadilly. Foods include: organic shitake mushrooms, tofu, fresh seaweed, sun-dried fish and squid, green and wheat tea, bonito flakes, noodles, pickled vegetables, seasonings, dressings and vinegars. Also available are sea vegetables such as nori (for sushi making) and instant wakame for miso soup. For those who want to give raw fish a miss, vegetarian lunch-boxes are freshly made to take away. Also on sale are Japanese bowls and cookbooks. The Piccadilly Wholefood and Bookshop is open seven days a week Mon-Sat 10am-7.30pm and Sun 10am-6pm.</p>

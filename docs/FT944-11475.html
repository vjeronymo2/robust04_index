			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: This is the night that sales explode - Clive Fewins visits a company which is enjoying its annual seasonal boom - it sells firework displays Chris Hutchison was born at 8pm on November 4, 1955. 'If I had been born four hours later my parents tell me they would have called me Guy,' he said. 'I have a feeling that would have totally altered my destiny. I do not think I could be taken seriously if I was called Guy.' Hutchison is managing director of The Firework Company, a 10-man operation based in an 800 sq ft mill outbuilding in the village of Uffculme, Devon. He says: 'In a game in which there are about 18 players we rank ourselves in the top half dozen serious suppliers.' You will not see fireworks made by Hutchison's company on sale in the high street. In fact, in common with the majority of its competitors, it does not manufacture. 'More than 60 per cent of our fireworks come from China - only about 10 per cent are UK-made - and they are nearly all designed for large displays.' Hutchison said. 'Our business is selling display packs to groups to fire themselves, and creating what we call operator-fired displays that we mount for customers.' Hutchison was a deputy store manager with Marks and Spencer, but left at 25 because he feared he was becoming institutionalised. The desire to run his own business found him first in control of a car valeting business in north London, with his wife, Peggy. 'It was a successful business but after six years I woke up one morning and decided I was not having any fun,' he said. Peggy agreed. She was even more amenable when they decided they were going to return to their Devonian roots. The fireworks came later. 'Basically I felt that firework companies were putting explosives in the hands of the public but not taking their responsibilities seriously,' Hutchison said. 'When I rang round the companies I was appalled at the lack of service and attention they provided. 'Perhaps it was my M &amp; S training in customer care, but I felt I could do better. 'I also felt there was potential in expanding the market throughout the year. Nearly three quarters of all the goods we sell go up in smoke in the few days around November 5. That leaves plenty of scope for the rest of the year.' Hutchison set up The Firework Company with Pounds 1,000 in 1988. In just over six years he has raised turnover from Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 550,000. The company mounts operator-fired displays costing from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 20,000 - they are doing 16 tonight - for customers ranging from local councils to charitable organisations and large corporate bodies. For what he calls 'DIY' displays - for organisations with more modest budgets who fire the display themselves - Hutchison supplies packs costing from Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,400. This autumn the company was runner-up in an international firework display competition in Macau. 'Nobody likes not winning but in our business it was like coming second in the Eurovision Song Contest when you are a song writer,' he said. 'Although we are at full stretch and have to hire temporary staff to assist us, nights like tonight give me a great buzz. I wish I could visit all our displays,' Hutchison said. As a child he was no more interested in fireworks than any other lad. But how he is a committed enthusiast with a 'passion for fireworks'. 'Our products bring pleasure to about half a million people a year,' he said. 'Big displays of the type we are capable of mounting really get the adrenalin going. There is something basic in all of us that responds to fire. Professionally my preference is to join the spectators. That way I can pick up the vibes. I am a great believer in selling the feeling, and I can only do that if I can really absorb the experience as one of the crowd. 'Peggy and I started with Pounds 1,000 and we have grown The Firework Co out of our customers' money,' he said. 'Our initial trading pattern was to find the customer, take the money with the order and then buy the fireworks. This way we have spun a pyrotechnic web out of very little.' Now the company is bigger he increasingly finds himself having to buy fireworks from China and several European countries well in advance of the orders for the explosively busy month of November. This has led to what he calls 'a certain retraining' of his bank manager. 'Life has not been all roses with the NatWest, partly because the company owns no premises and quite a bit of our borrowing is unsecured,' he said. 'We run on a Pounds 50,000 overdraft facility and have a Pounds 10,000 long-term loan.' Stock peaks at around Pounds 300,000 retail value in October, when the 15 tonnes of fireworks a year the company imports begin to move out from their warehouse. 'In January the figure is nearer Pounds 10,000,' Hutchison said. 'During the period in between we have huge cash flow pressures, despite our policy of always demanding payment before we despatch goods.' In the UK it makes sense for the company to diversify into non-November sales. Hutchison wants to develop the New Year's Eve market. 'In the rest of Europe December 31 is a very big,' he said. 'There is no reason why it should not be the same here.' The other big event in his sights is the millennium. Hutchison also hopes he will be able to capitalise on the kudos gained in Macau by increasing overseas sales, especially to the Middle East. 'If we could hit the French Bastille Day peak on July 14 it would help our cash flow enormously,' he said. 'So far we have been on a get-rich-slow path, but exports will unlock the door,' Hutchison said. 'Last year we made a Pounds 10,000 loss on a Pounds 500,000 turnover. This year we are hoping to return to profit. In spring 1993 Hutchison sold a total of 17 per cent of the company to five acquaintances to raise cash for the company. 'What we could do with now is an inward investment from a business angel or loan guarantee scheme. 'It would help us to buy in a more efficient way - which often means earlier  -and also to buy better. It would also help dilute my summer shackles . . .'

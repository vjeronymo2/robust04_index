			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [REUTER/YONHAP from Kiev and Istanbul] </F>   [Text] North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said on 8  June that North Korea will allow the inspections of nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon by the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] if the United States consents to resume talks with it.    Regarding the North Korean proposal that it allow nuclear  inspections conditional on North Korean-U.S. talks, U.S. State  Department Spokesman Mike McCurry, said: "Further study of  North Korea's new proposal is needed since it hinted on  flexibility in resolving the nuclear conflict." By saying so,  he did not reject the possibility of holding new dialogue with  North Korea.    In a news conference following his visit to the Ukraine,  North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said: "If North  Korean-U.S. talks are resumed, we will guarantee the inspection  of North Korean nuclear facilities by testing, measuring, and  preserving nuclear fuel rods there."    Minister Kim Yong-nam said: "The United States and North  Korea are the parties directly concerned with the current  situation regarding the nuclear issue, and only the two can  resolve the issue." He then said that "the nuclear issue was  created by the United States, and threats against North Korea  also come from the Untied States," and denounced the United  States for refusing the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks  by using delay tactics.    He stressed that the United States and some circles of the  IAEA continue to organizationally slander, defame, and attack  North Korea for political purposes.    In the meantime, Spokesman McCurry, who is currently  accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in  Istanbul, said in his commentary on DPRK Minister Kim Yong-nam's  proposal that day, that "the proposal may imply a some degree of  North Korean flexibility," and stressed: "In consideration of  the U.S. need for a guarantee that North Korea will stay in the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, further review of North Korea's  proposal is needed [migugurosonun pukhani haekhwaksan choyage  kyesok namaiddanun pojangul piryoro handanun kyonjieso igatun  cheuirul toisang pyonggahal piryoga idda]."    Spokesman McCurry added: "It is certainly important for the  IAEA to be authorized to conduct nuclear inspections in North  Korea."    Regarding this, U.S. officials concerned roused public  attention not to react excessively to recent announcements by  North Korea over the nuclear issue. U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher who arrived in Istanbul on 8 June to attend  the NATO foreign ministers' meeting also said that he was not  taking all the announcements reported from North Korea at their  face value.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] By the beginning of May this year, workers at the  Uzenneft Oil and Gas Recovery Directorate achieved good results,  having recovered 272,509 tonnes of oil. This good result was  achieved through reconstruction and the efficient use of  technology and personnel. All eight oilfields worked  concertedly along with other units of the Mangistaumunaygas  production amalgamation. The fact that 91 wells have been  commissioned from the mothballed fund and 10 wells automated has  also played its role.</p>

Lykov, Minsk; UDC537.312:541.49]    [Abstract] The CVD method of chemical deposition from the  vapor phase, used widely to prepare high temperature  superconductor film, is easy to control, has a high film growth  rate, makes it possible to obtain high quality films on large  areas and complex substrates, and provides high temperature  superconductor films with perfect surface structures without  additional high temperature calcining. One of the most important  problems arising in chemical precipitation from the vapor phase  is the selection of volatile compounds which may be converted  into the vapor phase and recondensed without change in  composition. Low polarity compounds having a covalent bond  between the metal atom and the ligand are the most volatile. The  molecules of the complex must not interact with each other or  with other compounds. Metal complexes with _b_-diketones are  frequently used as starting materials having acceptable  volatility to form fine superconducting films from the vapor  phase. In the present work a study was made of the effect the  structure of the ligand and the nature of the metal have on the  volatility of the complexes used to prepare superconductor films  having the composition Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O by using the  CVD method. Values are presented on the thermodynamic  characteristics of vaporization of the above compounds, their  heat and temperature of sublimation, and conditions for thermal  decomposition and storage.

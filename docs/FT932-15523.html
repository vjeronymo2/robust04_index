			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Managing highways for local authority A multi-million pound contract has been signed by Berkshire County Council and engineering consultants BABTIE GROUP who took over the council's highways and planning services on April 1. The four-year contract is worth more than Pounds 30m in fees and will see the consultants handling projects worth Pounds 140m over the same period. The contract is believed to be the largest ever awarded by a local authority and makes Berkshire the first council to externalise its highways and planning services. It has also resulted in a saving to the county council of Pounds 1.3m in 1993/94 and this figure is expected to increase in subsequent years. Babtie will take 309 of the department's 383 permanent and temporary staff and about 20 will continue to be employed by the county council on the 'clientside' to manage the contract. Fourteen staff will be ending temporary contracts, while a further 26 are taking voluntary redundancy leaving the council with 14 compulsory redundancies.</p>

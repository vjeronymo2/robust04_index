			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Ji Tao (4764 3447) and Trainee Li Xuemei (2621 </F> 1331 2734) "The Municipal Work Conference of Adult Education  Opens"]    [Excerpt] The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the  municipal people's government jointly sponsored the first  municipal work conference of adult education on 29 March. Li  Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, sent a  congratulatory letter to the conference. Chen Xitong, secretary  of the municipal party committee, and Li Qiyan, mayor of the  municipality, also extended their congratulations on the  convocation of the work conference. Attending the conference  were Wang Mingda, Li Zhijian, Tao Siping, Hu Zhaoguang, and Chen  Dabai.    In his letter Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council,  extended congratulations on the convocation of the work  conference and expressed cordial regard to teachers, cadres,  staff members, and workers throughout the municipality, who are  engaging in the adult education work.    He said: Developing educational undertakings and enhancing  the socialist spiritual civilization represent not only the  content of building modernizations in China but also an  important guarantee for the smooth progress of reform, opening  up, and economic construction. Under the present situation in  which reform is being deepened and opening up is being  broadened, it is necessary for us to upgrade in an overall way  the quality of people in China and to train a large number of  talented personnel suitable to the demand of modernizations and  a large number of high-quality laborers. Therefore, it is  imperative to put education in a strategic position of priority  development. Adult education is an important component of  educational undertakings in China and deserves to develop  vigorously. He urged relevant personnel in the municipality to  emancipate their minds, to seek truth from facts, to  continuously deepen the reform by proceeding from the country's  reality, to promote the healthy development of adult education  through reform, and to train more outstanding and practical  talented personnel so as to enable them to play an important  role in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    Vice Mayor Hu Zhaoguang delivered a report entitled  "Emancipate Minds, Seize the Opportunity, Deepen the Reform, and  Vigorously Develop Adult Education in the Capital" at the  conference on behalf of the municipal party committee and the  municipal people's government. In his report he chiefly  mentioned about the following five aspects: The review of adult  education conducted by the capital over the past 15 years in  which reform and opening up have been enforced. The position  and role played by the adult education in the capital's economic  construction and social development. The target and mission set  for the development of adult education in the capital in a  coming period. The orientation and major contents set for the  capital to deepen its reform in the adult education. Major  measures for the capital to vigorously develop its adult  education.    In his report Hu Zhaoguang said: The capital's achievements  scored in the adult education has been marked. It has fostered  the schooling systems of adult education; with the capital's  characteristics; at multiple levels; and with multiple  standards, styles, and channels. In 1993 the municipality held  training classes that were attended by 3.01 million personnel.  However, the present quality as a whole of several millions of  labor forces in the municipality still cannot meet the demand of  reform and construction. He urged governments at all levels,  various industries and trades, and enterprises, to place adult  education as an important daily schedule; to orient adult  education into their local and departmental plans for economic  and social development; and to regard it as an important content  in arranging, examining, and summarizing their fiscal work.    In citing the target and purpose set for the capital to  achieve in development of adult education in the upcoming  period, Hu Zhaoguang said: The municipality will concentrate  its efforts in the coming period on enforcing the "Beijing  personnel training project to cope with the personnel shortage  at the high level," "Beijing training project for personnel  transfer," and "Beijing training project for the staff members  and workers of township enterprises." By regarding the three  projects as leading targets, the municipality will promote  reform and development in the adult education.    Wang Mingda, vice minister of education, also delivered a  speech at the work conference, in which he fully acknowledged  the achievements scored by the municipality in its education  work and the characteristics fostered by the municipality in its  adult education. He also mentioned from the macro angle about  the important role of adult education and about some issues  needing attention. He said: The Beijing Municipal Party  Committee and the municipal people's government have attached  great importance on the adult education. The content of report  made at the work conference jointly sponsored by them on adult  education is substantial and the measures put in the report are  helpful. The municipality will certainly play a model role in  developing adult education in the country. [passage omitted]</p>

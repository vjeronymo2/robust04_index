			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland seeks SE listing SWITHLAND, the Midlands car retailer, is seeking a Stock Exchange listing through a share placing which will give the group a market value of Pounds 21.4m. The placing involves 18.5m shares, about 70 per cent of the issued equity, at a price of 81p each. Of this, 12.34m will be new shares, the sale of which will raise Pounds 9.05m net. The balance of 6.1m shares is owned either by NatWest Ventures, Swithland's venture capital backer for the past two years, or Mr John Hayes, the group's founder and chief executive, and members of his family. Ionian Corporate Finance is sponsoring the placing, for which the broker is Harris Allday Lea &amp; Brooks. Trading in the shares will start on November 15, provided buyers have been found for the issue of new shares. If not, the issue will be cancelled. If the offering is completely sold, the Hayes family's holding in Swithland will be 29.96 per cent. The share placing represents both re-financing of the group and clearance of the decks for expansion. Of the Pounds 9.05m raised, Pounds 0.5m will be used to redeem preference shares held by NatWest Ventures, Pounds 322,000 to buy from Mr Hayes a piece of land over which the group has an option and about Pounds 6m to retire debt, reducing gearing from 240 per cent to 40 per cent. The balance of the funds will be kept in reserve for expansion. 'Over the next three years we're looking to acquire another 10 retail operations, all within the Central TV area', said Mr Hayes. Swithland now has 16 retail centres in the Midlands; it specialises in selling nearly new and used cars and, to 85 per cent of its customers, providing related finance. Expansion will take place against the background of concentration in car retailing. 'Groups have been getting bigger over the past two and a half years. Over the next five to seven years, about 20 groups will emerge which will dominate the industry,' Mr Hayes said.</p>

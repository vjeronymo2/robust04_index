			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / German forces cleared for UN actions: Allies welcome court decision enabling Bonn to play full peacekeeping role Germany's constitutional court yesterday gave the green light for the country's troops to take part in future United Nations operations outside the Nato area. The historic judgment by the country's highest legal authority removes the constitutional ambiguity that prevented Germany from participating directly in the Gulf War and in nearly all UN blue helmet operations. The decision of the Karlsruhe-based court means that German forces will be able to take part in both peacekeeping and peacemaking exercises of the UN, provided the German parliament has given its prior approval. It says the Bundeswehr can take part in international missions as part of Germany's international alliances, including Nato and the Western European Union, in carrying out decisions of the UN Security Council, or directly under the authority of the UN itself. The judgment was instantly welcomed by the German government, for which it is a political victory, by its Nato allies and by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. The move is seen as enabling Germany to play its full part in international peace operations. US president Bill Clinton, who is on a visit to Berlin, said the decision was correct 'because of the leadership of Germany, because of the conduct of Germany, because of the role Germany has played in the creation of Europe'. Although the decision is on the face of it a setback for the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), which brought the legal challenge, its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, welcomed the outcome as an essential measure to clarify a longstanding grey area in the German constitution. He said it also denied the government the 'free hand' it had sought in sending troops outside the Nato area, by insisting on separate parliamentary approval for every operation. In two important ways, however, the court has given future German governments greater room for manoeuvre than the SPD had hoped. It makes no distinction between peacekeeping and peacemaking operations, and it requires a simple majority vote in the Bundestag rather than the two-thirds majority necessary to override the constitution. The decision was announced as part of a 142-page judgment by the court on the participation of German military personnel in three UN-sanctioned operations outside the Nato area - the aerial surveillance by Awacs aircraft of the 'no-fly zone' in Bosnia; the involvement of a German frigate in enforcing the UN embargo on former Yugoslavia in the Adriatic; and the attempt to enforce peace in Somalia, from which Germany has now withdrawn. In each case, the court concluded the exercise did not contravene the German constitution, but it called for the two exercises in former Yugoslavia to be sanctioned retrospectively by the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the judgment as confirmation of the government's policy of stepping up its involvement in UN missions, but hastened to say it would not necessarily lead to a rash of decisions to send German soldiers abroad. 'We will decide on a case by case basis,' he said at a press conference with Mr Clinton. 'We are not going to create a mood of 'Germans to the front'.' Although allies have rejoiced at the judgment, within Germany there remains great political caution about the circumstances in which the country's troops can and will be used to support United Nations missions around the world. Secondly, there are considerable doubts about just how ready the Bundeswehr - the German armed forces - is to mount such operations. Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats, and a leading campaigner for 'out-of-area' operations to be approved, was adamant that it would not have dramatic consequences. 'We have no intention of dreaming up as many missions as possible for the Bundeswehr to take part in,' he said. In the near future, the Bundeswehr is scarcely well-prepared for comprehensive out-of-area operations, although it can certainly provide very useful logistical support, according to Dr Holger May, head of the Institute for Strategic Analysis in Bonn. 'On the one hand, the Bundeswehr has the third largest airlift capacity in the world,' he said. 'We are one of only three Nato allies (the others are the US and Netherlands) who can provide missile defence with Patriot missiles.' On the other hand, there are clear disadvantages from having always planned German operations on the assumption of operating close to home. The German air force, for example, urgently needs to increase its logistical range, because it has never expected to operate away from domestic servicing and repair facilities. 'It is certainly not true, as some people at the defence ministry are saying, that we cannot organise a mission out of area before the year 2000,' Dr May said. 'That is nonsense. But it makes the case clearer than ever that we could never go it alone.'</p>

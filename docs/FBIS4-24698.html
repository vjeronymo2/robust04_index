			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, May 31 (XINHUA) -- More than 2.3 million  rural people lived in poverty-stricken areas in northeast  China's Liaoning province are now able to earn more than 500  yuan a year, the provincial poverty line, after eight years of  efforts by the government.    A relatively well-off province in China, Liaoning is quite  imbalanced in its regional development and there were 3.6  million people living below the poverty line in 1986.    Under the government's preferential policies, adopted since  1986, areas in the eastern, western and northern parts of the  province have been offered loans of more than 550 million yuan  for upgrading and restructuring the local farming industry,  enterprises and commercial sectors.    Preliminary success has been achieved. The aided projects  have created tax-yields and profits of 330 million yuan and  benefited some 700,000 families in the past eight years.    In addition, public facilities and infrastructure facilities  have been improved: 49 highways -- 1,800 kilometers in all --  and more than 100 new bridges were constructed. New irrigation  channels and wells were upgraded. Drinking water problems for  more than 1.24 million people and 260,000 head of livestock in  these areas have been solved.</p>

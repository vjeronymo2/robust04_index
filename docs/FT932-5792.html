			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Third time lucky: Plans to exempt small companies from audits Mr Peter Bumpas, managing director of Fabricators Steel Supply, a small steel supplier in Essex, has a simple attitude to the UK law requiring annual audits: 'It is of no benefit to us.' If a radical consultation paper from the Department of Trade and Industry becomes law, the requirement could disappear. The paper calls for the removal of the statutory annual audit for about 250,000-300,000 companies with an annual turnover below Pounds 37,600 - the threshold for paying value-added tax. Under the DTI proposals, company directors would remain responsible for maintaining financial records and filing annual accounts. But the verification of an external auditor would either be eliminated, or replaced by a 'compilation report' requiring less scrutiny from accountants: in short, a statement that the figures comply with the requirements of UK company law. Shareholders would have unanimously to approve any decision to drop the audit. The DTI has come under increasing pressure to lift the annual burden from small companies largely because of the costs to business and to accountants, who have to comply with a new audit regulation regime. Critics allege that the statutory audit is expensive and time-consuming. A study by Manchester University suggests the audit fee is 2 per cent to 4.5 per cent of turnover for small companies. Under laws dating from the early 1900s, Britain's 1.1m limited liability companies - in which creditors can lay claim only to the assets of the business and not to the personal assets of the directors - must produce annual audited accounts. An independent accountant, acting on behalf of the shareholders, is required to verify that the accounts prepared by the directors present a 'true and fair view' of the company's financial position. However, the same auditing requirements apply to the largest quoted company and the smallest business. Mr Bumpas's company falls into this latter category. Like most small company owners, Mr Bumpas is also the principal shareholder, and his auditor is also his book-keeper. So he hires his auditor to protect him (as a shareholder), and verify the accounts that he (as a director) has prepared in conjunction with his accountant (in his role as book-keeper). Despite business drying up in the recession, Mr Bumpas is still required to have an annual audit. 'I am paying my accountant Pounds 900 for nothing,' he says. That view is shared by Mr Neil Hamper, Mr Bumpas's accountant. 'It is a nonsense,' he says. 'I would feel much happier if I was acting just as a small business adviser.' Such criticism helps explain why the abolition of the audit of smaller companies has been examined by the DTI twice before in the past decade. But on both occasions ministers rejected reform, in the face of opposition from bodies such as the Inland Revenue, banks and credit-rating agencies, which opposed any change that might be seen to affect the credibility of financial information. However, a consensus seems to be emerging between some former opponents of change. The Inland Revenue says it has been consulted by the DTI over the proposals and its senior officials see the need to ease the burden on small business. The British Bankers' Association has also been won over by the reform argument. 'We can see the need to try to lift the requirement (for a statutory audit),' it said. 'We welcome it.' Banks, like the Inland Revenue, have more leverage over companies and can request detailed information about their financial position as a condition for loans. Professional accountancy bodies have been split over reform in the past, but even the previously hostile Chartered Association of Certified Accountants admits that the smallest company would benefit more from spending money on business advice and book-keeping than on annual audits. Pressure from the DTI, combined with the low exemption level, and the belief that small companies would still require the services of an accountant, have persuaded the association to change its position. Mr David Bishop, the outgoing Acca president, says: 'It seems a sensible attempt at reducing bureaucracy and lessening the hassle for the accountants operating in the market.' Support for reform has always come from business itself. Some view the DTI plans as not far-reaching enough. Mr Tony Miller, an accountant who is financial affairs chairman for the National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses, says: 'This is a step in the right direction but the plans are still far too restrictive.' The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, for instance, calls for exemption for companies with a turnover below Pounds 300,000. Some strong opposition remains. Mr Terry Robinson, a vice-president of the Institute of Credit Management, warns that credit-rating agencies would resist the changes. He argues that, without an audit, companies' figures would be less reliable, thus making an assessment of credit-worthiness more difficult or, in some cases, impossible. This in turn would make it more difficult for small companies to raise loans. 'This will work against the best interests of small companies,' he says. Several industry observers believe that removing the need for scrutiny of accounts by an independent accountant could give rise to greater risk of fraud. The DTI devotes just a paragraph in its document on the likelihood of fraud, which claims that this danger is minimal in small companies. It adds that exemption from audit would not be permitted for small companies that are part of a larger group which could be used to hide illegal financial transactions. With most traditional objectors now sympathetic to reform, regulations to raise the threshold required for an annual audit could be drafted within 12 months. Ironically, that would leave Mr Bumpas's company exempt just at the point when business could pick up and his turnover rise to the point where he would once more require an audit.</p>

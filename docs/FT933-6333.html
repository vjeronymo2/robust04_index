			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Bonn plays down Kohl doubts over farm deal GERMAN officials spent yesterday back-tracking on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's apparent endorsement this week of French demands that a hard-fought US-EC farm trade agreement finalised late last year should be renegotiated. But French officials welcomed what they described as a turning point in Germany's stance on agricultural exports. They said it could end France's isolation in international trade negotiations. Both governments confirmed talks would be held between senior trade officials next week in Paris to seek a common position on farm trade exports. In Washington, trade officials found it hard to believe the German government had genuinely shifted its position. Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau, commented: 'If this is really true, it could mean the end of the Gatt talks. But there is apparently disagreement about what he (Mr Kohl) meant.' After meeting French prime minister Edouard Balladur on Thursday, Mr Kohl said that, like France, Germany had 'problems with the agricultural part of negotiations, with the Blair House agreement', and needed to find 'a compromise acceptable for everyone'. France, under pressure from a powerful agricultural lobby, has strongly opposed last year's EC-US Blair House agreement aimed at paving the way for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of international trade talks. French officials said they were convinced Germany was prepared to reopen negotiations on the agreement to avert a European crisis on the issue. 'It is a significant shift,' said one official. But Mr Norbert Schafer, the German government spokesman, insisted Germany was not calling for formal renegotiation of the Blair House agreement. The chancellor's office said the coming talks would bring clarity on demands made on the French side. However, senior officials in the Bonn Agriculture Ministry reiterated Mr Kohl's words that Germany had a few problems with the Blair House agreement. They said Germany would not oppose renegotiations between the European Commission and the US on some specific issues. However, the whole agreement was not put into question, they said. The Commission, which negotiated the Blair House deal on behalf of the EC, had no official response to Mr Kohl's remarks. But nor, unofficially, was Brussels prepared to interpret them as a real shift in Germany's position. France's principal objection is to the agreement's provision for a 21 per cent cut in subsidised food exports over six years, which it says will cripple its lucrative cereals trade. Mr Kohl last October backed French calls for a strong 'rebalancing' clause in any farm trade agreement - meaning restraints on US cereals substitutes equal to cuts in EC cereals subsidies and exports. Yet it is difficult for Bonn to pursue this now, since its proposed alternative draft was inserted verbatim into the Blair House deal. In Washington, a senior US trade official said: 'It is unclear to us at this time whether these statements mean that the EC is considering a change in its support for Blair House, but obviously this would cause grave concerns. 'The EC must recognise that Blair House was itself a painful compromise, and that many US farm groups would like even deeper cuts in EC subsidies, Reopening this issue poses the serious risk of unraveling the Uruguay Round and reviving the oilseeds dispute. We feel certain the EC will live up to its agreements.'</p>

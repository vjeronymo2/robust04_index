			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE OF KECK TELESCOPE  </P> <P> It is unfortunate that the headline accompanying your article on the W.M. Keck  Observatory conveyed a misleading impression of the technical feasibility of  the project (Science/Medicine, Jan. 30). The principal innovation in the Keck  Telescope is the use of a primary mirror comprised of 36 hexagonal segments.  With this approach, it became possible to consider building a telescope with  four times the mirror area of the 200-inch Hale Telescope at the Palomar  Observatory.  </P> <P> Judging from the many milestones accomplished to date, the future of the Keck  Telescope looks bright. Our successes are numerous: At the observatory site, a  newly completed dome stands ready to receive the telescope. The telescope  structure is scheduled to be shipped this spring for installation. The support  systems for the mirror segments are finished. Work on the mirror segments  recently passed into the manufacturing stage, following a lengthy and  successful period of developing tools, test equipment, and manufacturing  procedures suitable for the unique requirements of the segmented-mirror design.  Even with the delay in mirror development, we expect to begin operations in  1991, as scheduled, with a telescope that takes optimum advantage of the seeing  conditions on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  </P> <P> The use of a segmented mirror has been made possible by two new technologies  that have been developed and demonstrated with prototype hardware by J.E.  Nelson and his colleagues at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. One of these  involved the sensors and actuators needed to actively monitor and adjust the  location of adjacent segments so that together they will form the surface of a  single mirror 10 meters (400 inches) in diameter.  </P> <P> The other enabling technology is stressed mirror polishing, a process that uses  the simplicity of spherical polishing techniques to produce the aspherical  surfaces of the individual segments.  </P> <P> We are confident that the Keck Telescope will contribute to unprecedented  astronomical discovery. By gathering faint light from the universe's most  distant regions, the telescope will help us piece together the very early  history of the universe and so learn how galaxies formed. By bringing us views  from the interiors of star-forming clouds, it will provide insight into how our  solar system formed.  </P> <P> THOMAS E. EVERHART  </P> <P> President, Caltech  </P></p>

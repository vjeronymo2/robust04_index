			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Lebanese Forces central media </F> apparatus on 22 March--read by announcer]    [Excerpt] Some mass media have tended in the past few days  to publish information citing unknown and undeclared sources  concerning the ongoing investigations into the explosions that  recently targeted the Lebanese people.    After returning to the competent judicial authorities to  ascertain the validity of the circulated and published reports,  rumors, leaks, details, names, accusations, and fabricated  scenarios, the Lebanese Forces were assured they were false.    Hence the appeal to the mass media to beware the risks  involved in falling for misleading falsification campaigns being  launched against the forces and other spiritual and partisan  quarters. They stress that the mass media should shoulder their  nationalist responsibility in such critical circumstances by  refraining from publishing any reports or information unless  they are issued by the competent judicial authorities who have  the legal authorization to comment on the progress of the  ongoing investigations.    If such assaults continue against Lebanese Forces' officials  and individuals, the forces regret that they will be compelled  to take the legal action necessary to preserve their rights,  particularly moral rights, against anyone who indulges in  falsification, distortion, and libel campaigns or false  accusations.

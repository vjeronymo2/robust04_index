			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the entrapment zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water and marsh habitat. Dispersion in areas downstream from the State and Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive, protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In contrast, when located upstream, the entrapment zone becomes confined in the deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack high zooplankton productivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Erkkila  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, in July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of Fish and Game, California Department of Water Resources, and Bureau of Reclamation, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island in Suisun Bay north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang 1991). These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution surveys, Wang (1991) was able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to Suisun Bay in late June and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied by the species *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed *&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination *&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation,'' as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``*&blank;*&blank;* to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.'' Therefore, areas designated as critical habitat must contain those physical or biological features essential to recover a species to the point that it no longer requires protection under the Act. Hence, critical habitat designation affords species additional protection above and beyond those of listing in that it preserves options for the species' eventual recovery. Section 3 further states that in most cases the entire range of a species should not be encompassed within critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat designations alert Federal and State agencies, other organizations, and the public about the importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical habitat also identifies areas that may require special management or protection. Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by Federal agencies. Section 7 requires that Federal agencies consult on actions that may affect critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Section 7 also requires Federal agencies to confer on Federal actions that are likely to result in adverse modification or destruction of proposed critical habitat. Aside from the added protection provided under section 7, the Act does not provide other direct forms of protection to lands designated as critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to considering biological information in designating critical habitat, the Service also considers economic and other relevant impacts of designating critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat when the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical habitat, provided that the exclusion will not result in the extinction of a species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Primary Constituent Elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological features that are essential to a species' conservation (50 CFR 424.12). The Service is required to list the known primary constituent elements together with a description of any critical habitat that is proposed. Such physical and biological features (i.e., primary constituent elements) include, but are not limited to, the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Cover or shelter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination, or seed dispersal; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

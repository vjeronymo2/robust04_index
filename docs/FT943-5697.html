			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Elf blames 10% fall on lower oil prices Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, yesterday blamed a 10 per cent drop in first-half net profits, to FFr1.2bn (Pounds 145m) on lower crude oil prices and refining margins and higher financial charges. Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman, said uncertainties over the price of oil and the value of the dollar made full-year forecasts difficult. In 1993 Elf showed a FFr1.4bn net profit in the first six months but turned in FFr1.07bn for the full year. 'We are still on course in our strategy to concentrate on our core sectors of oil, chemicals and health, and to improve our competitiveness to the level of other oil majors,' he said. After rapid expansion in recent years, Mr Jaffre said the group's goal now was to consolidate its position by cost-cutting and sales of non-core businesses. Capital spending was 13 per cent lower in the first half, while the French group has cut its stake in the Leuna refinery project in eastern Germany from 100 to 43 per cent. Mr Jaffre said asset sales of FFr1.5bn in the first half were 'a bit slower than I had hoped', but he predicted sales of FFr5bn-6bn this year and about the same next year. Elf said profits on chemicals tripled in the first half and its health activities remained stable. Evolutionary approach, Page 22</p>

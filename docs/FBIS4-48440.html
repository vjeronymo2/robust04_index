			<p>BFN     [Text] In Niger, there was a violent clash in the north of  the country on 16 May between the Tuareg rebels and the  government forces. The toll seems to be quite high, Christophe  Boisbouvier:    [Boisbouvier] Yes, according to several sources, this, the  most violent clash in a year, took place in a village of 3,000  inhabitants, called (Tiama), in the Air mountains, about 200 Km  north of Agades, on Monday afternoon. The army, equipped with  machineguns, and a rebel unit of (Mohamed Anoko's) Popular Front  for the Liberation of the Sahara were involved in the clash.  The toll is not yet clearly established, but according to rebel  sources 24 were killed on the government side and 16 on the  rebel side, eight of them being killed after being captured, but  it is impossible to confirm these figures at the moment.    This incident looks as though it could relaunch the war in  these mountains in northern Niger after several weeks of  relative calm. However, the two sides appear to be still  prepared to sit at the negotiating table, perhaps in Paris in  mid-June. It is true that after the latest talks in Ouagadougou  no cease-fire was concluded.</p>

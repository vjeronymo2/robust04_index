			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago del Estero, 6 Apr (NA) -- Today, President  Carlos Menem harshly criticized the parties that are urging  Argentines to cast blank votes in the 10 April elections. He  asserted it was time for people "to decide on whether to be hot  or cold, as God will spew forth those who are lukewarm."    Yesterday, similar to what happened in Cordoba Province, the  head of state once again called on citizens to turn out in  massive number at the polls to elect Constituent Assembly  members. Menem defended the advantages of the constitutional  reform during a political tour he made of Frias, La Banda, and  the city of Santiago del Estero to prop up the electoral  possibilities for the Justicialist Party [PJ] in the provinces.    The president arrived in Santiago del Estero this morning  from Cordoba, accompanied by Education Minister Jorge Rodriguez,  Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega, and National Mortgage Bank  President Adelina Dalesio de Viola. He was welcomed at the  airport by Santiago del Estero federal trustee Juan Schiaretti.  He then flew to the city of Frias, which is located 175 km from  here, where he later presided over a party rally. Menem  delivered a speech at this rally, which was held in the 25 de  Mayo Square in front of the town hall, after Schiaretti.    Menem sharply reprimanded those who are campaigning for the  blank vote. Once again, he exhorted citizens to turn out in  massive numbers to vote on 10 April because "now is the time to  take a firm stand" to keep abreast of our country's  transformation process. During his address, the head of state  stressed that "the time has come to turn to the Biblical  expression: As you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, God  will spew you forth. Lukewarmness is not a viable choice. This  is why I do not understand how some politicians can be  campaigning in favor of the blank vote," he stressed before  asking "what is the value of a blank vote at a time when one has  to stake everything on our homeland?"    Menem harshly reprimanded those who criticize the agreement  signed with the Radical Civic Union [UCR]. He stated: "More than  70 percent of Argentines are included in the pact," as they are  represented by the two leading political parties in the country,  the PJ and the UCR. He recalled that "six constitutional  amendments were made in the past without there ever being a  consensus by the majority parties." He deemed that "it is of  paramount importance to reformulate the current legislation in  this transformation process Argentina is undergoing."    The president then conceded that "these are not easy times."  He nonetheless warned that "there was no other way but to apply  the model and the proposal that is under way in order to lift  Argentina out of its stagnation." He noted that "40, 50 years  ago, the Argentine Republic was counted as one of the 10 best  countries in the world. We are now rated as No. 16. I intend  to once again occupy the position we used to have," he remarked.  He also insisted that with regard to GDP, Argentina "is the  country that has registered the greatest growth in the western  world over the last three years, and comes in third within the  world context after the PRC and Thailand."    Menem then devoted several minutes to the particular  question  of Frias in alluding to the building of sewage lines, the  possible establishment of a free trade zone, the building of the  Federal Channel which will provide water to three northwestern  provinces, and the canalization of the Bermejo River.    After the rally, the head of state returned to this capital  and got on a bus to travel to La Banda. There, at the Olimpia  Club, he participated in a ceremony to dedicate 122 homes in the  Ramon Taboada neighborhood. During the evening, Menem attended a  ceremony at the Juventud Club where he made several  announcements of strictly local interest. Later, he presided  over a political rally to close the PJ's election campaign at  the intersection of Belgrano and Leon Gallo Streets.    Menem's visit to Santiago del Estero Province coincided with  a strike of physicians, teachers, and civil servants united in  ATE [Association of State Workers], which the previous day had  declared him "persona non grata." Today, ATE Chairperson Alba  Luna de Castillo stated Menem was given "an icy welcome." She  emphasized that "there was nobody at the airport because today  is a day of mourning for Santiago del Estero residents."  Moreover, she engaged in a vitriolic attack on Schiaretti,  saying that "he spends province funds on political rallies" and  "has done nothing to solve the problems affecting our public  administration."</p>

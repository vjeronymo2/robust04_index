			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Executives strive to cope with job loss: Back-to-work strategies in a recession with record managerial redundancies A SENIOR executive living in an exclusive cul-de-sac in stockbroker-belt Surrey was so traumatised when he lost his job two years ago that he disguised the fact from his golf-partner neighbours for several months. Eighteen months later he was still without work but was a happier man - all but one of the seven breadwinners in his cul-de-sac were by then unemployed too. Mr Mark Scott, a partner in recruiting agency Jamieson Scott, tells this story to illustrate the unprecedented increase in executive, management and professional unemployment that has been a feature of the present recession. Nobody knows precisely how many managers are unemployed. In the early 1980s the Department of Employment stopped keeping information about former occupations of the unemployed - classifying managers is in any case difficult. But according to an Employment Department study of London and the South-East, 19 per cent of the unemployed have worked in professional or managerial occupations. That is about 150,000 people, and 400,000 for the whole country. This figure is not just a result of recession. Organisational change has permanently cut out layers of generalist middle managers and computers have wiped out certain specialisms. A survey by Reed Personnel Services predicts that managers will be the staff in least demand as the recession ends. It adds that companies have reduced management staff by 27 per cent during the recession, beaten only by unskilled staff who have declined 31 per cent. Do unemployed managers respond differently to unemployed non-managers? There are plenty of true stories of dynamic executives setting up sandwich delivery services or working, at least temporarily, as mini-cab drivers. But it appears managers are actually less flexible than most non-managers as regards future employment. An Employment Department study of the South-East reveals only 20 per cent of managers are prepared to consider non-managerial positions. Ms Dulce Merritt, managing director of Reed Accountancy, the employment agency, says that in the early stages of recession managers did seem prepared to take jobs below their previous pay and status but that has now stopped. She points out that sacked managers are often the least effective and flexible and therefore are less able to return to the job market. Generalist managers tend to be unemployed longest, but some groups, such as credit and tax managers, have not been hit at all. The Employment Department study shows that managers are under-represented - only 10 per cent - among those unemployed for 18 months or longer - self-employment may explain this. According to figures compiled Clubs, designed to help executives back to work, 4,041 out of the 12,158 executives who used the service last year got a job. A further 1,430 had a 'positive outcome', meaning in most cases self-employment. Senior executives in their 40s and 50s, with a marketable skill, often have to learn to survive by building up a portfolio of part-time consultancy jobs. 'That means a huge change in working life, some thrive but many find it tough,' says Mr Scott.                         *      *      * MR ROD HARVEY used to design buildings. Recently he has been sweeping floors on building sites for a few pounds an hour while he searches for a full-time job, Lisa Wood writes. An architect by profession, Mr Harvey's goal is to work in a 'people area', preferably in equal opportunities. A former Pounds 30,000-plus earner, he would definitely take a salary cut. Mr Harvey, a 42-year-old New Zealander, used to work for Chapman Taylor Partners, once the UK's second-largest architectural firm. In 1989 it had 650 staff - last year when Mr Harvey was made redundant it employed 150 people. He said: 'My last job was the mechanical and electrical co-ordinator on a Pounds 76m shopping and leisure centre in Woking. It was a massive job but contracts like those are just not coming up anymore.' He signed on with the Unemployment Office last August. His wife works and so he did not qualify for any form of income support or housing benefit. Over the year, while doing an MSC in construction management, Mr Harvey has applied for almost 800 jobs. He started by applying to other architectural firms but has now changed tack and wants a job in personnel. Several of his colleagues at the Birkbeck Executive Job Club, run by Kennedy Scott, a training development company, also want jobs in the 'people' business. Mr Harvey says: 'I'm lucky. I have been able to find a new job goal. A lot of us are just numb for a long time after being pushed out of our jobs.'</p>

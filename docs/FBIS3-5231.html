The 250-man "Evergreen" Unit will  leave the African country aboard a chartered plane on March 17  and arrive in Seoul the following day, according to the  ministry. The unit's equipment will arrive via ship and reach  the port city of Pusan sometime next month.    The Evergreen Unit marked South Korea's first participation  ever in a U.N. Peacekeeping Operation (PKO). It was dispatched  to the strife-torn nation last July for a one-year tour of duty,  but the Seoul government decided on an early withdrawal, around  April, after scores of Western nations announced their intention  to pull out. South Korea pushed up the withdrawal date to next  week after similar decisions were made by the United States and  other nations.</p>

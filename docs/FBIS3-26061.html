He  emphatically pointed out: In implementing the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee and of  the Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fifth Regional Party  Committee, it is necessary to clearly understand the situation,  strengthen unity, engage in arduous struggle, overcome  difficulties, strengthen the building of socialist democracy and  the legal system, and promote the establishment of the socialist  market economic structure.    At the forums held on the evening of 7 January and on the  afternoon of 9 January, Liu Zhenyi, Zhang Yingqi, Liu Zhen, Yang  Xilin, Jia Cai, Yu Xinglong, Wang Tianen, Yi Junhua, Wang  Xiumei, Liu Xiaowang, Wuerjilang, Liu Zuohui, Yun Gui, Feng  Yuqiang, and Zhou Guangde and other comrades gave speeches one  after another on the current situation, the hot topics of the  people's concern, economic construction, and the building of  democracy and the legal system.    At the forums, Comrade Wang Qun frequently chipped in and  gave speeches.    Wang Qun said: Comrades have offered many very constructive  suggestions. You have done a lot of investigation and research  work, have the practical situation well in hand, and reflected  the opinions and demands of the masses.    Wang Qun pointed out: The situation in our region is  currently excellent. This is the common understanding of all.  However, there are still many difficulties and problems that  merit the great attention of the regional party committee, the  regional people's congress standing committee, and the regional  government. Regarding the existing problems, the most crucial  issue involved is to treat them correctly and solve them  properly. For example, the problem on the gap between the  development rate of our region and that of the developed areas  must be solved with the common efforts of the higher and the  lower levels of the whole region. Our Inner Mongolia has a great  momentum for development, and our development pace will not be  slow in the days to come. First, we have a definite foundation  and a clearly-defined correct development strategy; second, the  state's input in Inner Mongolia is very big; and third, the  state has adopted special policies in the border minority areas.  We should have full confidence in narrowing the gap between our  region and the developed areas.    Wang Qun stressed: Leaders at all levels should pay great  attention to the pricing issue, control the prices  realistically, and strengthen management.    Wang Qun stressed: We should resolutely and continuously  grasp the anticorruption struggle because this is a major affair  which may help us win the trust from the masses. It is  necessary to estimate problems on corruption in a fact-seeking  manner. While recognizing the basic fact that the main aspect  of our party is good, most of the party members and cadres are  clean and honest in performing official duties, and the corrupt  elements inside the party only account for a small number, we  should also fully understand the seriousness and harmfulness of  the corrupt phenomenon inside the party, realistically regard  this struggle as a strategic task, and grasp it unswervingly  until good results are achieved.    Wang Qun pointed out: We should recognize that the current  temporary difficulties are problems which we have met on our  road of advance in the course of reform, and that they can be  solved. All of you should correctly approach these problems,  and distinguish between the major and minor aspects and the  essence. We should solve these problems with the ideology of  serving the people wholeheartedly and on our own initiative in  an effort to promote reform, development, and stability.    Wang Qun pointed out: We should give full play to the role  of  the people's congress standing committees in the course of the  four modernization drives. In accordance with the decision of  the chairmanship meeting of the regional people's congress  standing committee, we will organize deputies of the National  People's Congress in our region and some regional people's  congress deputies to inspect leagues and cities in the near  future. We will solve the practical problems concerning the  people's production and living in the course of implementing the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee.    Wang Qun called on leaders at all levels, all trades and  professions, and all sectors to act in line with the guidelines  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee  and of the Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fifth Regional  Party Committee, pay attention to the situation and unity, boost  enthusiasm, overcome difficulties, accelerate reform, and  develop the economy.    Wang Qun called on the people's congress standing committees  to act in line with the objective of building the socialist  market economic structure, coordinately carry out our  legislative policies and reform policies, accelerate the pace of  legislation, enhance the legislative and law enforcement level,  and promote the establishment of the socialist market economic  structure. It is necessary to conscientiously and repeatedly  study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, arm our minds and guide our work with the theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, emancipate  the mind, and seek truth from facts. We should also give less  empty talks, do more practical work, actively support and  supervise the "government, the higher people's court and the  people's procuratorate" to successfully carry out their work,  give full play to the role of the people's congress standing  committees as the organs of state power in the localities, and  enable the people congress system to play a greater role in the  course of building the two civilizations.</p>

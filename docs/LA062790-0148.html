			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AT&amp;T SEES LOWER 2ND-QUARTER INCOME;  </P> <P> SALE OF PRODUCTS FALLS SHORT; DEMAND FOR UNIVERSAL CARD SOARS  </P> <P> AT&amp;T today said its profit in the second quarter probably will be lower  than last year's in part because sales of various products have fallen short of  expectations.  </P> <P> The softness will make it more difficult for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph  Co. to meet its long-term objective of achieving 10% to 12% growth in annual  earnings, the company said in a news release.  </P> <P> But AT&amp;T said it stands by its earlier projection that net income for all  of 1990 will rise to a record level. This year's profit is expected to surpass  the 1989 earnings of $2.7 billion, or $2.50 a share.  </P> <P> The company blamed market conditions and a sluggish economy for weakening its  product sales in the quarter that ends Saturday.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T spokesman Dick Gray said results from April and May indicate sales to  small and large U.S. businesses of telephone equipment, including such things  as electronic switchboards, have been unexpectedly low.  </P> <P> Sales of network telecommunications products, such as switching equipment,  cable and transmissions systems, also have been below anticipated levels, Gray  said. There has been some weakness in sales to the federal government, he  added.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, heavy demand for AT&amp;T's Universal Card has caused expenses to  rise in the second quarter, the company said. AT&amp;T called the demand for  the new credit card, introduced in March, unprecedented and twice the level  expected.  </P></p>

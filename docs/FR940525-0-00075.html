App. 2170)(``DPA''). Section 709 of the DPA (50 U.S.C. App. 2159) provides that the regulations issued under it are not subject to the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Notwithstanding this exemption, section 709 of the DPA was amended by section 136 of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;558) to require any regulation issued under the DPA to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for at least thirty days to provide for public comment. This requirement subjects this final rule to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The impact of this final rule on small entities is expected to be insignificant. This final regulation imposes additional informational requirements on entities controlled by foreign governments. Most businesses affected by this rule will likely be large businesses, because these are the most likely to be controlled by a foreign government. Accordingly, it is certified that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 837(a) of the Defense Authorization Act creates for the first time a mandatory investigation provision under Exon-Florio. There are three points worth noting about this provision. First, this provision is limited in application to certain types of acquisitions. Specifically, the acquirer in question must be a foreign government controlled entity, or an entity acting on behalf of a foreign government. Furthermore, the acquisition must be one which ``could result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect the national security of the United States'' (emphasis added). Thus, even where the other specified criteria are met, this provision does not mandate an investigation for cases that could not ``affect the national security of the United States.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, for purposes of determining whether the acquisition results in foreign government control, CFIUS is applying the same functional test for control as provided in section 800.204.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, in contrast to the criterion for Presidential action under Exon-Florio,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that the foreign party acquiring control might take action that ``threatens to impair the national security,'' the criterion for undertaking an investigation of transactions involving government controlled entities is that there could be an effect on the national security.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``foreign government'' has been broadly defined for purposes of these regulations to include any government or body exercising governmental functions, and includes but is not limited to national as well as various regional and local levels of government. It is important to note that the definition is not limited to the particular levels of government that are specified in the regulation, and that other governmental bodies, including supra-national entities such as the European Union (including its component parts), are covered by this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the mandatory investigation provision, the regulations define the term ``engage in'' as used in the phrase ``seeks to engage in any merger, acquisition or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takeover *&blank;*&blank;*'' to mean ``seeks to acquire control through.'' The purpose of this regulation is to clarify that the mandatory investigation provision would not be triggered in cases where a foreign government controlled entity's participation in an acquisition is solely for the purpose of investment, as defined in section 800.217 of the regulations. The Committee believes that this reading is supported by the legislative history, and particularly floor statements made by members of Congress who sponsored this particular amendment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cong. Rec., Sept. 18, 1992, pages S 14050 through 14053 (comments of Senators Exon, Sarbanes and Riegle); and Cong. Rec. Oct. 3, 1992, page H 10986 (comments of Representative Collins). Subparagraph 800.402(c)(5)(iii) has been changed in the final regulations by the addition of the words ``for example'' to clarify that an agency or representative role are examples of ways in which a foreign person can act on behalf of a foreign government, but are not the only ways in which such a relationship could be conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

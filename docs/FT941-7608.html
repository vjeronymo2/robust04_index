			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / M-way tolls to be levied from 1998 More than 375 companies have responded to a call from the government for proposals to develop an electronic tolling system for Britain's motorways. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday announced the timetable for applications from companies to take part in trials. The government intends that charging of tolls will start in 1998. Ninety per cent of companies that had expressed an interest were British, Mr MacGregor said. ICL, the Japanese-owned computer company, said it was interested in taking part. The cost of installing electronic equipment at the 700 motorway junctions could exceed Pounds 100m, Mr MacGregor said. The trials would cost several million pounds. Many other countries are working on electronic tolls but none of them yet has a system which could cope with the volumes of traffic on Britain's motorways or with the features which the government wants to include. The tolling system would have to work on motorways carrying up to 12,000 vehicles an hour at speeds of up to 70 mph without slowing traffic flow. It would have to allow charges to be varied according to time of day and vehicle type. The government intends to install a fully electronic system with no facility for motorists to pay cash. But it would have to take account of foreign visitors and people making unplanned emergency trips. One possibility is for a system of smart cards on vehicle windscreens which would be 'read' by monitors on overhead gantries. Toll booths common on Continental and US motorways have been rejected because they require too much space and slow traffic. The system chosen must be fraud-proof and allow the authorities to trace motorists who travel without paying. However, the system must allow motorists the option of choosing that their routes should not be traceable, although there might be an extra charge for this. France, Germany and Austria are soon to start limited tests of electronic tolling. The British government is keen to introduce a system compatible with other European Union members and holds regular discussions with French and German officials. The government has previously calculated that, if tolls were set at 1.5p a mile for cars and 4.5p for trucks, tolling the 1,900 mile motorway network would raise Pounds 700m a year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Signpost to motorway charging  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Letter of invitation                                     February 1994 Closing date for application to participate and return of questionnaire                                       May 1994 Closing date for system proposals                       September 1994 Selection of systems                                      January 1995 Track and on-road trials start                              March 1995 Final assessment of trials                               November 1995 Final system specification                                January 1996 Implementation starts                                             1998  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Transport  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

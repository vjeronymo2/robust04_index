Its statement was read out in parliament by Deputy Speaker  Vakhtang Rcheushvili in Tbilisi late on Tuesday.    It speaks of a disastrous situation in the Abkhkazian region  of Gal in which five other Georgian villages were razed to the  ground following the return of Georgian refugees from western  Georgia. In the last few days, as many as 60 people were shot  dead and dozens of others taken hostage in that region. Over  800 houses were destroyed.    The official said some 3,000 Georgians had been forced to  flee for shelter to nearby woods and that Tbilisi was now trying  to find a way of helping them.    Ten other busloads of militants from the Northern Caucasus  arrived in Abkhazia on Monday and Tuesday, the Deputy Speaker  said referring to anonymous sources.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Arts: Bournonville Festival II Royal Danish Ballet has just ended a week's festival dedicated to its founding father, August Bournonville. The occasion was of the happiest. The Royal Danes had guarded a Bournonville heritage for nearly a century before, in 1951, they invited a handful of English critics to visit Copenhagen to sample some precious survivals of the poetic and vividly dramatic ballets that Bournonville had created between 1830 and 1877. Two years later, emboldened by critical delight, the company played a season at Covent Garden, and the London public yielded eagerly to the Danes' joyous dancing, their mellifluous and whole-hearted acting, and Bournonville's choreographic masterpieces which shaped and enshrined these virtues. Thus launched upon the international scene, the Danish ballet - and Bournonville - conquered the world. The company and its old repertory were everywhere in demand, everywhere admired. Yet the troupe faced an evident need to reconcile its historic identity with a desire to catch up with a more international style of classic dancing, after its years of Bournonvillian quietude. The task was complicated by the world's insistence that the Royal Danish Ballet meant Bournonville (which indeed it did) somewhat to the exclusion of any later creativity. That Bournonville prepared the Danes for most dance challenges seems to have escaped the generality of the public, and the fact remains that the Danes - admirable in many balletic styles - must needs still concentrate upon Bournonville to win a world public. And rightly so, when they present the extant repertory of six long works and some shorter pieces with the enthusiasm and undimmed freshness that they have just shown. In 1979 the Royal Danes staged a first Bournonville Festival in which all the old repertory was displayed. The Festival was a huge success. The second Bournonville Festival has been no less rewarding. Significantly, it brought a new staging of Napoli to mark the 150th anniversary of the ballet's first performance on March 29, which told much about the Danes' continuing concern with Bournonville's emotional and theatrical values, and the truest way of showing his work for future generations. One of the great strengths of the Royal Danish Ballet is its use of dancers of all ages in the theatre. The children of the school are vitally part of the crowd in Napoli's first act, and they watch the final scene from the bridge that traditionally spans the stage. In a few years some will be on stage in the solos that explode with fizzing vitality in the closing celebrations. As muscles tire, the great soloists renew their skills in the mime roles that give such richness and depth to the dramatic fabric of the piece. An artist like Kjeld Noack, marking 60 years on the stage this year, has made this progress, and still delights us with masterly mime playing. Sorella Englund, celebrating her silver jubilee on stage in La Sylphide, was an obsessed and terrifying Madge, who had latterly been a delicately touching sylph. The new Napoli - well designed by Soren Frandsen - has received imaginative refurbishment. Napoli's flaw has long been its second act. Now it has been carefully re-thought (all the Bournonville steps have been lost for years) and is less of a bore than heretofore, though I thought the costuming for the tritons somewhat inapt with bare chests, Newgate frill beards, and what looked like varicose veins, as indications of their watery nature. Everything else about the staging was radiant, from the bustle of quay-side life to the feu de joie of the finale's dances. In its central roles I saw superb performances from Lis Jeppeson and Nikolaj Hubbe. Miss Jeppeson is the ideal Bournonville heroine: by turns grave or child-like in her innocence, then sparkling in dance, or as the wicked Birthe in A Folk Tale, a demon of malign energy, she has an exquisite sensibility about the dramatic and technical nuance of her roles. Her dancing is ever-fresh. Mr Hubbe, the hero of this festival, is ardent in drama as in dance. His Gennaro in Napoli is all passion, raging with grief when he thinks his love is drowned, then cutting with a flashing physical edge through his dances. His James in La Sylphide was romantic fever personified; his Dancing Master in Le Conservatoire a grand statement about Bournonvillian bravura and elegance. Two other men offered typically Danish dance power and clarity. Johan Kobborg, a young soloist, exemplified those Copenhagen virtues of brilliancy in step and buoyancy in jumps. His account of the Flower Festival duet on the opening night of the Festival was the best possible introduction to joys to come. Lloyd Riggins, American-born, joined the company five years ago at the age of 17. His debut as Gennaro at Napoli's 150th anniversary performance was youthfully ebullient, and he was paired with the no less delightful Heidi Ryom as Teresina. In the vaudeville mime of Far from Denmark he was a sincere Vilhelm, and in the 'reconstructed' (that is, revived from notations and written sources) staging of Abdallah, his verve and dashing technique helped one believe in this curiously hollow example of Bournonville pietism. The Bournonville repertory and the Royal Danish Ballet, as they were shown to crowded and ecstatic houses during the festival are in fine fettle. Bournonville's past and present mingle like the generations of performers on the stage.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lourenco Jossias and Orlando Muchanga: "The </F> General's Lax Response"]    [Text] (Maputo) The duel between Afonso Dhlakama,  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, and Mozambican  Army General Domingos Fondo, promises new developments in the  wake of the news conference granted by Gen. Fondo yesterday. In  reply to Afonso Dhlakama's accusation that the general is linked  to deals involving arms smuggling to South Africa, Gen. Fondo  said -- without too much conviction -- that he denied Dhlakama's  charges and that the Renamo leader should present his complaints  to the right authorities.    In appearance at least, Gen. Domingos Fondo was very much at  ease during his meeting with the press. The allegation that he  was involved in smuggling weapons to neighboring South Africa  fell like a bomb in this country and in southern Africa, but his  answer was that he was not disturbed by it. He failed to  categorically deny the Renamo leader's accusation, thereby doing  little more than raising more doubts.    "I do not understand whether he (Dhlakama) is accusing me as  a citizen, a general, a public servant in the National Defense  Ministry, a Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, official, or  as a member of Parliament", he said, adding, by way of  clarification, that our country has "an institution that deals  with matters such as this one" and that, should Dhlakama "be in  possession of concrete evidence, he should bring the matter  before the court."    It was quite clear that the general was talking with some  anxiety. He was repeatedly asked whether he accepted the Renamo  leader's accusation, to which he replied that "I deny it as an  individual, but I say that he must take the case before the  competent authorities" instead of "making such claims in public."    After much rhetoric, the general was invited to comment on  what he would do about Dhlakama's remarks now, seeing that his  "good name" may well be tarnished. "Nothing", the general  replied, causing some surprise among the reporters who had  flocked to his modest office.    We asked him whether he did not feel offended or aggrieved,  to which he answered: No, "I do not feel offended yet", adding  rather tersely that if the Renamo leader does not take his  complaint to court "then he is a liar."    Gen. Domingos Fondo's name regularly crops up in  international media reports as being linked to arms and drugs  smugglers. He was asked to comment on this matter, but he  refused to do it, saying: "No one has ever talked to me about  arms smuggling. This is the first time I hear anything about  it." Gen. Fondo added that no Mozambican State organ has  approached him in connection with that matter yet. "Neither the  Attorney General's Office, nor the Interior Ministry, nor  anybody else", he stressed.    Gen. Fondo surprised the reporters with the contempt he  showed for Dhlakama's accusations, saying "I am not afraid of  anything, I am at peace with myself, and I am not worried. I am  free and that is why I go where I please."    At one point in the course of the news conference, Gen.  Fondo  was asked whether he would be willing some day to serve in the  Mozambique Armed Forces under Afonso Dhlakama's command. His  reply was typical: "As long as I am an active serviceman, I  shall obey whoever wins, whether that be Dhlakama, Arouca, or  anybody else. I shall obey as long as I am in active service."  To the general surprise of his audience, Gen. Fondo added,  pointing out one of the journalists: "Even if it is you..."    We asked him whether, as a businessman, he had business  interests in South Africa, to which he replied that "if you have  come to talk to me as a businessman, then I must take off my  uniform and talk as a businessman."    Major General Domingos Fondo heads the forces responsible  for  the protection of projects. During the war, those forces were  involved in the defense of economic targets. Gen. Fondo  explained that his forces are being disbanded because they are  irregular and must be scrapped in terms of the Rome Accord,  adding that "almost half of the soldiers have already been  demobilized and their weapons are being collected by the UN  Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, and taken to the general  storehouse."    In any event, there are complaints that many weapons have  been disappearing from that army unit. Answering the question,  Maj. Gen. Fondo said that "there are institutions responsible  for controlling the weapons. There has been widespread  disappearance of weapons from the National Defense Ministry  [words indistinct] a meeting. Gen. Fondo said that the problem  of alleged arms trafficking to South Africa had not been raised  during his meeting with Army General Alberto Chipande. "We  always talk about work when we meet", Gen. Fondo explained.    During the news conference, Domingos Fondo distributed  calling cards which carried the name of `Spanos da Beira'  company and he said, by way of explanation: "That is my company."    Yesterday, MEDIAFAX learned from an official in the Criminal  Investigation Police, PIC, Arms Smuggling Investigation Branch  that Gen. Fondo's name had never featured on any list of  suspects.    "Our leads have never mentioned his name. We have never  received any complaint concerning the general. We know nothing  about it in this branch, but perhaps other institutions know  something", that source said. When we asked whether there might  be other important Mozambican Army names on the list, our source  said no, admitting only that he knew about "persons who have  been arrested at the border while in possession of a weapon or  two, which they intended to use for armed robberies in South  Africa", he noted.    Our source went so far as to question the correctness of the  words, arms trafficking to South Africa. Faced with our own  doubts, he wound up the conversation by saying that he could  only answer other questions upon permission by senior Interior  Ministry officials.    We were not any more successful at the local Interpol  [International Police] directorate. Other Interpol sources whom  we tried discreetly to contact assured us that they had never  received anything concerning that matter and that Gen. Domingos  Fondo's name had never been discussed by Interpol agents.    Despite our insistent efforts, we were not able to get in  touch with any senior officials in the Interior Ministry or the  Attorney General's Office by the time this edition went to print.</p>

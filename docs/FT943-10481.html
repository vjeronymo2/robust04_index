			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries rally after late buying spree US Treasury bonds regained their stride yesterday afternoon after data on July car sales proved to be weaker than expected. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 higher at 86 1/2 , with the yield slipping to 7.379 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 5/16 , to yield 5.939 per cent. The softer tone in early trading gave way to an afternoon burst of buying on news that sales of US-made cars had slowed for the fourth consecutive month. Prices across the board slipped in the morning after the Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators was up 0.2 per cent from the previous month, against forecasts centred on a 0.1 per cent gain. Later, the government announced that new orders for factory goods in June had risen 0.8 per cent, in line with expectations. By holding its losses to modest levels, the market signalled its inclination to pause ahead of Friday's more crucial employment data. Traders were also taking a breather ahead of the details of the Treasury's quarterly refunding operation. When the afternoon announcement brought no surprises, bonds moved higher. As expected, the Treasury next week will offer Dollars 17bn in three-year notes, Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes and Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds. Italian bonds put on one of the strongest performances as political tensions appeared to subside after members of the coalition government indicated on Tuesday that they did not want a government crisis. In largely futures-led trading, the September BTP future on Liffe rose 0.70 point to 103.25. However, the issue over the division of the prime minister's business and political interests remains unresolved and could drag on, weighing on markets in weeks to come. Moreover, observers fear the government may run into problems when it seeks to implement some of its planned budget cuts later this year. 'We still have the possibility of negative news in September,' said Mr Marco Pianelli, southern Europe economist at Nomura Research Institute in London. 'Cuts in the pensions and health sector will be a true test of the government's credibility in stabilising Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio.' Spanish bonds lagged Italy in spite of the Bank of Spain's unexpected cut in its key money rate by 15 basis points to 7.35 per cent. However, the move triggered little follow-through buying, partly because the Spanish market has outperformed other high-yielding markets in recent weeks, benefiting from financial and political woes in other countries such as Sweden and Italy. The Spanish September bond future rose 0.18 point to 92.13. Long-dated UK government bonds ended a volatile day little changed, outperformed by the shorter maturities. The short end of the yield curve had sold off sharply in recent sessions on fears of near-term base-rate increases, but increasing confidence that the Bank of England is not about to lift rates supported the shorter maturities yesterday. The September long gilt future on Liffe ended at 103 3/16 , unchanged on the day. German bonds had another range-bound day dominated largely by futures as investors kept a low profile. The September bund futures contract closed at 94.01, down 0.05 point on the day.</p>

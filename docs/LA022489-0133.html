			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CALCAVECCHIA IS OFF AND RUNNING WITH A 65, LEADS BY 2  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia, the dominant figure in golf this season, shot a  seven-under-par 65 Thursday and took a two-stroke lead in the first round of  the $1.3-million Doral Open tournament at Miami.  </P> <P> "I didn't make a bogey, so that makes it a good day. A lot of good shots, a lot  of good putts, a lot of good everything," said Calcavecchia, who has won two of  six events this year and missed a playoff for another title by a single stroke.  </P> <P> Some of the game's leading lights found the chilly, gusty winds less than easy,  however.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, playing with Calcavecchia, struggled to a 78.  </P> <P> But he wasn't alone. None of the current holders of the Big Four titles could  break par 72 on the famed Blue Monster course at the Doral Country Club.  </P> <P> PGA champion Jeff Sluman shot a 75; U.S. Open titleholder Curtis Strange had a  73; Masters champion Sandy Lyle of Scotland took a 74, and British Open champ  Seve Ballesteros of Spain had a 73 in his first American start of the year.  </P> <P> A trio of Texas buddies -- Ben Crenshaw, Bruce Lietzke and Tom Kite -- were  Calcavecchia's closest pursuers. Playing in a threesome, Crenshaw had a 67,  Lietzke a 68 and Kite a 69. Wayne Levi was tied with Lietzke at 68.  </P> <P> The Women's Kemper Open, already shortened to 54 holes by heavy rains at  Princeville, Hawaii, could extend into next week if the rain continues,  tournament officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Rain has deluged the course at the Mirage Princeville Resort since Saturday,  but tournament director Kerry Haigh said the regular tournament was still  scheduled to begin today.  </P> <P> However, the forecast called for rain through the weekend.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA determined that a discount was appropriate for the on-highway heavy duty ABT program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The rationale for the credit discount was two-fold. First, additional environmental benefits were desired from banking and trading over and above the benefits produced from the averaging program already in place when banking and trading were added. Credit discounting was determined to be an appropriate method of providing a tangible environmental benefit, so that both manufacturers and the public would share the benefits created by the addition of banking and trading. Second, EPA believed that the amount of the discount would not be a disincentive toward participation in the program. Although a credit discount may be appropriate for the on-highway heavy duty ABT program, where banking and trading were promulgated separately from averaging, EPA is not promulgating a credit discount for today's action. The level of environmental benefits, the level of the emission standard, and the banking and trading components of the ABT program were determined in conjunction with one another. Therefore, a credit discount for today's action is not necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 55 FR 30584, 30592&hyph;30593 (July 26, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that if EPA was not requiring discounting, the Agency should require the use of LIFO as a means to minimize the value of early banking and of banking in general. Under a FIFO accounting system, older banked credits must be used in the current year's average before credits generated in the current year. This potentially allows manufacturers to bank all the current year's credits, which will have a three year potential credit life, if manufacturers are able to use previously-banked credits or purchased credits to offset those engines with FELs above the standard. This encourages manufacturers to achieve more emissions reductions earlier, which may be beneficial for the environment. Mandating a LIFO accounting system may discourage early emission reductions and was not proposed by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Allowing Early Banking of Emission Credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters supported EPA's proposal to allow manufacturers to bank credits one year in advance of the implementation date in order to provide incentives to introduce clean technology a year early. One commenter suggested allowing early banking starting in 1995 regardless of the phase-in implementation date. One commenter believed that early banking should be excluded in order to prevent the generation of windfall credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that incentives should be provided for manufacturers to make early use of clean technology. This consideration outweighs the Agency's concerns regarding the minimal number of credits that may be generated a year in advance by the small percentage of engines which already meet the upcoming standard. EPA presented an analysis in the NPRM demonstrating that credits from this small percentage of engines did not represent significant windfall credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA supports early banking incentives for the introduction of clean technology, EPA does not support allowing early banking starting in 1995 regardless of the phase-in implementation date. EPA proposed the phase-in implementation dates because many manufacturers had informed EPA that additional leadtime is necessary for particular sizes of engines. Although it would be beneficial to the environment to have clean engines introduced earlier, EPA is not allowing early banking beyond one year because the larger number of engine families and the extended years of early banking would increase the potential of windfall credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Early Banking Credit Generation Level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed to allow manufacturers to generate credits one model year prior to the implementation date of the standards. EPA proposed that engines banking early must have NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions below 9.2 g/kW-hr and could generate credits up to the 9.2 g/kW-hr according to &sect;89.207&hyph;96 and bank these credits for future use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter opposed the idea of early banking. However, several commenters disagreed on the credit generation level. Some commenters recommended that, to create an incentive for manufacturers to meet the standards early, they should be allowed to generate credits up to 11.9 g/kW-hr. Another commenter opposed the credit generation level of 11.9 g/kW-hr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that it is inappropriate to establish a credit generation level above 9.2 g/kW-hr due to the possibility of windfall credits. EPA did not receive data to indicate that emission credits granted to industry at the 11.9 g/kW-hr level would be, overall, less than or equal to the environmental benefits gained by the early banking program. Therefore, manufacturers participating in early banking may only generate credits up to 9.2 g/kW-hr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Liability and Noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned about the enforcement of the ABT program. One commenter wanted assurance that strict penalties were in place for exceeding FELs and other commenters wanted assurance that adequate compliance demonstration methodologies were in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has substantial experience in enforcement of vehicle and engine emissions from the on-highway ABT program. This experience will be carried forward to the nonroad program. EPA will ensure that manufacturers are held responsible for meeting the FELs that they set, that the FELs are carefully monitored by means of the SEA program, and that overall compliance is effectively monitored. Further, manufacturers will not be allowed to use credits to remedy FEL exceedances detected by EPA enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Disclosure of Credit Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the connection between credit information and confidential sales information, EPA regulations concerning the release of confidential business information have restricted the public's opportunity to review manufacturers' submission of credit generation and usage. EPA is currently discussing with the participating manufacturers in the on-highway ABT program the possibility of implementing a means of allowing the public to access enough information to make general assessments about the effectiveness of the ABT program on a regular basis. The Engine Manufacturers Association concurs that it is important to provide an ongoing opportunity for the public to evaluate the overall progress of the program. EPA and EMA expect to finalize an agreement in the near future on the periodic release of credit data in a format that would be useful to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> T. Nonroad Equipment Definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is finalizing the following definition for the term nonroad equipment: ``Nonroad equipment means equipment that is powered by nonroad engines.'' This definition follows Congress' format for defining ``nonroad vehicles.'' EPA believes this definition will clarify use of the term nonroad equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

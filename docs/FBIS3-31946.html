This will be  the first....    [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct].    [De Leon] Political stability and calm that will allow us to  govern and to face important social and economic problems  through a government plan we have drafted.    [Reporter] Mr. President, do you have any preliminary report  from the interior?    [De Leon] Of course. Fortunately everything is going  normally, calmly. We do not know how many people are voting,  but the truth is that despite all the terrorist problems,  obstacles, pressure, and efforts to boycott the event, the  referendum is taking place. The fact that the event is taking  place strengthens the democratic system, because this is an  example to the world. While in other countries domestic  problems are resolved antidemocratically, through violence, here  in Guatemala we are resolving this national political problem  democratically, the most sacred way the people have as the  expression of their sovereignty: through votes.</p>

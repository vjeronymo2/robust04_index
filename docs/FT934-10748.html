			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / US offers defence assistance to Japan: Concern over North Korean weapons THE US has offered to help Japan to defend itself against a possible North Korean nuclear attack. Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said after a meeting with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, that he had offered Japan at least three options for obtaining a missile defence system. They included buying one of the US's own theatre missile defence programmes currently under development, exchanging technology or launching a new joint development project. 'If they think of another alternative, of a way that they would like to participate, we'd be willing to listen to that too,' said Mr Aspin. US intelligence indicated that North Korea did have a nuclear weapons programme, but the evidence on exactly how close it was to producing nuclear weapons was 'mixed,' he said. The offer of co-operation is not new. The US and Japan already lead international efforts to persuade Communist North Korea to accept inspection of two suspected nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, Mr Aspin's latest gesture has fresh relevance in Japan, where public anxiety over North Korea's military ambitions has reached new heights. The latest source of alarm came last May, when North Korea test-fired into the Sea of Japan a long-range missile that could have reached Tokyo.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> FAMILY PLANNING FUNDS BACK ON HOLD  </P> <P> Restoration of $24 million in state funds for family-planning clinics for the  poor has been blocked again, this time by the California Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The justices issued a stay, halting further proceedings, while they consider a  challenge by the Deukmejian Administration to a lower-court ruling that would  require release of the disputed money. The high court set no timetable for  action in the case. The battle over funding began last summer when Gov. George  Deukmejian, exercising his line-item veto powers, trimmed two-thirds of a  $36-million appropriation for the clinics in the state budget.  </P></p>

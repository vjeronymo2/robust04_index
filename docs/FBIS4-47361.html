Gal; UDC 629.129.2] </F>   [Abstract] A new principle has been proposed for raising  sunken objects by means of precisely manufactured hollow ceramic  or glass spherical elements that have relatively large diameters  and that are formed into modules with a lifting force ranging  from 1 to 10 tonnes or more. The new method and flotation  devices, which were developed at the Nikolayevsk Shipbuilding  Institute, offer the following advantages: reliability and  simplicity of distributing the lifting forces required along the  hull of a sunken object lying at great depths thanks to the use  of individual modules capable of withstanding significant  pressures and conventional cables to attach the lifting modules  to the sunken object; simplicity of regulating forces and  executing the operations of eliminating list and trim by varying  the number of lifting modules and by rational distribution of  the sites at which they are attached to the sunken object; high  degree of mechanization of the operations entailed in the  lifting process; and achievement of the required lifting speed  thanks to a combined lifting technique where most of the lifting  forces are created by underwater modules and the rest are  created by hoisting mechanisms tied to the sunken object by  cable; improvement of the technological level of lifting thanks  to a reduction in the size and numbers of ropes in the winding  tackle systems used as additional lifting equipment; reduction  of the installed capacity of the lowering and raising equipment  thanks to the fact that the lifting modules are attached to the  sunken object one after the other rather than simultaneously;  and no stringent requirements regarding positioning the vessels  involved in lifting the sunken object. The new lifting modules  filled with spherical ceramic fillers with an aggregate density  of 359 kg/m[.sup]3[/] have been manufactured and tested. The  first has a lifting force of 10 kN, weighs 573 kg, and has a  volume of 1.60 m[.sup]3[/] and overall dimensions of 1.13 x  1.25 x 1.13 m. The second has a lifting force of 50 kN, weighs  2,861 kg, and has a volume of 7.97 m[.sup]3[/] and overall  dimensions of 1.93 x 2.14 x 1.93 m, and the third has a lifting  force of 100 kN, weighs 5,702 kg, and has a volume of 15.88  m[.sup]3[/] and overall dimensions of 2.93 x 2.69 x 2.93 m.

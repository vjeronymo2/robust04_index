			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Leslie Wise little changed at Pounds 1.24m Leslie Wise Group, the clothing manufacturer and distributor, reported static profits of Pounds 1.24m pre-tax for the six months to May 31, against Pounds 1.23m. The figure was struck after a Pounds 93,000 redundancy and trading loss at the garment manufacturing subsidiary and a Pounds 50,000 loss incurred in developing the new import division. Turnover for the Leicester-based company rose 18 per cent from Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 26.8m mainly because of the increase by the specialist design companies. Earnings per share were unchanged at 2.38p and the interim dividend is held at 1.75p. Mr Neil Wise, chairman, said the second half had started well with turnover in June and July 'significantly ahead' of last year. He added that the traditional trading pattern was moving towards a stronger second half.</p>

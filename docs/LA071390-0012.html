			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> KENYA;  </P> <P> MANDELA RECOVERS FROM PNEUMONIA  </P> <P> South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela has recovered sufficiently  from a bout of mild pneumonia to address a rally in Nairobi, Kenya, an aide  said. Mandela, 71, initially caught a cold as he neared the end of a grueling  tour of three continents, and it grew worse in the chill of Addis Ababa,  Ethiopia, 8,000 feet above sea level, where he attended a meeting of the  Organization of African Unity this week. The deputy president of the African  National Congress is to leave Kenya for Mozambique on Saturday for a two-day  visit.  </P></p>

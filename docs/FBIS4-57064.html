			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Geovani Esposito from Maracaibo] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Caldera has acknowledged that  Venezuela's economy is in serious disarray. Nevertheless, he was  also optimistic enough to say that his administration is doing  its utmost to overcome the situation.    Following constant subsidies totalling nearly 120 billion  bolivares authorized since this past January, Fogade [Deposit  Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] is now the owner of  approximately 72 percent of Banco de Maracaibo shares.    Fogade President Norys Aguirre announced the names of the  new  Banco de Maracaibo Board of Directors, which will be headed by  Jorge Correa. The new board of directors will be responsible for  executing and implementing the reorganization plan that  includes, among others, the following measures: streamlining  spending, restoring Bank of Maracaibo's losses with Fogade  financial assets, increasing the bank's capital to more or less  6 percent of assets, reorganizing operations by injecting  resources, implementing auditing practices, and requesting  technical assistance from international experts specializing in  the subject.    The Fogade president also indicated that by intervening in  the Occidente Mortgage Bank, the Banking Superintendency was  able to stabilize the bank's situation as part of Latino Group.    Aguirre pointed out that she supports the reorganization  plan  about to be implemented by intervention board President Enrique  Faria de Lima. He has set 17 May as the date for offering  guarantees to depositors.    According to the Fogade president, all of these traumas  which  the Venezuelan financial system is enduring represent one of its  worst crises. Nevetheless, she believes that one should not fall  victim to the mistake twice.    [Begin Aguirre recording, in progress]...an improved  supervisory organization. A renovated oversight organization  that will not allow situations to develop to a level such as  that at which we have arrived today in Venezuela. [end  recording]</p>

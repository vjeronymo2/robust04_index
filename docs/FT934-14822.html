			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Belfox in moves to widen its appeal BELFOX, the Belgian futures and options exchange, is preparing for wide-ranging changes which it hopes will broaden the market's appeal. Formal adoption of the new regulations is expected next month, according to the exchange, which was launched two years ago. 'The aim is to be as attractive as possible and have more participants on our market,' said Mr Willi Van Stappen, a Belfox manager, yesterday. Belfox was hampered in its first year of trading by lack of size and by persistent technical problems. However, it is now gradually introducing new products, including an option on the Bel-20 index of leading Belgian shares, and more options on individual stocks. Its latest annual report said that Belfox aimed to become 'a fully-fledged derivatives market' by the end of the year. The changes should help bring Belfox into line with other European derivatives markets. At the moment, for example, only Belgian and Luxembourg brokers and credit institutions are eligible to be brokers or market-makers on Belfox. Following adoption of the new rules, foreign banks and brokers will be able to participate in the market, without having to become clearing members of Belfox. The new regulations will also widen the definition of futures and options to allow new products - for example, commodities futures - to be traded. The system of fixed commission levels will be dropped, allowing clients, members and intermediaries to negotiate fees. Trading has picked up since last year, when a 'gentlemen's agreement' between 15 institutions had to be put in place to encourage trade in Belgian government bond futures. That agreement ended earlier this year, but trade in the bond futures has been helped by the continued turmoil in European currency markets.</p>

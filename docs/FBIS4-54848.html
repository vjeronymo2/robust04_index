			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Allegedly Mendacious Defamations"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--Referring to the Slovak press, the  Austrian APA agency yesterday reported that Anna Nagyova, former  director of the Slovak prime minister's secretariat, was  expecting a baby by former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. In  addition to this information, the APA report also contains  several invectives regarding their "supposedly not merely  official business relations" and marital problems in both  families. A statement made available to TA SR yesterday by  Ondrej Hanko, spokesman for the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS], notes in this context that, "by its vulgar,  unsubstantiated, and mendacious contents, the APA report defames  HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar and Anna Nagyova, head of his  secretariat." In the name of the HZDS, Hanko openly asked  Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky,  and Parliament Chairman Heinz Fischer how they assess the fact  that, "before the early elections, Austrian media are  interfering grossly and in the dirtiest possible way in the  election campaign by their unfounded scandalization of a leading  politician, the chairman of the largest political entity in  neighboring Slovakia." He asks whether this does not constitute  interference in the internal affairs of a neighboring country  and in the hitherto exemplary friendly relations, which have  been successfully developed by Meciar personally. HZDS  representatives also sent a similar statement to leading  Austrian dailies.</p>

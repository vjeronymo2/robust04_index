			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hakon Letvik: "Norwegian Protest to France and </F> the EU"]    [Text] Yesterday there were close contacts between the  Foreign Ministry and the Fisheries Ministry to discuss how the  Norwegian authorities can best protest against the wide-ranging  bureaucracy and the minimum prices that are now being used to  obstruct imports of Norwegian fish into France.    "Our embassy in Paris has been asked to contact the French  authorities at the Foreign Ministry and the Agriculture and  Fisheries Ministry. It will express regret at the tighter  border controls that are doing major damage to Norwegian fish  exports," Foreign Ministry press spokesman Ingvar Havnen said.    The French customs authorities are now demanding that  customs  documents and veterinary papers be in French, and veterinary  checks at the border have been tightened up with the result that  a number of tests are being carried out on Norwegian fish.  Analysis of these tests takes up to five days, and consequently  the French authorities have made sure this bureaucracy amounts  to an effective obstacle to the sale of fresh Norwegian fish at  an acceptable price.    Norwegian fish exporters will now try to clear their fish  through Danish or German customs so as to avoid France's  bureaucratic customs authorities.    The Foreign Ministry expects that Norwegian fish exporters  will keep themselves well informed about the situation in France  through their business contacts and their own employees involved  in transport. "We do not therefore want to give any general  advice about what they should do," Havnen said.    Despite the fact that Norwegian fish trucks were emptied of  10 metric tons of fish under the eyes of the French police, the  ministry does not have the impression that the police are  neglecting to do what is possible to protect Norwegian fish  trucks.</p>

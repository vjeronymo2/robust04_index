			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / In a squeeze over tax: The impact of a transatlantic dispute Foreign governments, businesses and tax lawyers are waiting anxiously for a decision from the US Supreme Court that could have far-reaching consequences for the way in which multinational companies are taxed. It could possibly trigger a transatlantic tax war. The court is expected to announce on Monday whether it will hear the case of Barclays Bank International versus the Franchise Tax Board of California, an appeal against the state's system for assessing tax on companies that do business within its borders. Yesterday, however, the UK raised the stakes with the pre-emptive announcement of retaliation if the issue is not resolved by the end of this year. The proposed action, announced yesterday in the Commons by the chancellor, would eliminate the partial refund of corporation tax that US companies now receive from the Inland Revenue on dividends paid by UK subsidiaries to the US parent. This would, in effect, increase their tax rate from 28 to 33 per cent and could cost US businesses, such as banks, oil companies and chemicals concerns, an estimated Pounds 250m a year. Barclays' 10-year suit involves both a great deal of money  - as much as Dollars 4bn for the virtually bankrupt state of California  - and a substantial point of principle: a potential challenge to the web of bilateral agreements which allows companies to conduct their business in different countries without suffering beggar-thy-neighbour taxation on each side of the border. One foundation of most of these agreements is the arm's length principle. In determining how much of a multinational company's profits should be assessed in each country, tax inspectors require the group to record the prices at which goods and services are transferred between subsidiaries in different countries as though they were being sold to independent customers. These transfer pricing calculations are easy enough for basic commodities such as oil, or even for more complex components for which a market price can be established. They can be much harder in other cases, such as for the calculation of royalties on a unique soft contact lens technology, to cite a case the US Internal Revenue Service lost to the Bausch and Lomb optical group. Many US politicians and tax collectors believe there are wholesale abuses of the system by foreign companies which manipulate their transfer prices to shift taxable income out of the US and overseas, either to their home country or to some fiscal haven with a lower corporate tax rate. As a result, some US tax authorities favour a simpler formula for estimating how much of a group's profit should be taxed in each state or country. They take the company's overall profits and divide them by the percentage of its payroll, sales and property in their state. The problem arises when California seeks to apply this approach not just to the profits of a single company legally incorporated in the state, but also to the profits of other companies in the same group which the state views as a single business unit. California occasionally used this unitary taxation method between the 1920s and the 1970s. It provoked no complaints. From 1970 onwards, however, the state began to apply the unitary method 'whenever related entities exhibited a unitary business relationship', according to Mr Benjamin Miller of the Franchise Tax Board, extending it to the worldwide operations of multinationals. The Supreme Court has seen no intrinsic problem in unitary taxation, validating the method in its 1983 decision in a case brought by Container Corporation against the Franchise Tax Board. But it has expressly reserved judgment on its application to foreign-based businesses, where the method faces a very specific challenge: Barclays argues that California's approach is illegal because it interferes with the federal government's sole right under the US constitution to regulate foreign commerce. Past US administrations have agreed, filing briefs with the Supreme Court in support of Barclays. The Clinton administration, however, has reversed this position and filed no brief on Barclays' latest bid to have the case heard. The White House's principal concern appears to have been the perilous condition of California's finances. The state last year had to pay its workers in IOUs after failing to agree a budget. This year, with the region still in recession, it faces another Dollars 8.6bn shortfall, which must be met by higher taxes or lower spending. The Barclays case alone could cost California about Dollars 520m in tax and interest to the British bank and to other companies in a similar position, and Dollars 350m of taxes assessed but not yet collected. Potentially far more serious is a closely related case brought by Colgate-Palmolive, the US household and hygiene group, challenging the inclusion of foreign subsidiaries in a unitary assessment. This involves about Dollars 1.2bn in possible refunds and the loss of some Dollars 1.9bn which the state still hopes to collect. Ironically, most of the facets of unitary taxation that foreign companies and governments find objectionable have been eliminated, following pressure from the Reagan administration in the 1980s. Since 1988, companies operating in California can now elect to be taxed on a 'water's edge' basis, which includes only their activities within the US in the unitary assessment. However, they still complain about the cost of preparing different accounts for California and about the fee they have to pay for the 'water's edge' choice, which brings the state Dollars 30m a year. Other states  - except Alaska, which applies unitary taxation to oil companies  - have abandoned the unitary method. The risk that some foreign governments see, however, is that they might rush to reintroduce the system if the Supreme Court rules against Barclays. 'We are worried about opening the door,' said Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC Commissioner for tax affairs, who was in Washington this week to lobby against the unitary taxation method. This concern may not be misplaced. Mr Miller of the California Franchise Tax Board says he would still like to return to worldwide unitary assessments, although he would settle for mandatory 'water's edge' reporting. Some tax experts even worry that the Clinton administration's decision not to back Barclays might be seen as a nod in the direction of abandoning the traditional arm's length principle in favour of a formula approach. Such a move still appears a distant prospect, but with the UK now embarked on retaliation, a tax war that could unravel the complex network of international tax treaties no longer seems impossible.</p>

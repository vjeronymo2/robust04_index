			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: New move to reform Sunday trading THE campaign for a change to the law on Sunday trading moved up a gear yesterday as Mr Ray Powell, Labour MP for Ogmore, used a Westminster press conference to underline the cross-party support for his proposals for reform, Alison Smith writes. His backbench bill, which would allow only certain types of shops to open on Sunday, including garden centres, newsagents, chemists and petrol stations, and would require shops to register with local authorities, will be debated by MPs on 22 January. That is in addition to the separate commitment from the government to provide MPs with an opportunity to discuss the options before government legislation is introduced, possibly later this session. Yesterday Mr Powell's proposal was endorsed by Mr Michael Schluter, director of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, who called it 'practical, feasible and enforceable', and by Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union.</p>

Yeltsin's Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov told ITAR-TASS NEWS  AGENCY that the two leaders reached the agreement during a  telephone conversation Sunday.    "The result of the conversation was agreement in principle  to  prevent the bombardments, taking into account recent Russian  diplomatic efforts," he said.    "It was agreed to continue consultations on resolving the  situation in Bosnia in the coming days," he said.    Earlier, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that  there would be no immediate nato air strike.    "After my conversation with Mr. Perry, I understood... There  will be no strike tonight, unequivocally," the minister told the  Russian television program Itogi after talking with U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry Sunday.    NATO has given Bosnian Serbs until Sunday 24:00 GMT to  withdraw all heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or hand them  over to U.N. control, saying that they would otherwise face air  strikes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikos Marakis: "Centrists and </F> Middle-of-the-Roaders"]    [Text] The "Centrist camp" had traditionally an almost  mythical character on the Greek political stage. Until  recently, it was a subject of contention by the two major  parties, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] and New  Democracy [ND], since its conquest led to parliamentary  majority. Suddenly we now hear people talking about its future,  and some people even go so far as to discuss its revival as a  political party.    This "revelation" resulted from the explosive reaction of  [former Foreign Minister] Mikhalis Papaconstandinou, who  attacked both the PASOK government and the ND leadership for  their "achievements in Brussels, where they presumably were to  fight for `Macedonia.'" Papaconstandinou's statements and his  almost complete indifference to the "penalties" imposed on him  may have surprised the ND leadership. But some of his friends  (with whom he usually has lunch at the well-known restaurant at  Kolonaki Plaza) had a different view. They said "Mikhalis does  not move haphazardly or for personal reasons. He has a plan."    The "plan" they speak of is no other than the formation of a  "centrist group" within ND which at a later stage (when Andreas  Papandreou takes over the presidency of the republic) will  "coordinate" itself with a corresponding group in PASOK to  revive the "center" in a party form. The more uncertain among  Papaconstandinou's lunch companions objected that those who see  such a plan forget that the "quarrel" between [now ND chairman]  Evert and Papaconstandinou has started since 1964 when  Papaconstandinou, then deputy minister of defense, punished  today's leader of New Democracy (who was then serving his  military stint in the Navy) "for being involved in political  activities"! They said that their views about the "Center" were  a scenario of political fiction. But in such cases who can be  sure that his assessments are correct?    In any event, the talk about the "Center" has many  ramifications since the political personalities who are  supposedly involved approach this question from different  viewpoints. All of them, however, share the same theoretical  scheme. In its more complete and refined form it originates in  the description of the European political stage where the  traditional parties have suffered damage beyond repair. It then  moves to Greece to present the forecast that the departure of A.  Papandreou will lead PASOK to such "developments" that will  change into "transitional" the present period in Greece. Out of  all this, their conclusion is easy: In the future the dominant  parties will be those with more flexible political views without  rigid ideological positions.    This analysis, or some parts of it, may be incorporated in  the political thinking of such disparate political figures as A.  Kaklamanis or A. Andianopoulos, I. Alevras or (Ms.) Dora  Bakoyianni and others who certainly do not espouse the same  ideological dogmas nor do they have similar partisan prospects.  Some speak of 30 parliamentary deputies from PASOK who look  forward to a centrist [partisan] expression and of a similar  number of ND deputies. Others limit the number of those who are  really interested in such a development to only two dozen from  both major political parties. But beyond those numbers and  reasoning, the surrounding atmosphere is so strong as to lead  even members of Evert's inner circle to describe those thoughts  as "a preparation of the New Democracy for the next period of  political developments." G. Souflias finds that PASOK is  abandoning its socialist identity while the New Democracy  abandons at the same time its more extreme aspects of its  policies, so that there is a certain convergence of the two  major parties toward the center and that the area of contest  between them will not be on ideological "principles" but on  their ability to manage and deal with the problems more  effectively. In this context one may understand better the  inability of ND Deputy Th. Kasimis who could not find  sufficiently strong arguments to respond to one of his  colleagues who posed the question: "Is it possible that the two  major parties have exhausted their historical dynamic?" The  person who posed the question is not among those who are known  for their studying and analyzing issues; apparently he reflected  -- rather unwittingly -- a reasoning already found in  international political thought. This current of thought claims  that the parties which today exist in the European countries are  the product of the bipolarity which prevailed after the war, but  do not correspond to the conditions which emerged after the fall  of "communism" and the restructuring of all traditional dogmas.    The discussions about the "center" to the extent they turn  into real political action will find, maybe unexpectedly, a  rival in the Political Spring party. Its leader, A. Samaras, of  course prefers to speak of a "middle" not of a "center" area.  But the section of society that may be defined by the one or the  other term is the same and includes the vast majority of those  who are not moved by the "dogmatic ideologies" of the two  extremes. The notions of "political modernization," and  "national awakening and restructuring" used by Samaras and  addressed as they are to the "citizens" as a whole and not to a  particular social group, constitute his "passport" to the  "middle of the road." At the same time, his choice is the  necessary "vehicle" in his effort to develop a "new majority  current" which will be based on the common, general interests of  society. He sees the Political Spring as the force which will be  able to serve most effectively those interests. With this  strategy he aims at taking away forces from both parties and  also to push New Democracy to the right to leave him greater  opportunities for exerting influence.    At the same time, Samaras rejects for himself the  characterization of "politically centrist." In his view, this  term is connected with the "Center" of the 1960's, which -- he  claims -- gave to the Greek political history the worst there is  because it not only failed to undertake the "renewal effort" as  it had promised but instead it became the standard-bearer of  "horse trading." Samaras takes seriously the "revolution of  conscience" he advocates and rejects the tradition of the  "center" which wanted "the policy to be a succession of a series  of compromises." Besides, he says, "a policy which does not  produce specific results is something like a ship without  destination"...    The renewed competition for the "centrist" or the "middle of  the road" area includes three different currents. One originates  with those who want to continue the traditions of the old  center, the second moves around a reasoning of modernization and  the strategic exploration of confluence between the two major  parties, and the third is expressed already by the Political  Spring. Developments move today at a slow pace but progressively  they acquire a more specific and clear content, something which  will provide the conditions for a "take-off" as soon as the  forces in the major political parties become free to move.</p>

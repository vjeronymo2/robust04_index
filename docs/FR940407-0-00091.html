			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In seeking to provide States with the flexibility to implement emissions trading programs effectively, the final EIP rules retain the proposed requirement for the State to establish appropriate administrative procedures for conducting, approving, verifying, recording, and tracking trades. As part of an EIP program, these procedures would then be reviewed by the EPA in the course of EPA review of the SIP revision incorporating the EIP into the SIP. Thus, the EIP does not necessarily envision single-source SIP revisions for each trade conducted in the context of an EPA-approved generic emissions trading program. Of course, EPA approval of such programs is predicated on the program containing all the appropriate environmental safeguards that are required by the EIP rules. One such safeguard is the inclusion of program audits, to be conducted by the State, to evaluate program implementation and track program results. The EIP rules require that the State provide post-audit reports to the EPA, and that the State commits to implement timely programmatic revisions or other measures necessary for the successful operation of the program. Additionally, the rules require that State and Federal enforceability must be preserved, such that when ERC's generated within an emissions trading program are used to offset increases in emissions from other sources, the EIP must contain a mechanism for ensuring State and Federal enforceability of the measures taken to generate the credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is currently developing additional guidance on such issues associated with banking of ERC's. The EPA intends to complete this additional guidance as quickly as possible, and, in the interim, to work with States developing EIP's involving banking of ERC's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Regional and Interstate Trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Neither the proposal nor final rules specifically address the issue of regional and interstate emissions trading. Several commenters raised this issue, however, particularly in the context of trading of emissions offsets. Most such commenters felt that the EPA should encourage interstate trading by establishing consistent rules and prohibiting States from creating interstate barriers. One State group felt that the final rules should provide for the fullest possible implementation of trading strategies on a regional basis within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. One environmental group urged that the final rules remind States of the statutory geographical constraints on trading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has developed some preliminary guidance on this issue as it relates to NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  offsets in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Additional guidance on interstate or regional trading will be developed in the context of the EPA's working with interested States in program development activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This guidance is contained in a March 31, 1993 letter from Mr. John Seitz, Director of the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Mr. Bruce Carhart, Executive Director of the Ozone Transport Commission, which includes all or portions of the northeastern States from Washington, DC, to the New England States. This letter is available in the docket for this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Administrative Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another Agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that these rules are not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866. This action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These rules do not contain any information collection requirements subject to review by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and applicable EPA guidelines revised in 1992 require Federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of Federal rules upon small entities. Small entities include small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule does not of itself impose any requirements on small entities, nor require or exclude small entities from any EIP's which may be implemented in the future. As a result, the EPA has determined that these rules will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as required under section 605 of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that these rules do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Progressive Socialist Party leader </F> Walid Junblatt on 28 February--read by announcer]    [Text] Only earnest and stern measures can deter the  criminals and eliminate those who play havoc with national  security. These measures should include the following:    1. The results of the investigation into the al-Sayfi  [Phalangist Party headquarters] bombing must be made public and  if evidence and suspects are available, they must be tried by a  military tribunal and executed on the spot.    2. The same measures must be applied without hesitation  against the recently apprehended pro-Israeli gangs. According  to reports, the Army intelligence service recently uncovered and  arrested such groups.    3. A request must be submitted to the French Government to  hand over the individuals suspected of attempting to assassinate  President Ilyas al-Hirawi. According to our information, these  individuals possess much information and command dangerous  groups hostile to the country's security.    4. The country's various intelligence services must be  purged of all individuals guilty of corruption, favoritism,  illegal means of amassing wealth, and negligence. Such people  must dismissed. All intelligence services must be placed under  one unified command so that it will be possible to remedy the  current chaos in these services, as illustrated by the fact that  escort services for VIP's and their motorcades are more  important than the citizens' security.    5. A media law must be passed, unhindered by democratic  formalities, with the aim of stopping some television and radio  stations from broadcasting incitements. These media must be  deterred and closed down.    As for the weepy statements full of political theorizing  aimed at linking the church massacre with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, they are neither useful nor convincing.    While it is true that Israel is the first beneficiary of  such  incidents, it also has well-known agents in the country. This  morbid thing must be excised from the national body before the  sickness spreads and remedy becomes impossible. Israel, in the  final reckoning, does not need to cover up its crime. Just  listen to the still-inciteful statements by the Zionist entity's  leaders. For example, the so-called man of peace Shim'on Peres  refuses to disarm the settlers, wagers on Rabin's downfall, and  represents the Zionist army's and Zionist entity's hardline  wing. The measures Israel has adopted are limited to the  temporary arrest of five settlers.    The Hebron massacre is the start of a major series of crimes  aimed at expelling the Palestinians from the West Bank and  bringing in more Jews from the former Soviet Union and other  countries. Recently they informed us that one million Indian  Jews might be brought to Palestine. Hence, the peace  negotiations, stillborn to begin with, were buried by the Hebron  crime.    We fear that some of the advocates of partition, federalism,  so-called civilized pluralism, and extensive decentralization in  Lebanon will return to their schemes, bombing churches today and  mosques or other places of worship tomorrow with the help of the  Israelis.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By F.C. Kuo and Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Bangkok, April 29 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Thailand will  hold another round of tariff reduction talks under the framework  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in late  June, a ranking Taiwan official said Friday [29 April].    Lin Yi-fu, deputy director-general of Taiwan's Board of  Foreign Trade, made the statement following the conclusion of  the first round of negotiations here.    Lin led a 13-member Taiwan delegation at the GATT tariff  consultations, while Thailand was represented by Puangrat  Asavaphisisth, assistant director-general of business economy at  the Ministry of Commerce.    During the one-day talks, Lin said, both sides agreed on  tariff cuts for 40 items among the 38 agricultural goods and 20  industrial products under discussions.    Taiwan agreed to lower import duties on the 40 items an  average of 24 percent, Lin said.    Those items pending agreement include fruits such as mango,  papaya, mangosteen, and rambutan as well as rice products, for  which Thailand is seeking significant tariff reductions, he  added.    Lin and his delegation, who earlier visited Manila, the  Philippines and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for similar tariff talks,  will return to Taipei Saturday.    Taiwan has held similar talks with the United States,  Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Korea, and Hungary.    Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are  expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth entry into the  Geneva-based world trade regulating body.    Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September  1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pailin, Cambodia, April 6 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR]  guerrillas have launched an attack from Thai territory on  Cambodian Government troops stationed along the border to the  west of the rebel faction's former Pailin headquarters, a  government general said Wednesday.    "We were on the border when they came in," General Houl  Savoan of the 5th Military Region said. The general said a 40  strong group of Khmer Rouge, backed by a tank, attacked his men  Monday. "But the Khmer Rouge were repelled back into Thai  territory," he said.    The general, however, later admitted that the government  forces had pulled back from the area and said journalists could  not visit a former Khmer Rouge radio station because the area  was "insecure."    A group of some 120 Khmer Rouge attacked government troops  occupying Sala Krau, a former guerrilla jungle base around 12  kilometers (7.5 miles) north of Pailin, Saturday, he said. The  Khmer Rouge lost six men in the ensuing firefight while the  government had one soldier dead and three wounded, he said.    Khmer Rouge radio, broadcasting from a new clandestine  location, claimed their fighters killed 42 government soldiers  Saturday in clashes in Sala Krau and adjacent areas.    Worn-out looking government soldiers, returning from jungle  around Sala Krau, said there was relentless fighting every day.  But despite these ongoing clashes, government officers rebutted  Khmer Rouge claims that they had walked into a trap by seizing  Pailin. They claimed the guerrillas' hit and run attacks did  not jeopardise the government's hold on the resource rich region.    An AFP photographer saw soldiers stacking some of what Hul  Savoan estimated to be around 100 tonnes of Khmer Rouge  ammunition recently discovered by the government forces.</p>

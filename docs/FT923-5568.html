			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Query on estate claim PLEASE would you advise me on whether I have any claim on my former husband's estate or pension. We were divorced after nearly 40 years of marriage and his second marriage lasted only 1 1/2 years until his death. During that time maintenance payments were made to me. On divorce my husband and I each put Pounds 15,000 into a trust to provide for me in the event of his death expecting the sum to increase significantly, and not anticipating his death 1 1/2 years later. I now live on my old age pension and the interest from the trust and the capital gained selling our home. Under normal scheme rules and practice, entitlement to any spouse's pension rights ceases on divorce. Where there is a new spouse he or she would automatically qualify for spouse's pension rights under an occupational scheme. This position is generally regarded as unsatisfactory given the high percentage of marriages that end in divorce and the UK Pensions Management Institute is currently gathering evidence for a major report aimed at recommending changes in the law. Some pension schemes do, however, give the trustees discretionary power to provide a survivor pension to a person other than a spouse. Some schemes enable a member to sacrifice part of his or her pension so as to provide for such a dependant's pension. In your case it may be worth writing to the trustees of your former husband's pension scheme, giving details of your case and asking whether they will make a lump sum and/or pension payment to you. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns.  All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Ng] </F>   [Text] The Sun Yee On is considered to be by far "the most  prominent" gang among the 57 triad societies on the official  police list.    In their first official detailed account of the existence of  triads and their involvement in crime, the police ranking of  most- active gangs put the Sun Yee On, part of the Chiu Chow  group, ahead of the Wo groups and the 14K triad.    The 14K, which has 20 sub-groups, including the 14K Baai Lo,  14K Kim and others, was found to be the largest.    Other major gangs include the Wo group with 10 sub-groups,  six Chiu Chow groups and four gangs under the Luen umbrella.    The police paper presented to legislators yesterday revealed  that 10,842 crime cases between 1991 and the end of last year  were triad- related. This equated to 301 cases per month or 10  a day.    Crimes either known or suspected to have been carried out by  triads represented 4.2 per cent of the total number of crimes  recorded in this period.    Of these, the most frequently committed offences were  wounding and serious assault, blackmail and intimidation.    The triads were linked to 3,870 cases of being members of an  unlawful society, 1,813 of blackmail and intimidation and 1,869  of wounding and serious assault.    Last year, a total of 3,487 cases were known or suspected to  be triad-related compared with 4,015 in 1992.    The paper said triad societies perpetrated extortion in  places such as wholesale fish and vegetable markets, public  light bus terminuses, mahjong parlours, construction sites, and  film and decoration industries.    It did not disclose police estimates of the total population  of the triad gangs.    "Triad societies are secret fraternities and, as such, some  particulars are difficult to ascertain with certainty," it said.    "This is especially so when it comes to estimating either  the  number of triads in Hong Kong, or the total number in any given  triad society."    But a police triad expert told a District Court trial in  January that the Sun Yee On alone was estimated to have a  membership of up to 56,000.    The police warned there was an emerging trend among triads  to  veer away from illegal activities and use their money and  influence in legitimate enterprises.    Many leading triad members were now part of Hong Kong's  social scene.    "They have attained an air of respectability and some are  consciously seeking a high social profile through regular  contact with persons of importance in the community," the paper  said.    It said a growing number of women were being admitted to  triad societies, though men were still predominant.    There was also an evolution of more sophisticated triad  members involved in white-collar crime.    Police said these were second-generation triads, who had  received the best education with money generated through illegal  means.    The police said it was imperative that the Organised and  Serious Crimes Bill, which has been under consideration by the  Legislative Council since July 1992, be enacted as soon as  possible.    The paper said the bill could provide additional powers of  investigation to counter organised crime including triads, as  well as the authority to seize assets obtained through criminal  activities.    The police listed the known triad societies at the end of  1993 as:    14K -- 20 factions: 14K Baai Lo, 14K Hau, 14K Kim, 14K Kin,  14K Lai, 14K Lun, 14K Mui, 14K Ngai, 14K Sai Kong, 14K Sai Shing  Tong, 14K Sat, 14K Shing, 14K Shun, 14K Tai Huen, 14K Tak, 14K  Tung, 14K Yan, 14K Yee, 14K Yee Shing Tong, 14K Yung.

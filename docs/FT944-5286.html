			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / International Press Review: The Reykjavik-Oslo-Vaduz-Berne axis - Switzerland Switzerland is not known for its lively political life. But in recent years, two issues - European integration and the problems associated with drug addiction - have achieved an extraordinarily long life. The referendums in Sweden and Norway on joining the EU sparked a fresh round of reflection in Switzerland over the country's decision in a referendum in December 1992 to eschew participating in European integration. And a national referendum yesterday on a law that would make it easier for police to detain immigrant drug dealers brought out again the widespread indignation over Zurich city's open drug scene. It has come as an unpleasant surprise to the Swiss to discover that they are so divided over these issues that they are willing to debate them in public. It has long been a matter of firm belief in this multicultural country that civil harmony is best achieved through compromises arrived at discreetly behind closed doors. The Swiss media are equally steeped in the tradition of seeking a middle way rather than asserting radical points of view. No mainstream Swiss newspaper or magazine, for example, can see any alternative to joining the European Union. The only difference between them is in the degree of wit employed in condemning their country for what they see as its foolishness. The decision by Norwegians to stay outside the EU provided considerable scope. Anti-EU Swiss politicians had wasted no time in asserting that the decision meant the European Free Trade Association (Efta), with Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein as remaining members, could still have a viable future. Richard Diethelm in Zurich's Tages Anzeiger responded sardonically: 'An Efta menu reduced to fondue and fish is too indigestible to have any expectation of being a permanent part of the Swiss diet.' Jacques Pilet in Geneva's Nouveau Quotidien was more indignant. 'It is not serious to claim that a Reykjavik-Oslo-Vaduz-Berne axis will enable us to defend our interests effectively in the European Union,' he said. Another element of the European issue has reappeared because last month the European Commission finally agreed to discuss six issues bilaterally with Switzerland. In the wake of the anti-EEA vote two years ago, the Swiss set out to negotiate urgent matters, such as landing rights in EU countries for Swissair. The Neue Zurcher Zeitung, which has had more reservations about integration than most, warned its readers to expect the worst: 'Certainly, there is at the moment no alternative to bilateralism for Switzerland. But let no one be deceived. This is not the same as an active, comprehensive integration policy, but only a damage limitation policy.' Zurich's drug policy has also divided the Swiss to an extent rarely seen before. Yesterday's referendum backed increased police powers of search, arrest and detention when dealing with asylum seekers. Again, the range of opinion on this issue has been relatively narrow, with the only unqualified criticism coming from commentators in the French-speaking part of the country. They resent Switzerland's human rights record being tarnished because the Zurich city government's experiment with a liberal drug policy ran out of control. Jacques-Simon Eggly in the Journal de Geneve wrote last week: 'If it passes, I hope at least that the judges retain in their minds the troubled consciences of those who, however attached they are to security and the struggles against crime and drugs, fought it.'</p>

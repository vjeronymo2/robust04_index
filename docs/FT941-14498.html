			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / London truck ban to be simplified Measures to simplify a ban on trucks using many London roads at night and at weekends were announced yesterday as part of the de-regulation initiative. The Department of Transport also announced plans to replace the nationwide system of bus and lorry operators' licences, which have a maximum life of five years, with continuous licences. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister responsible for London, said the permit system in the capital would be abolished but heavy trucks would still have to keep to main roads. Abolition of permits, required by trucks which need to leave approved main routes, will save road hauliers Pounds 3m a year. Restrictions on trucks of 16.5 tonnes and more using London's roads were introduced in January 1986 by the Greater London Council. The move from five-year vehicle operator licences to continuous licensing will save businesses about Pounds 2.6m. Quality criteria will not be changed, however, and periodic reviews of operators will still be made.</p>

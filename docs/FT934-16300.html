			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Warning on possible Sellafield leak GALLONS OF radioactive liquid may have leaked from waste storage tanks at Sellafield, Cumbria, the government said last night. British Nuclear Fuels, operator of the site, confirmed that the level of liquid in one of seven huge concrete silos had fallen. An official from the Pollution Inspectorate, which reports to the Department of the Environment, was yesterday trying to establish whether a leak had occurred. The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for BNF. The company is waiting for a licence to start operating its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant, also on the site. The second public consultation on Thorp ended on Monday. BNF said that if any liquid had escaped, levels of radioactivity would be very low, 'equivalent to that which we routinely discharge to the sea'. It had not detected any increase in radioactivity. For the past few months BNF has been carrying out a multi-million pound refurbishment programme on the tanks, which contain intermediate level radioactive waste. A final decision on Thorp is expected in mid-November. It also emerged yesterday that the DoE has decided not to become involved in the decision on licensing a new plant at Sellafield. The decision will be made by Copeland Borough Council.</p>

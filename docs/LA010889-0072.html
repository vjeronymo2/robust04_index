			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIPS TO HOMEOWNERS  </P> <P> Question: I have been told that I should not use an architect when doing a home  improvement project, such as adding a room or extending walls.  </P> <P> Answer: I think there has been a great deal of architect bashing in connection  with home improvement projects. On many smaller or simple projects, it is not  necessary to have an architect. Many home improvement contractors have  qualified draftsmen who can design the basic programs. However, I recommend  using an architect on any sizable project.  </P> <P> Many of the better home improvement contractors receive the bulk of their  business from architects. One contractor told me that 70% of his work comes  through architects. These projects are usually large in scale, highly  customized and ambitious in concept. Architects for home improvements must be  very practical in their concepts to avoid cost overruns.  </P> <P> Selecting a good architect should be based on the experience, the type of work  and the craftsmanship on previous projects. Do not be afraid to check out an  architect, as you would a contractor.  </P></p>

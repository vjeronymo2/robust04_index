			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Chrysler confident of loan extension CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, remained confident yesterday that negotiations on a crucial Dollars 8.6bn multi-bank loan extension for its financial services subsidiary will be completed shortly, despite last-minute delays. To rollover the credit facility, Chrysler Financial needs the consent of all 152 banks in the lending consortium, but two banks, one US and one German, are reported to have demanded better terms on the loan before approving its renewal. A spokesman for Chrysler confirmed that although the two banks delaying the deal accounted for only Dollars 60m of the Dollars 8.6bn financing, if unanimous approval of the loan's renewal was not forthcoming the entire deal would have to be scrapped. That would require Chrysler renegotiating the terms of the loan with every one of the 152 banks in the consortium. The spokesman, however, said the company expected to conclude the deal 'relatively shortly'. The loan extension is crucial to the Chrysler subsidiary, which provides the financing for many of the carmaker's customers and dealers. Because Chrysler Financial has a junk credit rating, the company has few alternative sources of funding. Analysts, however, believe the rollover of the loan will be completed successfully. Mr Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley pointed out that Chrysler's ability to negotiate an extension on the facility long before its expiration date of April 1993 represented a vote of confidence in the company's future by banks. He said: 'It's a major achievement for Chrysler to get so many banks to agree to rollover these loans nine months in advance of expiration."</p>

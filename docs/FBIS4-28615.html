			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- The recent series of  behaviors North Korea showed in the course of nuclear talks have  fed the suspicion that North Korea actually aims to develop  nuclear arms instead of seeking to obtain diplomatic gains  through the nuclear issue, Kim Tok, director of the Agency for  National Security Planning said on Monday.    "It now appears their ultimate aim is to develop nuclear  arms  and they are employing a delaying tactics to earn a time," Kim  said.    Speaking at a National Defense Committee session, the  intelligence chief said his agency has been running an early  warning system against North Korea around the clock in close  cooperation with the intelligence networks of Korea's allies.    He said that thus far there have been no direct signs of  military provocation on the part of North Korea, though some  unusual symptoms such as expanded offensive military exercises  and the tightened grip of people's control were detected.    Saying that the coercive control of people seems to have  reached a point where it no longer works effectively due to  mounting difficulties like food and energy crises, Kim said  there is the danger that North Korea may choose to foment an  external crisis to sidestep their acute internal problems.    "Nonetheless, I believe it would be not easy for the North  to  unleash a military provocation because they themselves well know  a war means their suicide," he said.</p>

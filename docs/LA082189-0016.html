			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SULLIVAN FINALLY ABLE TO SMILE AGAIN  </P> <P> Danny Sullivan flexed his right arm, grimaced, then smiled and waved to the  crowd around Victory Circle at Pocono International Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.,  Sunday.  </P> <P> The 1985 Indianapolis 500 winner, who has been hampered by a broken arm since  an accident May 11 in practice for this year's Indy 500, completed his comeback  with a victory in the Quaker State 500.  </P> <P> Sullivan, who won $98,618, beat Penske Racing teammate Rick Mears in a late  duel.  </P> <P> "My arm feels all right now," Sullivan said. "It was a little sore during the  race and I know I'll feel it tomorrow, but right now it feels fine."  </P> <P> Sullivan took the lead 12 laps from the end when Michael Andretti, who was  leading, pitted for fuel. Mears, a three-time Pocono winner, moved past  Andretti into second place on lap 191 and got to within one second of Sullivan,  the 1984 Pocono winner, three laps later.  </P> <P> But Sullivan, defending CART-PPG Indy-car champion, wound up beating Mears by  4.226 seconds.  </P> <P> Michael Andretti, who won the last two Indy-car races, was third, followed by  Teo Fabi of Italy, the last driver on the lead lap, Mario Andretti and, another  lap back, defending race champion Bobby Rahal.  </P> <P> Sullivan's race speed of 170.650 m.p.h. broke the 500-mile Pocono record of  156.701 set in 1974 by Johnny Rutherford.  </P> <P> Points leader Emerson Fittipaldi started from the pole and appeared to be on  the way to a runaway, building margins of up to 25 seconds as he led 63 of the  first 67 laps.  </P> <P> On lap 68, however, he suddenly slowed and pitted with a broken wheel and  shredded tire. He was out for 22 laps and failed to finish and his points lead  over Mears was cut to 143-125.  </P> <P> Rusty Wallace, winning his second consecutive Winston Cup event and fifth of  the season, took the Champion 400 in a NASCAR track race record of 157.704  m.p.h. at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich.  </P> <P> The record of 156.863 m.p.h. was set by Davey Allison last year.  </P> <P> Wallace took the lead with 17 laps to go and beat Morgan Shepherd by 15.6  seconds.  </P> <P> Shepherd passed Harry Gant, who ran out of gas and finished third.  </P> <P> Defending Winston champion Joe Amato won the Top Fuel finals in the NHRA  Northstar Nationals at Brainerd, Minn., by beating Shirley Muldowney.  </P> <P> While Amato's victory was his second straight and fourth final-round appearance  in a row, Muldowney was making her first appearance in the finals since 1983.  </P> <P> Amato took the win with a quarter-mile time of 5.248 seconds at 278.81 m.p.h.,  while Muldowney smoked her tires and could only watch as Amato raced to  victory.  </P> <P> Bruce Allen won the Pro Stock competition, while Ed McCullough took the Funny  Car event.  </P></p>

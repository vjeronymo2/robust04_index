			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: A pragmatist wary of greener grass - John Thornhill talks to Liam Strong, the new chief executive of the Sears retail group THE UK retailing scene has just been presented with an intriguing prospect. Mr Liam Strong, the energetic 46-year-old former marketing director of British Airways, yesterday took over as chief executive at Sears, the notoriously sleepy retailing group which includes Selfridges, Adams, Olympus, Wallis, Freemans and the British Shoe Corporation. As the City sees it, the highly ambitious Mr Strong is a man in a hurry  - in a business that cannot be rushed. While at BA he developed a reputation as something of a whizz-kid, his most famous coup being the launch of the World's Biggest Offer, a marketing campaign which attempted to stimulate air travel after the Gulf war. Colleagues at BA speak of a man who was fully confident in his own abilities, unforgiving of others' faults, and impatient to implement change. But, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Strong appeared decidedly restrained in his ambitions for Sears. Wisely perhaps, he offered no sweeping new visions for the future of the company; nor did he suggest any radical remedial measures. 'Our over-riding objective simply has to be to get a better return on our assets. Until we have done that there is little point in trying to do anything else.' In two sentences he summed up the City's disquiet with Sears and signalled his determination to tackle it. Analysts have persistently criticised the poor returns it has been able to generate on an asset base of more than Pounds 1bn and annual sales exceeding Pounds 2bn. From peak pre-tax profits of Pounds 273m in 1988-89 Sears fell to Pounds 147m last year as the recession and exceptional charges associated with a continuing restructuring programme took their toll. A further fall is expected this year; the dividend is likely to be uncovered  -and recovery looks set to be long and slow. Yet Mr Strong was tempted because of what he saw as clear recovery potential. 'When I looked at Sears I saw a big company with good asset backing, a wide portfolio of businesses, some problem areas such as footwear and menswear, and some pluses like childrenswear. And all at the bottom of the business cycle.' Since November, Mr Strong has toured the company 'picking up stones to see what lies beneath', in the words of the chairman, Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith. Now he is responsible for finding solutions. Somewhat surprisingly, given his background, he is far more an advocate of creeping incremental change than of the grand gesture. 'The real benefits to be had in the marketplace are from getting the commercial and operational sides of the business working well together,' he says. 'There is a tendency in most service businesses - whether in a plane or in a shop - for the operational side to dominate.' He is wary of being drawn on specifics, but says he sees his role as introducing a culture of constant challenge, redefining standards, and applying them consistently across the business. He suggests the emphasis must be placed on the more effective use of supply chain management and information technology systems, and improved levels of customer service. He intends to launch a mangement audit to assess the company's managerial talent and ensure that it is sensibly deployed. 'One of the things that strikes you is that some things are done very well in certain parts of the group, but they are not applied consistently.' Mr Strong sought inspiration from other retailers in Europe and North America before taking up his post. He concluded that retailing is a dangerous business that has to be carefully played. He exhibits a strong streak of pragmatism and adopts a wary view of expansion either by means of launching new brands or by overseas acquisition. 'The failure rate of developing new brands in retailing is high. Buying up exciting formats must be a better way to go than trying to develop something entirely new yourself,' he says. And he has a similar attitude towards expansion in mainland Europe. 'We will be approaching it more cautiously than anything else we do on the principle that if it is easy someone else will have already done it.' Overseas turnover last year was about 9 per cent of the total and will probably be similar this year reflecting growing Euro-business. Sears is carefully testing its Adams childrenswear franchise in the Netherlands, its Olympus sportswear outlets in Spain, and its Wallis fashion concessions in Germany. It has formed a joint venture with Groupe Andre, the French retailer, to develop business in northern Europe. On the home shopping front, Sears has just bought a Dutch mail order group to combine with its existing Freemans business. But Mr Strong is aware of the potential pitfalls. 'The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence but that's because you know less about it. When you move there you will fail precisely because you know less about it,' he says, permitting himself a rare smile. One area that he accepts may prove more amenable to rapid change is the Selfridges department store. The business, which has a book value of Pounds 180m, has not produced the returns expected of it. The branding of Selfridges could certainly be pursued more aggressively, he suggests. But in spite of his innate caution, the timing of Mr Strong's move to Sears has been shrewdly calculated. He can expect to benefit greatly from the restructuring already undertaken by his predecessor, Mr Michael Pickard, a tall and seemingly ponderous man given to wearing tie-pins with his initials JMP stamped upon them. Mr Pickard wrought a quiet revolution at Sears, helping to shift it from a rambling conglomerate to a more tightly-focused speciality retailer. He also introduced more rigorous financial disciplines and reorganised the British Shoe Corporation, which embraces Dolcis, Saxone and Freeman Hardy Willis. His initiatives at last seem to be beginning to bear fruit. Mr Strong is astutely sending a subdued message to his intended target audience in the City. 'What he says is what we want to hear,' says Mr Rodney Forrest, retailing analyst at stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing. 'But it is also clearly a reality. He will not suddenly wave a magic wand and it will all come right. But there will be a progressive turnaround and improvement.' Mr Strong now has it all to prove. And as he is the first to admit: 'It is in general more difficult in life to decide how to get things done than to decide what to do.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat by Franca Zambonini on 13 April; place not given:  "Arafat: I Am Tired But I Will Not Give In"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zambonini] How are you?    ['Arafat] I am tired. I spent a whole night on my feet to  find out what was happening in Ramallah. [Arafat Ends]    At Ramallah a pregnant 18-year old Palestinian woman was  killed in her kitchen by a stray bullet and a Palestinian  building was blown up; fortunately there was nobody in it at the  time.    For many years 'Arafat accused the West of enmity toward the  Palestinians. He would say: "The West thought that Palestine  was a land without a people that could be given to a people  without a land in order to lessen its feeling of guilt over the  Jews massacred by the Nazis." Or: "The West has ascribed to  Israel all the virtues of the only civilized state in the Middle  East and to the Palestinian people every kind of wickedness."    [Zambonini] What will your Palestine be like when peace  comes?    ['Arafat] A holy land with three religions, divided into two  states -- the Israeli and the Palestinian -- within a new Middle  Eastern order. We will be able to start from scratch with  international aid, by means of a plan similar, on a smaller  scale, to the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt the defeated nations  after World War II. If that does not happen, we will lapse into  chaos, into a Balkanization of the Middle East. History shows  us that wars start when justice is not implemented. To fail to  resolve the problems means providing the fanatics and their  groups with a pretext for violence.    [Zambonini] But do you not have the power to curb the  extremist fringes?    ['Arafat] I cannot do anything before I enter Jericho. The  authority is in Jericho. Today is 13 April. Can I say: This  is the day of the Israeli withdrawal? No. It should have been.  Instead, here I am. Yes, it is delays such as these that are  the cause of the killings.    [Zambonini] In Cairo you signed an agreement with the  Israelis for the establishment of a Palestinian police corps  comprising 9,000 men armed with automatic rifles. Where are  they?    ['Arafat] The police force exists only in theory, too. Arab  countries have loaned me 10 Hercules aircraft to transport the  policemen to the occupied territories, but hitherto not one of  them has been able to enter. I wanted some of them to go  immediately to Hebron, where people cannot move about freely and  have to suffer a curfew because of the presence of 42 settler  families. Yes, 42 Israeli families are keeping 120,000  inhabitants of Hebron prisoner. The same applies in Gaza, where  1 million Palestinians are the hostages of a mere 1,000  settlers. It is situations such as these that inflame the  fanatics on both sides, and the Palestinian people and the  Israeli people are paying the price of their violence.  Meanwhile, we produce declarations of condemnation instead of  promptly implementing the agreements reached. It does not take  courage to make war; it takes courage to make peace.    [Zambonini] Do you think that the Vatican could have a role  to play in the peace talks?    ['Arafat] We consulted the pope to advance the peace  process.  We maintain contacts and meetings with Vatican representatives  at all levels. Personally, I had the privilege of meeting with  Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran, the Vatican foreign minister, and  that meeting confirmed to me that the Vatican's role as a  mediator between us is a very influential one.    [Zambonini] Do you think that the presence in Hebron of 160  international observers, including 35 Italians, is useful?    ['Arafat] I have full confidence in them and in the task  that  has been assigned to them. I wish that there were many more,  not only in Hebron, but also in Gaza, Jericho, and the rest of  the territories. I pleaded on bended knee for the West to send  out the international force envisaged by UN Security Council  Resolution 904 to protect the Palestinian people during this  difficult transition period. The United States said "no," as  did many European nations. So hitherto only three countries have  sent out observers -- Denmark, Norway, and Italy. Their  presence, albeit small, is important as a sign of confidence and  security.    [Zambonini] According to the agreements, there will be an  election four months after the Israelis' withdrawal. Do you  think that the PLO will be successful?    ['Arafat] I feel reassured by previous results. In the  latest municipal elections 96 of the 116 people elected were on  the PLO lists. Last month there were three elections on the  Gaza Strip -- those for the medical, legal, and engineering  councils -- and we achieved excellent results. Our democracy  has asserted itself amid a forest of rifles. When at last we  have peace -- a dream that I pursue without giving in to the  difficulties -- free elections will be the culmination of a long  revolutionary path.</p>

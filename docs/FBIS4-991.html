			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], has reiterated that should his party win  the October elections, it will form a government of national  unity. In an interview with Radio Mozambique, Dhlakama stressed  that the strategy of his movement is within the framework of  national reconciliation. He added that he would like all  parties to be voted to participate in the government, because,  he said, only by consolidating efforts and everybody's  experience can we build our country. Dhlakama was speaking when  he returned to Maringue yesterday, where he attended Renamo's  special congress, which confirmed him as a candidate for the  October presidential elections.</p>

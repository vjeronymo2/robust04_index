			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Recruitment: Hidden motives behind ageism - Employment obstacles for older managers Those Metroland suburbs described here three weeks ago as the focus of 1990s unemployment have been responding with some gusto to the problem of age discrimination, which has created a class of disillusioned, jobless managerial professionals. While the responses were, in the main, positive - some even offered jobs - they were not all wholly sympathetic. The most compelling points came from those who had experienced unemployment themselves and who were now back in work. Brian Winch of Knapton, Norfolk, proves that the problem is not confined to Metroland. Now in his 50s, he was made redundant three times before becoming managing director of a manufacturing company. He confirms that many recruitment consultants do rule out applications from the over-50s, even the over-45s in some cases, because their clients insist on this age limitation. Once managers have got back into employment, Winch says with undisguised glee, 'those of us who have been so treated by these consultants take good care not to use them for recruitment.' His next target is personnel departments which 'try to reflect what they think the senior management wants, not what the company needs, and usually are the main source of prejudice against age.' If you can negotiate these hurdles, he says, 'once you get access to top management, prejudice seems to disappear'. Are the personnel officers forgiven when he is back in the driving seat? Winch replies: 'My remedy is simple in that my first action in a company is to declare redundant the whole of the personnel department and not replace them.' Not all his comments side with the middle-aged executive job seekers. Many of them, with backgrounds in tiered status organisations, can be a 'damned nuisance' in a flat structure, constantly writing internal memos and playing company politics, says Winch. Others tend to oppose change, particularly when it involves redundancies. He maintains that this applies to only those middle-aged managers who refuse to adapt. 'Many of us just get on with it as part of life and the times we live in, and don't let it get to us,' he says. Winch, however, has not had, perhaps, an ordeal like that of Nicholas Athorne, a 43-year-old professional corporate banker with more than 16 years' experience in North America and the City. He lost his job three years ago and today he has two jobs, one as a truck driver and one as a business consultant to medium-sized companies. Athorne, who lives in Suffolk, was dispossessed of his house, drew income support for a time and had a number of low-paid casual jobs. He has networked among fellow professionals, printed 'umpteen versions' of his CV on his personal computer, collected drawers full of rejection letters and admits to feeling despondent on occasion. Ageist policies in banks, he believes, will rebound on them when they lose business because their staff are too inexperienced. 'Perhaps eventually senior management will come to realise that the marginal additional cost for experience can more often than not outweigh the excessive cost of loan provisions,' he writes. Other readers made similar points, but many were short on solutions. Brian Winch says his company employs a number of older people, some on temporary contracts, in jobs out of the mainstream. All have previously held senior positions, but have adapted to the new challenges and 'recognise that their old career has gone forever.' On this theme he suggests that, just as companies have management development and promotion, so they need 'management undevelopment and unpromotion (not demotion).' There might be some merit in this idea were it not for one large obstacle - final salary pensions. One reader, Alan Smallbone, a retired insurance executive, argues that the way final-salary schemes are structured means that underlying funding rates for employers increase with the age of the employee. Those who believe that pensions cannot influence ageist policies could look at the US. Continental Can (then a subsidiary of Kiewit Continental, a Nebraska construction company) in the US agreed to pay Dollars 415m to 3,000 former employees three years ago after a court case exposed a computerised plan that triggered redundancies for workers who reached a 'magic number' - a combination of age and years of service that qualified them for pension benefits. In the UK, where employees have no such legal protection, removing older employees can prove a useful way of creating a pension scheme surplus. Another problem is that employees who recognise that their salary levels in the last year or few years of employment is crucial to their pension entitlement will be reluctant to take a salary drop commensurate with a change of responsibilities. Even though it is arguable that age discrimination in employment is just as damaging as that based on sex, race or disability - all against the law in the UK - the government is not in favour of legislation.

Carried out earlier this month, it covers data on 315 jobs in 131 banks and finance houses.

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cominco's woes test management mettle - The Canadian metals group has failed to live up to expectations THE list of problems facing Cominco, the Canadian metals group, is long enough to test the ability of the most hardened corporate trouble-shooter. The price of zinc, Cominco's biggest revenue earner, has slumped by a quarter in the past nine months, the company's flagship Red Dog mine in Alaska is producing well below capacity, and a new lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia, has been idle since it was commissioned more than three years ago. Burdened by hefty water taxes at Trail which keep rising even when profits are falling, Cominco has lost CDollars 108m (USDollars 85.7m) since the start of 1991. More than one-third of the loss occurred in the first three months of this year. The share price is now only about half its 1989 peak of CDollars 32.13. As if that were not enough, Mr Robert Hallbauer, the forceful chief executive who has spearheaded efforts to ease Cominco's financial and production troubles, is undergoing treatment for leukaemia. He will be away from the office for at least another two months. Mr Norman Keevil, chairman, made no attempt to hide Cominco's woes at last week's annual meeting in Vancouver. Announcing a suspension in the interim dividend, he said: 'We cannot let (recent losses) continue for any length of time'. Cominco was expected to flourish after control shifted five years ago from dowdy Canadian Pacific to an international base metals consortium comprising Metallgesellschaft, the diversified German metals group, Australia's MIM Holdings, and Teck Corporation of Vancouver. MIM and Teck own 45 per cent of Cominco. The new shareholders installed Mr Hallbauer, a Teck veteran, as chief executive, and sent in a German marketing team. But relations between the company and its new shareholders - and among the shareholders themselves - have at times been strained. Mr Keevil made an important break with the past at the annual meeting by announcing that, after three years of indecision, Cominco was abandoning the German-designed QSL technology used in the troubled lead smelter. It plans to convert the facility to a smelting process known as Kivcet, developed in Kazakhstan. The saga of the smelter is by no means over, however. Cominco is claiming compensation for an alleged breach of contract from Lurgi, the German engineering group which designed the smelter. It may also claim for loss of earnings during the three years it has had to rely on an old, inefficient smelter which the QSL facility was meant to replace. Chances are that Cominco's claim will go to arbitration. Mr Erik Menges, head of Lurgi's commercial department, expresses 'surprise and disappointment' at Cominco's decision. He notes that QSL smelters are working successfully in Germany and Korea. Mr Menges says Lurgi remains willing to adapt Trail to the high lead and zinc residues contained in feedstock for the Canadian plant. Cominco is confident Trail, one of the world's biggest metallurgical complexes, can prosper. Despite the high-cost lead smelter, operating losses there dropped to CDollars 10m last year from CDollars 53m in 1991. Trail's big advantage is cheap power, due to two nearby hydro-electric stations which Cominco owns. But as a big water consumer, Cominco is also one of the few private companies in British Columbia subject to the controversial water tax. A provincial inquiry two years ago recommended a CDollars 14m cut in property and water taxes as part of a package of measures needed to ensure Trail's viability. The social-democrat government has baulked, however, at reducing the water levy, apparently for fear it will set a precedent for BC Hydro, the provincial power utility. Cominco is adamant the CDollars 100m conversion of the lead smelter to the Kivcet process will not go ahead until the burden of the water levy is lightened. Talks between the two sides have quickened recently. The government is understood to have offered other forms of relief, but Cominco is concerned this would still expose it to hikes in the water levy. Meanwhile, the company is examining ways of using its hydro-electric resources to help finance conversion of the smelter. One possibility could be to involve BC Hydro in expansion of the power plants. Cominco believes the outlook for the Red Dog mine is brightening. The mine produced only 70 per cent of its design output last year, as a result of unexpectedly complex geology and high lead oxide impurities. Mr Keevil told the annual meeting Red Dog should reach capacity before the end of this year. That would lower unit costs by almost one-third, and make the mine profitable even at the current zinc price of 46.5 US cents per pound. Mr Rick Cohen, mining analyst at Goepel Shields in Toronto, thinks the worst is over for Cominco. Besides coming to grips with the problems at Trail and Red Dog, the company has raised CDollars 158m by spinning off its fertiliser division into a new public company. The 60 per cent-owned Snip gold mine in northern BC has performed well above expectations since it started production in early 1991. Another new property, the Quebrada Blanca mine in Chile, in which Cominco has a 39 per cent direct stake, is due to produce its first cathode copper early next year - on schedule and on budget. The best news would be a turnround in the zinc market. Cominco has cut 1993 metal output by 50,000 tonnes in an effort to help bring down swollen worldwide inventories. But Mr Keevil has indicated further cutbacks are unlikely unless other producers show a greater willingness to restrain their output.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Kohl to ask US to step up assistance for Moscow GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl will urge a big increase in US assistance for President Boris Yeltsin's reform programmes, when he meets President Bill Clinton for the first time today. The precarious state of Mr Yeltsin's government is certain to be a dominant theme of the talks, with both sides having outspokenly pledged support for the Russian leader in his tussle with parliament. Mr Kohl yesterday welcomed the US president's proposal for a 'concrete aid programme' for Russia, which Germany has been urging for months, but underlined that it is now up to the rest of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations to provide more finance. 'We expect our partners to get more actively involved than they have up till now,' he told the German Bundestag shortly before leaving for Washington. 'We Germans have provided more than 50 per cent of all western help so far, with more than DM80bn. . . But with that, we have already reached the limits of what we can afford.' Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said yesterday that the US aid programme for Russia that Mr Clinton plans to announce at his Vancouver summit with Mr Yeltsin next month would concentrate on 'practical, tangible down to earth, non-ideological programmes for prompt assistance to the Russian people.' Mr Christopher said Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, had 'pleaded' for technical assistance at the micro-economic level in his talks in Washington this week. US bilateral aid would focus on micro-economic programmes in fields such as energy and housing, Mr Christopher said, acknowledging that in the past aid for Russia had been 'halting and inadequate'. Macro-economic assistance to stabilise the Russian economy and ward off imminent hyperinflation would be primarily multilateral, and would be announced by the G7 after the Vancouver summit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporter has been  killed at Umlazi, and thousands of ANC [African National  Congress] supporters have begun marching on the nearby King  Zwelithini Stadium. Witnesses say a man in a bakkie [pickup]  began firing on groups of ANC supporters. A short while later  he was stabbed to death and his vehicle was set alight.    The incident began when hundreds of IFP supporters occupied  the stadium this morning ahead of a planned ANC rally there.  The ANC contingent, who were turned away earlier by police  using tear smoke, has regrouped and is heading for the stadium.  The ANC says it is to lay charges against IFP members for  contravention of the Electoral Act, and said that IFP supporters  had flouted the terms of last month's agreement between Mr.  Mandela and Dr. Buthelezi which guaranteed free political  activity.</p>

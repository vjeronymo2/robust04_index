			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "Partnership </F> for United, Peaceful, and Democratic Europe"]    [Text] On 10 January, the government heads of the NATO  states will try to find an answer to the new challenges in terms  of security policy in Europe. Should the North Atlantic  Alliance be extended to the East? How can the security  interests of the Eastern Europeans and the Russians be taken  into consideration equally? What roles should organizations such  as the European Union, the Western European Union [WEU], the  CSCE, and the NATO Cooperation Council [NACC] play in this  connection? With the contribution of Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU ends a series of  discussions that includes articles by national and international  politicians and scientists on this issue:    It has become a hackneyed phrase to say that Europe is  living  in a decisive period of its history. Still, particularly today,  this statement is more true than ever before. Major events are  taking place in both Western and Eastern Europe. With the  European Union, which is preparing for the accession of new  members, integration has reached a new stage. Russia has freed  itself of the remnants of the Soviet political system and is now  entering a stage of parliamentary democracy, which rests on a  stable, solid constitutional basis. A big step toward economic  integration has been made within the CIS by signing the  agreement on economic community.    However, it is obvious that the efforts to create a  democratic Europe as one united entity are falling behind  tendencies toward a fragmentation of our continent and the  emergence of new dangers and threats. Which of these  developments will gain the upper hand depends to a great extent  on the decisions that have to be made by the responsible  European politicians at the NATO summit and the CSCE summit in  Budapest this year. An ill-chosen peace structure for Europe  can become a burden for all Europeans just like a bad design for  a house and can itself become the reason for frictions and  conflicts, similarly to what happened in the past through the  Versailles Treaty. We must not repeat the mistakes of our  forefathers.    By what objectives should the general security system, which  has to be created by the Europeans, be guided? What criteria  should it fulfill? What paths can be pursued for its  implementation?  <H5>  The Trap of Simple and Quick Solutions </H5>   There is no lack of simple solutions for Europe's security  problems that appear superficially efficient. In short, one can  say that they essentially consist of the extension of Western  institutions, whose existence was justified in the Cold War era,  to the countries of Eastern Europe and to Russia. Here the main  attention goes to the quickest possible integration of the  Central European countries into Western military-political  structures.    These recommendations are based on two myths that are  regarded by their advocates as axioms of current European  policy. First, the thesis of a "security vacuum" in Central  Europe, of a "gray area," which almost inevitably becomes the  site for Russian-German rivalries or falls into the sphere of  Russian expansion. Second, the thesis of "Russia's move toward  a nationalist, imperialist policy" as a result of the recent  parliamentary election.    The solution is produced by taking these two statements  together: NATO should protect the countries of Central Europe  against the inevitable thrust from the east. The "guard house  on the Rhine" should thus be shifted to the banks of the Bug.  This request is substantiated by references to the West's  "moral obligation" toward the young democracies in the region  and by reflections about the "natural geopolitical interests" of  the Western nations themselves.    In my opinion, this approach replaces the ability to spot  dangers, which is essential for any politician, with a strategy  that does not only assume the "worst scenario" but even provokes  it.    One can seriously speak of a "security vacuum" in Central  and Eastern Europe only if one claims and predicts with equal  seriousness the existence of hostile security-political blocks  in Europe, in whatever form, and the continued existence of  hostility between the East and the West. Put differently: To  support the thesis of a "security vacuum" means to deny the  essence of the all-European process, which is expressed in the  Paris Charter: the unity of the democratic peoples of Europe.  This would be the biggest declaration of bankruptcy of all of  European politics, which, despite seemingly insurmountable  difficulties, tore down the Berlin Wall, brought German unity,  and led to the collapse of the totalitarian monsters of the 20th  century. Instead of moving forward, one is making a panic step  backwards by at least half a century.    The "security vacuum" is bound to restore rivalries between  Moscow and Berlin in Central Europe. Yet, this would be a step  backwards, dictated by fears and the ignorance of what has been  achieved. Today there are two major democratic states in Europe  -- the Russian Federation and the FRG, two partners that  cooperate politically and economically and are united through a  bilateral treaty and through their participation in the CSCE  process. To pave the way for a confrontation between these two  states in any "gray area" would mean to challenge German-Russian  partnership as the greatest feat of the current Europe and to  undermine the foundation of European stability.    In the strategy of the "worst scenario," one can see the  inertia both in the interpretation of the "threat from the East"  and the appropriate counter-recipe. If the worst of all  scenarios is predicted -- the renewal of Russian imperialism --  then one must not start from an attack of "Soviet tanks" against  the East, but one must start from the repetition of the Yugoslav  drama in the former Soviet Union. The consequence would be  millions of refugees, disasters in the major industrial  complexes, and the danger of a use of tactical nuclear arms.  What could NATO do in such a situation for the protection of  its eastern members? The cloud of the various Chernobyls would  certainly be enough for all of Europe. The "guard house on the  Bug" would not have the necessary power to help anyone at all.    Yet, it is exactly such an overhasty extension of NATO that  might provoke this worst case scenarios. It would serve the  extremists in Russia as a strong argument for a revival of the  Russian empire and for resistance against the "attack from the  West." Hence, the strategy of the "worst scenario" is  particularly dangerous because it includes a self-fulfilling  prophecy.  <H5>  The Russian Factor for European Security </H5>   Fears of a new "threat from the east" may be dispelled  mainly  through a strategy of partnership with democratic Russia, which  has embarked on the path toward a law-governed state and the  market economy. Those who speak of an "aggressive" Russian  policy in Europe cannot produce a single shred of evidence,  apart from statements by some Russian politicians who do not  have any influence on the determination of the course of the  government of this country. In real life, one can usually speak  of an aggressive foreign policy only when a country declares the  conquest of other countries as its objective, pursues an  offensive military doctrine, and supports an ideology to this  effect.    These criteria do not apply to the Russia of today. The  Russian president's foreign policy has proven that we want to  achieve our country's interests as a nation state through  partnership and not through confrontation with the world around  us. This objective is supported by our democratic constitution.  Russia does not have any territorial claims against any country  in the world, including countries in Central and Eastern Europe.  According to Russia's new military doctrine, our armed forces  serve the sole purpose of defending our country and our allies  and of peacemaking efforts in line with Russia's international  obligations. As a military power, Russia is limited to the  quantity necessary for defense, as established by the treaty on  conventional disarmament in Europe and the START I and START II  Treaties. All military activities are predictable and have been  laid bare within the framework of the applicable agreements on  confidence-building measures. Speaking of a "Russian threat"  under these circumstances means to deliberately twist facts.    The success of right-wing nationalist forces in the recently  held parliamentary election is not a symptom for a pathological  decay of Russian society but a vaccine for a healthy organism,  which, of course, leads to an increased temperature. There  cannot be a deep fertile ground for really pro-fascist  conditions in Russia, which did more for the defeat of fascism  in World War II than any other country in the world. The people  did not caste their votes for a "campaign against the West" or  for an "advance toward the warm seas," and neither for the  renewal of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp by force.  They voted against the ambitions and the self-complacency of  some reformers, against their inability to explain the people  the objectives of the reform in a simple language that people  can understand, and against lacking social protection of the  population, and an insufficient struggle against crime.  Comparisons with the Germany of 1933, which are now popular, are  only acceptable to mobilize forces for the defense of Russian  democracy, but not to establish the allegedly inevitable fate,  its defeat.    The Russian democrats have started to draw the necessary  conclusions from the sobering lesson of the parliamentary  election. The reform program will clearly be revised in favor of  strengthening social measures. We are determined to fight  against crime without any mercy. Yet there is no and there will  not be any flirting with right-wing extremism. We reject any  overt or covert form of extremism, aggressive nationalism, and  fascism.    The West must also draw its conclusions from the election  success of Zhirninovkiy's Liberal Democratic Party. Our  partners must revise their tone and accents in the dialogue with  Russia. Constant preaching and criticism are inappropriate for  talks with Moscow. Partnership is hardly reconcilable with  proposals that we should either accept or reject as a whole  without being granted the right to revise them with a view to  our own interests. Such attempts are sometimes being made when  it comes to evaluating the Yugoslavia conflict or the situation  in Libya and Iraq.    It is precisely now that Russia must have a stronger  feeling of support from abroad for its reform policy. What is  essential is a clear, well-developed strategy for cooperation  between Russia and its democratic partners in the West. At the  moment, in many respects, we remain at the level of a generally  correct "idea of partnership" (Russia and the West are partners  because they belong to the democratic community of states), but  our actions are based on decisions of the moment. When Russia  made its entrance on the international stage as an independent  state, this approach was the only one possible. However, this  stage is now over. We need new strategic formulas and  mechanisms for their implementation that fully correspond to the  present quality of our relations. What is most important is  that the cooperation that Russia was promised in Tokyo must be  put into practice without reservations. Europe does not need a  strategy in which Russia's return to imperialism forms, as it  were, a "built-in" component, but a system-shaping strategy that  promotes the unity of all the democratic states in Europe.  <H5>  Partnership for a United Europe </H5>   At the end of the 1940's, Western politicians were able to  find a genuine strategic answer to the great problems of their  times -- the rebuilding of Western Europe and the resistance  against Stalin's expansionist policies. Adequate mechanisms  were set up in good time, including the foundation of the  European Community and NATO. Here we are talking not about  dismantling well-proven mechanisms, but about adjusting them to  the new realities and drawing them into a truly all-European  system of security and cooperation.    In creating a new architecture for Europe, one has to pay  urgent attention to a number of criteria, including the  following:    -- A balanced, gradual approach to the creation of the  European security system. Here, "shock diplomacy" methods and  policies of accomplished facts are excluded. The Russian side  supports thorough consultations between all interested parties.  We are conducting such a dialogue in the runup to the NATO  summit with partners in the North Atlantic Alliance, in Central  Europe, and with neutral states.    -- Openness of regional organizations and institutions as a  surety for a successful adjustment to the new European  realities. Russia has no right to stipulate who and who may not  join NATO. However, we do have the right to proceed on the  assumption that the North Atlantic Alliance will take into  account the special features of an unavoidably long transition  period and -- if one looks even further into the future -- will  emphasize the point, enshrined in NATO's articles, that states  that NATO remains open for any democratic European or Atlantic  state to become a member. It should not be excluded from the  outset that Russia will apply for NATO membership at some time  in the future. It is important to ensure an effective and equal  partnership in a period a general change and adaptation to one  another.    -- The guarantee of an equal level of security for all  European states. In Europe, "first and second-class security,"  "gray areas," and "special spheres of influence" are just as  unacceptable as "isolated regions" and a "cordon sanitaire."    -- The treaty-based foundation of European security, as it  has emerged, must be preserved. This also concerns the treaty  for final settlement in relation to Germany.    -- Exclusion of territorial claims between European states.  Are the intentions of certain Baltic states to join NATO  compatible with territorial demands against their neighbors?    The chief goals of our proposed strategy for partnership at  the political level and in the field of security should be the  following:    First, development of Euro-Atlantic cooperation. The  transformation of the CSCE into a political organization for the  entire region and of the NACC into an autonomous organization  for military-political cooperation but one closely linked to the  CSCE. Their aim must be to coordinate the efforts of NATO, the  WEU, and the CIS in strengthening international security, acting  to strengthen peace, and providing genuine protection for the  rights of national, linguistic, and other minorities in Europe.  I regard the declaration adopted at the CSCE conference in Rome  on combating aggressive nationalism as a significant step in  this direction.    As far as the NACC is concerned, one should not regard it  as an anteroom for NATO according to the "NATO plus" formula,  but as envisaged when it was originally set up, as a independent  instrument of equal partnership between one-time enemies for the  building of a new Europe. Proposals for expanding NACC to  include neutral European states and to form a compact  secretariat for the Cooperation Council are of considerable  interest. The NACC itself must direct its work toward  developing cooperation in the security field, in military  planning, arms conversion, and maintaining peace.    Second, the creation of a system of overlapping security  guarantees between the states of Western and Eastern Europe.  The closer the states are intertwined with one another, the  stronger the network of their relations will be. For this  reason, should one not consider, for example, creating a  security network of mutually complementary treaties in the  security field between Germany and Poland and Poland and  Germany? Corresponding treaties could also be proposed for  other states in the region.    Third, I welcome the proposals made by my German colleague  Klaus Kinkel concerning concluding an agreement for cooperation  and consultations between NATO, on one side, and the countries  of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine, on the  other. It would be useful to set up a communications channel  between NATO and the CIS.    Fourth, increasing the ability of the European states to  ensure peace. For the time being, frankly speaking, the East  and the West have as yet found no joint [solidarische] answer to  the challenge posed by the local conflicts in Yugoslavia and the  former Soviet Union. In the meantime, these conflicts are  developing into a big European security problem. Our partners  should effectively support the efforts of Russia, which is  carrying the main burden of ensuring peace in the post-Soviet  area. The establishment of a voluntary fund for supporting the  efforts to guarantee peace in the CIS is now on the agenda of  the day. NACC can provide practical support (such as financial  aid in training personnel for peacekeeping operations).    Fifth, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe. It is  a mistake to regard the strategic missiles dispute between  Russia and Ukraine as one aspect of the division of the Soviet  legacy. This is a matter of preventing a contravention of the  nuclear weapon nonproliferation regulations and affects the  interests of the whole of Europe. Our partners in NATO  supported the Russian position at NACC's meeting in Brussels  when they rejected Kiev's attempts to represent the decisions of  the Supreme Soviet as a ratification of the START I Treaty. The  strategy of the European partnership must provide a strong  incentive for strict observance of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.    The economic elements of the partnership deserve special  mention. Their essence lies in the transition from isolated,  chronically delayed support programs to including Russia in the  international division of labor on an equal, nondiscriminatory  basis and in providing Russia with access to European markets.    In many respects, the fields for action that I have  mentioned  have connections with the proposals that my colleagues from many  European countries have put forward in recent months. The  dialogue concerning a security partnership for Europe is already  gaining intensity. I hope that the NATO summit will further  this development in a useful way through its balanced and  farsighted decisions. Russia is a responsible and committed  partner for the members of the North Atlantic Alliance in the  development of such a strategy.</p>

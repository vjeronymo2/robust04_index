			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Danish consumer prices rise Danish consumer prices increased by 0.4 per cent from July to August and by 2.2 per cent over the 12 months to August, according to the Official Statistical Office. The 12-month rate of increase was the highest since early 1992. Half the increase from July to August was caused by a normalisation of clothing and footwear prices following sales in July. A 10 per cent increase in the price of coffee and other food prices explained most of the rest of the increase. In July 1993 the Danish inflation rate was the lowest since the 1950s at 1.2 per cent. This year, under the impact of a fast growing economy and a boom in consumer demand, the rate of inflation has begun to move up. Austrian consumer prices rose in August by 0.6 per cent and by 3.2 per cent year on year. Spain's industrial production index rose 8.4 per cent in June 1994 from June 1993. The Dutch producer price index for manufactured goods rose a provisional 0.1 per cent in July from June, giving a 0.2 per cent rise year on year.</p>

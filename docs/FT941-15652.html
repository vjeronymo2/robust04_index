			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Belgian scandal takes its toll on markets Mr Guy Coeme, Belgian deputy prime minister, yesterday hit back at allegations that he committed forgery, and was involved in illegal acts connected to the award of a lucrative government helicopter contract five years ago. 'I have not committed forgery, there has been no forgery, and no illegality. The procedure is perfectly correct and in line with all legal requirements,' Mr Coeme, former defence minister, told a news conference. Mr Coeme, now communications minister in Belgium's centre-left coalition, is the most senior of three ministers from the country's French-speaking Socialist party, wanted for questioning by Mrs Veronique Ancia, a Liege magistrate. Mrs Ancia is investigating allegations of bribery and corruption in relation to the 1988 contract awarded to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer. In particular, she is examining the possibility that bribes were offered or paid to the francophone Socialist party to influence the decision. Mrs Ancia has asked the national parliament and the assemblies of the country's Walloon region and French-speaking community to lift the parliamentary immunity of the three ministers. The widening political scandal took its toll on the Belgian franc and bond markets yesterday morning, as dealers speculated about the possibility that the Agusta affair might damage the government. A committee of members of the Belgian parliament's upper house should vote today whether to lift the parliamentary immunity of Mr Guy Spitaels, minister-president of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon interior minister. The balance of votes in the committee appeared yesterday to be tipped against Mr Spitaels and Mr Mathot, both of whom have argued against lifting of immunity, but offered to talk separately to Mrs Ancia. Mr Coeme, and Mrs Ancia herself, are likely to be questioned by a similar committee of the lower chamber next week about the request. All three men have this week denied any wrongdoing, and Agusta itself has repeatedly denied any connection with illegal financial dealings. But the trio - dubbed les trois Guy - have also attacked the widespread leaking of what they say is an inaccurate report to the parliament, justifying Mrs Ancia's request for the lifting of immunity. Mr Coeme called yesterday's press conference specifically to tackle charges contained in that report. In particular, he struck back at allegations that vital documents were doctored to favour the Agusta bid over French and German competition, claiming that Mrs Ancia was referring to an unauthorised rough copy of the final document. Explaining his refusal to resign while the case was being examined, Mr Coeme said: 'I have a feeling of deep injustice about what has happened concerning my role, and a resignation would be considered . . . a second injustice.' Political commentators appear to be divided about the significance of the affair for the survival of the government, a fragile coalition of Dutch- and French-speaking Christian Democrats and Socialists. Flemish opposition parties have been particularly critical, but the potential scandal has not touched any other ministers in the current government directly.</p>

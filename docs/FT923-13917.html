			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share rally extended in good volume THE FOOTSIE Index came within one point of the 2,500 mark yesterday as a brighter tone in the US dollar and on Wall Street brought buyers back into the London market, lifting the Index by more than 25 points. The institutions were buyers of the leading blue chips, taking their cue from strategists at several UK securities houses who described the UK market as oversold, if only in the near term. London joined in the general advance by other leading European bourses. However, any more lasting rally is likely to hinge on the meeting of the Bundesbank policy council next Thursday, according to the strategy team at Robert Flemings Securities. The upturn in London was encouraged by the favourable response to the latest US jobless figures from both the dollar and the New York stock market, where the Dow Average gained 21 points in UK trading hours. The London arm of a US investment bank bought shares in Glaxo strongly and there were indications of a large programme trade which was weighted towards the buy side. Trading volume increased sharply yesterday, at least in terms of the Seaq daily total which rose to 482.9m shares from Wednesday's 396.1m; retail business was worth only Pounds 816.9m in the previous session, still an unexciting performance. At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 25.3 points at 2,497.9, having touched 2,499.2 earlier. The erratic performance of the stock market this week has suggested that the institutions continue to regard the UK market as a 'buy' between FT-SE 2,450 and 2,500. Equities were led forward by sharp rises in US-orientated stocks, with BAT Industries, SmithKline Beecham and Rothmans International standing out. Domestic consumer stocks remained out of favour, with fresh food distributers unsettled after a profit warning from Albert Fisher, supplier of products to the big supermarkets. Among UK securities houses taking a relatively more optimistic view for the short term were UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, where Mr Mark Brown, while admitting that the market has taken a worse turn than expected, urged that it was 'time to buy'. He stressed that the current yield on UK equities of around 5 per cent, putting shares on a yield ratio of 180 against government bonds, has proved a 'useful support during this recession'. Today brings the close of the two-week trading account in London equities, and share prices benefited again yesterday from bear-closing operations - buying operations by traders who had sold stock early in the account period, when share prices were higher, and needed shares for delivery when the account closes. Traders were favourably impressed by the market's performance yesterday, perhaps more by the improvement in trading volume than by the gain in the FT-SE Index. The market has traded an extremely erratic pattern this week, with share prices moving sharply in minimal turnover as traders have reacted to bad news on new issues and company profits.</p>

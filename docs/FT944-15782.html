			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Architecture: 100 years of London pride - Centenary celebrations for the city's survey Sometimes public money is spent wisely. One hundred years ago a remarkable project was started that has become famous as the Survey of London. Its centenary is being marked by a display at the Museum of London in the Barbican (until November 27), and a slim volume has been produced by the survey's general editor, Hermione Hobhouse, as a permanent reminder of the importance of a rare and continuing work of scholarship. The idea of carefully recording the buildings of a whole capital city in measured words and drawings could have been pedestrian and boring. But for anyone interested in architecture, the existence of the survey is as reassuring as the presence of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital is to the City of London. It is good to know that quiet and serious expertise is being supported from the public purse in the interests of learning, knowledge and excellence. However, unlike Barts' marvellous hospital and medical school, the survey is not in danger of being targetted by official vandals. Indeed, the survival of this small group of dedicated scholars, historians and measurers in post-Thatcherite Britain is something of a small miracle. The survey started as a result of pressure from a group led by the great arts and crafts architect C R Ashbee in the 1890s, and thrived initially with the support of the London County Council. That support was continued by the Greater London Council until its abolition in 1986. The GLC had nurtured a specific to look after the historic architecture of London. Its historic buildings division was a pioneer in the care of listed buildings, and became an exemplar to English local authorities. When politics intervened in the 1980s, the division was taken over by a quango, English Heritage. Thankfully, someone somewhere was wise enough to see that the scholarly survey belonged elsewhere, so it was given a home in a non-departmental public body, the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. This was inspired, because the founders of the royal commission had an intellectual sympathy with the founders of the London survey. There are portraits in the exhibition at the Museum of London of Victorian and Edwardian statesmen like Sir John Lubbock, author of the first Ancient Monuments Act of 1892. During much of the 19th century, government action to preserve or care for historic buildings had been ineffectual. It took great energy and political manoeuvring by groups and individuals to change all this. As a result, the end of the 19th century saw the formation of the National Trust, the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (created by William Morris and his friends), the London Society and the London Topographical Society. We have become used to the system that evolved at that time, but it took a series of campaigns to alert politicians to the need to preserve the past. It was the architect C R Ashbee who had the idea of creating local watch committees to draw attention to the historic fabric of the parishes of London, and to spotlight areas or specific buildings under threat. In the words of Ashbee: 'We plead that the object of the work we have before us is to make nobler and more humanly enjoyable the life of a great city whose existing record we seek to mark down; to preserve of it for her children and those yet to come whatever is best in her past or fairest in her present ..and to stimulate among her citizens that historic and social conscience which to all great communities is their most sacred possession.' The work of the London survey represents in elegant and disciplined form an expression of those ideas. The display at the Museum of London shows many of the glories of London, which are also manifest in the great volumes that have appeared during the last 100 years and which continue to be produced by a dedicated team. There is a chance to hear much more about the work of the London survey in a series of lectures on Mondays (until November 17) at the Linnean Society, Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. Further information can be had from the Survey of London, Newlands House, 37-40, Berners Street, London, W1, 071-631 5065. London Survey'd: the work of the Survey of London, 1894-1994, is published by The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, at Pounds 7.95.</p>

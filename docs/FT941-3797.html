			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Post Office staff to be balloted The Post Office's 1,900 counter staff in London are being balloted for strike action in an attempt to save the capital's network of main offices from closure. If the staff back the strike call in the postal ballot, the union will hold a mass lobby of parliament and call for a one-day boycott of post offices. The result of the ballot will be announced on March 21.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Money's no object when you are buying for baby / A look at Tupperware's aim to update its image with a new range for children Tupperware is launching a new range of children's products in Europe as part of a drive to update its image. Anxious to get away from the image of dreary suburban life evoked by the 'Tupperware party', the company is now targeting the working mother. Lisa Gagliani, UK Tupperware product manager, says the range of children's feeding equipment will be central to bringing people back to the company's products. 'Our research in the 1980s showed that Tupperware was becoming invisible to the modern woman,' she says. 'Since then, we've updated our corporate image and we believe that our market in the 1990s is the working mother. Demographically, couples are waiting longer to have children, having fewer children and spending more on them.' The new range, called TupperCare, aims to take advantage of these factors: prices will be about two to three times higher than comparable products from competitors Mothercare, Boots, Canon, Avent, Tommy Tippee and Maws. The baby set, for example, which includes bottles, a tumbler and accessories, costs Pounds 19.95; the set for toddlers on solid foods, includes a bowl, tumbler, cutlery and tray, and sells for Pounds 25.95. Gagliani says: 'We're not out to compete on price, but on quality. We have about 11,000 mothers and fathers in our sales force in the UK and Ireland, and they believe that parents and grandparents will bear that premium.' Her sales target for 1993 is Pounds 4m-worth of TupperCare. There will be no departure in Tupperware's marketing methods and the 'party' will still be the main outlet for sales. The idea of the home demonstration began in the US with the chemist, Earl Tupper, who pioneered the use of plastic containers as household products. By the 1950s he was selling his products through department stores but found that retailers were not successfully demonstrating the company's hallmark - the Tupperware seal which made containers air-tight. Tupper removed his products from all retail stores and substituted home demonstrations. By inviting friends and neighbours to a Tupperware party, housewives could combine a new job opportunity with their social lives. Women were also selling to women without the fear of a salesman's foot in the door. Party-goers only needed to watch a 20 minute sales demonstration and if they got carried away and bought too much, there was a 14-day cooling-off period during which they could return their purchases. For the latest children's range, Tupperware Europe's in-house designers developed the bottles and British consultancy FM Design devised the other products. Ian Ferris, from FM, visited mother and toddler groups before starting work on the prototypes. Says Ferris: 'Mothers have strong views on product design. They don't want to stay at home with young children, so they need leak-proof bottles and containers for baby foods. They also felt patronised by products with 'mumsy' patterns and pastel colours. We constantly refined our ideas by going back to mothers and showing them our proposals.' In green, coral and mauve, the range features removable bases, which keep tumblers and plates steady, air-tight seals, interchangeable parts and cutlery with shaped ends which prevent them slipping into the child's plate.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / BT and Visa agreement HOLDERS of Visa credit and debit cards will soon be able to pay for domestic and international telephone calls on their card account under a deal between British Telecom and Visa International. VisaPhone, which is already available in the US, allows callers to provide their card number and an identification number to pay for calls. The system will be fully introduced in the UK early next year. Visitors to the UK will be able to bill calls to their Visa card in local currency. UK banks which issue Visa cards are expected to offer the service in the next few months.</p>

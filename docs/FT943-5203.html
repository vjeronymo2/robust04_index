			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (3): Now it's every firm for itself - Brokers discover that the good old days of assured profits are gone for ever The world of the reinsurance broker is no longer the cosy, clubby place it once was. The same harsh reality that has prodded the retail and wholesale sectors into action has finally penetrated through to the reinsurance layer, prompting widespread and large-scale changes. Some firms will not survive the brush with reality; those that do will emerge as risk consultants with a much wider brief than their ancestors. The harsh reality is a shrinking, but more demanding client base. Brokers are having to prove their worth to their customers by cutting costs and adding value. It is a difficult juggling act to perform when the squeeze is on remuneration and when brokers are still servicing long tail liabilities. Brokers work within much tighter margins than underwriters and administering old accounts is expensive and time-consuming. The problems are exacerbated by the reluctance or inability of some reinsurers to shell out for claims and by the switch from the standard 10 per cent commission on premium income to more flexible and creative arrangements. 'The cost to brokers of reinsurance run-off in the London market alone could be more than Pounds 1.1bn', says Mr David Corben, chairman and chief executive of Jardine Thompson Graham. 'The general squeeze on the rates of brokerage will continue and there may well be pressure for fees or negotiated commission.' Some brokers are further hampered by past, expensive forays into the underwriting arena. Alexander &amp; Alexander's ownership of Sphere Drake in the early 1980s is proving to be a costly mistake. Willis Corroon has laid its underwriting company, Sovereign, to rest and C E Heath has disposed of its companies, mainly in Australia. Sedgwick has recently recapitalised River Thames, but the decision surprised the market and cost the broker Pounds 25m. The shakeout in the insurance industry has created a market of fewer, larger clients. Brokers are therefore desperate to hang on to their existing clients and to engage in the bitter battle for new ones. But the sophisticated insurance company client base demands that brokers prove their worth. There is, after all, always the temptation to deal direct. 'It is no longer enough for a reinsurance broker simply to place a client's risk. Nowadays, the successful broker is a fully-fledged consultant who offers the client a whole range of skills and services,' says Mr John Pelly, chairman of non-marine reinsurance at Willis Corroon. Mr Corben agrees: 'The reinsurance broker of the future will provide a far more technical and knowledgeable service than has been the norm in order to add value to the process. He must be sufficiently trained to understand aggregations and be able to do some basic statistical analysis.' The insurance industry is often accused of living in the technological stone age, but reinsurance brokers are embracing technology as a means of offering their clients a bespoke service. Facilities such as CATMAP in the US allow brokers to analyse risk profiles down to the very last detail, ensuring clients buy a policy that exactly matches their risk exposure. This type of risk analysis by computer will come into its own if the trend away from proportional business towards excess of loss continues. 'An excess of loss risk or event is more difficult and complicated to analyse and rate than a proportional programme,' explains Mr Pelly. 'The broker who is up to speed and who can help the client calculate the extent of his exposure will steal a march on his competitors.' Brokers can also sharpen their competitive edges with security analysis. Client confidence in the reinsurance market has been eroded by a reduction in market capacity and by the troubles at Lloyd's of London. More and more clients ask more and more questions, down to the name of the lead underwriter on a Lloyd's syndicate. 'Clients want to know who is underwriting their risk and need to have the utmost confidence in the security of that underwriter,' says Mr Alan Williams, deputy chairman of Alexander Howden reinsurance brokers. 'It is the broker's job to vet security with an up-to-date system.' Networks, such as LIMNET and RINET and the Electronic Placing Support, a London market initiative due to go live on January 1 1996, should speed up the broking process and lead to a more efficient and cost-effective business. But brokers have mixed feelings. They have read the mandate to move with the times, but they look back with longing at the old ways. 'Technology is revolutionising the broking industry. But we should not be afraid of change if it enhances the service we offer our clients,' says Mr Williams. 'I do not believe that computers will replace face-to-face negotiations, certainly not with lead underwriters, they will simply reduce the amount of time and effort spent trudging round the market from one underwriter to another.' By streamlining the business, brokers hope to cut costs and promise to pass the savings on to their clients. The broker's raison d'etre is to serve the needs of the client. If there are fewer clients it stands to reason there will be fewer brokers. Some, particularly the smaller firms with scant resources, will not keep up with the pace of change. Those that do, should finish in better shape. Emphasis is now on the recruitment of high-calibre personnel who can put their shoulders behind the push for professionalism. But if client numbers are dwindling, brokers need to forage for new business. Although they refute the claim that they are creating markets, a number of the larger broking houses are pioneering developments in the burgeoning economies of eastern Europe and Latin America. The government of Kazakhstan, for example, has selected Alexander Howden to be its insurance consultant. Market conditions and client demand have forced the reinsurance broker to take a long hard look at the business he conducts and the way he conducts it. And these ever-flexible middlemen have responded to the challenge of change. They may take the occasional look back at the past, but they have always got at least one eye firmly on the future.</p>

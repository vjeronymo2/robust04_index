			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BREWERS' 18-0 WIN A CLUB RECORD  </P> <P> The Milwaukee Brewers recorded the largest shutout in the club's history today,  pounding out 20 hits and beating the Boston Red Sox 18-0 before a Patriots Day  crowd of 35,478 in Fenway Park.  </P> <P> Dave Parker and Greg Brock had four hits each, and Gary Sheffield, Edgar Diaz  and Brock drove in three runs apiece. Milwaukee had nine doubles and one triple  but no home runs.  </P> <P> Ted Higuera (1-0) allowed two hits in 6 1/3 innings as he won in Fenway Park  for the first time after five losses. Tom Filer and Dan Plesac finished the  combined three-hitter.  </P> <P> Mike Boddicker (1-1) gave up six runs and six hits in 2 1/3 innings, and Dennis  Lamp followed by allowing three runs and four hits in 1 1/3 innings. Rookie  Dana Kiecker allowed four runs in 1 1/3 innings, and Mike Rochford gave up four  runs in 2 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Every Milwaukee starter except Dale Sveum got a hit.  </P> <P> The 18 runs by the Brewers were one short of the team record, set against  Boston on May 31, 1980. The 18-0 loss was one run short of the biggest shutout  defeat for the Red Sox; Cleveland beat Boston 19-0 on May 18, 1955.  </P> <P> The major league record for the largest shutout was the Pittsburgh Pirates'  22-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 16, 1975. The American League  record of 21-0 was set by the Detroit Tigers against Cleveland Indians on Sept.  15, 1901, and tied by the New York Yankees against the Philadelphia Athletics  on Aug. 13, 1939.  </P> <P> Parker, who has hit safely in all five Milwaukee games, had three doubles and a  single. Brock doubled twice and singled twice.  </P> <P> Higuera, bothered by injuries last year, allowed only a single by Ellis Burks  leading off the fifth inning and a single by Tony Pena. He struck out three and  walked four.  </P> <P> Greg Vaughn had two doubles and a single and two RBIs, while Diaz drove in  three runs with three singles.  </P> <P> The nine doubles by Milwaukee were two short of the American League record set  by Detroit against the Yankees on July 14, 1934.  </P> <P> The Patriots Day game started at the traditional time of 11:05 a.m. to allow  fans to watch the latter stages of the Boston Marathon.  </P></p>

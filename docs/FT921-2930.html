			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / German N-power status denial Germany yesterday strongly contested the view expressed in a Pentagon study that it would seek to become a nuclear power, Reuter reports from Bonn. 'This scenario that Germany could one day in the future have its own nuclear weapons is not, absolutely not justified,' government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, said.

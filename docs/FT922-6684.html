			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Havas sees imminent growth in profits HAVAS, a leading player in French media and tourism, should return to profits growth this year after sustaining a fall in profits in 1991 according to Mr Pierre Dauzier, president. Mr Dauzier yesterday told an analysts' meeting in Paris that the group was on course for net profits of FFr1.2bn (Dollars 226m) in 1992. That would represent an increase of 10.8 per cent upon 1991 when profits slipped by slightly more than 6 per cent. Last year Havas was hit by the slowdown in the French advertising industry (where it is the dominant player as a result of its holding in the Eurocom group) and also by losses from its travel interests. The advertising slowdown also affected the performance of its free newspaper businesses. Mr Dauzier forecast static sales of FFr26.5bn for the group this year. He said he did not envisage a strong recovery in the advertising market this year, but did expect to see a modest improvement. In the coming years Havas is expected to increase the proportion of sales generated outside France from 30 per cent in 1991 to 50 per cent in 1995. Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utilities and industrial group, may reduce its 3.8 per cent holding in Havas, according to Mr Dauzier, who said he would look 'favourably' on the arrival of a new foreign partner as an equity investor. He saw this as a way of forging closer business links with international partners. Mr Dauzier confirmed that Havas planned to press ahead with a FFr1.8bn capital increase in mid-July to raise funds to continue its expansion in Europe. Perrier, the French mineral water company, saw its shares suspended in Paris yesterday while Nestle of Switzerland and Banque Indosuez of France, which are approaching the end of a fiercely-fought joint bid for the company, finalised details of a forthcoming offer to buy out Perrier's minority shareholders with the stock market authorities.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Ten good ideas A NEW London-based think-tank named Demos opened for business this week. I wish it well, for we are in need of fresh thinking and radical solutions if we are to escape the malodorousness and apathy that now blanket the northern hemisphere. (Things are far more cheerful in the southern hemisphere. I was there a short while ago - Bali, as it happens. They are all extremely well and happy in the southern hemisphere, working like the clappers, reaching for prosperity, sipping coconut and mango juice, doing a spot of wood-carving, selling rubbish to the tourists, making babies by the billion and generally canoodling and carrying on while we north of the equator slip deeper into stupor and depression). In particular, I hope that the mega-brains at Demos take a razor to the tottery institutions that are still clinging to power in places such as Britain, even as the millennium rushes towards us. Some weeks ago there was an article in The Times in which some old dodderer, some dangerously complacent relic, claimed that the only thing wrong with Britain was the recession; that it would be a blunder to tinker with the institutions - Parliament, the law, the monarchy, what have you - that had served us so well for hundreds of years. He couldn't have been more wrong, for what this interminable recession has done - I suppose we should be grateful - is expose the decaying hulk of poor old Britain to phosphorescent scrutiny. And what have we discovered? We have discovered that our institutions are riddled with the pox. That our ruling class has rabies. That our industry has evaporated. That Europe can't stand us and that the US now distrusts us. We need big ideas fast. Here are 10 improvements that the mega-brains at Demos may care to toy with: 1) Despatch the whole of John Major's cabinet, and most of the shadow cabinet, to one of the world's quiet places. If the electorate in all its thickness won't turf the government out, firm steps must be taken. Bhutan springs to mind. There is a shop in Bhutan called Dolly Tshongkhang Shop No 15 which (I have spoken to the proprietor) would happily employ most of these displacees, except John Smith. Bhutan will not touch him, so he can go to Paraguay. As the late Nicholas Ridley said shortly before his death, any half-way competent leader of the opposition should have winkled John Major out of Downing Street long before now. The only minister we will keep is Norman 'Hercules' Lamont, the one man in the cabinet who - by taking the flak for John Major's policies - deserves some respect. 2) Sack the House of Lords and abolish all titles. 3) Reduce the House of Commons to 250 MPs, none of them older than 40, and treble their salaries. 4) Introduce proportional representation and hold regular referenda, starting with Maastricht. The fiasco of Britain's attempt to ratify the Maastricht treaty shows how debauched our system and our politics have become. 5) Withdraw the vote from 80 per cent of the electorate. In future, the right to vote will be determined by a sophisticated equation related to property ownership, educational attainment and personableness. When I voted in the UK election last April I was horrified at the people trooping in and out of the polling station. They should never have been there. Just look at the result. 6) Sack the judiciary and most of the police, and fine all lawyers two years' salary. God, how we hate them. Ditto accountants. 7) Fine Queen Elizabeth II Pounds 10m every time one of her racehorses finishes outside the first three. She is supposed to be an expert on bloodlines, but her horses are famously dim and slow. This should prove a far swifter method for dismantling the House of Windsor than siphoning off dribs and drabs in income tax. 8) Slap a VAT of 700 per cent on all tabloid newspapers. That way, the neanderthal working class will be encouraged to start reading a better class of newspaper instead of wallowing in the smuttiness and jingoism that are sapping their lifeforce. As a corollary, ban Rupert Murdoch from setting foot in Britain and bust up his empire. 9) Sack Brian Clough as manager of Nottingham Forest. He has become a wretchedly stupid man. 10) Burn the place down; we need to start again.</p>

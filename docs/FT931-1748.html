			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / People: Barclays Bank Sir John Quinton, the former chairman of Barclays Bank, has combined his experience in lending with a return to his roots by becoming a non-executive director of the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society. He was born in Norwich and educated at Norwich School as well as going to university in Cambridge. Sir John, who retired as chairman of Barclays in December has since become non-executive chairman of Wimpey. His experience at Barclays, which is suffering from having made Pounds 2.3bn provisions against possible bad debts last year after an expansion in property lending in the late 1980s, is likely to come in useful at the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society. The society is 21st in size in the UK and is among those affected by the downturn in house prices in the southern housing market. It has placed emphasis on diversification into services such as stock broking to increase its commission income.</p>

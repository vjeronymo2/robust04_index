			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal rises 7.5% A SHARP increase in provisions for sour property and mining loans held Bank of Montreal to a 7.5 per cent rise in net earnings and a slight drop in return on equity for the 12 months ended October 1992. BMO, which is the first of Canada's big banks to report fiscal 1992 results, posted net income of CDollars 639.6m (USDollars 507.6m), or CDollars 4.76 a share, up from CDollars 595m, or CDollars 4.63, in fiscal 1991. Fourth-quarter earnings dipped to CDollars 159.7m, or CDollars 1.17, from CDollars 175.9m, or CDollars 1.35. Loan losses for the year are estimated at CDollars 550m, up from CDollars 337m. Non-performing loans jumped to CDollars 2.2bn on October 31 from CDollars 1.3bn a year earlier, due largely to the classification of what the bank described as three large real estate accounts, including Olympia &amp; York, as non-accrual. The bank said that the higher loan losses were offset by increased market share and higher productivity. Non-interest expenses rose by 6 per cent, but this included a 21 per cent rise in various government levies. BMO has gained a name over the past two years as being the first Canadian bank to announce cuts in its prime lending rate. Total assets stood at CDollars 109bn on October 31.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / US army drops Star Wars order THE US Army cancelled yesterday a Dollars 594m (Pounds 393.3m) research contract with McDonnell Douglas to develop and test a tracking system for the Strategic Defence Initiative, or Star Wars, anti-ballistic missile defence, Agencies report from Washington. The army said the shrinking defence budget forced it to withdraw the contract from the nation's biggest defence company and four big subcontractors. The move is a further sign of financial distress and delay for the proposed defence programme. The SDI has suffered a succession of financial setbacks in Congress in recent years. Legislators this year slashed from Dollars 5.4bn to Dollars 3.8bn President George Bush's request for 1993 research funds. Army officials said the contract was won by McDonnell Douglas in 1988 and that about Dollars 200m of the funds had already been spent.</p>

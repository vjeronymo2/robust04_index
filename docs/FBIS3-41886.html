Even when the former union was undivided and all  its nuclear electric power stations [AES] were operating  normally, insufficient orders could be found to operate the  plant and its production capacities to the full. The Chernobyl  catastrophe and the subsequent suspension of construction of new  AES power units for an unspecified time undermined the already  shaky economy of the enterprise. [Video shows workers handling  metal rods and components on a production floor]    Today its main output, components for nuclear reactors,  makes  up only 22 percent of its overall production volume. The plant  found itself unable to maintain its enormous auxiliary  capacities. When this happened three years ago it was decided  to shift them into independent organizations with their own full  measure of responsibility and an independent bank account. They  were told in as many words: So, if you want to survive, here is  the necessary minimum order from the plant, find the rest of  your profits yourselves. [video cuts to show Foshenko  interviewing V. N. Sukhoverkhov, general director of the  ``Atomenergomash'' Production Association]    [Begin Sukhoverkhov recording] My main task is  marketing. I mean looking for orders and markets for the  products of the enterprises comprising the production  association, now and in the future. I have absolutely no  interest in anything concerning the internal operations of these  enterprises. [end recording; video cuts to show a worker  handling automobile window glass]    So machine tools and equipment not related to the basic  needs  of nuclear power engineering appeared on the previously empty  production floors of the enterprise, which never did reach  design capacity. A wood processing shop began turning out  furniture; production started of glass for all types of  automobiles, including imported ones; a sausage shop, and a shop  for plastic goods were inaugurated; and a whole plant for  disposable syringes was built. [video again shows  Sukhoverkhov]    [Begin Sukhoverkhov recording] As far as our  prospects are concerned, they include the preparing the way for  the creation of new production facilities. We are seeking to  attract investors to build these new production facilities.  [end recording]    From a previously unified plant, six production groups were  formed. They remain, however, a single production mechanism.  Next year it is planned to double the number of these  enterprise.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Extracting the benefits from African oil - Sub-Saharan countries are short of training and investment capital ANGOLA IS a good example of the oil-producing potential of sub-Saharan Africa. Endowed with an estimated 4.9bn barrels of recoverable reserves, the country continued pumping during 16 years of fierce civil war, which officially ended less than a year ago. Oil kept the Angolan economy afloat. Now, with new offshore fields being opened to exploration and investment, and more than 500,000 barrels of crude being produced a day, Angola is consolidating its position as sub-Saharan Africa's second largest producer, after Nigeria. But such 'rich' developing countries have fears too, many of which were voiced this month in Luanda, the Angolan capital, at an oil and gas conference aimed at encouraging co-operation between African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations and the European Community. ACP oil producers are worried that a lack of adequate training, a shortage of international investment capital, and global environmental pressures may hamper their economic development. 'Countries with large energy resources can't always extract the benefits,' said Mr Fernando Jose Franca Van Dunen, the Angolan prime minister, in his opening address. 'If they are not accompanied by technical transfers, and proper support, more problems, more economic disaster and more poverty can be provoked. Give us help in drawing up inventories of our resources, teach us to exploit them rationally and give us some mechanism so we can solve our balance of payments problems.' At the same time, developing nations without natural energy resources - the majority of the 69 ACP countries - are concerned that in a capricious world oil market they may be hamstrung by their dependence on hydrocarbons. Their anxiety is well-founded: according to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa spends about one-third of its hard currency earnings on petroleum. Energy analysts say the concern should not be one-sided. The buzz-word of the Luanda conference - as at previous EC-ACP gatherings - was 'interdependence'. The developed north will simply store up trouble for itself for the future if it neglects the energy needs and concerns of the developing south, which - together with other non-OECD economies - is exercising an increasing influence over international energy policy. Mr Quincey Lumsden, a director of the International Energy Agency, warned delegates that in 10 years' time, important oil crisis management decisions could be taken beyond the industrialised nations' reach - not in Paris, where the IEA has it headquarters, but in Beijing, Brasilia or New Delhi. The EC's ability to meet the concerns of ACP countries with direct action is limited by its existing political and financial commitments. ACP oil and gas producers, for example, have long insisted that hydrocarbons should be eligible for special loans and export earnings stabilisation funds from the EC. Such assistance is at present provided for most commodities under the Ecu12bn (Pounds 8.4bn) Fourth Lome Convention - the EC-ACP trade and aid agreement - but oil and gas are excluded. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, told the Luanda conference that such wishes - reiterated by Angola's Mr Van Dunen and by Mr Ralph Maraj, foreign minister of Trinidad and Tobago (the only non-African ACP oil producer) - 'did not fall on deaf ears'. But realistically, the European Commission is unlikely to press for changes in the Lome terms to benefit a dozen developing nations that already have greater natural advantages than other ACP members. However, senior commission officials believe existing community initiatives  -applied both to EC members and to central and east European countries - do provide examples of ways in which the framework for energy development in ACP countries could be improved. Recent draft EC legislation to harmonise criteria for granting oil and gas exploration licences contains principles that could be applied to ACP countries. That would ensure equitable conditions for potential international investors, some of which complained at the conference that the contract terms being imposed by developing oil producers were too tough. The European energy charter - designed to help the former Soviet Union and eastern European states exploit their natural resources - could be extended or adapted to ACP countries. As the continued desire to invest in Angolan oil-fields during the civil war indicated, international companies will continue to drill for oil under the most difficult political circumstances. But an African energy charter would provide a level of security for international investors - and reciprocal guarantees for ACP and exploration companies - which would underpin economic development of the developing countries. An ACP-EC working group is now likely to be set up to continue discussion of the issues raised by the Luanda conference. Improved training is one fundamental problem that needs to be tackled, particularly in countries, like Angola, that have suffered severe disruption of regular education. As one aide to the Angolan energy minister put it during the conference, for African oil producers 'money is no problem - but there is a whole generation which has had little education or training'. Similarly, ACP countries are held back by inefficiency in the refining and distribution sectors. That pushes up costs in states that do not produce their own oil, and occasionally forces African exporters of crude to import petroleum products. Theoretical solutions do not always work in such cases: ACP delegates pointed out that the break-up of downstream state monopolies in procurement, refining and distribution - one approach advocated by Mr Miguel Schloss of the World Bank - is not on its own enough to encourage investment in decaying infrastructure. Perhaps the biggest issue the working group will have to tackle is the question of protecting the environment, which commission officials insisted should be a priority for the developing countries as it is now for most industrialised nations. ACP representatives were surprisingly reticent about the impact an EC energy tax might have on their future economic development. But there seems little doubt that if the commission's plans announced this month get the backing of EC members the poorer oil-hungry nations will break their silence.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo welcomes end of US trade threat Japanese government officials yesterday welcomed a US decision to drop the threat of trade sanctions against Japan. They hoped for a similarly positive outcome to the bilateral trade negotiations, still deadlocked only weeks before a US-Japan summit next month. US pressure on Japan to make a greater effort in pushing the bilateral framework talks forward is likely to increase when Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, stops over in Tokyo on his way back to Washington over the weekend. Mr Bentsen is to meet the Japanese prime minister and finance minister. The US cancelled the sanctions, which were scheduled to go into effect yesterday if Japan had not taken steps to open its construction market to foreign competition. The cancellation followed Japan's adoption of a plan to increase the openness and fairness of its construction market this week. Japan has also agreed to monitor, with the US, progress made by foreign construction companies in winning public works contracts. The two sides will conduct an annual review of such data as the number and value of public works projects which are open to competitive bidding, the number of foreign companies which are awarded such contracts and efforts made by foreign companies to win contracts. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said he hoped the US move to remove the threat of sanctions 'will have a favourable effect on the Japan-US framework talks toward the summit in February'. However, almost no progress has been seen in the key areas of contention between the US and Japan in their trade talks, despite the short period left before the summit on February 11, when the leaders of the two countries are expected to announce results on specific issues. On the crucial issue of opening up Japan's markets to foreign cars and car parts, Japanese bureaucrats have continued to resist US proposals for quantitative indicators which the Japanese consider to be numerical targets. The two sides also remain wide apart in other areas such as government procurement and deregulation of financial markets. The impasse has led to growing US impatience over what officials see as Japanese intransigence in the talks. An emergency meeting held on improving market access for foreign semiconductor manufacturers in Japan brought no progress. The US is unhappy that the share of foreign semiconductor companies in Japan has been falling for three quarters despite a bilateral understanding that there would be continued improvement.</p>

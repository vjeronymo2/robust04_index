			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / A hint of swagger Mr Neil Kinnock looks and acts like a 'dead cert' winner - just as he did in 1987. This time, however, the Labour leader and his fiercely protective entourage sniff triumph in the electoral breeze. They are acting accordingly. Motorcades with security back-up, fanfares, spotlights and VIP reception committees help create the impression that, after nine shadow years, Mr Kinnock is emerging into the light as the man of the moment. Hands held at holster level suggest a hint of the victor's swagger and the matey grin which sparks fury or affection remains broad, though Mr Kinnock is too scarred by experience to believe the battle is won. A spontaneous, cheek-kissing intimacy still breaks out from the calculated sobriety intended to show that here is a serious man up to serious job. His toe-caps sparkle but you just know he prefers trainers. The choreographers of a highly professional campaign have left very little to chance. That means limiting the opportunities for mistakes - there were none on the road in the first week - and maximising exposure for the party leader on terms dictated by a team dedicated to showing Mr Kinnock's best side. Secrecy surrounds every step of the way, partly because of security but also to ensure the Tories do not second-guess Labour's day-to-day campaign. There is, however, barely concealed delight within the leader's camp at keeping the press guessing, a game which helps create an essential aura of importance. The strategy can go too far. On Thursday, the pack set off for Birmingham. Asked by a journalist on board the battle bus if she knew the day's destination, the press officer merely replied 'yes'. The inquirer responded: 'Then you'd better tell the driver because no one's told him.' In 1987, Labour made it clear it believed the election would be fought in front of the masses on television and asked why it should assist a largely hostile written press with comparatively little influence. The party had a good point then and has a good point now. So far, contact with unvetted voters has been strictly limited and will remain so; when it is attempted, the public in any case risks being flattened by a moving mountain of broadcasting technology upon which the entire, bizarre exercise depends.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Oracle outbid for teletext licence ORACLE, the teletext company owned by the ITV franchise holders, has been ousted by an outsider, Teletext UK, in the bidding for a new licence. The Independent Television Commission announced yesterday that Teletext UK - whose shareholders are Associated Newspapers, Philips Electronics and Media Ventures International, a media investment fund - won with a bid of Pounds 8.206m a year in 1993 prices for the 10-year licence. As well as a national and regional service the company plans to provide local news, business and sports information for 15 cities on teletext - information broadcast in spare lines of the television picture. The service will be called Teleview. Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, and Philips Electronics, a pioneer of teletext technology, each hold 45 per cent of the ven-ture, with Media Ventures owning the final 10 per cent. The consortium also plans to offer a wide range of feature material. The Press Association, the national news agency, will provide the news for the service. The competitive tenders were a small-scale replay of last year's bids for ITV licences, with the franchise going to the highest bidder after a quality threshold had been met. In addition to the cash bid, the winning consortium has to pay 2 per cent of qualifying revenue for the first three years and 8 per cent for the remaining seven years. Oracle Teletext came second with a bid of Pounds 6.676m. Other bidders were TV-am Cable Television, Carlton Communications, and a consortium put together by Independent Television News. The ITC awarded an additional commercial licence for business users to Data Broadcasting International. The company was the only applicant and bid Pounds 25,000 a year.</p>

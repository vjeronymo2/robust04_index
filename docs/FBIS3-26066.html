He is expected to attend  the inauguration ceremony of Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station, to be held in Shenzhen's Daya Bay on 7 February.    Sources disclosed that Premier Li Peng has inspected  Guangzhou, Foshan, and Zhongshan so far. He went round the  cities in the evening to admire the light decorations and find  out about the market and the urban public's daily life as the  Spring Festival approaches.    It is learned that Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station, which is about to go into operation, is up to now  China's biggest Chinese-foreign joint-venture project, with a  total investment of about $4 billion. While Zhejiang's Qinshan  Nuclear Power Station, completed in 1991, was China's first  nuclear power generation base, the soon-to-be-completed Daya Bay  Nuclear Power Station, with two 900,000-kwt pressurized-water  reactor generating units, will bring China's nuclear power  industry to a new height.    Sources pointed out: Premier Li Peng has devoted a great  deal of energy to the construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Station. From the time when the site was being sought to this  day when the plant is about to go into operation he has  inspected the project a total of 10 times and gave clear  guidelines for every stage of the construction process. He went  on many observation trips to other countries and painstakingly  worked out strategies for initiating the nuclear power industry  in China. He clearly instructed: "Guangdong Nuclear Power  Station should consistently implement the principle of safety  first, quality first." The core project of Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Station started on 7 August 1987, that is, over six years  ago. Its annual electricity production will be about 10 billion  kwt-hours, which means, when it is combined with the  energy-conserving hydroelectric power plants in the province, a  total annual energy output of 12.6 billion kwt-hours. This will  greatly benefit the economy in Guangdong and Hong Kong.</p>

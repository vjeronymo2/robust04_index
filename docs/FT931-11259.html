			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Alcatel in Dollars 300m link with Sprint ALCATEL, the world's leading supplier of telecommunications equipment, and Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telephone company, have agreed to form a Dollars 300m turnover joint venture in data communications systems. The new company, Alcatel Data Networks, will sell equipment and systems to large public and private data communications networks, such as France Telecom's Transpac, already among the 300 network operators that form the partners' customer base. Other customers include telecommunications carriers, service providers, state agencies, international businesses, airlines and railways. This will be among the top two companies in the world in the specialised, but fast-growing, field of wide area data networks, or data communications between separate sites, said Mr Jozef Cornu, Alcatel vice-president responsible. It will have an estimated 25 per cent world market share, in competition against the data communications divisions of Northern Telecom of Canada, Ericsson of Sweden and Germany's Siemens. The European market for this kind of equipment is worth Ecu2.3bn per year in Europe and growing at 20 per cent annually, said Mr Cornu. Alcatel Data Networks, based in Paris, will be 51 per cent controlled by Alcatel, which is providing the chairman, Mr Pierre Guichet, and 49 per cent held by Sprint, but it will be jointly-managed. Sprint is expected to provide about Dollars 180m of sales in the first year, with the remaining Dollars 120m from Alcatel. It will employ 1,000 people, 700 from Sprint and 300 from Alcatel, drawn from the US partner's network systems department and the equivalent branch on the French side. The group will distribute each partner's products and provide both companies with the complete range for their own distribution. They will also co-operate on the introduction of equipment based on so-called asynchronous transfer mode, a way of speeding up transmission of pictures, voice and data along shared lines. 'This will allow us to increase our size and competitiveness in a key, growing market segment,' said Mr Cornu.</p>

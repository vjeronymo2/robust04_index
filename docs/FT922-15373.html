			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Tyne Tees makes Pounds 213,000 pre-tax THE STRESS in the UK's commercial television system showed again yesterday as Tyne Tees Television returned a pre-tax profit of Pounds 213,000 on turnover of Pounds 58m. This compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 5.77m on a turnover of Pounds 54.4m in 1990. The modest profit at the largest of the small ITV companies represented a considerable turnround compared with a first-half loss of nearly Pounds 3m. On Friday HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west, declared pre-tax profits of Pounds 441,000 on a turnover of Pounds 171m. From January when the new 10-year licences begin, Tyne Tees must start paying Pounds 15.06m a year plus 2 per cent of its net advertising revenue. The ITV company believes that in spite of the deep advertising recession there were signs of real revenue growth in the last quarter of 1991 and the trend had continued this year. 'We have good reason to believe that even modest revenue growth, together with our continuing tight control of costs and the reduction in levy will lead to a satisfactory result for 1992,' Sir Ralph Carr-Ellison, Tyne Tees chairman said yesterday. The company is sticking to forecasts that a pre-tax profit of more than Pounds 2m is possible for 1993 in spite of the relatively large size of the franchise bid. Mr Ian Richie, Tyne Tees managing director, believes that the regulatory changes - everything from no longer having to fund Channel 4 to a smaller levy and national network contributions based on ability to pay - will be worth around Pounds 10m a year to the company. Staff numbers have also been reduced from 553 in 1990 to 308. Mr Richie also hopes that Tynes Tees will be able to increase its share of advertising revenue from its present 3.2 per cent to something more accurately reflecting the north-east region's 4.3 per cent of consumer expenditure and 5 per cent of UK households. The extent to which Tyne Tees succeeds this year will give a significant indication of how the smaller ITV companies are coping with the consequences of competitive tenders for new franchises. Tyne Tees is recommending a final dividend of 9.5p making a total for the year of 14.5p compared with 19p in 1990. Earnings per share dropped from 36.19p to 1.65p.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SCHOOL DEADLOCK  </P> <P> California Assembly Republicans are holding up state budget negotiations until  they get more money for suburban and rural school districts. Their argument  that suburban and rural schools now share many of the problems faced by large  urban districts is correct, but their solution asks too much. They want to use  most of any uncommitted education money to catch up. State education officials  are working on new formulas that would help equalize spending but also  recognize legitimate big-city needs. That will take time, but it seems the  better approach.  </P> <P> Much of the approximately $17-billion state public school budget will pay for  basic costs of educating children and accommodating growth in enrollment.  Between $400 million and $430 million will be left after the basic costs are  covered.  </P> <P> Under the 1976 California Supreme Court Serrano decision, the state also must  move toward ensuring that all school districts receive equal amounts of money  for each student. There is apparent agreement among education officials and  legislators that about $150 million of the remaining funds should be spent on  continuing implementation of the Serrano decision. Districts like Alhambra,  Glendale, Garden Grove and Santa Ana would share the Serrano allocation, as  would Los Angeles schools.  </P> <P> Still unresolved is the question of how much of the remaining $300 million  should go to what are called categorical aid programs, such as extra help for  districts to transport handicapped students, improve programs for low-income  students, pay for special help for students who speak little or no English and  promote school desegregation. Assembly Republicans think the formulas for  special programs should be rewritten so that suburban and rural districts get  most of the money.  </P> <P> State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig agrees that suburban and  rural districts should get more of this money, but not all of it and not as  quickly as the Republicans want to get it. He thinks half of the money should  go to the special programs, using more up-to-date formulas. Another $110  million would be invested in reforms such as smaller classes; $40 million would  pay cost-of-living adjustments for other special programs. Honig also thinks  that funds earmarked for desegregation programs should remain separate, partly  because courts would not look with favor on their being mixed with funds for  redistribution.  </P> <P> There is no question that changing population patterns have put new financial  strains on suburban and rural districts. But urban districts have critical  problems as well. The state will have enough money this year to address some of  the needs of all sides only if all sides compromise on the question of how much  money is required and how quickly the needs can be met.  </P></p>

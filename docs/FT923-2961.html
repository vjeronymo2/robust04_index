			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Quarter measures So there it is. A quarter point cut in the German Lombard rate was less than many in the financial markets had hoped. The Bundesbank's move looks a little less niggardly when the half point cut in the discount rate is taken into account - not to mention the repurchase operation announcement which has taken a similar amount off short-term money market rates. But the overriding impression is that it acted only with considerable reluctance. In the end, the rate cut may have been the inevitable price for a deal to stop the run on the lira which had cost it DM24bn in intervention last week alone. Had intervention continued at that rate, it was bound to knock money supply growth further off course. By announcing Germany's intention to cut rates in advance, however, European finance ministers have made the Bundesbank vulnerable to suggestions that it has forfeited its political independence. That alone means the central bank will almost certainly want to restore its credibility. Barring a serious crisis in exchange markets, there seems little chance that it will cut rates again in the short run. Though the manufacturing side of the German economy is slowing, this is less true of the services sector. Money supply growth remains well over 8 per cent, and the government in Bonn still lacks firm control over its finances. It is thus too early to declare a definitive end to strains in the ERM. The lira closed last night well below its new ceiling against the D-Mark. Sterling climbed only 2.5 pfennigs despite support from the Bank of England. There still seems considerable risk of turmoil if this weekend's French referendum does go against the Maastricht treaty. Sterling might then turn out to be the exchange dealers' next victim. Doubtless the Bundesbank will then expect the UK to follow Italy's example in raising domestic interest rates before it looks to any help from Germany.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Lower seasonal demand, a drop in wholesale costs and heightened retail sales  competition combined to push gasoline prices down a full cent in the first week  of the new year, an oil industry analyst said. The national average price of a  gallon of gasoline was 98.04 cents, a cent lower than the price Dec. 16, said  Trilby Lundberg, whose Lundberg Letter regularly surveys pump prices at 13,000  service stations across the country. Prices at self-serve stations, where most  gasoline is sold, averaged 87.81 cents for regular unleaded, 104.08 cents for  premium unleaded and 84.41 cents for regular leaded. At full-service stations,  prices averaged 118.24 cents for regular unleaded, 129.69 for premium unleaded  and 114.78 for regular leaded.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Toshihiko Kashiwa] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Jan -- A Japanese-led consortium will be  formed for an oil-refinery modernization project in Kazakhstan,  a Central Asian nation. Nichimen Corporation will formally  conclude a contract with the Kazakh Government on behalf of  Japanese partners in the consortium. The total project cost is  estimated at $1.2 billion and the Japanese partners are likely  to win a more than $600-million contract. The Bank of Export  and Import of Japan is committed to extending $300 million in  loans to Kazakhstan and it is highly possible that Japan's trade  insurance will be applied for the first time to that country.  The Japanese Government and oil companies, that are eager to  diversify energy supply sources for Japan and increase Japan's  aid to former Soviet republics other than Russia, are eyeing  Central Asian nations that are rich in resources. The  oil-refinery modernization project is likely to provide an  impetus for improving relations between Japan and Central Asian  nations.    The Japanese partners in the oil-refinery modernization  project are three general trading firms -- Nissho Corporation,  Marubeni Corporation, and Itochu Corporation -- and Chiyoda  Corporation and JGC Corporation.    The Kazakh oil refinery to be modernized under the project  is  the Adeirau [name as published] Oil Refinery on the northern  coast of the Caspian Sea, which was built with U.S. aid. The  refinery, which went into operation in 1945, is highly obsolete.  The oil refinery is known to be capable of refining 6 million  tons of oil a year, but its capacity has dropped to 4.5 million  tons. The oil-refinery modernization project will bring its  capacity back to 6 million tons by replacing one refinery  facility with two oil facilities. The project also will improve  the oil refinery's productivity by raising the refining rate of  lead-free diesel and gasoline.    With regard to the project, Hydra Carbon Engineering [name  as  published], a French firm, and Ronald Service, a British firm,  that had continued to negotiate with the Kazakhs, concluded a  basic contract last summer. Later, however, the two European  firms were found to be unable to implement the project. For  this reason, the six Japanese firms and Fueros Tal [name as  published], a German construction firm, have been asked to  participate in the project.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> HELLS ANGEL LECTURES ON NEWS ETHICS  </P> <P> Just before his talk the other night, George Christie Jr. noted that he had  given a speech only once before: when he testified at his  solicitation-of-murder trial three years ago.  </P> <P> Christie, president of the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club,  was acquitted of soliciting the murder of a government informant. The not  guilty verdict was due in part to his ability to persuade a jury to trust him  and ignore preconceived notions about the motorcycle gang.  </P> <P> But Saturday night, Christie had the audience on his side even before he  stepped to the microphone and addressed the Ventura College Press Club.  </P> <P> About 50 aspiring journalists and professors cheered him when he spoke about  the power of the media and the need for morality in journalism. They laughed  when he talked about his run-ins with the law. They nodded in agreement when he  warned about the dangers of sloppy journalism.  </P> <P> "We are not the monsters that some people have created us to be," he said of  the Hells Angels. "Preconceived images are certainly a problem that I've had to  deal with."  </P> <P> Normally, the college invites an editor or reporter to speak at the annual  awards banquet, said Linda Wolf, office manager of the college newspaper. But  this year, staff members decided they wanted someone who had been on the  receiving end of news reports.  </P> <P> "We wanted to hear about reality," she said.  </P> <P> Christie has gotten both positive and negative coverage. The positive press  came when he raised $3,000 from his fellow bikers and ran in the 1984 Olympic  Torch Relay. The money was eventually directed to the Special Olympics in  Pottstown, Pa.  </P> <P> But Christie got less favorable headlines in 1987, when he was indicted and  later acquitted on charges of hiring a hit man to kill an Arizona prison  inmate. Federal authorities later acknowledged that they had faked the inmate's  death to entrap Christie.  </P> <P> Wearing a black leather vest with the Hells Angels logo emblazoned across the  back, Christie told his audience at the Doubletree Inn that the Angels had not  made a conscious decision to improve their image. They did, however, want to be  more accessible to journalists and the public, he said.  </P> <P> Christie has been interviewed for newspaper articles, by Mike Wallace for "60  Minutes" and by Regis Philbin for "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee." He said he  has turned down interviews with "tabloid" television shows, because, they tend  to exploit misery.  </P> <P> Some journalists have portrayed him as an honest family man, the target of  harassment by law enforcement officials, he said, while others painted him as  an outlaw.  </P> <P> Above all, Christie advised the aspiring journalists to be honest with the  subject of their news reports and to live by their own sense of morality. "If  you can look yourself in the mirror in the morning," he said, "you should be  happy with yourself."  </P></p>

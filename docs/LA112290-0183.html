			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE TO RAISE FEES FOR PARKING  </P> <P> The Santa Monica College Board of Trustees voted this week to double fees for  on-campus parking from $20 per semester to $40, beginning in the spring  semester, to help finance parking structures now being built.  </P> <P> "The district cannot afford not to do this," college President Richard Moore  said.  </P> <P> The higher fees, he said, will enable the college to repay what it borrowed  from the state to build the parking structures. Even with the rate increase --  which will affect students, faculty and staff -- the college district will have  to pay about $250,000 of the cost of the structures, Moore said.  </P> <P> Students who participate in the college's Rideshare program and car-pool with  at least two other students will be guaranteed on-campus parking and will pay  only $20 per semester.  </P> <P> Financial aid recipients will also pay $20 per semester. Rates for the summer  session will be half the regular semester rates.  </P></p>

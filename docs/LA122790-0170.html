			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> STEPHANIE HAYNES IS ON THE ROAD AGAIN  </P> <P> You think you were busy before Christmas. Singer Stephanie Haynes, who lives in  San Juan Capistrano, says she traveled "about 600 miles" making gigs during one  week in December, with a club date in Rancho Cucamonga on Sunday, the grand  opening of a Japanese nightclub in Torrance on Tuesday, a stop at Chadney's in  Burbank on Wednesday and a weekend engagement at a new nightspot, Central Park  West, in Brentwood.  </P> <P> The following week found her doing three nights in the Sheraton San Pedro's  Stingaree Gulch room with pianist Gildo Mahones. Talk about roadwork. She's  back in Orange County today at El Matador Restaurant in the Huntington Harbour  Mall with bassist Luther Hughes, keyboardist David Garfield and drummer Paul  Kreibich.  </P> <P> Of course, there's good reason why she's in such demand. Her warm tone, smart  sense of phrasing and a huge repertoire of jazz standards has won her  comparison to singers such as Irene Kral and Sarah Vaughan. "I've listened to  both of them a lot, but I don't consciously try to sing in their style," Haynes  said last weekend. "I think people hear certain qualities in my voice that  remind them of Kral, but your sound is God given. You can't really change it."  (And as for Vaughan? "Nobody has a voice like that.")  </P> <P> Singing came late to Haynes, who originally had designs on being a classical  flutist. But while studying the instrument at UC Santa Barbara, she began  hanging out with musicians who were into jazz and who played for parties and  dances. "They asked me if I could sing," she recalls, "and before long, I was  getting up to sing the only two songs I knew the words to: 'Misty' and 'Satin  Doll.' "  </P> <P> After moving to Albuquerque in the early '70s, she began working the local  scene. She returned to Southern California in 1974 and since has appeared in  clubs, restaurants and hotels all over the area.  </P> <P> "There was no real effort involved for me to become a singer," she said.  "Having a background in instrumental music made it easy. Singers have a pretty  bad reputation as musicians, but I had all the basics, how to count, how to  stay in key. . . ." She said she has no desire to return to the flute. "I've  never had the desire to play jazz on the flute. I've tried it and know how it  should sound, but I've got all that classical training to overcome. I hear  myself and say: 'No, that's not going to do it.' "  </P> <P> Haynes has come a long way from the days when "Misty" and "Satin Doll" were the  only songs she knew. The most recent of her two recordings, 1988's "Here's That  Rainy Day" (on Trend/Discovery with keyboardist Cedar Walton, bassist Al  McKibbon and drummer Billy Higgins) is a collection of Jimmy Van Heusen tunes  that includes well-known numbers such as "It Could Happen to You" and "Darn  That Dream" alongside such lesser known vehicles as "I Could Have Told You."  Live, she mixes familiar warhorses -- "I'm Old Fashioned," Duke Ellington's "I  Didn't Know About You" -- with Brazilian numbers such as Jobim's "No More  Blues."  </P> <P> Recently, she's been looking more to the Brazilians for material. "There's a  whole genre of modern Brazilian music that doesn't have the exposure it should  have," she said, citing composer-performers Ivan Lins, Milton Nascimento and  Leny Andrade, a singer who because of her scat skills often is called the  Brazilian Ella. "I'm open to any kind of music that sounds good to me. But  nothing sounds good to me unless it's coming out of the jazz tradition or it's  Brazilian. I hear pop music -- you can't avoid it these days -- but I don't  hear any that I like."  </P> <P> She thinks taste in music is a function of age. "The young haven't been exposed  to this kind of music; they don't have a consciousness of jazz being different  from any other form of entertainment. That has to be taught, but where do they  get the instruction? They'll pay attention to rock bands because they are blown  away by the volume and can involve themselves by dancing. But everything else  remains dressing for socializing, certainly not for listening."  </P> <P> Haynes will be going into the studio in January with pianist Alan Broadbent,  bassist Putter Smith and drummer Kreibich to record more jazz standards. On tap  are Freddie Hubbard's "Up Jump Spring," Sonny Rollins "Pentup House" and Benny  Golson's "Whisper Not" (with lyrics by Leonard Feather). She'll also begin an  open-ended, five-day-a-week engagement at Ron's in Palm Desert on Jan. 3 (a  stint at Ron's in Laguna Beach, with bassist Hughes, lasted 2 1/2 years). It  looks like, for Stephanie Haynes, next month will be as busy as this one.  </P> <P> Who: Stephanie Haynes, with Luther Hughes on bass, David Garfield on keyboards  and Paul Kreibich on drums.  </P> <P> When: Thursday, Dec. 27 at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: El Matador Restaurant, 16903 Algonquin St., Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Take the Valley View Street exit from the San Diego Freeway and  head toward the ocean. Valley View will turn into Bolsa Chica Road, which will  dead-end at Warner Avenue. Go right onto Warner until the next traffic signal,  where it intersects with Algonquin Street.

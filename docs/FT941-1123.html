			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: SAS cuts deficit to SKr492m Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a 35 per cent reduction in losses for 1993 and predicted it would return to profit this year. The airline, in the midst of a tough cost-cutting operation following the failure last year of Alcazar, the planned four-way pan-European airline merger, said pre-tax losses reached SKr492m (Dollars 62.3m) in 1993, compared with a loss of SKr760m in 1992. In spite of a more positive outlook for 1994, Mr Jan Reinas, the outgoing chief executive, strongly criticised the commission of the European Union for a recent report which proposed that big loss-making airlines in the EU should be allowed a further round of state subsidies. Mr Reinas, to be succeeded on April 1 by Mr Jan Stenberg, called the proposal unethical and complained that SAS was not competing on 'a level playing field'. SAS turnover rose to SKr39.1bn from SKr34.4bn as heavier international traffic lifted traffic volumes by 6 per cent. But operating costs grew more sharply than sales to SKr37bn from SKr31.5bn. Operating profit fell as a result to SKr249m from SKr1.4bn. The improvement in the pre-tax deficit was due mainly to a profit of SKr810m from the sale and leaseback of six Boeing 767-300 aircraft. Other sales, including two catering subsidiaries, raised a further SKr556m. SAS, jointly owned by Danish, Norwegian and Swedish companies in which each government has a share, faces further deregulation this year in the internal Nordic market. However, it said it should return to profit partly through the effects of a SKr3bn cost-cutting programme of disposals and 2,900 job cuts introduced since the collapse of Alcazar.</p>

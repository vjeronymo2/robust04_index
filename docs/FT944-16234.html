			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Management: How to recognise the British ex-pat - Executives who choose to live overseas One of the many consequences of the empire is that the emigrant British diaspora is amazingly widespread. Some countries such as the US, Australia and South Africa may have millions of British passport holders, a good percentage of whom regard themselves as ex-pats. The ex-pats can be found at the country club famous for its cheap gin and faithful retainers. But they can also be found in the local church, the Rotarians, the Women's Institute and the British Council. Others prefer either to blend in with the locals or keep to themselves. But how do the British adapt to living and working abroad? Are they uniquely effective ex-pats or is it true that, like American jokes and Bulgarian wine, they do not travel well? An ex-pat is usually defined as someone who makes the decision to live and work abroad. Many do not plan to be ex-pats but then find themselves in the role. How do they change over time? It seems that various ways of adapting are open to them. These different styles may change over time and indeed they may be more common in some countries than others. But most are immediately recognisable. Upwardly Mobile. These ex-pats soon discover that with some technical training, a western education, English fluency and a white skin they are top of the pecking order. In demographic speak a C2 is treated like an A or B socio-economic group member. Instead of being a servant, one has servants; instead of taking orders one gives them. Return becomes unthinkable because it means downward mobility. Sojourners. This group is more pragmatic with a long-term plan. They are abroad for a specific goal and usually a set time period. It may be to accrue capital to pay off a mortgage, or it may be to do one's duties in the company and earn promotion on return. They are strictly not ex-pats but are temporary sojourners on a foreign posting, although they usually mix with the ex-pats. Nomads. These are sequential sojourners in the sense that they pitch their tent in one country after another, apparently aimlessly. A new pasture seems all they are after for they follow no long-term plan. But the longer they are abroad the harder it is to go home. They are condemned to being the wandering albatrosses of the ex-pat world. Financially Trapped. This group has stayed too long at a place in decline. They do not have the option to return home because they are tied into a pension plan and indeed a weak economy. The financially trapped may be found in badly managed, newly independent countries where the currency has been chronically devalued. They cannot move or go home because they have no capital. Gone Troppo. This refers to the long-term ex-pats who have gone native. It is, of course, much more than becoming thoroughly acquainted with the language, the dress codes and the norms of the natives but a rejection of one's own values. It can sometimes look pathetic and may be induced as much by a love of alcohol and adultery as the values and behavioural norms of the local culture. The Never Lefts. The most odd reaction is that of the ex-pats who behave as if they have never left Sunningdale. They may be marooned in a tropical paradise, but they are slavishly faithful to their old way of dress, food, social behaviour. They maintain the style and preferences of the country they left which now no longer exists. In some places the ex-pats exist as if nothing has changed since the great days of the empire. They are happy to be abroad so long as the natives are waiters and drivers. They may have a deeply ambivalent attitude to the mother country and the thought of coming home. To re-pat the ex-pat is indeed a significant challenge. Adrian Furnham is Professor of Psychology at University College London.</p>

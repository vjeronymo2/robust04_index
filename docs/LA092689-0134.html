			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORT CRITICIZES ARIZONA UTILITY SDG&amp;E HAD HOPED TO MERGE WITH  </P> <P> Tucson Electric Power, the utility that San Diego Gas &amp; Electric had hoped  to merge with in 1988, has repeatedly ignored its customers while attempting to  reward its managers and shareholders, a recent Arizona Corporation Commission  report claims.  </P> <P> TEP has shown an "emphasis on shareholder and management compensation and  disregard for its customers," according to ACC Hearing Officer Jerry Rudibaugh.  TEP has "a very unhealthy attitude for a regulated company," Rudibaugh  concluded. The comments were part of a 70-page report that recommended against  granting TEP a 31% electric rate increase. Rudibaugh recommended that TEP's  rate increase be limited to 11.6%.  </P> <P> The report was welcomed by some local observers who believe that San Diegans  would be better served if SDG&amp;E abandoned a proposed merger with Southern  California Edison and resurrected last year's aborted merger with TEP.  </P> <P> Although the report hits hard at current and past management, it does not take  issue with the fact that TEP is a relatively small utility with a short-term  glut of generating capacity and a highly desired web of transmission lines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Even Better Bargain  </P> <P> "I would be concerned . . . if Tucson were to take over SDG&amp;E," said  Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San  Diego-based consumer group. "But if SDG&amp;E were to take over Tucson, they'd  take over the resources and transmission lines that are available, not the  management team."  </P> <P> "If Tucson Electric Power was a good bargain last year, then it's an even  better bargain this year," said Peter Navarro, a University of San Diego  professor and chairman of Prevent Los Angelization Now, a San Diego-based  consumer group.  </P> <P> The proposed merger with TEP, which was announced in June, 1988, fell apart in  November shortly after Rosemead-based Southern California Edison made a  surprise bid for SDG&amp;E. TEP was unwilling to get involved in what was sure  to be a long and costly effort to fend off Edison's bid.  </P> <P> Reopening negotiations with TEP "is the single most important thing the City  Council could be doing, outside of its regulatory hearings," Navarro said  Monday. "It's very important that the council send an emissary to both the  regulatory authorities and the company in question to explore that  possibility."  </P> <P> Navarro believes that San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor should "get on the phone  to (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom Page's equivalent at TEP" to determine if the  utility wants to reopen merger talks. Council members could then "pass a  non-binding resolution recommending that SDG&amp;E reopen discussions," Navarro  said.  </P> <P> Although Shames and Navarro want merger talks reopened, they have found little  support at the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC has not included an  SDG&amp;E/TEP merger in a list of scenarios that regulators will study along  with the proposed merger between SDG&amp;E and Edison.  </P> <P> As part of their review, commissioners have ordered the utilities to explain  what would happen if the merger were not completed and what would occur if  SDG&amp;E were simply to buy power from Edison rather than merge. "We've been  pushing for (a second look at the TEP merger) but the commission is reluctant,"  Shames said. "I think it's a viable scenario. In fact, it's more viable now  than it ever was."  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E spokesman Dave Smith declined to comment on the Arizona commission  report.  </P> <P> Rudibaugh's report is but one step in a complex rate-making procedure that the  Arizona utility must complete before adding generating plants and other  facilities to its rate base. Shareholders would be forced to make up the  difference if regulators determine that a new facility would not benefit  ratepayers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Select Decisions  </P> <P> TEP has taken several actions that are counter to the interest of TEP  customers, according to Rudibaugh, who has recommended that the commission trim  TEP's $80-million rate increase to $57 million.  </P> <P> His report hit hard at those select decisions. "We cannot and will not permit  ratepayers to pay for unneeded power resulting from imprudent decision,"  Rudibaugh stated.  </P> <P> Rudibaugh also has demanded that TEP shareholders absorb $850,000 in management  bonuses because the company's "management compensation already exceeded the  industry average." In a related development earlier this summer, Einar Greve,  TEP's former chairman unexpectedly resigned just days after selling most of his  TEP stock.  </P> <P> Rudibaugh also took issue with TEP's plan to have customers absorb the  $32.5-million purchase of a coal mine. Rudibaugh determined that the mine  purchase was "imprudent. . . . It is not clear that it will ever be used to  benefit ratepayers."  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Investcorp funds Thorn buy-out: Management of lighting division has options to increase 3% stake in new independent company after Pounds 162m sale to Bahrain-based investment bank THORN EMI yesterday confirmed the sale of its Thorn Lighting division for Pounds 162m to Investcorp, the Bahrain-based international investment bank, in what is effectively a management buyout. Investcorp, which owns stakes in Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany in New York, Gucci of Italy and other European and US businesses, has asked the Thorn Lighting management to take an initial 3 per cent stake in the business. Mr Philip Buscombe, of the Investcorp management committee, believed Thorn Lighting's 'rightful place' was as a quoted company. The investors would be seeking a flotation in the medium term. As with its sale of Kenwood Appliances and Thorn EMI Software to their managements, Thorn EMI will retain a stake in the new Thorn Lighting company. The parent company will receive Pounds 137m in cash, a 12 per cent equity stake, worth Pounds 8.7m, and Pounds 16.3m in subordinated loan notes. The sale leaves Thorn EMI with a Pounds 43m post-tax exceptional charge. A Pounds 44m book profit is more than offset by an Pounds 87m goodwill write-off. The charge on this deal will be counter-balanced by a Pounds 34m exceptional profit on the sale of its stake in Thames Television to Pearson. Thorn Lighting's launch as an independent company coincides with a sharp downturn in the continental European economies, where it makes about half its sales. But Mr Hamish Bryce, chief executive, said the company was gaining market share in Germany and France. It would grow through the introduction of new products and by cutting costs. The management team, which is investing Pounds 800,000, will be able to increase its 3 per cent equity stake. Investcorp has granted options to the 30 managers which could raise their stake to about 13 per cent. Mr Buscombe said this was a feature of most of the 47 deals the bank had done in the 10 years since it was founded. Investcorp would be managing the investment of its Arab backers, rather than managing the business. 'One of the secrets of what we do well is not to get involved with management,' he said. Investcorp was established in 1982 by Mr Nemir Kirdar, an Iraqi businessman, who brought investors together within the six Gulf Co-operation Council countries. It has tended to lead buy-outs of companies - the largest of which was the Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) acquisition of Saks Fifth Avenue, the US department store chain - and then place stakes with Arab investors, managing the stake on a discretionary basis. The group is on the point of purchasing Circle K, the bankrupt US convenience store chain. After that deal and the purchase of Thorn Lighting, it says it will have been involved in transactions with a total acquisition value of Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 4.2bn). Investcorp's last sizeable deal in the UK was the purchase of the largest single stake in Computacenter, the UK systems integrator. Lex, Page 24; London SE, Page 44</p>

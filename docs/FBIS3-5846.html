			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The reason the Electronic Industries Association of  Japan compiled a report on the Japanese industry's position on  the Japan-U.S. semiconductor issue, and distributed it in the  United States, is that it wants to prevent the issue from  reemerging as a bilateral political controversy.    Since foreign semiconductors have succeeded in taking up 20  percent of the Japanese market, as provided in the Japan-U.S.  semiconductor agreement, the Japanese electronic industry claims  that "we already maintain a good relationship with the U.S.  industry." It has so far remained calm. However, the  possibility remains that the U.S. Government, which now takes a  tough attitude toward Japan in economic issues, may again take  up the semiconductor issue.    The semiconductor industry has not shown signs of being  affected by the U.S. Government's recent revival of the Super  301 provision (on the identification of and sanctions against  countries guilty of unfair trade practices) of the U.S. Trade  Act, and the tension in bilateral relations. While the share of  foreign semiconductors has shown some decline since 1993, U.S.  makers have been making moderate remarks all along -- such as:  "We believe our company's share in Japan will continue to grow.  We do not have any complaints against Japan" (according to a  Motorola executive).    In fact, the U.S. semiconductor industry's hands are quite  full with meeting the U.S. market's booming demands. It has  limited capability to supply the Japanese market. This is in  great contrast to the past situation when both the U.S.  Government and industry were unanimous in their criticism of  Japan.    Nevertheless, the U.S. Government may still take up the  semiconductor issue because semiconductors are a model case for  setting numerical targets, which is the key issue in the present  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, and this is being used as a  "tool" in the overall negotiations. The share of foreign  semiconductors in the fourth quarter of 1993 will be announced  in mid-March, to be followed by bilateral semiconductor talks at  the government level.    Earlier this month, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry  Association [SIA] issued a report saying the share of foreign  semiconductors in Japan will be 25-30 percent in 1996. While  "this is merely a forecast, and is not a demand being presented  to the government" (according to a SIA official), the  semiconductor agreement is scheduled to be reviewed in the  second half of 1994, and there is a possibility that the U.S.  Government may make this a new demand.    As the semiconductor issue is facing a delicate political  timetable, the important thing is to make sure that face-saving  measures will be ready for the U.S. Government, which has  "brandished its fist." Although the U.S. industry does not seem  to have any misgivings about the semiconductor issue, it is not  in a position to go against the government's wishes.    At a news conference given by the U.S. and Japanese  semiconductor industries in June 1993, a Texas Instruments  executive stated that "it is better not to have government  intervention"; he was said to have incurred the U.S.  Government's ire. Later, the SIA "revised" its comments and  claimed that it "supports the Clinton administration's  result-oriented trade policy."    Therefore, the Japanese position at present is to try to win  the U.S. Government's understanding while working to prevent the  setting of new market-share targets -- which would be the worst  scenario for Japan -- and, at the same time, seek new forms of  bilateral cooperation, such as "design-in" (joint development  from the design phase).</p>

Lashing out at Nauru, he compared its size to that of a  glass  of water and said it was a Pacific nation with no honorific  greetings or genealogy.    His assault on phosphate rich Nauru came just two weeks  after  Nauru President Bernard Dowiyogo was here for independence  anniversary celebrations.    Tofilau was referring to an incident in 1980 when, under a  previous government, claims were made that Nauru had funded  opposition political groups. As a result of the claims, Nauru  promptly withdrew its investments in Samoa, resulting in an  apology from the then government of Prime Minister Tupuola Efi,  who is now Opposition Leader and is known as Tupua Tamasese Efi.    The most senior member of the opposition Samoa National  Development Party present in the house, Ulualofaiga Talamaivao  Niko, said Monday's remarks by Tofilau were "childish and  stupid" and would have a damaging impact on relations with "our  brothers in the Pacific."    "If we look down on Nauru because of the size of Nauru, how  would we feel if countries bigger than Western Samoa did the  same? ...I'm very ashamed.</p>

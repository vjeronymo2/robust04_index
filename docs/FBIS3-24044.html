			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lidija Sabajevaite: "Who Usurped Radio and </F> Television?"]    [Text] No matter the occasion--whether it's from the Seimas  rostrum, or in the press, or at get-togethers--those on the  right are complaining that they do not have an opportunity to  express their opinion on the radio or television.  Simultaneously, the LDDP is accused of having usurped the  aforementioned means of information and of implementing a Soviet  era policy, when there was one set of speakers and one truth.    So that we might better comprehend those on the right, let's  return to the recent past. From the very moment that the  independence of our state was restored, they had unlimited  opportunities for presenting information. The right of all  representatives of the national government to have precedence in  using Lithuanian Radio and Television on issues pertaining to  their duties was fixed in article 6 of the Charter for  Lithuanian Radio and Television. This is why we watched  "Atgimimo banga" ["Wave of Rebirth"] each week, which was  gradually converted into a platform for government  representatives from the right side of the political spectrum;  on many an evening we listened to the speeches of always the  same politicians. Television acquired its "talking heads"  appellation.    Representatives on the left side of the political spectrum,  who made up an insignificant minority in the Supreme Council,  were unable to make use of the Article 6 right. They were  chastised as "enemies" by the "patriots", so it was not  permissible for the people to remember that they existed.  Besides that, all the air time was divided up among "one's own".    After the relationship of political forces in the government  changed in the wake of the Seimas elections, the Radio and  Television Board proposed relinquishing Article 6. Since this  elicited tempestuous dissatisfaction on the part of the right,  the Seimas education committee made the decision to give each  political party air time proportionate to the number of members  it had in the Seimas. The right, which had initially concurred,  later reconsidered and abandoned this proposal, demanding that  the opposition be assigned a special weekly slot of air time.  Then the majority of Seimas members supported the Radio and  Television Board proposal not to allot special slots to any  political party, nor to the opposition or the government.    Does the fact that neither side has its own program mean--in  the words of those on the right--that the LDDP has usurped the  radio and television?    People of various political persuasions work on the Radio  and  Television Board, but most of them do not belong to political  parties. Does the presence of 2 LDDP representatives and 1  social democrat in a body of 16 members really constitute  domination by the left?    According to the Radio and Television Charter, the board  establishes the political and cultural strategy for broadcasts  (II. sec. 9.4.). The representatives of the right, e.g., S.  Saltenis, N. Ozelyte, V. Landsbergis, and others criticize the  board's work, accusing it of inaction, lack of national topics,  etc. It may be that the board is not sufficiently active, but  that is the fault of its own members, one of whom is N. Ozelyte.  I also do not like all the broadcasts that are on television and  radio; however, I believe that those responsible for the poor  work are the specific people who prepare those broadcasts.    How much and what kind of political information is presented  is a different matter. It is perhaps possible to say that the  broadcast programs confine themselves to quite narrow  commentaries. In addition, those invited to comment are people  whose opinions on most issues have been known for a long time.  What is missing are some markedly more diverse opinions,  educated dispute, and most importantly, serious and objective  analysis of political events. This I believe is essential,  because it would help people orient themselves with respect to  rather complex international as well as domestic events. There  are enough qualified political scientists in Lithuania, who, if  invited to appear on radio or television, could help form the  country's political culture.    Do the representatives of political parties or the  opposition  have absolutely no opportunity to use the radio and the  television?    In listening to daily radio programs, e.g. "Aktualijos"  ["Topical Issues"], one can almost always hear the voices of  well-known politicians from the right. There has never been an  instance when only representatives of the left talked about  political events on the informational television broadcasts,  especially on the program "Naujienos. Nuomones" ["News and  Opinions"]. We also see representatives of both sides on special  political broadcasts.    It is possible, of course, to understand the annoyance of  active politicians from the right, since they can't make use of  state television in the same way that they make use of the  "Tele-3" studio. But those on the left should be even more  disappointed, because they have to be content with only the  attention of journalists from state television.    Therefore, assertions that the LDDP has usurped radio and  television are fabricated. If we were to consider it usurping  that we frequently see the president and the prime minister on  our television screens, then we would also have to term as  usurpers of our television the heads of other countries, who are  shown during the overview of international events.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (4): Leap to an interactive future - John Thackara analyses the technological challenge for design The development of interactive information and communications systems is the greatest challenge and opportunity for design since industrialisation. The opportunity for design lies in developing products, or 'content', to match the scale of the investments being made in the infrastructure: as much money will be spent on networks between now and 2000 as was spent on all telephone systems and equipment since Alexander Graham Bell invented them. Penetrating this gigantic new market, however, will require a cultural shift within the design business; much of the industry still suffers from a tendency to operate in relative isolation from its clients, and believes that a 'design' is a finished product or environment or piece of print - not something intangible such as an interactivity programme. Some designers are adapting faster than others to a new business environment transformed by new technology and process re-engineering. Architects seem to have accepted that the market for lofty, disengaged aesthetes has been superseded in a world of smart buildings regarded by their owners not as large objects but as information systems. Architects have espied a niche for an expert in the building team who represents the building's final user - who has the added ability to orchestrate coherence and quality in the finished building. Industrial designers in manufacturing face even more dramatic changes as the distance between the producers of products, and their users, shrinks. Sophisticated distribution and logistics systems, computer integrated manufacturing and design technologies, new materials, and direct marketing, have changed fundamentally what it means to 'design' a product. The heroic industrial designer of legend, epitomised by Raymond Loewy, was trained with a basically linear model of manufacturing in mind: he (rarely she) inputted a 'concept', and various engineers and marketing types produced and sold the product. Today, multi-disciplinary, process re-engineered teams juggle multiple inputs from consumers, widely distributed production facilities, and intelligent distribution and retailing systems. Competitiveness is based on the effectiveness of the innovation process as a whole. The product designer  -like the architect - can no longer deliver competitive products from the splendid isolation of the atelier. The idea of collaborative innovation, and shared creativity, with users, designers and producers creating new products together, is the most exciting feature of what pundits are calling the New Economy - and potentially the most profitable. At the moment, less than 5 per cent of the Dollars 60bn a year spent by its 580,000 researchers on R&amp;D in Europe makes it to the market in the form of a product or service which someone can buy. (And less than 1 per cent of that Dollars 60bn is spent learning how to spend it.) But economists have discovered that commercial performance is determined more by the quality of interaction between research scientist users - and this does not mean passive customers stuck behind one-way mirrors to 'try things out'. Such one-sided relationships between a company and its clients - the user reacts, he or she does not propose - are being superseded by 'envisioning laboratories' - environments in which users can play with new technologies before an application has been packaged as a finished product. Companies such as Xerox are designing research centres with multi-media capabilities in which customers, supported by advanced programming tools, can quickly model the consequence of re-configuring products and systems. Mr John Seeley Brown, Xerox's research chief, explains: 'It is not enough just to tell people about some new insights from the lab. You have to get them to experience it in a way which evokes its power and possibility. Put another way, we are trying to prototype a use before we prototype a system.' Pre-prototyping user needs has obvious benefits even in traditional 'hard' product development, where design decisions tend to be irrevocable once tooling and production investments are specified. When the whole technological environment is novel - as it is with interactive computers and communications - the ability to involve users in the design and simulation of new applications is even more valuable. Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) points out: 'At the beginning of the century, people who invented new media were the users: photography was invented by photographers, cinema by film makers. This intimate coupling of the inventor and the creative user only disappeared with the invention of television and, later, computers. Its disappearance was needless.' Today, even the most gung-ho of the American telephone companies and media giants agree that unless more content, or 'programming', is developed for their much-hyped infobahnen - highways of the mind - they will not go very far as a business. All that is on offer so far is video-on-demand and tele-shopping - decidedly banal electronic versions of existing human activities; hardly the stuff of which new civilisations are made. So where are ideas for new needs to come from? However well envisioning labs engage with groups of users, someone has to provide an aesthetic stimulus - throw ideas into the ring - to provoke genuinely fresh thinking. This is where design can provide a cultural function as a bridge between industry and artists who are interested in technology but suspicious of big business. Intellectuals and artists have been preoccupied by the implication of information technology for some time. For avant garde media artists in particular, the notion of the interface has replaced the finished artwork as the main object of enquiry, but few computer scientists (or even marketers) have the faintest idea how exciting (and even marketable) some of these ideas can be. Design can be a useful mediator in breaking down the isolation from each other of artists, computer scientists and users, and in promoting the fruitful interaction between them which may just yield the new concepts and applications needed to fulfil the promise of the new technologies. The need for such bridge-building between industry and artists is not new. It was the main mission of the Bauhaus 70 years ago. The original Bauhaus foundered on the rock of elitism and exclusivity: the news media - inclusive of users as well as designers - may mean that a design-based Electronic Bauhaus becomes Europe's secret weapon.

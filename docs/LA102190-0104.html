			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LATE MISCUE PAVES WAY FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY VICTORY  </P> <P> Perhaps Antelope Valley College could have engineered a last-minute drive for  the winning field goal.  </P> <P> But as it was, good fortune intervened on the Marauders' behalf in a 21-14  victory over host San Bernardino Valley in a Foothill Conference game Saturday  night.  </P> <P> With 1 minute 27 seconds left and the score tied, 14-14, a bad snap on a San  Bernardino punt from the 30-yard line gave the Marauders a first and goal just  inside the Indian 10-yard line.  </P> <P> Punter Steve Price tracked down the ball but immediately was leveled by Rick  Starling.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley (6-0-1, 4-0-1 in conference play) ran the ball three  consecutive plays, scoring on Steve Miller's five-yard run over right tackle  with 34 seconds left.  </P> <P> "We weren't thinking field goal at that time," said Miller, who rushed for 72  yards in 23 attempts. "We just wanted to score a touchdown."  </P> <P> After playing to a 14-14 standoff in the first half, neither team mounted a  serious threat in the second half until the errant Indian snap.  </P> <P> San Bernardino (2-5, 1-4) drove to the Antelope Valley 35-yard line on its  initial possession of the second half, but Starling recovered an Obie Cooper  fumble.  </P> <P> Until the last two minutes, Antelope Valley's deepest penetration was to the  San Bernardino 48-yard line, but that drive fizzled when a pass by Marty  Washington (seven of 16 for 38 yards, two touchdowns) was intercepted by Derek  DeWitt at the Indian 33.  </P> <P> "We had a little luck tonight," Miller said. "But we always thought we had a  chance to make something happen."  </P> <P> After being stung for two touchdowns -- and falling behind 14-0 -- in the first  quarter, Antelope Valley regrouped in the second quarter and tied the score,  14-14, six seconds before halftime.  </P> <P> The tying touchdown came on a 15-yard pass from Washington to Tony Simmons (84  yards rushing in 17 carries), but it was Daron Rodgers' recovery of quarterback  Anthony Strickland's fumble at the San Bernardino 22-yard line that set up the  score.  </P> <P> Washington's pass to Simmons came on a broken play as the redshirt freshman  from Grambling State was chased out of the pocket before hitting Simmons at the  15-yard line. From there, Simmons juked a couple of Indian defenders to get  into the end zone.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: St Gobain reports sharp advance Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, almost trebled first half results, lifting net profits from FFr452m in the first six months of last year to FFr1.26bn (Dollars 239m). The sharp increase, above most analysts' forecasts, reflected improved economic conditions in most of the group's markets, lower financial charges and the positive impact of restructuring measures taken over the past two years. The performance was welcome news for the company, whose shares have been hit over the past few weeks following the investigation of its chairman, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, as part of a corruption probe. The investigation, involving one of the company's subsidiaries, is one of several to affect leading French industrialists over recent months. The improved result was achieved on sales of FFr38.04bn in the first half of 1994, compared with a figure of FFr35.74bn in the same period in 1993. Operating profits rose from FFr2.34bn to FFr3.5bn, while financial charges fell from FFr930m to FFr735m. Turnover rose strongly on the American continent, and started to show a similar revival in Europe, according to the company. Last year, Saint-Gobain was badly affected by depressed demand in the construction and automobile sectors. The company said all of its principal operating divisions had seen a significant increase in results, with the exception of piping. This activity saw stable results, reflecting weak demand in the European water sector. Industry analysts predicted that the strong performance would continue in the second half of the year. They said that results would be boosted by exceptional gains of about FFr900m resulting from the sale of its paper and packaging activities to Jefferson Smurfit of Ireland. The sale of its Cellulose du Pin division was part of a strategic plan aimed at focusing the group on its core activities - glass, building materials and ceramics. Proceeds of the FFr5.6bn disposal will also combine with a FFr3.6bn capital increase in March, to sharply reduce Saint-Gobain's debt. This stood at FFr15bn at the end of last year.</p>

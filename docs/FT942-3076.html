			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: NFC It looks as though Mr Peter Sherlock's honeymoon period as chief executive of NFC is over. Yesterday's 10 per cent fall in the shares after interim figures only marginally below consensus expectations suggests the market is growing impatient for his restructuring of the company to bear fruit. The new business put on in the UK during the first half may well take time to show through to profits. But it is striking that both turnover and profits were virtually flat in UK transport and logistics at a time when the recovery was supposedly gathering pace. Indeed profits would have fallen across the group as a whole without the smaller loss at the peripheral Lynx parcels division and the increase in the pension credit, whose future depends on actuarial whim. Maybe the share price would have been spared yesterday's shock in the days when NFC used to make routine profit forecasts, but it is unlikely to outperform till Mr Sherlock delivers the goods.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PAKISTAN SAYS IT BEAT BACK AN ATTACK BY INDIA  </P> <P> The government said today its armed forces repulsed an attack by Indian troops  along the cease-fire line that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir,  officials said. India denied the claim.  </P> <P> The Defense Ministry said the attack on a remote observation post in the  Himalayas occurred Sunday, the day after talks ended between the two countries  to ease border tensions.  </P> <P> Defense officials said Indian troops used heavy artillery, anti-tank guns and  mortars in an attempt to capture an outpost on the KEL sector in  Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.  </P> <P> The outpost is located about 60 miles northeast of Muzzaffarabad, the capital  of Azad (Free) Kashmir.  </P> <P> "Our forces repulsed the attack and inflicted casualties on the intruders," the  official said, but he gave no figures.  </P> <P> In New Delhi, a spokesman for the Indian government denied any fighting had  occurred.  </P> <P> "It's not true," said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing  rules. "We have not attacked. We have not used any artillery. We have not  suffered any casualties."  </P> <P> Skirmishes and small arms fire are frequent along the cease-fire line, but  Sunday's assault marked the first time that heavy artillery has been used, the  Pakistani defense official said.  </P> <P> The Defense Ministry said India's attack was reported to U.N. military  observers in India and Pakistan and that defense measures have been  intensified.  </P> <P> The official said the use of heavy artillery and mortars was an attempt to  escalate the situation along the line of control to try to divert world  attention from a Muslim secessionist movement in Indian-held Kashmir, the  agency said.  </P> <P> The uprising, which has claimed more than 950 lives since late January, has  heightened already uneasy tensions between predominantly Hindu India and Muslim  Pakistan, which were created along religious lines in the 1947 partition of the  subcontinent.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO MONITOR PROP. 146  </P> <P> On Election Day, officials of the Santa Ana Unified School District will be  paying close attention to the fate of Proposition 146, an $800-million  statewide school construction bond measure that could give the district some  much-needed financial help to build new schools.  </P> <P> Last week, the district's school board unanimously passed a resolution in  support of the measure and later complained about the lack of attention the  proposition has received.  </P> <P> "It's ridiculous that the way a proposition gets passed has to do with the  amount of money in the campaign war chest," school board President Audrey  Yamagata-Noji said. "We don't have another viable funding measure, and passage  of this proposition is critical for us in this community."  </P> <P> Only about $35,000 has been available to run the statewide campaign for the  proposition, said Peter Birdsall, campaign manager of the Sacramento-based "Yes  on 146" campaign.  </P> <P> "It's a very low figure to deal with," Birdsall said. "That amount is only a  little more than what it costs to run a 30-second commercial on prime-time  television."  </P> <P> The district, the largest in Orange County with 43 schools, is in the midst of  a $225-million school construction program that has schools being built at a  rate of about two per year.  </P> <P> The new schools are needed to house a student population that has been growing  at a rate of about 1,000 students annually. The district has added hundreds of  portable classrooms to school sites and has placed some schools on a year-round  calendar to ease overcrowding.GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

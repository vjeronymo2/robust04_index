			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Eytan Rabin and Nadav Shragay] </F>   [Text] Last weekend, Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander  of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in Judaea and Samaria,  instructed the commander of the Hebron battalion to ask Uri  Qrasan, the security officer of the Jewish settlement in Hebron,  to provide him with specifics regarding the measurements and  weight of all the mobile homes in Tall al-Rumaytha. Qrasan was  also asked to estimate the number of people that can,  theoretically, occupy each such home (probably to determine the  number of settlers that can barricade themselves in the homes  and oppose evacuation). Qrasan has given the Army his answers.    The Hebron settlers believe the request indicates that the  IDF is attempting to prepare a contingency or practical plan for  the evacuation of the site, where seven families currently  reside.    The curfew on Hebron and its surroundings will be lifted  today or tomorrow at the latest. The curfew was imposed on the  city three weeks ago, immediately after the Cave of the  Patriarchs massacre. The decision to lift the curfew was made  after a series of discussions in which the participants heard  reports about the distress of the Palestinian population. At  the same time, fear was expressed that once life in Hebron  returns to normal, riots might erupt and clashes between the  Army, the residents, and the settlers might take place.    Before the curfew is lifted, additional IDF and Border  Police  troops will be stationed in Hebron.    The Tomb of the Patriarchs will not be opened to the public  at this stage. The IDF is currently working out new procedures  and security measures for the site, including separate entrances  for the two nationalities. It has already been decided to  prohibit bringing arms into the tomb. Security sources believe  that riots will break out when the curfew is lifted. If the  riots evolve into serious incidents, the curfew will be  reimposed.    The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and  Gaza has begun preparing for the possibility of the government's  ordering the IDF to evacuate the Hebron settlers. The  settlement leaders have contacted groups in Qiryat Arba' and  other settlements in a bid to thwart the evacuation. They plan  to call thousands of people to Hebron once they learn of an  imminent evacuation.    Seven families currently reside in Tall al-Rumaytha: The  family of Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, who is currently wanted  after an administrative detention order was issued against him;  the family of David Shir'el, whose gun was taken from him; the  Ra'anan family (headed by the grandson of Rabbi Avraham Hakohen  Kook); the family of Uri Qrasan, the Hebron Jewish settlement  security officer; the Ben-Yitzhaq family; and the Horowitz  family [six families named as published].    The rising tension in Hebron and the fear of terror attacks  have led the General Staff to decide to cancel the training  schedules of infantry units and deploy them for active duty in  the territories and Lebanon. For example, a combat unit that  has just completed a tour of active duty in Lebanon was about to  begin a series of exercises. By order of Major General Dani  Yatom, commander of the Central Command, the soldiers were sent  for active duty in the West Bank. The same has happened with  other military units.    A senior military source said: "Everyone is waiting for the  big bang. Canceling training schedules is not good, but  everyone is under pressure. We are expecting an Arab  retaliation. No one is happy about canceling drills and  exercises, but this is dictated by the reality in the field."</p>

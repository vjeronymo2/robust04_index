			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Finland cuts base rate to protect fragile shoots of recovery: Hugh Carnegy examines prospects for an export-led end to prolonged recession FINLAND yesterday cut its base rate from 7 to 6.5 per cent in an effort to lift the economy out of deep recession and to sustain emerging optimism for recovery. The rate cut applies to many domestic mortgages and loans dating back several years when these rates were set officially. Most market rates in Helsinki are now around 7 per cent compared with 17 per cent last autumn. Finnish interest rates in general are among the lowest in Europe. Falling interest rates have lifted optimism over the Finnish economy which has contracted by 10 per cent since 1990. A two per cent rise in GDP is forecast in 1994, largely on the basis of rising exports. Exports are expected to rise by more than 12 per cent this year and almost as much in 1994, fuelled by a sharp devaluation in the Finnish markka late last year and falling real wages at home. These two factors have combined to give Finnish companies greatly improved competitivity. Finland, along with Sweden, has carefully avoided re-pegging its currency to the Ecu, because devaluation has boosted competitiveness of the wood and paper industries, both dominant factors in the economy. 'We think we are close to the bottom,' said a finance ministry official, but there is a grim realisation in Helsinki that the recovery is likely to be fragile and painfully slow. Any upturn in the economy has to offset a catalogue of difficulties stemming from the loss of trade with the Soviet Union, a slump in world markets for its forestry products and the of collapse of a borrowing-led domestic bubble at the start of the decade. The finance ministry has already revised downwards its original forecast of 3.5 per cent growth next year. Above all, persistently rising unemployment, presently standing at around 18 per cent of the workforce, is not expected to peak until 1994. Forecasts which officials admit are optimistic see the jobless rate still above 12 per cent in 1997. Export growth may wipe out the current account deficit next year, halting the rise in foreign debt which is now approaching 50 per cent of GDP. But a rise in exports has so far produced little impact on employment as Finnish manufacturers are heavily capital intensive. The paralysed domestic economy has also yet to respond to falling interest rates. The trend has been for companies and individuals to repay borrowings. Latest official forecasts see overall consumption falling by four per cent this year and a further 3.5 per cent in 1994, while investment is set to decline by more than 11 per cent this year, the fourth successive year of decline. Nor is the government able to provide fiscal stimulus. The cost of unemployment benefit, debt servicing and bailing out the banking system, coupled with falling revenues, has taken the budget deficit to near 10 per cent of GDP.</p>

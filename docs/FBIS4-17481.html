			<p>BFN     [Text] Kharkov, 24 Apr -- Former vice prime minister  Volodymyr Lanovyy said at a news conference on 23 April: "My  candidacy for the post of Ukrainian president at the forthcoming  elections is supported by Rukh [Ukraine People's Movement for  Perestroyka], the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Democratic  Party of Ukraine, the Party of Social Justice, the Green Party,  the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine, and the Peasants Party  of Ukraine." Leonid Kuchma, whom Volodymyr Lanovyy considers  not to be a strategist, has the highest rating among the  contenders for the presidential seat and this is caused  exclusively by the "empty stomachs of Ukrainian citizens."    Mr. Lanovyy said that it is planned to create a new  parliamentary faction in the new Supreme Council which would  unite the political forces of the center right and center left  as well as part of the party of power that is market-oriented.  The basis for such a faction would be formed by nonparty  democratic deputies. In the event of an understanding on the  part of market-oriented deputies, the size of such a faction  could be 130-150 persons.    Mr. Lanovyy noted that with regard to carrying out market  reforms, the new composition of people's deputies would be more  liberal than the old one.    Mr. Lanovyy's position concerning the Black Sea Fleet is:  "The transfer of part of the Black Sea Fleet is a transfer of  bases and therefore of the infrastructure, i.e. of territory.  Apart from that, it is unwise and even criminal to settle  economic debts with means of defense." The former vice prime  minister expressed support for a parliamentary republic as the  best form of statehood for Ukraine. A strong, and even tough  presidential power should exist in the transitional period.  Personally, Mr. Lanovyy would immediately combine two posts:  those of the president and the prime minister.</p>

During the meeting, his majesty stressed to the minister the  need for Arab coordination, as well as the need to revive  solidarity and unify the stands and views of the Arab brothers,  particularly at this critical phase in the life of the Arab  nation. He said the challenges facing the nation dictate that  efforts and energies should be pooled together to ensure the  minimum level of Arab solidarity and coordination that would  benefit all peoples of the nation, strengthen the ties existing  among them, and protect the interests of the nation and its  future generations.

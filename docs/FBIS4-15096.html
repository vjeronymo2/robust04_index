			<p>BFN     [Text] As a top Black Sea Navy officer has reported to  INTERFAX, tension is mounting in the Crimea.    He linked this primarily to the Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov's current unofficial visit to Cyprus, where he has been  kept from returning. As he explained, the presidential plane  cannot leave Cyprus because the Turkish authorities have not  given permission for its flight over their air space. The most  likely reason for their refusal is that the flight has been  requested later than is stipulated by Turkish legislation.    As a spokesman for Meshkov's administration has reported,  presidential aides in Simferopol have asked Russia's Foreign  Ministry to help settle the affair.    "Meshkov's plane was registered in Ukraine. This means that  no one but the Ukrainian authorities should interfere," a senior  Russian Foreign Ministry official explained. The authorities  could easily do so since the Ukrainian Embassy in Ankara has  been functioning for two years now, he added.    Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy,  accompanied by a unit of national guards, arrived in Simferopol  without any preliminary agreement with the presidential  administration. Some other Ukrainian generals are now in the  Crimean capital. Among them -- a deputy chief of staff and  senior security and intelligence officers.    The Chief of the Ukrainian Air Force Headquarters Anatoliy  Lopata is in Sevastopol for inspection. The Ukrainian  President's Military Adviser Vladimir Petenko is also in the  Crimean port.</p>

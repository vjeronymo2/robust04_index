			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Lost survivors of the Serbian solution SOMETIMES Nenad stands for hours on the main square of Karlovac, an elegant nineteenth century town located south of Zagreb, the Croatian capital. There, in the bitterly cold, damp, winter fog, he waits for news about his mother and two sisters. He has had no word of their whereabouts since May 26, when Serb paramilitary units entered his home in the village of Kamicani, northern Bosnia. 'I was arrested on that day. I don't know why. All the men in the village were rounded up and moved to the camp at Keraterm. In early June we were moved to the Omarska camp. All I know is that my sisters and mother were taken away to the sports hall near Prijedor, in the north of the republic. I have heard terrible reports about rape, but I do not want to think about it,' he said. Nenad, aged 22, was dressed in a jumper, jeans, and anorak provided by the International Red Cross. He has no other belongings. Nor has he got a home to which he can return. 'My father was forced to sign away our house. He has disappeared. The entire village has since been destroyed,' he said slowly, in a calm, soft voice. He spent 72 days at Omarska, and then, along with hundreds of others, was transferred to Manjaca, in northern Bosnia. 'That camp was very bad,' he explained. 'Many people were murdered, often in cold blood. There were massacres, carried out on front of our eyes. For a while about 20 or 30 people were killed each night. Their bodies were piled upon each other. The next day they were sometimes burned. At times I could not bear it.' He paused. He lowered his eyes, and then he started to cry. 'I want to be with my family. I want to live in peace. Please help us,' he said, placing his hands over his wet face. Nenad is just one of 3,000 former detainees, most Moslems, from Manjaca, who were finally released by Bosnian Serb forces in December. Many have similar stories to tell. Yet none feels bitterness or anger towards the European countries. 'We are not blaming Europe in the way they treat Bosnia. Europe is not guilty. It is we who are the guilty ones because we were too peaceful. We should have armed ourselves. All we ask now is for weapons,' said Rusmir, a 43-year-old craftsman. After negotiations with the Croatian government in November, the International Red Cross set up a transit camp for the former detainees of Manjaca - the only camp throughout the entire former Yugoslavia  - with the hope of resettling these homeless people in a third country. So far the response from the international community has been abysmal, according to Mr Alf Nordstrom, one of the main Red Cross co-ordinators in Karlovac, a former Habsburg garrison town. 'These poor people have nothing left,' he said. 'Many countries promised to resettle them, but there have been a series of broken promises. 'These people are the victims of ethnic cleansing, yet the west is turning a blind eye to this inhumanity. Have we learned nothing from the second world war?' The release from Manjaca camp has brought small relief to the former inmates whose helplessness contrasts sharply with the sounds of Christmas festivities from the Croat restaurants behind the square. Many do not want to be resettled without first being reunited with their families. Besides, most want to go home to Bosnia. 'It is my home,' said Haris, a 33-year-old car mechanic. But Nenad does not want to think about going home. 'Home is with my mother, and siblings, regardless of the country,' he said. The Red Cross officials have no idea about how to reunite families who have been forcibly divided. 'We do not know where the women and children are,' said Mr Nordstrom, a Swede, who arrived in Karlovac three months ago to help the refugees. Every day hundreds of young and old men gather on the square waiting for news of their relatives. On December 17 a bus bringing detainees from Manjaca arrived in Karlovac. Some women refugees who had managed to escape to Croatia travelled to Karlovac to see if their sons, husbands, or brothers were among the released. 'My children were not on the bus,' wailed Amira, a 53-year-old mother of four sons. Local Bosnian Serbs had stoned the bus as it crossed the border into Croatia. Every day Amira travels from a refugee camp the other side of Zagreb to see if her family will ever be reunited. But nobody can offer her hope, particularly in her case because she is the mother of a family of doctors and engineers. 'It is hard to explain the process of selection,' said Nenad. 'In Omarska, for instance, the Serbs separated the professionals and the wealthy men from the manual workers. These were my neighbours. I never saw them again.' Adil, a 45-old doctor, said he was lucky to be alive. 'Do you know about Katyn, when the Russians killed the cream of the Polish professional class during the second world war?' he asked. A crowd of young and middle-aged men had gathered around, and listened in silence as Adil continued. 'The way the Bosnians were categorised reminded me of that. It is as if, when all this is over, there will be no solid professional or civil class to rebuild our society. I do not think the Serbs had a solid method or plan. But the way they selected people and then took them away makes me believe that they tried to prevent us from ever again creating a professional elite. Do you know what I mean?' Nenad was still crying.</p>

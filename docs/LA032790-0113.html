			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON REVIEW INSISTS B-2, C-17 PLANES ARE ESSENTIAL;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: SECRETARY CHENEY WILL BE BRIEFED ON THE ANALYSIS. IF HE AGREES, HE  WILL GO TO BAT FOR THE WEAPONS DESPITE FIERCE OPPOSITION IN CONGRESS.  </P> <P> Senior Pentagon management officials plan to recommend that the United States  proceed with production of the B-2 Stealth bomber and the C-17 transport  aircraft and continue work on two futuristic fighter-bomber aircraft, defense  officials said Monday.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, they are expected to offer Defense Secretary Dick  Cheney options for trimming the B-2 and C-17 program in light of pressure to  respond to changes in the East Bloc and new fiscal constraints.  </P> <P> The B-2 is being built at the Northrop Corp.'s Palmdale plant, and the C-17 at  McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Long Beach plant.  </P> <P> The Pentagon is nearing completion of its sweeping review of the four weapons  systems, which collectively account for more than $200 billion in planned  expenditures. Cheney is scheduled to receive briefings on the review, which he  ordered in early January, on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Cheney is expected to make his decisions on the review's findings by next week.  If he accepts the review's conclusion that the projects are essential, he would  give them a major boost despite intense opposition in Congress.  </P> <P> According to published reports confirmed by defense officials, the review has  concluded that changes in the Soviet Bloc have not undercut the military's  basic need for the $70-billion Stealth bomber program and the $37.5-billion  C-17 cargo plane, as well as for the Air Force's and Navy's future-generation  warplanes.  </P> <P> However, in his briefing to Cheney, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood  is expected to outline options to delay or scale-back production programs for  the B-2 and C-17. Both are already in production but face uphill battles on  Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> The review also reaffirms an earlier finding in which the military said it  needs the Air Force advanced tactical fighter and the Navy A-12 attack  aircraft, according to reports published in the authoritative defense industry  publications "Aviation Week and Space Technology" and "Defense News."  </P> <P> The review panel's conclusion that the military rationales for the planes have  not changed is certain to spark intense controversy in Congress. Lawmakers who  are eager to reap a "peace dividend" from shifts in Eastern Europe have said  the Pentagon can now cancel some of its costliest initiatives, including the  B-2.  </P> <P> However, if Cheney adopts the reviewers' options for scaling back the programs,  he might blunt the growing congressional movement to halt the B-2 after  Northrop builds the 16 aircraft for which funds already have been approved.  </P> <P> The results of the "Major Aircraft Review" reflect the widespread reluctance  among Pentagon officials to declare the military changes in the Soviet Union  and Eastern Europe as irreversible and to scale back defense programs  accordingly. Cheney, who is one of the Bush Administration's leading skeptics  toward the Soviet Union, has argued fervently against major program  cancellations in the face of changes throughout the Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> In a recent speech, Cheney said that as a result of the review, "we may end up  modifying the (B-2) program itself in terms of the rate at which we buy  aircraft or the total number, total size of the buy." The Air Force maintains  that it needs 132 B-2 bombers, at about $530 million each, to accomplish its  missions in case of nuclear war. Under congressional orders, however, the  Pentagon is investigating the costs and consequences of producing between 33  and 99 of the bomber aircraft.  </P> <P> At a recent meeting with reporters, John A. Betti, undersecretary of defense  for acquisition, said that the review has been designed to offer Cheney a "menu  of options." Betti, who has largely guided the review, said that a group of  fewer than 100 Defense Department officials has gone "back to ground zero, if  you will, and (is) thoroughly evaluating requirements.  </P> <P> "It is clear in all our minds that we're not going to stick with everything we  started with," Betti added.  </P> <P> But while Betti said that cancellation of any of the programs is "always  available" as an option to Cheney, defense officials said that cancellation  will not be one of the options the review committee will offer the defense  secretary.  </P> <P> That is largely because the Defense Intelligence Agency and the review group's  senior policy-maker, Paul Wolfowitz, have not significantly changed their  assessment of current or future Soviet military capabilities.  </P></p>

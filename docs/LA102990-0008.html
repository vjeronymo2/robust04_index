			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> Your editorial makes a good case for voting for Bannister. But another issue  comes through loud and clear.  </P> <P> Garamendi has been in Sacramento for 16 years. He has run for governor and  state controller. And he's going to continue to try for various public offices  until he gets into one in which he is incompetent. (The Peter Principle at  work.) He's part of the problem, not the solution. He's got the political and  fund-raising connections to trample an unknown like Bannister no matter how  well-qualified for office the latter individual may be.  </P> <P> Garamendi is an example of why we need term limitations. Holding public office  should not be a lifetime career.  </P> <P> MARTIN PARKER, Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

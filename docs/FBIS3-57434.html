The satellite carries Russian-made equipment to obtain  meteorological and gelio-geophysical information, as well as a  French-made Scarab device to measure radiation balance of the  earth and a German-made Prare navigation system to measure  parameters of the spacecraft motion.    The satellite was put into the orbit with the following  parameters:    -- the initial period of rotation -- 109.4 minutes;    -- the maximum distance from the earth surface (in the  apogee) -- 1,221 kilometers;    -- the minimum distance from the earth surface (in the  perigee) -- 1,198 kilometers;    -- the inclination of the orbit -- 82.6 degrees.    The on-board equipment is functioning normally. The  control-measurement complex controls the satellite's flight.    Information from the Meteor-3 satellite is received by the  Russian Federal Service for Hydro-Meteorology and Environmental  Monitoring for processing and use.    Alongside with the satellite, they launched a German tubsat  small detached satellite to test the system of precise  orientation with the help of star and solar sensors. Parameters  of its orbit are close to the parameters of the Meteor-3.    The Meteor-3 launch commemorated chief designer V. Adasko.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Value engineering studies should follow the systematic problem-solving process defined by the VE job plan. Value engineering studies should be performed using a team consisting of individuals from different disciplines, such as: Design, construction, environment, maintenance, planning, right-of-way, and other specialty areas depending upon the project being reviewed. Individuals from the public and other agencies may also be included as team members when their inclusion is found to be in the public interest. The study leader should be trained in VE, understand the VE process, and be able to serve as the coordinator and facilitator of the VE team.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Studies should be employed as early as possible in the project development or design process so that valid VE recommendations can be implemented without delaying the progress of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Each study should conclude with a formal report outlining the study team's recommendations for improving the project and reducing its overall cost. As a part of the formal report process, a presentation of the VE team's recommendations should be made to upper management and documentation of the presentation included with the final report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The VE program should include procedures to ensure that the VE recommendation approval process involves appropriate reviews and concurrences from applicable staff offices, such as: Design, construction, environment, air quality, safety, materials, traffic operations, right-of-way, and other offices when the proposed VE change impacts their specialty areas. All reviews by external staff offices should be performed promptly to minimize delays to the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The VE program should promote the development and submission of VECPs by construction contractors, provide for their prompt review, assure their prompt approval or disapproval and, if approved, assure the implementation of the proposed changes. State highways agencies shall include a VE or cost reduction incentive clause in their standard specifications or project special provisions that clearly allows construction contractors to submit VECPs. This clause should include a provision allocating, by percentage, the cost savings that is to be shared between the agency and the contractor. States should retain the right to accept or reject all VECPs and acquire the rights to use accepted VECPs in current and future projects without restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

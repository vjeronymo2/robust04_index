			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDER IS MURDER . . . REGARDLESS  </P> <P> Regarding Howard Rosenberg's May 13 article about Kirstie Wilde, the former Los  Angeles news anchor: I am curious as to why Wilde underscored the crazed  heinousness of John Gacy's crimes by noting he was not just a garden-variety  mass murderer but a "homosexual mass murderer!!" So, mass murder committed by  heterosexual persons is more indicative of a healthy personality?  </P> <P> KAREN AITCHISON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

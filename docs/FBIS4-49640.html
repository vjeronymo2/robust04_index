			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 6 May (XINHUA) -- During a forum this  morning between mainland-based members of the Preliminary  Working Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee for the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], and local  deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] and local  members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, Lu Ping, PWC vice chairman  and secretary general, delivered an important speech on several  current issues which are being universally followed by the Hong  Kong people and deliberately misguided by the British Hong Kong  authorities.    Speaking of the "through train" issue, Lu Ping said: We had  originally hoped to solve the "through train" issue for members  of the last British Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco]  through negotiations in accordance with relevant NPC provisions.  Because the British side has shut the door tight, Sino-British  talks on arrangements for the 1994/95 elections have broken  down, making it impossible to realize the "through train"  concept; this is certainly not what we had hoped for. However,  Mr. Chris Patten does not believe that there will be no "through  train" after 1997. I would like to advise him not to cherish  any illusion about that. By 1 July 1997, we will form anew the  first SAR legislature according to the Basic Law and relevant  NPC provisions.    Lu Ping said: The relevant NPC decision explicitly states  that the last Legco should be constituted in conformity with the  Basic Law and the provisions of the decision if it is directly  to become the first SAR legislature; otherwise, there will be no  premise for a direct transition. Also, the NPC decision  authorizes the SAR Preparatory Committee to draw up specific  methods for constituting the first SAR legislature in accordance  with the Basic Law. The methods encompass such issues as how to  delineate electoral districts for direct elections along  geographical lines, what election methods will be adopted, what  new functional constituencies will be introduced, and how to  constitute the election committee.    Lu Ping said: The British Hong Kong authorities proposed the  "constitutional reform package" in 1992, and are now proposing  another amendment plan. The Chinese side was never consulted on  the amendment plan, which is simply unacceptable. In the  future, we will surely act in accordance with the Basic Law and  the NPC decision. We believe that this will by no means cause a  stir in Hong Kong, and will surely facilitate the realization of  smooth transition.    Lu Ping went on: The "through train" is a single unit; there  is no question of a through "carriage." No illusion should be  cherished about this. On 1 July 1997, all members of the last  British Hong Kong Legco will get off the train. This is for  sure, and there is no doubt about that.    On district organizations, Lu Ping stated emphatically:  Neither the NPC decision nor the Basic Law provides for  allowing the British Hong Kong district organizations to make  the transition beyond 1997. To be sure, we are hopeful that the  British side will cooperate with us so that the district  organizations will also make the transition beyond 1997.  Unfortunately, the British side has shut the door tight in this  respect, causing a breakdown of Sino-British talks on the 1994  elections for district organizations. Therefore, there is also  no question of a "through train" in this matter.    Lu Ping said: The last British Hong Kong Legco can only be  a short-lived one, with just another 22 months to live. When  considering the methods for forming the first SAR legislature  and district organizations, the PWC will certainly listen fully  to the opinions of various sectors in Hong Kong and make every  effort to ensure a smooth transition. Nevertheless, we cannot  compromise on matters of principle. The principle is: Given  the breakdown of Sino-British talks, the last British Hong Kong  Legco cannot become the first SAR legislature and the British  Hong Kong district organizations cannot become district  organizations in the SAR.    Lu Ping said: The PWC invited relevant civil servants from  the British Hong Kong Government to this forum in Hong Kong for  a briefing; this was a good thing because it could help solve  some problems. However, the British Hong Kong Government  boycotted the PWC by not allowing the civil servants to come in  contact with the PWC. This shows a lack of sincerity on the  part of the British Hong Kong Government to cooperate with the  Chinese side in other fields.    Lu Ping reiterated: The PWC's door of contact and  cooperation with Hong Kong's civil servants is always open, and  our invitation remains valid.    Lu Ping said: The British Hong Kong Government has signaled  its intention to cooperate with the Chinese side in other  fields. However, in the words of Vice Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen, verbal statements offer no guarantees.  Practical actions should be taken, and we should "listen to  what a person says and watch what he does." Lu Ping stated:  The Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament, in its  report, recognizes in no uncertain terms that Britain's policy  toward China, Hong Kong included, has undergone fundamental  changes; this means moving from cooperation to confrontation.  We have not yet detected any sign of sincerity about  cooperation or any gesture of cooperation on the British side.  While the Chinese side is willing to cooperate with the British  Hong Kong Government in other fields, it cannot compromise on  matters of principle. The British Hong Kong Government must  show genuine sincerity about cooperation.    Someone asked: Some people have called for the creation of a  human rights commission in Hong Kong. What comment does the  Chinese side have on this proposal? Lu Ping replied: According  to the concept of these people, the commission will be an organ  of power. However, it will not be part of the executive organ  prescribed in the Basic Law, a legislative organ, or a judicial  organ. According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's executive organ  includes the Audit Department and the Independent Commission  Against Corruption. The Basic Law also contains explicit  provisions concerning the legislative and judicial organs.  Hence, the creation of a human rights commission will obviously  contradict the Basic Law and destroy the entire framework  established by the Basic Law.    Lu Ping said: Since the human rights commission will be an  organ of power, it will necessarily erode the power of other  organs and cause instability in Hong Kong. He asked in return:  Will there be no guarantees for human rights in the absence of  a human rights commission? Britain does not have a human rights  commission; it does not even have a human rights law. Are there  no human rights in Britain? Proponents of a human rights  commission are like "drinkers whose intentions lie not in the  wine" [people with ulterior motives].    In response to a demand that the Chinese Government  regularly  report to the UN Human Rights Commission on the situation of  human rights in Hong Kong after 1997, Lu Ping said: China is  not a party to the two human rights conventions and has no  responsibilities or obligations whatsoever to report to the UN  Human Rights Commission. Hong Kong is not a political entity,  and it is not qualified to report to the UN Human Rights  Commission. The Basic Law explicitly states that those parts of  the two human rights conventions that apply to Hong Kong will be  implemented through Hong Kong's local laws after 1997. In other  words, the two human rights conventions cannot be applied to  Hong Kong directly. A consensus was reached on this point when  the Basic Law was drafted.    Lu Ping said: Hong Kong citizens will enjoy broad-based  rights after 1997, for which the Basic Law provides full legal  guarantees.    Replying to a question on the SAR Government's land fund, Lu  Ping stated: Every cent of the land fund belongs to the future  SAR Government. Chinese representatives to the Sino-British  Land Commission, acting in accordance with the mandate given by  the PRC Government, is responsible for the fund's collection and  safekeeping, as well as for the preservation of its value, in  their capacity as trustees. After 1997, the SAR Government will  administer the fund.    Lu Ping said: Annex III of the Joint Declaration explicitly  states that upon the entry into force of the Joint Declaration,  half of the income earned by the British Hong Kong Government  from land transactions shall be left to the future SAR  Government. Because the SAR Government will not be established  before 1997, Chinese representatives to the Sino-British Land  Commission, in their capacity as trustees, are now responsible  for the collection and safekeeping of this portion of income, as  well as for preserving its value. The Sino-British Land  Commission will be abolished after 1997. Hence, the PWC's  economic affairs panel has suggested transferring the land fund  to the SAR Government after 1 July 1997. The SAR Government will  decide which organization will receive and take care of the fund.</p>

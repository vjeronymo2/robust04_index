			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / People: Finance moves - Henderson Administration In the latest of many management changes at fund managers HENDERSON ADMINISTRATION, John Hughes, the board member responsible for administration, has resigned. A spokesman on behalf of the company said that his job had changed, and been enlarged, since the recent acquisition of Touche Remnant. 'There were lengthy discussions about his role and about job satisfaction. But it didn't work out, unfortunately for him,' the spokesman said. Hughes, 48, had been on the board since 1988 and had joined the company a year earlier. Between 1984 and 1987 he had been systems director at BZW, and for the previous decade he had worked in the marketing department of Rank Xerox. Tony Solway, director of systems, is acting head of administration while the board decides what will happen to the post.</p>

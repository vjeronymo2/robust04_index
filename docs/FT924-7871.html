			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Guerrilla leader's capture prompts recovery in Peru - A striking revival in Lima In an impressive recovery, the Lima bolsa has turned in one of the world's best stock market performances over the past two months following the capture of Abimael Guzman, the guerrilla leader, on September 12. After a 15 per cent gain in dollar terms in the second half of September, the general index leapt more than 30 per cent in October. It has subsided by about 5 per cent since then as investors took a breather. Turnover rose to levels of around Dollars 1.5m per day, still only half the February-March peak but a substantial improvement on the past six months. Brokers say a shortage of willing sellers has kept the lid on what otherwise would have been more active trading. The market had been in the doldrums following President Alberto Fujimori's April 5 decision to dissolve congress and suspend the constitution. Stocks fell 23 per cent in six months. But a recent chain of events has boosted the flagging market. Euphoria at the spectacular Guzman capture coincided in late September with approval by the IMF of Peru's economic stabilisation programme; then there was the signing of a Dollars 200m credit which had been frozen since the Fujimori coup. A 30 per cent ceiling has been forecast officially for inflation for next year, exceptionally low for Peru. And recent legislation makes Peru arguably the most attractive country in the Latin American continent for foreign investors. There is still no capital gains tax payable on profits from shares. The prospect of greater political stability is enhanced by next week's voting in of a new 'democratic constituent congress'. Even though Peru's principal parties are boycotting the November 22 elections, the return to democracy is expected to encourage the full resumption of international financial relations. 'It all adds up to the confidence factor, the spinal cord of investment,' says a relieved stock exchange president, Mr Jose Luque Otero. 'Flight capital is returning fast, and over half of current activity is due to foreign investment.' The small Lima bolsa, with some 300 quoted companies, has recently signed reciprocal trading agreements with the stock exchanges in Caracas, Bogota, Santiago and Barcelona. Foreign investment is likely to be boosted further by similar accords with Madrid, Mexico City and Buenos Aires. Mr Lorenzo Sousa of Peruval, one of Lima's principal brokers, estimates that foreign buyers account for up to two-thirds of current business. The US and the British have moved in strongly, he says, since the early wave of buying that was dominated by Argentines and Chileans. Outstanding performers over the past eight weeks have been telephone company shares - up more than 2 1/2 times. CPT, the Lima telephone monopoly, in which the state has a 20 per cent participation, and wholly state-owned telecommunications group Entel, are due for privatisation in the second half of 1993, and trading is active. Blue chip mining shares have also outperformed the index, recovering as the long-overvalued local currency gradually falls back against the dollar, favouring exporters. And the perennial favourites, breweries and cement, have remained firm. The state-owned package in Cementos Lima, worth an estimated Dollars 50m, is due for auction on the stock exchange floor before the end of 1992. Enthusiastic Lima analysts are predicting a spell of 'vigorous and sustained growth', with the prospect of prices doubling by March. Prices are still low by comparison with neighbouring countries, they say. Realists such as Mr Sousa know that all is not yet plain sailing for Peru. Tough renegotiations with the Paris Club are scheduled immediately after next week's congressional elections. The Peruvian financial system is still far from stable and many inefficient industrial companies may yet face bankruptcy. 'But foreign investors who put their money in Peru have worldwide experience,' says Mr Sousa. 'They know which sectors are solid - beer, mining, cement. They are investing in certainties.'</p>

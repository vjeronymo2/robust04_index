On Thursday [3 February]  the Bundesbank announced that the annual money supply growth  rate was 8.1 percent (preliminary value) in December. In  November the M3 money supply (cash in circulation, sight  deposits, time deposits with maturities of less than four years,  and savings deposits) had grown with an annual rate of 7.2  percent. The Bundesbank had set the target zone for 1993 at 4.5  to 6.5 percent. This year the guardians of the currency are  aiming at monetary growth between 4 and 6 percent.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / N Ireland devolution talks go on NORTHERN Ireland's unionist and nationalist leaders yesterday set out differing proposals for government in province as inter-party talks in Belfast appeared to make headway. They met briefly for a plenary session under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Work on models for devolution then moved to a sub-committee chaired by Mr Jeremy Hanley, junior Northern Ireland minister. The sub-committee will meet today and tomorrow before reporting to a plenary session on Friday. The IRA said yesterday that it had planted the firebombs that ignited during the weekend at the MetroCentre shopping complex in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. The complex is the biggest shoping centre in Europe. A further device was found yesterday, bringing the total to 11, of which eight ignited. Nobody was hurt and little damage was caused, but trading losses were estimated to have reached a total of Pounds 1.5m.</p>

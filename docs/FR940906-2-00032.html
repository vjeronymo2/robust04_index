CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000 and 001. Cover Point LNG filed this amendment in response to the Commission's July 27, 1994, Preliminary Determination (PD) concerning Cove Point LNG's proposal to acquire and reactivate the mothballed LNG facility at Cove Point, Maryland. The Cove Point LNG facility is presently owned by Columbia LNG Corporation. The PD rejected Cove Point LNG's proposal to charge market-based rates for its proposed peaking services and suggested that Cove Point LNG file another rate proposal. This filing in Docket No. CP94&hyph;50&hyph;002 is Cove Point LNG's new rate proposal and its response to certain tariff issues raised in the PD. Cove Point LNG now proposes to charge minimum and maximum rates for its peaking services with the maximum rates capped at amounts based on the net present value and levelized cost of competing services over ten- and twenty-year terms. Cove Point LNG requests that the Commission act on its proposal and issue a final certificate on or before September 30, 1994. Cove Point LNG's proposal is more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said Amendment should on or before September 6, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules; provided however, that any person that has filed a previous motion to intervene in these proceedings need not file a new intervention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linwood A.

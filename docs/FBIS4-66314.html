			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Yulai [1728 3768 0171]: ``CAS Machine </F> Translation Center Completes Construction of Three Bases'']    [Summary] Beijing, 4 Apr -- It has been learned from the  Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) that since world-renowned  young machine translation scholar Dr. Chen Zhaoxiong began to  direct the CAS Computer Institute's Machine Translation Center  (MTC) in November 1992, CAS has completed construction of two  other MTCs. The three domestic centers now specialize in the  following areas: research in information science, production and  development of machine translation systems (MTSs), and technical  training, respectively.    The two new centers have already taken on over 10 research  projects including State 863 Program key tasks, NSFC key tasks,  and international and domestic cooperative projects. The  centers have admitted into their facilities over 100 invited  guests and cooperative research fellows from Beijing University,  Qinghua University, and 16 other higher-learning institutions  and research institutes. With 863 Program support, Dr. Chen and  his colleagues have developed a number of MTSs including  English-Chinese, Chinese-English, Russian-Chinese, and  German-Chinese. The Kuai Yitong 863 series of MTSs, developed  and marketed in cooperation with Hong Kong's Quanzhi [2938 2535]  Company, are now in mass production with a scale indicated by  annual sales of 600 million yuan, direct benefits of $5.1  million to the State, and fixed assets of over $8 million. A  while back, the original CAS MTC pooled its research talent with  Quanzhi's investment capital to form the joint venture Shenzhen  Kezhi [4430 2535] (``Sci-Sense'') Language Information  Processing Ltd., the strongest and richest language information  processing industrial base. The third base or center,  specializing in technical training, admitted 12 MS candidates  and 1 Ph.D. candidate last year, and this year will admit an  additional 10 master's students and 4 Ph.D. students.</p>

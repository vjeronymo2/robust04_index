			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The plastic cup of friendship I HAVE been on holiday, the last 10 days of which were split between three Club Med villages in Morocco: Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Agadir. This was my first experience of Club Med, and it left me mightily impressed. China's bid to stage the millennial Olympic Games may have been crushingly - and rightly  -snubbed, but from what I saw in Morocco, China can derive solace and joy from the news that Club Med is to open its first holiday village there in 1995. So happy was I in Morocco that I turned a blind eye to the cavortings of Miss Lee, my Thacherite executive assistant, who accompanied me on holiday and who filled her days and nights with an intense schedule of tennis lessons. Like most good Thatcherites, Miss Lee has a huge collection of exceedingly short tennis frocks. However, it was not the lessons that attracted Miss Lee so much as the young Arab instructors. They kept her out till all hours, often till pearly dawn; I presume the courts were floodlit. Because Miss Lee had her hands full, I was left in peace to tackle a pile of books. The most enjoyable was Norman Lewis's latest volume, An Empire of the East, about travels in Indonesia. Lewis is regarded as the best living British travel writer. He has an infinitely sure touch, and is a wonderful reporter. Such a marvellous reporter that he has given me a big idea. The idea struck me on Page 148. Lewis is in Jayapura, in Irian Jaya, hoping for a surat jalan (permission to travel) for the central highlands. Given its location, says Lewis, you would think that Jayapura would have been 'full of the remembrance of things past, of jaded pretension, of the stage scenery of a tropical fin-de-siecle and dignified decline.' Nothing could be less true. Jayapura has no attractions. Some Indonesians see it as the Siberia of the tropics. But at 6pm on a Sunday, Lewis suddenly noticed a frenzied rush to the shops. 'On offer everywhere were sporting trophies in the shape of cups of all sizes with lavish and often dismal embellishment. The public had formed a tight cordon round the supermarket's central display, commenting excitedly on the maenads, tritons and cherubs, before making their choice . . . The shimmer of silver and gold misled. It was far and away the largest collection of such objects I had ever seen in one place, but all were of plastic, although indistinguishable at a distance . . . from the real thing.' What was going on? A young assistant came to Lewis's aid. 'You see,' he said, 'normally these cups are being awarded for achievements of many kinds. For running like greyhound. For throwing ball into net. For lifting heavy weight with separate class for lady competitors. Always the purpose is to encourage athletical success.' 'But not today, you say?' 'Today is special occasion for giving such cups as presents to good friends. This, in Jayapura, is friendship day. If friendship is big, cup must be big. Oh yes, a man who receives much admiration may fill a room with them.' 'But for every one he gets he must give one in return, isn't that so?' 'That he must do. That is natural thing.' 'Well at least it's good for business.' 'Oh yes. On friendship day we are being given shot in arm.' It struck me, as I read this, that what we need most is our own friendship day. This is a sad and weary planet ruled by a sad and weary species. In Britain, especially, we are consumed by self-disgust. We look with revulsion at everything around us, at what we have become. Which is why I am setting great store by a British friendship day. Perhaps it will be next June. It is a balmy, friendly month. I am reasonably sure that Woolworth's sells plastic sporting trophies amid all its other rubbish. On national friendship day we shall give one to each friend. The bigger the friendship, the bigger the cup. And we shall utter something suitable, a mantra as it were - perhaps 'God bless John Major.' I mentioned my scheme to Miss Lee. It was dawn in Agadir. The light was milky-pearly. She had just come in from her lesson. Her hair and frock were rumpled. There were circles under her eyes. I said: 'This is probably our final chance, Miss Lee. We need a national friendship day. It will prove a shot in the arm.' An Empire of the East, Jonathan Cape, Pounds 16.99.</p>

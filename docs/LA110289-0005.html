			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 PARKS DECLARED OFF-LIMITS TO SAILORS  </P> <P> For the first time in several years, Navy officials have declared two San Diego  parks off-limits to sailors because of widespread violence and drug peddling.  </P> <P> The Armed Forces Disciplinary Board banned sailors from frequenting the  Southeast Athletic Field at 45th Street and Logan Avenue and the parking area  of South Mission Beach Park, in the 600 block of Mission Boulevard.  </P> <P> "Yes, it's a little bit like playing Mom and Dad, but on the other hand, in  good conscience, I have to protect the sailors," said Adm. John W. Adams.  </P> <P> According to regulations, a top-ranking official can declare an area or an  establishment out of bounds "to help maintain good discipline and an  appropriate level of good health, morale, safety, morals and welfare" of  personnel. And an "off-limits" proclamation can refer to "any vehicle,  conveyance, place, structure, building or area."  </P> <P> For years, local officials have maintained an off-limits list that consisted  mostly of brothels, massage parlors and stores that trafficked in drug or  sex-related paraphernalia. The Navy has also imposed restrictions on sailors  visiting certain areas, such as Tijuana, where petty officers 2nd class and  below in rank are prohibited from visiting between dusk and dawn.  </P> <P> But an entire area has not been totally banned since the early 1970s, when a  pier at Imperial Beach was declared off-limits because of drug dealing, said  Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a Navy spokesman.  </P> <P> The bans are enforced by the honor system. But a sailor arrested during a drug  raid of an off-limits area, for instance, would be charged by police and also  punished by the Navy for violating an off-limits order.  </P> <P> After compiling tips from local authorities, the Armed Forces Disciplinary  Board, a group of about 40 Navy lawyers and commanding officers, establishes  the off-limits list. Six months ago, a commanding officer complained that a  number of his sailors were being robbed as they traversed the Southeast  Athletic Field. After studying the area and conferring with city police, the  board decided to ban the two parks.  </P> <P> "Everyone said there's no reason for a sailor to want to go there," Schamp  said. "There's no good thing to do there."  </P></p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / TUC to act over pay bias against union members THE TRADES Union Congress plans to complain to the International Labour Organisation about a controversial amendment in the government's new labour legislation allowing employers to discriminate against trade unionists by denying them wage rises if they refuse to sign personal contracts. Mr Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, has written to Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, pointing out that 'the amendment, if it passes into law, would clearly be a violation of ILO convention 98 on the right to organise and collective bargaining. 'I sincerely hope the government will abandon the amendment,' Mr Willis says. If not, the TUC will lodge a formal complaint with the ILO, which has already found that Britain has breached conventions it signed on good labour practices nine times since 1979. The TUC argues that ILO convention 98 - ratified by Britain in 1949 - upholds the general principle that no person should be prejudiced in employment by reason of trade union membership or legitimate trade union activities. The TUC has already complained to the ILO over two other parts of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill. Those cover the abolition of the wages councils - ending legal protection for the low-paid - and the removal of the statutory duty on the conciliation service Acas to promote collective bargaining. The TUC is lobbying some Conservative backbenchers in the hope that they may oppose the amendment, which has concerned some Tory peers. But union leaders believe the Commons will pass the measure and that it will come into force later this summer.</p>

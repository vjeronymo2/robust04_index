"Hungary's internal stability and international relations,  drawing a protective net around the country, are insufficient  for the security of the country. Nor is it sufficient to keep  the Army on a level enabling it to defend the country. For the  security of Hungary, appropriate conditions should be guaranteed  for the survival of ethnic Hungarian communities abroad," Fur  said.    The rally was attended by members of the MDF National  Presidium and the cabinet.</p>

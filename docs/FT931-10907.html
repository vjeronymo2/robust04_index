			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies The Bundesbank clearly wrestled with its conscience to come up with yesterday's discount and Lombard rate cuts, but there is no escaping the importance of the signal it has sent to the markets. As with last month's decision to trim its money market repurchase rate, it has shown that, in the last resort, it will act to preserve the integrity of the ERM. Since yesterday's decision was unexpected by the foreign exchange markets, it is also an admission that the speculative attack on the Danish krone earlier in the week constituted a serious threat to the system as a whole. With the Bundesbank in this mood, it will be difficult for speculators to justify renewed attacks. That does not mean ERM countries can feel comfortable with their lot. The half point cut in the Lombard rate is largely meaningless; it simply allows the rate to catch up with falls in money market rates that have already taken place. The substantial move is the quarter point cut in the discount rate. That leaves other European countries scant leeway to cut their rates. It must look particularly niggardly in France where real short-term interest rates are roughly 10 per cent. To bolster Europe's economic prospects much larger cuts are needed. One has to hope domestic developments will soon allow the Bundesbank to be less cautious. The fear is that budget deficit worries, and the strength of the dollar, may slow the pace of future cuts. If the Bundesbank continues only to give just enough ground to hold the ERM together, the deflationary agony of its ERM partners will simply be prolonged.</p>

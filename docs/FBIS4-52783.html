			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wilfredo G. Reyes] </F>   [Text] The full development of the country's financial  markets continue to be stunted by various economic, financial  and structural barriers, hence our underdevelopment as compared  with our neighbors in this regard.    In a recent speech before the Foreign Exchange Association  of  the Philippines, Negros Oriental Rep. Margarito Teves (3d  District) lamented the existence of seven major obstacles to  this growth namely:     -  The huge old Central Bank deficit, amounting to some P  [Philippine pesos] 320 billion, "which burdened the entire  financial system for a long time;"    -  The consolidated public sector deficit, tagged at P20.7  billion  last year and targeted at 27.7 billion this year, "financed  largely through domestic borrowing which crowded out private  investments;"    -  The close-knit family structure of many companies which does  not encourage sourcing of funds through public offering;    -  The prolonged existence of two exchanges wherein they used  different prices on the same issue, with the effect that  investors were not able to enjoy the best price;    -  The restrictive financial policies as evidenced by previously  stringent foreign exchange regulations and bank branching rules;    -  Poor market information on the availability, risk and yield  of  alternative assets which is a major cause of the observed  segmentation of the financial market that includes the presence  of a sizable informal sector; and    -  The absence of an institution, separate from the Bangko  Sentral  ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] (BSP) and the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which will exclusively  address the development of capital markets.       Mr. Teves lamented further the underdevelopment of these  markets is emphasized more when compared with their counterparts  among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member  states, saying: "Compared to our ASEAN neighbors, our financial  markets, especially the capital market, are still relatively  underdeveloped (while) ASEAN financial markets have been growing  by leaps and bounds."    First, the ratio of domestic liquidity (M3) to gross  domestic  product (GDP) in the country stood at only 34.4 percent in 1990,  as compared with 74.6 percent in Thailand, 68.2 percent in  Malaysia and 35.2 percent in Indonesia during the same period.    "This low M3 to GDP ratio implies that the range of our  financial instruments is still limited," Mr. Teves observed.    "There is an absence of variety of alternative debt and  equity instruments, while incentives to savings is unattractive  and inadequate," he added.    "Credit allocation is distorted and there is a sizable  informal sector, particularly the 5/6 type of lenders, which  serves the financing requirements of investors."    Second, although the Philippines has the oldest stock  exchange in Asia, its performance in terms of the number of  listed participants (183 as compared with 300 each in the  relatively young markets of Malaysia and Thailand last December)  and of stock market capitalization (which stood at 15.1 percent,  of GDP as of 1990, compared with 105.9 percent for Malaysia and  29.5 percent for Thailand for the same period) has left much to  be desired.    Finally, the level of credit to the private sector as a  percent of GDP in the Philippines stood at only 19.4 percent in  1990, compared with 68.7 percent in Thailand, 67.9 percent in  Malaysia and 35.9 percent in Indonesia during the same year.    "The low ratio of credit to private sector to GDP in the  Philippines is an indication of the crowding out of private  investors due to large government participation in the bonds  market," Mr. Teves observed.    "As of 1992, the outstanding issuances of National  Government  had reached P445 billion," he added.    "More than half of these government securities issued were  in  the form of high-yielding short-term Treasury bill."    These problems notwithstanding, Mr. Teves lauded  government's  recent moves to rectify the current situation, particularly  through six measures, namely:     -  The creation of the BSP and the consequent rehabilitation  of the old Central Bank which is expected to reduce the burden  on the financial system, especially on banks, in the form of a  reduced reserve requirement;    -  The creation of the Philippine Stock Exchange which  introduced  a one-price system, thus resolving the issue of inefficient  pricing that existed during the time when there were two  separate exchanges offering the same products at different  prices;    -  The liberalization of foreign exchange regulations which has  facilitated the entry of foreign investments and the  repatriation of earnings and capital;    -  The liberalization of the banking sector which includes the  removal of the policy of auctioning branches;    -  The utilization of the stock market as a vehicle for  privatizing government-owned and-controlled corporations; and    -  The improvement in the SEC's policy and regulation regarding  pricing, insider trading and disclosure of information.       Still, there are three indispensable,fundamental conditions  for the unimpeded growth of the financial sector which the  country has yet to see, namely:     -  A stable macro economic environment that encourages wealth  holders to maintain their savings in financial instruments and  with financial institutions, as opposed to such non-liquid  assets as land and jewelry;    -  An effective prudential regulatory environment that will  encourages safe and sound financial practices to prevent too  frequent bank failures and the collapse of financial  institutions, which cause a setback in public confidence in the  financial system; and    -  The regulatory environment should balance prudential  regulation  with providing enough flexibility so that financial innovation  is not stymied and financial players are able to provide  creative solutions to various needs in the market.</p>

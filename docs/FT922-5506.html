			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: Chancellor hits the jackpot on Peps - Serious Money NORMAN Lamont has not had an easy time of it during his 18 months as chancellor of the exchequer. But this week, at least, he can reflect that he did something right. Reduce unemployment? No sign of that. Defeat inflation? Not yet. His crowning achievement was to increase the limit on unit and investment trust personal equity plans. Now, this might not strike you as a matter for public rejoicing. But in the last three weeks of April, around 230,000 people opened a unit trust Pep. What spurred this enthusiasm? It cannot have been the mouth-watering returns enjoyed by recent unitholders. An investor who bought the average UK growth fund in May 1987 will have seen a return of just 16.9 per cent; those who took the plunge in May 1989 will have made a measly 4.5 per cent. One might think that such failings would have led to a rationalisation of the industry and a leaner, more competitive business. Not a bit. There are more funds than ever and annual management fees have tended to drift up from 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Indeed, performance over the past five years has got worse while charges have increased. Anyone would think unit trusts were a public utility. It could simply be the tax breaks that spurred the April rush. But have investors considered this factor carefully? For most, the capital gains tax exemption in a Pep is academic. As for income tax, the yield on a typical UK unit trust is probably 4 per cent. So, a basic rate taxpayer would have to pay a quarter of that in tax, or 1 per cent. On the maximum Pounds 6,000 investment, the tax saving is thus Pounds 60 a year. Useful, but hardly enough to start a stampede. Why, having said all this, was the rule change still the right thing for Norman Lamont to do? For a start, the previous Pep regulations were a dog's breakfast. The government was convinced that investors had to experience 'real capitalism' - in other words, the ownership of individual shares. Collective funds do not offer the same direct link to company fortunes. The result of the rules was, however, a two-tier system. Rich investors transferred their existing holdings into a Pep so they could build up a substantial tax-free portfolio over time. Good news for them, but of limited use in the cause of wider share ownership. Everyone else was stuck with managed Peps where the charges often outweighed the tax breaks and the holdings were too small to permit proper diversification. Add the effect of sluggish stock markets over the past few years and it is small wonder that so many Pep investors have been dissatisfied. That there was ample demand for a full Pounds 6,000 collective fund Pep was demonstrated by a loophole in the rules. Investment trust new issues qualified for the full allowance, and a host of launches in 1991-92 appealed successfully to the Pep investor: M&amp;G alone raised Pounds 376m. Investment trusts have much to offer the private investor, but there will always be some who prefer unit trusts. The open-ended nature of unit trusts means that investors can always sell at asset value; investment trust shareholders (and especially those who bought in a new issue) must worry that the shares will move to a discount. In addition, the borrowing powers of investment trusts may enhance investor returns in bull markets but can lead to serious problems in recessions, as can the unquoted elements of some trust portfolios. Ask the investors in Ensign or Drayton Consolidated. To be fair to the unit trust industry, some managers are showing signs of altering the charging structure. Murray Johnstone has slashed the initial charge to 1 per cent on its range of funds while Gartmore has abolished the charge altogether on its UK Index fund. Others would follow suit if private investors showed some initiative. At the moment, groups have very little success in selling trusts directly; most are sold through independent financial advisers and salesmen, many of whom pocket the 3 per cent commission that makes up the bulk of the initial charge. If investors did their own research in the unit trust field (via the specialist publications which print detailed performance figures, and by ordering managers' reports), or if they sought out a fee-based adviser, that would enable more trusts to reduce their charges. But charges are a secondary issue to performance. Unit trusts need desperately to make their investors some money. History certainly suggests that the past five years of poor performance has been an aberration. Statistics can be used to prove anything; according to the Unit Trust Association, someone who invested Pounds 500 a month in a unit trust Pep for the past 25 years would now have over Pounds 1.7m. That sounds good - except that the number of people able to invest Pounds 500 a month 25 years ago could probably have been assembled in a garden shed. Nevertheless, it seems likely that, come May 1997, most of those investors who have bought unit trust Peps recently will feel satisfied. The UK market might look a touch overvalued at the moment, but using a savings scheme avoids the difficulty of investing at the top of the market. And it will help Norman to feel he has achieved something.</p>

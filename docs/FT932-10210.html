			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: BIS returns to the black BIS, the computing services group owned by Nynex Corporation of the US, returned to profitability in 1992, with Pounds 8.7m at the operating level. Revenues improved 7 per cent to Pounds 120.5m (Pounds 112.6m). In the previous year there was a loss of Pounds 1m, the first one in the company's recent history. BIS is a complex group including computer software, consultancy, facilities management and direct marketing interests, and it is best known for Midas, a software package for international banks now used by 500 customers in 70 countries. Some 46 per cent of total revenues come from banking software. Mr Roger Graham, chairman and chief executive, said the turnround to profit had been the result of cutting parts of the business that were unprofitable and improving quality and customer satisfaction. There had been strong growth in sales to local and central government and to utilities. The group intended to compete strongly for a share in the government's market testing programme, Mr Graham said.</p>

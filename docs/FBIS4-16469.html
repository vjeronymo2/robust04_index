			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Harmony" rubric: </F> "Government and State Duma Find Common Language. Budget  Infusions To Be Put in Order"]    [Text] The State Duma has made what might at first glance  seem as minor amendments to its rules of procedure, but what in  legal terms has marked a certain turn in relations between the  representative and executive authorities. The issue is that  under Article 104 of the Constitution draft laws that call for  federal budget appropriations cannot be submitted for State Duma  consideration without the government's expert opinion. By  including this article in the Fundamental Law its authors tried  to insure themselves against the practice of the RSFSR's Supreme  Soviet and Congress where the adoption of laws to the greatest  detriment of the budget seemed to be the domestic deputies'  favorite sport. Out of inertia, the new parliamentarians have  tried to go back to their former hobby only to run into Article  104.    Initially, lawyers among deputies have found a loophole:  what is required under the Constitution is just a government  opinion regardless of what it says. For instance, a law on a  100-fold rise in the salaries of commercial bank directors to be  financed by the state could cost 1 trillion rubles from the  budget, of which the government would advise the State Duma,  deeming the initiative inappropriate, but the deputies could  well spurn the opinion and pass the draft law just the same.  This is why the government did not see any reason to rush with  writing its opinions. The State Duma's unilateral attempt to  impose time limits on the executive branch would have certainly  been unconstitutional.    The situation was definitely abnormal, but the two sides  have  reached an agreement and decided to formalize it legally: On 11  April the government decreed that letters with opinions on draft  laws regarding federal budget expenditures must be prepared  within 14 days. The period may be extended to 30 days if it is  necessary to obtain additional information which is not provided  for in the state accounting system. Moreover, the government  obliged federal authorities to draw up opinions on State Duma  draft laws at its request within 7 or 15 days, the latter if  there is a need to obtain extra information. Finally, should a  sponsor of the draft law or a Federation component fail to  submit the requisite information, the government decreed that  the dispute would be resolved upon agreement with the lower  chamber.    The State Duma has gone its part of the way, too. The  amendments to its rules of procedure effectively repeat the  government document, except for the provision on giving  assignments to executive agencies, something the lower chamber  is not entitled to do.    The State Duma was surprisingly swift in considering the  rules of procedure amendments, and Deputy Baburin's remark that  the decree is very important, because it affects the status of  both the government and the State Duma -- which is why there is  no reason to be too hasty in adopting it before the law on  deputy status is passed -- did not find a response among the  parliamentarians. Maybe one of the reasons is that the report  on the agreement was delivered by "the biggest leaf on both  branches of power" -- Sergey Shakhray, who is at the same time a  deputy prime minister in the government and a State Duma faction  leader.</p>

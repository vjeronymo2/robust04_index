			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (14): Poised for a fresh start - Agriculture AFTER more than a decade and a half of decline, Angola's agriculture could be poised for a new start. The end of the civil war last year, and good rain-falls in most parts of the country, have raised expectations that a modest recovery is on the way. Officials report an increase in activity in the countryside since the war ended and forecast a 15 per cent rise in food production this year. If confirmed, it will be the best result since 1980. But there is still a long way to go before Angola regains food self-sufficiency, and the rest of agriculture remains deeply in crisis. Agriculture was thrown into turmoil after independence and the departure of Portuguese settlers. Farms, plantations and food processing industries were abandoned and vital commercial and servicing structures collapsed. The civil war exacerbated the crisis and production went through a precipitous decline leaving the country - once an exporter of agricultural produce - dependent on food aid. Food imports rose rapidly to reach Dollars 242.7m in 1984, according to the World Bank. Among the main export crops, coffee production fell from 210,000 tonnes before independence to about 7,000 tonnes in the late 1980s; cultivation of cotton fell from more than 110,000 tonnes in 1973 to 307 tonnes in 1986; maize production - once Angola's fifth largest agricultural export and an important element in the local diet - fell from almost 900,000 tonnes in 1975 to 290,000 tonnes in 1986. Production of most basic foods, from rice to beans and potatoes, declined markedly. The livestock sector fared no better with the number of cattle slaughtered for meat falling from 157,000 in 1973 to fewer than 18,000 in 1985. Mr Benjamin Castello, deputy minister for agriculture, says low production was the result of war, natural catastrophes - drought in the south and floods in the north - and of misconceived policies. 'Agricultural policy was not properly adjusted to conditions. There were good intentions but the policy failed to take into account the human factor. People didn't participate in the policy and there was an over-reliance on mechanisation. There were no incentives to improve production and as a result rural trade disappeared.' Large state farms were given priority and preferential treatment over small-scale or subsistence farming, but they performed badly due to poor management, lack of technical preparation and misplaced attempts to meet unrealistic targets. In the early 1980s, the government shifted support towards small farmers. An emergency plan was approved in 1984 with the aim of reducing the state's role in production. Inefficient and unpopular co-operatives were turned into peasant associations, enabling farmers to pool their resources but allowing them to retain and sell the products of their own work. 'The co-operatives were often set up bureaucratically without real local participation. State companies exploited the peasants as if they were new colonialists,' Mr Castello says. Agricultural Development Stations (EDAs) were created in the countryside to provide technical and financial support for peasant associations, including help with access to production inputs and distribution. The measures helped to stabilise prices and led to a rise in production in spite of the war, Mr Castello says. Economic reforms known as the Saneamento Economico e Financeiro (SEF), introduced in 1988, should also help. These include: liberalising prices, allowing greater private sector activity and investment in the transport, retailing and wholesale sectors, opening up credit facilities, and decentralising decision making. Foreign investment is encouraged, especially in the service sector whose inefficiency is seen as one of the biggest barriers to development. Land and large plantations left vacant by the departure of settlers and not currently used will be sold. The government plans to privatise all coffee plantations and foreign companies will be invited to tender for the larger ones. Before independence, Angola was the world's fourth-largest coffee grower, producing a record 4m bags of coffee and generating exports worth Dollars 206m in 1972-73. Most coffee plantations were in the less populated north and workers were contracted from the south - where the rebel Unita forces were strongest - and the migrant flow stopped during the war. Many plantations were neglected and most will need substantial investment because many coffee trees are dead or diseased. Several groups are interested, including Espirito Santo of Portugal which owned a big plantation in central Angola, but much depends on what happens after next September's elections. Mr Castello says a new property law clarifying land ownership will be passed soon. 'All investors, foreign or Angolan, want this reassurance. Anyone who wants to invest can come to the ministry, explain what they want to do, whether 100 per cent foreign or a joint venture, and we'll see what we can do.' The flight of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes poses another problem. Countless villages are deserted and about 40 per cent of the population now lives in urban areas. As people drifted to towns in search of safety and work, the proportion of Angolans engaged in agriculture dropped by half from 74.5 per cent in 1970 to 35.5 per cent in 1985. There are signs that people are starting to move back to the countryside, and as security and communications improve this is likely to accelerate. Many government officials see the successful resettlement of these displaced families as fundamental to the country's future. 'As long as Angola's peasants are poor, Angola will remain poor' argues Mr Costello: 'We have to create the framework for all Angolans to enrich themselves. The creation of wealth will guarantee stability in the country.'</p>

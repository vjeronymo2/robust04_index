			<p>Sword'   <F P=102>   94AS0281F New Delhi JANSATTA in Hindi 4 May 94 p 4 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0281F </F> <F P=104>  New Delhi JANSATTA </F> <F P=105>  Hindi </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Worthless 301"] </F>   [Text] There are many reasons for the two-month extension  given to India on Special-301, the U.S. "commercial sword." One  reason perhaps is Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's proposed visit  to Washington. At a time when a topic like the NPT  [Nonproliferation Treaty] is to be discussed in Washington,  raising the Special-301 issue would be creating unnecessary  bitterness from diplomatic standpoint. There already are  differences over several issues between India and the United  States. More serious that trade issues are the political and  defense issues. President Clinton and Prime Minister Narasimha  Rao will discuss all these issues. Therefore, we do not  understand why the U.S. Department of Commerce showed the  Special-301 sword. Granted, the two month extension is over now;  however, the official report on GATT talks has been confirmed  during this time. India has signed it. GATT contains answers to  all the questions that had led to the Special-301 proposal in  the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Government should be satisfied with  India's agreement on the Dunkel proposals of the GATT and should  work on ending Special-301. Instead, it has warned that India  will be brought back under Special-301.    It appears that India is facing Special-301 because of  China.  They want to make China a GATT member. It has applied for it.  China has made the delay in decision on its entry an issue for  opposing it. Until China joins GATT, the United States will  continue to threaten it over copyright and patent infringement.  China and India are in the same category on the U.S. list. That  is why India is repeatedly warned about Special-301. It is  possible that the U.S. Congress does not want to end Special-301  because of China. At present, China, Argentina, and India are  the Special-301 countries. India and Argentina have signed the  GATT documents and both have to change their patent and  copyright laws under this agreement. Enough time has been  allocated under GATT for it. The United States is putting  psychological pressure for making new laws by giving warnings  every two months. Nothing will happen if India ignores these.  India should not worry about Special-301 now. How can we accept  U.S. highhandedness after signing a multi-party international  trade agreement? All patent and copyright issues are considered  in the new trade agreement. At a time when multiparty trade  arrangements are being made, how can the United States become an  enforcer in a bilateral arrangement? Perhaps, the U.S.  administration has understood it and has not taken any action  and India has not wasted time in expressing its  reaction.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Ariane seeks to reassure insurers Arianespace, the Paris-based manufacturer of the Ariane rocket, yesterday launched an investigation into the failure of its 63rd mission - which ditched Turkish and European telecommunications satellites insured for Dollars 350m into the Atlantic Ocean on Monday. In Kourou, French Guiana - the company's South American launchpad - and Paris, officials sought to reassure clients and insurers that the programme of ten launches in 1994 would not be affected by the disaster. 'We hope insurers will continue to invest their confidence in the Ariane system,' an official declared. The inquiry, which will be conducted together with the European Space Agency and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, will report next month. It was the sixth failure for the rocket, which controls over half the commercial space launch market, since its first lift-off in 1979. It emerged yesterday that a premature shut-down of an engine followed by overheating in the unmanned Ariane-4 rocket caused the failure 13 minutes after launch. It was the first failure for four years and industry participants denied that the crash marked a turning-point in Arianespace's fortunes. Although the high-risk commercial launch market has become highly competitive, the French-led consortium has retained its grip in spite of looming Russian, Japanese and Chinese rivalry and American competition. In the US, three out of eight launches of General Dynamics' Atlas rocket failed last year, while McDonnell-Douglas' Delta rocket has been overtaken by the move towards heavier satellites.</p>

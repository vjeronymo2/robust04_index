Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban March 3 SAPA -- State President F W de Klerk  said on Thursday [3 March] he did not believe there was enough  time for mediation to bring the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] back  into South Africa's transition and urged ongoing dialogue to  achieve this end. "I don't think mediation is a very  expeditious means," he told reporters after meeting community  leaders in Pietermaritzburg -- part of his election roadshow  through Natal. "Time is of the essence," he said, adding that  direct dialogue was the best way to overcome differences.    Mr de Klerk told parties intent on boycotting the election  that they were "shooting themselves in the foot".    On reports of a split in the Conservative Party [CP], Mr de  Klerk said it did not surprise him, as he believed there was  strong support by CP members at grassroots level to contest the  April poll.    In reply to a question, Mr de Klerk said he did not feel  intimidated by venturing into kwaZulu territory, saying he had  not received any negative reaction from IFP President Mangosuthu  Buthelezi on his journey into that region.    Mr de Klerk will on Friday afternoon visit strife-torn  Umbumbulu south of Durban, a district of kwaZulu which has been  wracked by years of political violence.    Mr de Klerk also said he had discussed issues such as  abortion and satanism with a group of church, local government,  traditional and other leaders in Pietermaritzburg on Thursday  morning. On abortion, he said he believed the NP [National  Party] policy which outlawed unnatural birth except under  exceptional circumstances, was a good one. Only when the life  of a mother was in jeopardy did the NP believe abortion should  be considered. Mr de Klerk moved to central Pietermartizburg  later on Thursday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F> by Peter G. Feher; place and date not given: "In Spite of All  This, We Would Like Good Relations With Slovakia -- Reply to the  Accusations"]    [Text] On 2 February in the Bratislava Parliament, Slovak  Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik made a speech. He summed up his  country's 1993 diplomatic results and spoke about Slovakia's  foreign relations. In the course of this, he blamed Hungary a  number of times for the tensions between the two countries, and  for the open issues that hinder the establishment of good  relations. We asked Geza Jeszenszky to reply to the accusations  of his Slovak colleague.    [Feher] Moravcik accused Hungary of being responsible for  the atmosphere of mistrust between the two states. Does this  indicate some kind of negative change in Slovak foreign policy,  or is it part of the already existing process?    [Jeszenszky] The Slovak foreign minister made propagandistic  statements. We could term his words as some kind of  self-deceit. I am convinced that history will clearly prove  that his accusations had no basis.    However, we do not have time to wait for the historians to  make their appropriate judgment over Moravcik's statements  because, in the interest of adequately informing the populations  of the two countries and the international community, this kind  of approach has to be calmly, but firmly refused. It is the  facts that fundamentally disprove the Slovak foreign minister's  views. Since the time it became clear that the Czech Republic  and Slovakia would separate, Hungary has made many gestures  toward both countries. We have paid special attention to the  newly established Slovak state. Our historic coexistence, the  600,000 Hungarians living in Slovakia, the longest section of  our border, regional politics, and economic viewpoints all  dictate good bilateral relations. I would like to remind people  that I held a lecture on Slovak-Hungarian conciliation on 3  September 1992, which was received positively. Prime Minister  Meciar's invitation to Hungary and his visit took place after  this. During the Budapest talks, [former Prime Minister] Jozsef  Antall brought it to Meciar's attention that Hungary has cordial  intentions with its northern neighbor, however, in two issues  the Hungarian stance cannot be changed: We cannot accept the  unlawful diversion of the Danube, and we have to insist on  settling the situation of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia in  the spirit of the international norms and recommendations. We  suggested further talks on both issues. We wanted joint  committees to be set up, and raised the possibility of an  agreement on the protection of national minorities. (This would  have been an agreement similar to the one we had made with  Slovenia). Slovakia was not prepared for cooperation on these  issues. As we know, the Danube was diverted, and Moravcik's  latest statement on this issue is not accurate, because he said  that, due to the European Union's mediation, the political  antagonism between the two countries ceased to exist and it has  been turned into a legal dispute. Only after defeating the  Slovak Government's long resistance did Hungary manage to  achieve that the European Union's mediation and The Hague  Court's jurisdiction would be used. Therefore, it can be seen  that, even in the case of a serious violation of the law,  Hungary strived to settle the issue through negotiations, within  a legal framework.    [Feher] In his aforementioned parliamentary speech, the  Slovak foreign minister accused Hungary, among other things, of  damaging Slovakia's situation by over-emphasizing the Hungarian  national minority problems at international forums. Slovakia,  as a member of many international organizations, accepted as  obligations the recommendations regarding national minorities.  In this case, what is the basis for Moravcik's accusations?    [Jeszenszky] Hungary could have hampered Slovakia's  acceptance into the various international organizations. The  best known example is probably Slovakia's membership in the  Council of Europe. As is known, Hungary deliberately did not  hinder its admittance, because we did not want to lay more  burdens on bilateral relations. When Slovakia was established  and when it was to be admitted to various international  institutions, we did indicate our concerns regarding its policy  on national minorities. In Slovakia, there is a language law  that is not at all favorable to the national minorities, and the  national minorities have serious reservations regarding the  Slovak Constitution. Even the European Community stated at the  time that the full observation of national minority rights is  one of the preconditions for recognizing new states. Therefore,  Hungary did not initiate this issue on its own, rather, this is  an international system of requirements. Hungary was not just  imagining things when Slovakia's Council of Europe membership  came up: It became obvious that two new measures were  threatening the Hungarian minority. These are the  transformation of the schooling system and the reform of public  administration, which would put the Hungarian minorities in a  very disadvantageous position.    [Feher] In his parliamentary speech, Moravcik claimed that  the drafting of the bilateral basic agreement was in process  and, on the Slovak side, nothing was standing in the way of  signing this document as soon as possible. Is the drafting of  the bilateral basic agreement indeed so far forward?    [Jeszenszky] Unfortunately, I cannot confirm this, and the  obstacles are not posed by the Hungarian side; the real problem  is that the settlement of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is  indeed a prerequisite for signing such an agreement -- in the  spirit, let us say, of the often mentioned Recommendation No.  1201 of the Council of Europe. If this was implemented in  Slovakia and the measures that are to the detriment of the  Hungarian minority are not introduced, then Slovakia's practice  would be suitable for all affected sides. The agreement could  refer to the desired principles and practices in an adequate  form. Therefore, if the situation of the Hungarian minority is  settled in the spirit of the recommendations accepted by the  international community, then a bilateral agreement can be  signed as soon as the following day.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] today released 73  Palestinians prisoners who live in the Gaza Strip. Local Gazans  are furious over the small number of people released and claim  this is a violation of the Cairo agreement. Israel has so far  released 2,000 prisoners, whereas it undertook to release 5,000  in the agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

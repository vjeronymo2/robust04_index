			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Random Notes on Hong Kong" column article by Lian Tian </F> (6647 1131): "Joining Efforts To Make a Bigger Cake"]    [Text] Through painstaking preparations, the new Hong Kong  banknotes issued by the Bank of China [BOC] are now available to  Hong Kong inhabitants. This is a major event in Hong Kong  economic circles.    According to an authoritative figure from the BOC, as a  commercial bank, the BOC has issued Hong Kong banknotes in an  orderly way according to local laws and current Hong Kong  regulations for issuing currency. Moreover, after becoming a  banknote issuer, the BOC will continue its operation in light of  Hong Kong's financial laws, continue to support the status of  the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard  Chartered Bank as Hong Kong's major banknote issuers. The BOC  intends to enter into fair competition with other banks in Hong  Kong and seek common development rather than replace them. Hong  Kong people should set their minds at ease. As stated by an  official in charge of the BOC: "We do not intend to take a  larger share of the cake. Instead, we want to join others in  making a bigger cake." As the second largest bank group in Hong  Kong, the BOC in Hong Kong has always regarded the maintenance  of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and Hong Kong's status  as an international financial center as its fundamental  interests.    From the BOC's issuance of banknotes in Hong Kong, we can  see  the great significance of the move in Hong Kong's economy.  Apart from consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international  financial center, it will also be conducive to the continuity  and smooth transition of Hong Kong's currency system. Hong Kong  is one of the limited number of regions in the world where  banknotes are issued by commercial banks, where there is no  central bank, and where the functions of the central bank are  jointly performed by the government departments, the Hong Kong  and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and other commercial banks.  Following the issuance of its banknotes, the BOC will become a  member of these commercial banks. The move itself shows that  the system of commercial banks issuing banknotes, which has  prevailed in Hong Kong over the years, will smoothly continue  after 1997. It also indicates the policy of the Chinese  Government toward Hong Kong, that is, keeping prevailing  practice unchanged.    Second, it will be conducive to stability of the value and  credibility of Hong Kong currency. The BOC is one of the large  banks which ranks in the front of the list of world banks. With  a solid foundation, the move of the BOC in issuing Hong Kong  banknotes will be conducive to maintaining a strong Hong Kong  dollar. The system of pegging Hong Kong dollar to the  greenback, aimed at stabilizing Hong Kong's financial market and  the economy as a whole, has played an important role. After  becoming a banknote issuer, the BOC will show more concern for  the system than in the past and make vigorous efforts to  consciously maintain it.    The BOC cannot make any commercial benefit from issuing  banknotes in Hong Kong. Conversely, it has to undertake for the  cost of the operation. Proceeding from the overall situation of  maintaining Hong Kong's financial stability, the BOC, in  compliance with the request of Hong Kong society, has vigorously  undertaken a greater responsibility and issued Hong Kong  banknotes. We hope that the BOC will seek practical results  rather than undeserved reputation, carefully manage its  business, and join Hong Kong banks in making a bigger "cake."</p>

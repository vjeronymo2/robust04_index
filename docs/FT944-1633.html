			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: London Trading volumes are likely to be sluggish in the week leading up to Christmas as dealers indulge in seasonal celebrations. The economic statistics on offer are unlikely to disturb the festivities; the broad measure of money supply (M4) and the non-European Union trade figures rarely move the market, and Thursday's third-quarter GDP figure is expected to be unchanged from the last estimate. More significant could be the publication, on Wednesday, of the minutes of the November 2 meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. With the market expecting a further base rate rise in the first quarter of 1995, the governor's views on inflationary indicators will be closely watched. Attention will also be focused abroad, and in particular on the US Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting in Washington tomorrow. Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks the Fed will not tighten and the Bundesbank's M3 money supply target will indicate little need for a further rise in German rates. In such circumstances, and given her view that a lot of bad news on interest rates is already priced into the market, she thinks there is scope for short gilts to rally.</p>

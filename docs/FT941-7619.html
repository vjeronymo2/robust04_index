			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Tories to contract out running of annual conferences Tory party managers are taking the government's business philosophy to heart  -Conservative Central Office is to contract out management of its annual conference with the aim of making a profit from it. Officials said the autumn conference, one of the centrepieces of the political calendar, usually costs the party a lot of money, but they declined to say how much.

In recent months the party has gone to some lengths to put its finances in order after a deficit of Pounds 15.3m in the year to March 1993. The new company will be responsible for arranging most of the facilities at the conference, including accreditation, hotel accommodation and the design of the stage. An important aim will be to increase revenue from a commercial exhibition traditionally held in the conference foyer. Exhibitors include companies and other bodies which wish to lobby delegates. The party insisted that there would be no increases in the amount charged to delegates to attend the annual conference, which is held in Blackpool, Brighton or Bournemouth. The chief executive of the new company is Mr Michael Lockett, the owner and founder of World Conference Travel. Mr Tim Collins, the Tory party's director of communications, will be the non-executive chairman. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said yesterday: 'By applying the Conservative principle of contracting out to this part of our own activities at Central Office, I expect the party at all levels to reap significant gains.'</p>

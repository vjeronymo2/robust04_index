			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MONORAIL IDEA MUST SURVIVE CIVIC MYOPIA  </P> <P> When it comes to needed improvements at the county's John Wayne Airport, the  city of Newport Beach suffers from a chronic case of municipal myopia.  </P> <P> Sometimes the city gets so hung up with its obsession against airport growth it  abandons sound and reasonable planning and pursues a hypocritical and  shortsighted approach. The proposed monorail planned to run between the airport  and two office buildings in Irvine near the edge of the airfield is a good case  in point.  </P> <P> The estimated $3.5-million monorail system being planned by the McDonnell  Douglas Realty Co. proposes monorail service for about a half-mile from the  office buildings at Douglas Plaza to the airport. But the system is designed so  it can be expanded to serve other commercial and industrial areas and link them  to the airport.  </P> <P> It is an exciting proposition that, if built, would be the first privately  constructed, owned and operated but publicly used monorail system in the  nation.  </P> <P> But Newport Beach has filed an appeal to the initial approval given to the  project last October by the County Board of Supervisors. City officials, in  seeking to reopen hearings on the plan, are singing the same song they have  sung for years every time an airport improvement is proposed: They fear that  the project will mean additional airport growth.  </P> <P> The city keeps raising that argument despite the fact that the airport growth  issue was resolved more than 3 years ago -- in August of 1985, in a 20-year  compromise agreement among city, county and community groups.  </P> <P> That agreement, controlling airport noise and growth, sets a ceiling of 4.75  million passengers a year at the county airport for the first 5 years and a  maximum of 8.4 million passengers annually for the next 15 years. Those  maximums are lower than the county's original plan. The new airport terminal  now under construction was also scaled back to satisfy Newport Beach's fear of  unbridled airport expansion.  </P> <P> Why then should Newport Beach keep challenging improvement plans around the  airport?  </P> <P> The proposed McDonnell Douglas monorail system is designed not to increase the  passenger load at John Wayne but to decrease the heavy traffic congestion in  the airport area. The county board should reject Newport Beach's appeal and  Irvine city officials who must still pass on the project should also reject  Newport Beach's opposition and give the monorail enthusiastic approval.  </P> <P> It makes good sense to seek ways to get passengers -- who will be using the  terminal anyhow, within the annual maximums already agreed upon -- to the  airport with as little traffic congestion as possible. The monorail is an  innovative alternative, cost-free to the public, that should be pursued.  </P></p>

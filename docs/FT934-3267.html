			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Banks mop up an oil spillage - Why Metallgesellschaft has a futures problem Last Friday, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, paid a visit to the twin towers of Deutsche Bank, just down the road from the loss-making conglomerate's own headquarters in the centre of Frankfurt. At 8am, Mr Schimmelbusch, together with his finance director and one other senior executive, had an audience with Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank main board director responsible for corporate finance and chairman of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board. It seems likely Mr Schimmelbusch then alerted Mr Schmitz to potential liquidity problems arising from the group's oil trading activities in the US, and requested new credit lines to stave off a possible cash crisis within the group's US operation, MG Corp. The difficulties were sparked by a sharp fall in the oil price in recent months. This has given rise to the need for Metallgesellschaft to finance so-called 'margin calls' - cash payouts - to cover part of the risk on oil futures. Senior executives from Metallgesellschaft were obliged to skip the head-office party later that day and enter a round of negotiations with Deutsche and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks which both happen to be significantshareholders in the metals, mining and industrial conglomerate. The negotiations bore fruit around lunch-time on Monday, when Metallgesellschaft put out a one-paragraph statement saying it had secured additional lines of credit. However, news of the talks had already broken in that morning's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper: the statement could not prevent a large sell-off of the company's shares. They ended the day down 12 per cent. The scale of the share-price reaction reflected worries about the underlying financial stability of the group. Metallgesellschaft has been badly hit by recession in Germany and the impact of cheap metal imports from the former eastern bloc. Last month, Metallgesellschaft announced a loss of DM347m (Dollars 204.1m) for the year ended September, and said it would pass the dividend. Following this, the stock market clearly judged the latest risk as a potential straw to break the camel's back. But was the share price reaction justified? According to Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank chief executive, it was not. He said it was not a question of existence-threatening risks at Metallgesellschaft, but rather of a short-term liquidity problem caused by a technicality. 'There has been too much excitement,' he said. 'We need to be more relaxed about this.' The New York-based MG Corp has built up a substantial business supplying physical oil and oil-related products such as diesel, gasoline and heating oil. As part of normal business practice, these contracts are hedged with a variety of instruments to neutralise the group's exposure in the event of sharp price movements. The oil futures contract, however, has been running against MG Corp: when the oil price falls, contract-holders are obliged to make a margin call with the Nymex futures exchange. This is designed to smooth out the impact of an adverse change in prices. The oil price has dropped from Dollars 21 a barrel in May to less than Dollars 14 now. For MG Corp, the need to find the cash imposes a liquidity strain, despite the fact that the company's risk is covered by its contract to sell physical oil at a future date. The risk enters a new order of magnitude only when the original contract to sell gasoline at a given price goes awry. In its brief statement earlier this week, Metallgesellschaft gave no hint of this, saying only that it had paid all calls to date but needed new borrowing facilities to cover the possibility that the oil price will fall further. Metallgesellschaft made it clear yesterday it would publish further information next week. The stockmarket, for one, appears to be giving the group the benefit of the doubt - the shares closed DM12 up at DM360 yesterday.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / BBC gives go-ahead for 24-hour news, sport on Radio 5 THE BBC governors last night gave the go-ahead for a 24-hour news and sports service on Radio 5 beginning next April. The decision marks a final climbdown by the BBC board of management and governors who wanted to launch an all-day news service on the long-wave frequency used by Radio 4. The BBC is now likely to face opposition from sports fans who do not want to share their service with news. Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, said last night: 'I am confident, after extremely thorough research, that a news and sport network offers an exciting new programme prospect - which will bring new listeners to the BBC and extend choice for all licence payers.' The new service will be aimed at a young audience, which implies a popular sound to the news. The BBC's plan to restrict Radio 4 to FM frequencies met opposition in the UK from listeners who could not get an acceptable FM reception. There was even more vociferous opposition from those who listened to Radio 4 in continental Europe on long wave but who could not pick up FM broadcasts. Ms Jenny Abramsky, BBC director of radio news and current affairs, is expected to run the new service. The position of Ms Pat Ewing, the present controller of Radio 5, is unclear. Last night Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC governors, said the marriage of news and sports brought together two of the BBC's strongest assets. The BBC has not yet said where the new home will be for the children's and education programmes now carried on Radio 5. Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow national heritage secretary, said last night the decision 'flies in the face' of the BBC's commitment to serve all listeners. The only network showing signs of a growing audience was the one to be sacrificed for another service dominated by news, she added.</p>

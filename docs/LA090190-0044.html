			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CAPSIZED YACHT STILL FLOATING TOWARD HAWAII  </P> <P> Pandemonium might be the first boat to finish the 1991 Transpacific Yacht Race.  </P> <P> More than a year after capsizing while returning from the '89 Transpac from Los  Angeles to Honolulu, the 66-foot ultralight has been sighted once again, still  floating upside down -- this time 800 miles northeast of Hawaii on a slow drift  toward the islands.  </P> <P> An unidentified oceanographic vessel reported to attorneys for the insurers  that they saw the boat -- distinctive because of a white hull and naked keel  bolts -- Thursday.  </P> <P> Owner Desmond McCallum, who had chartered the boat to another sailor for the  race, received $335,000 in compensation for the loss. The San Francisco law  firm of Derby, Cook, Quinby and Tweedt has filed a civil suit in San Diego  seeking $360,053 in damages against six defendants, including the designers,  Nelson-Marek.  </P> <P> "We've sued everybody having to do with the keel," a spokesperson said.  </P> <P> The requested damages include $22,553 in personal property of the crew and  $2,500 for a flyover after a first sighting in early February.  </P> <P> The firm also plans to attempt to salvage the boat, which, at its current rate  of drift, could beach itself in Hawaii late next spring, shortly before the  start of the '91 Transpac.  </P> <P> Pandemonium flipped 300 miles off San Francisco on Aug. 3, 1989, when its keel  fell off. A crew of five clambered onto the overturned hull and was picked up  by a freighter late that night.  </P> <P> It was next seen early in February by a Matson Navigation Co. vessel about 700  miles southwest of that location, but a plan for a salvage operation was  delayed when a seagoing tug was unable to leave Newport Harbor because of the  Huntington Beach oil spill. By the time they could have left, salvagers  figured, the boat would have drifted too far to be located again.  </P></p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Life according to Blair Ambition for Labour 'Most obviously it is to lead the party into government and to end 15 years of being a party of protest. But the reason for putting Labour into government is so that we can begin the process of national renewal which I believe is essential for the country to build a strong and decent society that is capable of developing individual effort and enterprise. I think Labour has got to be a party with a very clear sense of its own modern identity. That is about applying its traditional values, its belief in society, social justice, equality of opportunity and applying those values to the modern world. And I think it has got to be a party that is capable of building a new coalition of support in the country that reaches out beyond its traditional boundaries of support to be a vehicle for the national renewal that I want to see. But the beliefs that I hold are derived from a very clear tradition of the left-of-centre and the Labour party throughout its entire history. Welfare state What we want is to recreate the notion of the welfare state as a vehicle for economic opportunity and security for people rather than welfare dependency. We want a nation at work and not a nation on benefit. I would like to look at the benefits that we have at the present time in the context of what the Social Justice Commission reports . . . But I think the main change in emphasis that I would like to see is this notion of modernising the welfare state by getting back actually to its basic principles. Beveridge never foresaw a situation where people would for years on end be recipients of welfare. The purpose of it was to give people the opportunity of making their way in their own lives. Leadership style If you look back over 10 years, the time that I have been on the Labour party front-bench, I have always tried to include people and to take people with me in the changes I have wanted to make. I think an inclusive and open and listening style of leadership is very very important and I think John Smith gained a lot of respect in the Labour party for that. I think it's very important to try and work by agreement with people and by making people understand what we are about. Liberals and PR I don't believe in pacts and I don't believe they work. I don't think you can start trying to impose pacts on political parties. I don't think it works. What I have always said is it is at the level of ideas that we should be prepared to open up. The Social Justice Commission is the beginning of that in a sense and what I have actually called the dialogue of ideas goes on. I think that's important. The party policy is to give people a referendum on proportional representation. I personally am not persuaded by PR but the party policy I think is the right one. Trade unions The basic relationship between Labour and the trade unions is built on the bond of belief between the two. The changes that were put in train last year by John Smith ensure that the relationship is focused much more on the individual participation of trades union members. There will always be a relationship between the trade union and the Labour party, there has been historically and there will continue to be. It should be a relationship that is based on fairness and not on favours. It is not the function of a Labour government to come in and do particular favours for the trade union movement. What we have said is we will set a legal framework that is fair to trade unionists. Now in my view it should be up to somebody whether they join a trade union or not and that is why I moved the Labour party away from the position of the closed shop. But if people do want to join a trade union they should be entitled to do so. Where there is substantial support for the union at the workplace they should be entitled to have their union represent them. But it should be a matter of the free choice of the employees concerned. Industrial policy If you put to me the question, is it the function of the Labour party to pick winners, the answer is No. Is it the function of a Labour government to try and tell industry how to run its affairs? No. But it is the function of any sensible modern industrial policy, for example in the field of technology or training, to make sure that the efforts of government and society as a whole are backing up the efforts of industry to be successful and to grow. I think it is important that employers train and if they don't train that they have some social responsibility to make some contribution to the national training effort. Water industry We certainty disagreed with the water industry being sold off. But I think that most people would not regard it as a sensible expenditure of money . . . unless you had a very great deal of money to spend . . . that you renationalise the water industry as opposed to say spending money on health or education.'</p>

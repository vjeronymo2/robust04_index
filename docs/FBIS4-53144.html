			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] There have been many activities in Phnom Penh  recently which undermined friendly relations between Vietnam and  Cambodia. Following is our radio comment on these sabotage  activities.    In Phnom Penh recently, people staged a demonstration with  slogans against Vietnam and the friendly relations between  Cambodia and Vietnam. Concerning this incident on Monday, a  spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry made a statement  saying that Vietnam was very worried at this move aimed to  undermine traditional friendship between the two countries, and  to harm Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia. The statement  said these acts were beneficial to no one, but created  instability and encouraged the Khmer Rouge to destroy peace and  the peaceful life of Cambodians and Vietnamese ethnic nationals  living there.    The main reason for the instability in Cambodia, despite the  UN- sponsored elections, has been the Khmer Rouge. Together  with sabotage acts against the national reconstruction of  Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge has always waged a national campaign  of hatred and massacre against Vietnamese nationals. Reality  shows the Khmer Rouge will never stop opposing Vietnam.    Nevertheless, Vietnamese people have cherished hopes for  peace in Cambodia so that the people can build a prosperous  country. Vietnam places great importance on building and  developing a neighborly and friendly relationship with the  Kingdom of Cambodia, on the basis of respecting each other's  independence, sovereignty, non-intervention in each other's  internal affairs, and equal cooperation for mutual benefit.    The spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry further  said that Vietnam has never coveted Cambodian territory, and has  always strictly implemented all territorial agreements signed  between the two countries. For this reason, Vietnam requests  the Cambodian authorities, as well as authorities in other  countries, to assure normal life for Vietnamese nationals, like  other foreign nationals in Cambodia, in conformity with  international laws and regulations.    Vietnam has reaffirmed its good will in relations with  Cambodia many times, but response to this good will depends on  Cambodia. The Vietnamese people hope that such acts of sabotage  to friendly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia will never  take place again in Cambodia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While we see the desirability of being able to pursue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only alternative remedies in many cases of facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance, the fact is that section 1919(h)(7) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act offers the availability of alternative remedies when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coupled with an action to terminate a provider agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when there would be no repayment consequences for either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility or the State. In these cases, when HCFA agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the State's assessment that a provider agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination should be sought, the State's timing for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination controls. If the State opts for one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies in addition to termination, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies would be applied unless the Secretary chooses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose an alternative remedy. When both the State and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary choose to impose one or more alternative remedies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1919(h)(7)(B)(ii) of the Act specifies that only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's remedies are imposed. As already discussed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the State's decision to terminate the provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement as well as impose alternative remedies prevails,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we do not believe the rules of section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act would govern the imposition of the alternative remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, where a SNF's or NF's deficiencies do not pose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, HCFA or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State may opt for a ``slow-track'' termination and apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or more alternative remedies in the interim period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the facility achieve substantial compliance before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date of the termination, as we would expect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur in almost every case, the termination action would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rescinded. Should the facility fail to correct deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the effective date of the termination, the termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would proceed, but neither the State nor the facility would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be liable to us for a repayment of funds for the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the identification of deficiencies. While we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not suggesting that States or HCFA make a decision to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminate a provider agreement in all cases where facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies have been identified, we believe it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important that States, and all others affected by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, be clear as to the consequences of using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various provisions of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have concluded that the approach we have described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above can be applied to SNFs as well as to NFs and dually-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating facilities. When we have identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies for SNFs and seek provider agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we would not be seeking only an alternative remedy. In such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, we believe the rules of section 1819(h)(2)(C) would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply since the State's recommendation is for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination and alternative remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe proceeding in the fashion we have described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to all nursing homes may strike the kind of balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Congress was seeking through its placing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies in greater prominence than had been the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case before nursing home reform. Most importantly, nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home residents would be protected, because the facilities in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they reside would have every incentive to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quickly in order to have alternative remedies lifted. With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that incentive, residents would face the unsatisfactory care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that gave rise to the enforcement action for only short  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods of time without facing the specter of relocating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were termination the first remedy of choice. Second,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States would have considerably more flexibility to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies knowing that neither they nor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility will be liable to us for the repayment of funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should a facility, in fact, fail to achieve substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance by the time that the termination action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective. Of course, the mandatory denial of payment which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State or the Secretary is required to impose after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third month of noncompliance would not require the State for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid or the facility for Medicare to sign an agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to repay Federal funds if substantial compliance is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believed that the continuation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of payments pending remediation provision should only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied in situations where the Secretary and the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagree about whether to terminate and the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that termination should occur but the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the facility can correct the problems. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter states:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

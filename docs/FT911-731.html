			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Pretoria and ANC move to end township violence: Mandela and de Klerk reach a 'broad consensus' on measures aimed at halting the bloodshed THE SOUTH African govern-ment and the African National Congress have reached outline agreement on measures to end violence in black townships, only hours before the ANC had threatened to pull out of talks on the country's political future. The agreement, which has still to be finalised, represents the best hope yet of halting violence which has left nearly 10,000 people dead in black townships since 1984. According to a statement released last night by the government, 'broad consensus' was reached on most issues after six hours of talks on Wednesday night between President FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the ANC. Officials from the two sides met yesterday to finalise details of the agreement, which involves a ban on the carrying of almost all so-called 'traditional weapons' in public. The statement said some remaining issues required further discussion, with talks to take place urgently. Those close to the talks said disputes over details - such as the convening of a planned conference on violence - could still sabotage a formal agreement. But there was no sign last night that the ANC intended to carry out its threat to boycott talks on a post-apartheid constitution, at least while negotiations continue. In an ultimatum issued last month, it had set a May 9 deadline for agreement on measures to end violence. Flexibility from Pretoria on the issue of 'traditional weapons' appears to have made it possible to avert deadlock. The Inkatha Freedom Party claims that Zulu culture requires the carrying of weapons such as knobkerries (clubs), assegais (spears) and pangas (machetes) at certain gatherings. But the sight of Zulus marching through black townships armed with such weapons has provoked confrontation, leading to hundreds of deaths. In a meeting on Tuesday, Mr de Klerk appears to have forced the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to agree that all such weapons apart from spears should be banned. Carrying such weapons in designated 'unrest areas' will now be prohibited while legislation covering the country as a whole will be reviewed. The statement made clear that agreement had yet to be reached on what constituted a cultural occasion at which spears could be carried and whether party political meetings qualified. It also indicated the two sides had failed to finalise arrangements to convene a multi-party conference on violence. Pretoria had said it would convene such a conference on May 24 and 25, but this was rejected by the ANC; the meeting now looks likely to be hosted jointly by the ANC, Inkatha and the government, under the auspices of a multi-denominational group of church leaders. Compromise has been reached, either before or during the talks, on six of seven demands contained in the ANC's ultimatum. So far, Pretoria has refused to act on the last one, the sacking of two ministers - General Magnus Malan at defence and Mr Adriaan Vlok at law and order. The statement said Mr de Klerk reiterated 'the standing policy of government requiring professionalism and the absolute impartiality of the police in maintaining law and order, in protecting lives and property and in crowd control'. The latest agreement itself may do little to achieve peace, however, until bilateral contact is resumed between the ANC and Inkatha, which severed relations last month. Although an obstacle to constitutional talks appears to have been removed, there is also likely to be little progress on this until the ANC has elected a new leadership at its planned national conference in July.</p>

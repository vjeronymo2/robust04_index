			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Clergy may lose security of tenure Consultations on whether clergy should become subject to conventional employment contracts are to be conducted by the the Church of England. At present more than two-thirds of the Church's stipendiary clergy are in post on the basis of the ecclesiastical freehold, meaning they cannot be moved against their will. A steering group on conditions of service decided this week to consult dioceses on seven possible alternative arrangements. The church's policy-making General Synod will debate the issue next year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PEI's equity contributions and loan proceeds will be used for recommissioning the Facility (including building the Liquefaction Unit and related equipment), operating and maintenance expenses, and working capital. Amounts in excess of $25 million necessary prior to the completion of the recommissioning of the Facility, including any necessary construction backstop and working capital, will be provided by Columbia LNG and/or the CLG Subsidiaries, as an equity contribution, up to $7.0 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By Commission order dated September 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25896) (``September Order''), Columbia and Columbia LNG were authorized to defer principal and interest payments on Columbia LNG's long- and short-term debt for the period September 30, 1993 through February 28, 1994. The aggregate amount of such deferred principal and interest payments is estimated to be $3.8 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia and Columbia LNG now propose to continue to defer principal and interest payments on Columbia LNG's long- and short-term debt for the period March 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994, or Construction Capital Closing, whichever is earlier. The aggregate amount of such principal and interest payments proposed to be deferred is $7.9 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia and Columbia LNG propose to proceed immediately upon Commission approval and prior to the issuance of the additional common stock by Columbia LNG to reduce the par value of Columbia LNG's common stock from $25 to $1 and increase the number of Columbia LNG's authorized shares to up to 15,000,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accomplishing this reduction in par value would involve the following steps: (i) Columbia LNG's certificate of incorporation would be amended to reduce the common stock's par value from $25.00 per share to $1.00 per share and to increase the number of Columbia LNG's authorized shares to up to 15,000,000; and (ii) the value of Columbia LNG's stated capital would be reduced by up to $24.00 per share of common stock outstanding, and such amount would be transferred to additional paid in capital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia and Columbia LNG also propose to proceed immediately after Construction Capital Closing with a recapitalization of Columbia LNG to establish a 100% equity capital structure for Columbia LNG. To effect this recapitalization, Columbia and Columbia LNG propose that Columbia make a capital contribution to Columbia LNG of up to $48.1 million of installment promissory notes and short-term debt. An additional amount up to $3.9 million would also be contributed which would consist of accrued interest to the effective date of the recapitalization deferred pursuant to this application-declaration and the interest which was deferred pursuant to the September Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia LNG also proposes to contribute the Facility to the Partnership at Construction Capital Closing in exchange for a 50% interest in the Partnership to be held directly by Columbia LNG and/or indirectly through one or more of the CLG Subsidiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, Columbia LNG and Columbia propose that through December 31, 1995, Columbia LNG offer to issue and sell to Columbia and Shell LNG, in proportion to their respective common stock holdings in Columbia LNG, up to 7,000,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, in an aggregate amount up to $7.0 million. The up to $7.0 million, together with funds on hand and anticipated tax benefits, will (i) provide for the continued operation and maintenance of the Facility pending Columbia LNG's contribution of the Facility to the Partnership; (ii) provide for continued expenditure of developmental costs prior to Construction Capital Closing; (iii) provide for any direct and indirect Columbia LNG cash capital contributions to the Partnership, including the recommissioning costs, if any, and (iv) provide for all other operating requirements of Columbia LNG through December 31, 1995. If Shell LNG chooses not to purchase any common stock, the entire amount up to $7.0 million will be purchased by Columbia, with a corresponding increase in Columbia's ownership of Columbia LNG. Some or all of the additional developmental costs incurred prior to Construction Capital Closing may be reimbursed to Columbia LNG by Cove Point Energy Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia LNG also proposes to create and fund the CLG Subsidiaries which will be operator of, and/or hold interests as partners in, the Partnership. At the time of the Construction Capital Closing, Columbia LNG anticipates transferring all current Columbia LNG employees to one or more of the CLG Subsidiaries which will hire additional employees as necessary to undertake day-to-day responsibility for operation of the various Partnership assets. The Partnership will reimburse the operator for all costs incurred by it in such operations and pay the operator certain management fees. After this transfer, Columbia LNG's principal assets will consist of its Partnership interest and its common stock holdings in the CLG Subsidiaries. To fund the CLG Subsidiaries' operating requirements through December 31, 1995, Columbia LNG proposes to acquire from the CLG Subsidiaries in the aggregate up to $1.0 million of common stock, $1 par value, to be issued and sold by the CLG Subsidiaries. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1815 GMT on 11 January broadcasts in its "Details"  program a feature by Sergey Dorenko, in which he reviews past  relations between the Russian president, government, and  parliament and looks at possible future developments.    The program includes recorded remarks from an interview with  Yegor Gaydar by Dorenko; the place and date of the interview are  not given.    Gaydar says: "The prime minister has consulted me regarding  proposals on reorganizing the government. Both the president  and the prime minister have asked me to stay in a new and  reorganized government. I know certain ideas and alternatives  that have been formulated in this area." Gaydar refuses to  divulge any details.    Dorenko then mentions that Gaydar's most recent meeting with  Yeltsin took place on 31 December, and asks Gaydar whether he  will be held responsible for somebody else's decisions. Gaydar  replies: "A situation, the ongoing situation, when someone else  is making decisions for which we have to bear responsibility is  absolutely intolerable to us. If, for instance, a decision is  taken against the will and position of our like-minded  colleagues... [pauses] I will fight to keep our monetary and  financial policy fairly consistent and will oppose irresponsible  decisions. I will fight to prevent some members of the Cabinet,  who are good guys, from making empty and irresponsible promises  while other members of the cabinet, the bad guys, have to  explain later why these promises could not be kept."    Dorenko concludes the program by saying that power in Russia  remains shrouded in secrecy, that is why his program contains so  many conjectures and too few facts.</p>

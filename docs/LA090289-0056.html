			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA TO PHASE OUT ALAR USE IN APPLES BY JUNE, 1991  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday that it will phase down  permissible levels of Alar in apple products over the next two years, with a  ban on the pesticide taking effect in June, 1991.  </P> <P> The EPA said it wanted to discourage further use of the plant growth regulator  by farmers, but that it did not want to move so quickly that crops treated with  Alar earlier this year would have to be removed from the market.  </P> <P> Under the EPA's proposed phase-out schedule, the current 20 parts per million  federal limit on Alar residues in apples and processed apple products would be  reduced to five parts per million on Nov. 30, 1989. The limit would be lowered  to 1 part per million in November, 1990, and any detectable level would be  illegal after May 31, 1991.  </P> <P> The agency said it set its schedule on the assumption that apples harvested  this fall would be available for another year at most and that apple juice and  sauce made from apples grown in 1989 would be out of the food system by the  spring of 1991.  </P> <P> The EPA said it was not necessary to immediately seize Alar-treated food  because studies showed that consumers faced no significant short-term health  risk from the pesticide, which is used on apples and other fruit to enhance  color, firmness and shelf life.  </P> <P> But the agency said it had new scientific data confirming its initial findings  that Alar poses an unacceptably high risk of cancer if regularly consumed over  a lifetime.  </P> <P> The EPA began a special review of Alar in 1984 due to cancer concerns, but the  agency took no action until earlier this year when an environmental group  released a study charging that children were at special risk from the  pesticide.  </P> <P> EPA officials challenged the findings of the Natural Resources Defense Council  study as overblown, but agreed that Alar posed unacceptable risks.  </P> <P> The agency said it also was revoking approval for use of Alar on cherries,  nectarines, peaches, pears, peanuts, grapes, tomato transplants and ornamental  plants.  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Jamaica takes steps to curb election violence JAMAICA'S political leaders have signed a code of conduct in an attempt to reduce party political violence in the last week of campaigning for next Tuesday's general election. The code, which constrains politicians from statements and action which could inflame political passions, follows clashes between party factions and which the police say have caused six deaths and several injuries. A similar code of conduct, signed before the last election four years ago, is credited with having reduced political tensions and violence. Police say 17 people were killed in incidents associated with party politics in the 1989 election. In 1980 about 600 of the 800 deaths in Jamaica that year were attributed to party political violence in the poll campaign. Public opinion polls published at the weekend have given Mr P J Patterson's incumbent People's National party a four-point lead over the Jamaica Labour party of Mr Edward Seaga, a former prime minister.</p>

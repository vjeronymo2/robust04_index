			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / The Blue Arrow trial: County man 'unaware' of stake MR PETER DALE, former managing director of County NatWest Securities, yesterday insisted to the Blue Arrow trial that he had no knowledge of other shares taken by County NatWest, CNWS's merchant banking co-subsidiary, until the day the holding of a discloseable stake was publicly announced. Mr Dale, a prosecution witness, said that until December 17 1987 he did not know of the stake, worth almost 5 per cent of Blue Arrow, bought by County's corporate advisory division. He knew only of the 4.5 per cent holding taken by CNWS and a similar stake held by Phillips &amp; Drew which, along with County, advised Blue Arrow on its 1987 rights issue. County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals all deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m rights issue. Mr Dale said he had seen no problem in CNWS accepting its 31m shares from County's corporate advisory division. 'It was only a problem if you were aware, as NatWest's senior management were, of the corporate advisory holding and the P&amp;D holding,' he told Mr Alun Jones QC, for Mr Stephen Clark, a County director and one of the defendants. He denied the suggestion from Mr Jones that he had known what was going on. Mr Dale agreed that he had allowed Stock Exchange rules to be breached by delaying the reporting to the exchange that the 5 per cent disclosure limit had been exceeded in normal trading, but described this as 'relatively trivial'. Mr Dale told the court that he had been informed by Miss Elizabeth Brimelow, then compliance director, that County was considering making a larger disclosure and that the matter was being dealt with at a senior level within NatWest, the parent bank. When he learnt of the stake held by the corporate advisory division, he had said the full holding should be disclosed. However, since he still thought legal advice had been taken, his concern was not fully aroused. The trial continues today.</p>

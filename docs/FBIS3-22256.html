			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.J. Mcllroy: ``Beaches Left Polluted by Rubbish </F> of 28 Nations'']    [Text] British beaches are being polluted by waste dumped  illegally from shipping traced to 28 different countries,  according to the Marine Conservation Society.    Many stretches of coastline were in a ``scandalous'' state  with tons of debris and sewage-related waste strewn around, the  society said yesterday.    Typical of items dumped by passing shipping were aerosol  cans  and a log book of shipping channels from Germany; a milk carton  from India; a shampoo bottle from Japan; two batteries from  Poland; a plastic sauce bottle from Spain; a drinks container  from China, and a large plastic drum, margarine tub lid and  plastic bottle from Holland. ``All the items had their own  language on the debris, ruling out the possibility the items had  been bought and disposed of in the UK,'' the society said.    The society was reporting on Beachwatch '93, a  clean-up operation of 121 beaches it launched last September  with Reader's Digest.    ``The major source of plastic waste was from shipping,''  said  Miss Cait Loretto, marine science officer with the society.  ``This shows that existing legislation is not only ineffectual  but is also being widely ignored.''    ``The maximum fine for catching an offender is &pound;450  in the  UK. In the United States a cruise liner was recently fined more  than &pound;200,000 for dumping plastic -- now that is something  like a deterrent.''    She said the Environmental Protection Act 1990 put the onus  on local authorities to keep public places up to a certain  standard of cleanliness -- a standard many beaches failed to  meet.    ``Some beaches are regularly cleaned from May to September  but this still fails to ensure that the majority are free from  litter.''    The findings of Beachwatch '93 are based on the  results of the clean-up campaign during which more than 1,000  volunteers cleared 33 tons of rubbish from 121 British beaches.    A total of 114,880 items found included 51 percent made of  plastic ``providing a real threat to marine life.'' Eleven  percent were sewage related, among them condoms, tampons, panty  liners, cotton buds and nappies.    The society said it wanted to put pressure on the Government  for better legislation, better disposal facilities and better  sewage treatment ``so our beautiful beaches can be made safe and  pleasant for all.''</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY RALLIES TO ASSIST FAMILY RAVAGED BY DEATH, FIRE  </P> <P> Community members are rallying to support the family of Jimmy De La Riva, the  4-year-old boy who died in an apartment fire last Friday as his father looked  on helplessly.  </P> <P> Lori and Joseph De La Riva and their four young children whom Joseph rescued  from the blaze have been living in a motel room paid for by the Red Cross. The  organization also paid for funeral services for Jimmy, who was buried Wednesday  in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Employees at the Tustin post office, where the boy's mother has worked for  about a month, have raised more than $700 for the family and plan to hold a  bake sale Tuesday to raise more money.  </P> <P> More than $1,500 has been donated to a memorial fund established by the boy's  grandmother, Josie Ruiz, at the Bank of America branch in Tustin.  </P> <P> Ruiz said the family members are holding up well emotionally, although they  remain angry that police officers blocked Joseph De La Riva from trying to  rescue his son. Officers said he could have been killed in the attempt to bring  Jimmy out. De La Riva rushed Joseph Jr., 7, and Adam, 6, out the front door of  the burning apartment before carrying out Micah, 3, and Sarah, 1 1/2.  </P> <P> "We are more at peace now," Ruiz said. "We're doing a lot better. We had a  beautiful service. We know he's in a safe place. The pastor said he's playing  in the streets of gold."  </P> <P> Ruiz said the family is touched by the response of the community.  </P> <P> "People from all over the county are donating money," she said. "Five dollars  here or $10 there, but it's adding up. We hope it brings a lot of families  closer together."  </P> <P> The fire caused an estimated $80,000 damage to the three-bedroom apartment on  Bliss Lane and destroyed most of the family's belongings.  </P> <P> "They lost everything," Ruiz said. "They had no savings. Whatever money they  had was in Joe's wallet and that was lost in the fire too."  </P> <P> Erla Sine, a postal worker who is helping organize the bake sale, said De La  Riva's co-workers wanted to help after learning of the tragedy. Donations of  baked goods are being solicited for Tuesday's sale at the post office parking  lot, 340 E. 1st St., from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.  </P> <P> "We don't think our employees alone will supply enough to last all day," Sine  said. "With just our employees, we'd probably sell out by 11. There's only  about 100 of us."  </P> <P> Ruiz said the family has received donations of clothing, furniture and  household goods, but is still in need of many items. They are looking for an  apartment, she said, because they will be leaving the motel Friday.  </P></p>

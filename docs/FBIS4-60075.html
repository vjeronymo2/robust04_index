			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Elections Now"] </F>   [Text] It was a mistake to bet on Yasir 'Arafat from the  very beginning. 'Arafat's almost 30 years of experience in  control of Fatah and the PLO attest not only to his talent for  survival but also to the guilefulness that renders him  untrustworthy. He has not undergone the necessary and hoped-for  metamorphosis from the leader of a national liberation movement,  operating partially in exile and even clandestinely, to a  statesman. He has failed to rise to the greatness of the hour  and is returning not to the Gaza Strip and Jericho, but back to  his old tricks.    'Arafat, however, is not the PLO or the Palestinian people.  It was he who signed the Cairo agreement with Yitzhaq Rabin but  the relations between the two peoples and their respective  political entities cannot depend on the nature of changing  leaders, who are mere mortals subject to political transitions.  'Arafat's inflammatory sermon in Johannesburg is a serious  matter not because it addressed the question of Jerusalem --  Israel is indeed obligated to discuss all the issues, including  East Jerusalem and the settlements, in the negotiations over the  permanent arrangement, even if the Palestinian yarn spinner made  up a "letter from Rabin" for the benefit of his audience -- but  because the hallowed words of peace can no longer be voiced by a  person who calls for jihad. If the sermon was some kind of  tactical move designed to mobilize support for 'Arafat's  policies then it is a mistake because there are also skeptics  among the Israeli public and these kinds of tricks discourage  them from supporting the political process. If it is an  indication of 'Arafat's substantive position, along the lines of  the "phased" doctrine, then it proves that 'Arafat is deluding  himself that Israel is so weakened that its withdrawal will not  stop at the Green Line. Whichever way, 'Arafat, personally, is  no longer a credible partner for negotiations.    In the Declaration of Principles, Israel pledged to hold  elections in the territories within three months of implementing  the first stage of withdrawal in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.  This stage has now been completed and the countdown for  elections should begin. Contrary to his earlier eagerness to  incorporate this clause into the agreement (in order to use it  to include East Jerusalem), 'Arafat now seeks to rule the  territories without elections. Israel shares this interest to  the extent that it is a partner to 'Arafat's concern over the  rise of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and similar  organizations; however, Israel's partnership with 'Arafat does  not involve supporting him against the PLO's middle generation,  which is poised to fight for its inclusion in the territories'  leadership.    Israel must insist on the implementation of the clause on  elections in the territories following sufficient preparations  that should last not three but six months. Israel should make  the continuation of the process conditional on the holding of  elections with the participation of all parties whose declared  goal is to make peace with Israel, without the threat of any  jihads. In other words, not Hamas, not the Islamic Jihad, not  the rejectionist fronts, and perhaps not even 'Arafat. Israel  must negotiate with the authorized representatives of the  Palestinian people but not with those who stick the agreement in  their pocket and then threaten a ruthless war to achieve the  rest of their objectives, a war over everything.</p>

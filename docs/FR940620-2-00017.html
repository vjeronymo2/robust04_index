Columbia LNG requests authorization to (i) add a new point of delivery for Washington Gas Light Company (Washington); and (ii) construct and operate a new 12-inch tap at White Plains, Charles County, Maryland from which gas will be delivered to Washington. Columbia LNG and Cove Point LNG request expeditious consideration of their application due to an urgent request from Washington to have the tap in place by the up-coming winter heating season to avoid the kind of pressure-related difficulties experienced by Washington on its southern Maryland system during the severe weather last winter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia LNG and Cove Point LNG request that the Commission act upon the application independently of the applications filed by Columbia LNG in Docket No. CP94&hyph;57&hyph;000, as amended, and Cove Point LNG in Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000, as amended. Columbia LNG has an application pending in Docket No. CP94&hyph;57&hyph;000, as amended, in which it is seeking authorization to abandon its facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction and to transfer those facilities to Cove Point LNG. Cove Point LNG has an application pending in Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000, as amended, in which Cove Point LNG is,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , seeking authorization (i) to acquire Columbia LNG's facilities; (ii) for a blanket construction certificate; and (iii) to provide firm peaking services and firm and interruptible transportation on an open access and non-discriminatory basis under subpart G of Part 284 of the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that Commission action in this proceeding occurs after acceptance of a certificate by Cove Point LNG in Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000 and the transfer of the facilities to Cove Point LNG, Columbia LNG and Cove Point LNG request that the authorization granted in this proceeding be issued to Cove Point LNG or in the alternative, be freely transferable by Columbia LNG to Cove Point LNG. Columbia LNG and Cove Point LNG state that Cove Point LNG is a party to this proceeding in order to facilitate this request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before July 5, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214 (1993)) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10 (1993)). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

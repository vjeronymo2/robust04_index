			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the vernal pool fairy shrimp has a relatively wide range, the majority of known populations inhabit vernal pools with clear to tea-colored water, most commonly in grass or mud bottomed swales, or basalt flow depression pools in unplowed grasslands, but one population occurs in sandstone rock outcrops and another population in alkaline vernal pools. The vernal pool fairy shrimp has been collected from early December to early May. The water in pools inhabited by this species has low TDS, conductivity, alkalinity, and chloride (Collie and Lathrop 1976). This species has a sporadic distribution within vernal pool complexes (Jones and Stokes, 1992, 1993; County of Sacramento 1990; Patton 1984; Stromberg 1993; Sugnet and Associates 1993b) wherein the majority of pools in a given complex typically are not inhabited by the species. Simovich  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1992) reported that the vernal pool fairy shrimp typically is found at low population densities. Only rarely does the vernal pool fairy shrimp co-occur with other fairy shrimp species, but where it does, the vernal pool fairy shrimp is never the numerically dominant one (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990). Although it can mature quickly, allowing populations to persist in short-lived shallow pools, it also persists later into the spring where pools are longer lasting (Simovich  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). Sugnet and Associates (1993b) listed 178 records for the species out of 3092 ``discrete locations'' containing potential habitat in their report. These 178 records represent the 32 known populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp, which extend from Stillwater Plain in Shasta County through most of the length of the Central Valley to Pixley in Tulare County, and along the central coast range from northern Solano County to Pinnacles in San Benito County (Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990; M. Fugate, pers. comm., 1991; Sugnet &amp; Associates 1993b). Five of these populations are believed to be comprised of a single inhabited pool. Four additional, disjunct populations exist; one near Soda Lake in San Luis Obispo County, one in the mountain grasslands of northern Santa Barbara County, one near the Santa Rosa Plateau in Riverside County, and one near Rancho California in Riverside County. Three of these four isolated populations contain only a single known pool occupied by the vernal pool fairy shrimp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The vernal pool tadpole shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lepidurus packardi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), a member of the family Triopsidae, was described by Eugene Simon in 1866 (Longhurst 1955a). Longhurst (1955a) placed the name in synonymy with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lepidurus apus.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequently, Lynch (1972) examined the taxa and determined that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lepidurus packardi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is a valid species. The Service accepts Lynch's taxonomic treatment of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lepidurus,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which maintains  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. packardi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vernal pool tadpole shrimp adults reach a length of 50 millimeters (2 inches). They have about 35 pairs of legs and two long cercopods. This species superficially resembles the ricefield tadpole shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Triops longicaudatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). However,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lepidurus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> possess a flat paddle-shaped supra-anal plate that is entirely lacking in members of the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Triops <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Pennak 1989; R. Brusca  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992; M. Simovich  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992; J. King  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992). The vernal pool tadpole shrimp is known from 18 populations in the Central Valley, ranging from east of Redding in Shasta County south through the Central Valley to the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge in Merced County, and from a single vernal pool complex located on the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in the City of Fremont, Alameda County. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The vernal pool tadpole shrimp inhabits vernal pools containing clear to highly turbid water, ranging in size from 5 square meters (54 square feet) in the Mather Air Force Base area of Sacramento County, to the 36 hectare (89 acre) Olcott Lake at Jepson Prairie. The pools at Jepson Prairie and Vina Plains have a very low conductivity, TDS, and alkalinity (Barclay and Knight 1984; Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990). These pools are located most commonly in grass bottomed swales of grasslands in old alluvial soils underlain by hardpan or in mud-bottomed pools containing highly turbid water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The life history of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is linked to the phenology of the vernal pool habitat. After winter rainwater fills the pools, the populations are reestablished from diapaused eggs that lie dormant in the dry pool sediments (Ahl 1991; Lanway 1974). Ahl (1991) found that eggs in one pool hatched within three weeks of inundation and maturated to sexually reproductive adults in another three to four weeks. Simovich  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1992) reported sexually mature adults occurred in another pool three to four weeks after the pools had been filled. A female surviving to large size may lay up to six clutches of eggs, totaling about 861 eggs in her lifetime (Ahl 1991). The eggs are sticky and readily adhere to plant matter and sediment particles (Simovich  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). A portion of the eggs hatch immediately and the rest enter diapause and remain in the soil to hatch during later rainy seasons (Ahl 1991). The vernal pool tadpole shrimp matures slowly and is a long-lived species (Ahl 1991; Alexander 1976). Adults are often present and reproductive until the pools dry up in the spring (Ahl 1991; Simovich  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ms. Roxanne Bittman petitioned the Service to list the Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and California linderiella as endangered species in a letter dated November 19, 1990, which was received by the Service on November 20, 1990. Ms. Bittman submitted additional information on these species in a letter dated November 20, 1990, which was received on November 26, 1990. On March 21, 1991, the Service made a 90-day finding that the petition contained substantial information indicating that the action requested may be warranted. A notice announcing this finding was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 30, 1991 (56 FR 426968). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ms. Dee Warenycia petitioned the Service to list the vernal pool tadpole shrimp as an endangered species in a letter dated April 28, 1991, which was received by the Service on April 30, 1991. On November 21, 1991, the Service determined in the administrative 90-day finding that the petition contained substantial information that the action requested may be warranted. On May 8, 1992, the Service published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 19856) to list the four fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp as endangered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments and Recommendations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the May 8, 1992, proposed rule (57 FR 19856) and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might assist the Service in determining whether these taxa warrant listing. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, including affected planning departments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Notices of this proposal were published in the Santa Rosa Press Democrat, San Francisco Chronicle, Monterey Herald, Chico Enterprise Record, San Luis Obispo Telegram-Tribune, Santa Barbara News-Press, Modesto Bee, Sacramento Bee, and the Fresno Bee on June 5, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 4, 1992, the Service received a written request for a public hearing from Mr. George Robson of the Tehama County Planning Department. Several other requests for a public hearing also were received. As a result, on August 13, 1992, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 36380) announcing the public hearing and reopening the comment period until September 18, 1992. The Service conducted a public hearing on August 31, 1992, at the Radisson Hotel in Sacramento, California. Testimony was taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Twenty-one persons presented testimony. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / N-waste problems mount for Ukraine THE previously well-integrated nuclear network of the former Soviet Union has been thrown into disarray by disagreements between the recently formed republics. The most immediate and dangerous result is the difficulty Ukraine now faces disposing of its nuclear waste. Yesterday, directors of Ukrainian nuclear power stations were in the Russian region of Krasnoyarsk to salvage a deal allowing them to continue shipping nuclear waste to the sparsely-populated region. Traditionally, the 10 VVR1000 nuclear reactors in Ukraine have stored their waste in Krasnoyarsk. But this year, according to Ukraine's industry minister, Mr Viktor Hladush, the region attached food supplies to the issue. In exchange for guarantees that Ukraine will supply butter and sugar at 1991 levels, Mr Hladush believes Krasnoyarsk will take the waste. Ukraine has undertaken to supply the Russian republic but Krasnoyarsk leaders are insisting on a separate agreement. Mr Hladush warned that as the Soviet economy disintegrated each link in the Soviet nuclear power chain was fragile. 'From Zhovti Vody (in south-eastern Ukraine) to Krasnoyarsk, every region could put forward a similar ultimatum,' he said. He added that Ukraine had also to find new purchasers for uranium and heavy water because cuts in the Soviet nuclear arsenal had reduced domestic requirements. The problem, he said, was that 'we cannot sell to those countries who want to buy'. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry has highlighted a new source of tension with Russia over the division of conventional forces. An official said Russia was demanding two-thirds of all land-based hardware belonging to what was once the Soviet army and three-quarters of all aircraft. Ukraine insists on keeping all military hardware, apart from nuclear missiles, stationed on its territory. Some of the best hardware is stationed in Ukraine. It would also be difficult to transfer the conventional forces from Ukraine without the republic's consent because nearly half of all Soviet soldiers stationed there have sworn an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. A Ukrainian defence official said agreement with Russia was close on strategic forces, which had been viewed as the more contentious issue.</p>

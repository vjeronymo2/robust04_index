			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Ukrainian </F> Supreme Council plenary session in Kiev on 1 June -- recorded]    [Text] Esteemed people's deputies, I am convinced that the  Supreme Council is taking very important and proper steps by  considering at its plenary sitting, for the second time in such  a short space of time, the problems connected with Crimea. I am  convinced that if the Supreme Council of the previous  convocation had approached this issue in a similar way then we  probably would not have had so many problems today.    Recent events that have taken place in the Republic of  Crimea  are causing serious anxiety and worry both in Ukraine and beyond  it, and in Europe as well as in the world community. At issue  is not only the safeguarding of Ukraine's territorial integrity  but the preservation of peace and security, above all, on the  European continent. The present situation which is unfolding in  the Republic of Crimea requires a profound and detailed  discussion by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, and I support the  speeches made here today. They also demand that the Supreme  Council adopt decisions appropriate to the situation.    As you know, on 10 May this year, the Supreme Council of  Ukraine adopted a resolution on suspending the actions of the  law of the Republic of Crimea on restoring the constitutional  bases of Crimea's statehood. It was proposed that the Crimean  Supreme Council should, within 10 days, bring the Crimean  Constitution into line with the Constitution of Ukraine and the  law of Ukraine on the division of powers between the bodies of  state powers of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. Ukraine's  Supreme Council created a commission in order to hold talks with  Crimea's Supreme Council on this issue. Talks were held between  the delegations of both Supreme Councils, according to the  results of which the delegations agreed to form a joint working  group to elaborate the agreed proposals of Ukraine's Supreme  Council and Crimea's Supreme Council.    In addition, according to the results of these talks, it was  proposed that the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Councils should,  within three days, discuss suspending the acts adopted on 20 May  this year for the duration of the working group's activities.    The 10-day period has elapsed; however, Crimea's Supreme  Council has not brought Crimea's Constitution into line with  Ukraine's Constitution. Therefore, the power bodies of the  Republic of Crimea are continuing the policy of ignoring the  Ukrainian Constitution, our state's legislation, Supreme Council  resolutions, and generally recognized principles and norms of  international law. The question arises: Is this an accident or  is it connected with the failure by the Crimean powers to  understand the situation, or could it be a reflection of the  strategic policy which the leadership of the Republic of Crimea  is implementing?    Our assessment testifies to the fact that this is not an  accident. The point is not in a good or a bad president but  lies elsewhere.    A political force -- a party -- came to power in Crimea that  proclaimed the secession of the Republic of Crimea from Ukraine  and the return of the Republic of Crimea to Russia as its  strategic course. This is the strategic course. This strategic  course is divided into stages. The first stage is the adoption  of a constitution that, in essence, would mean or would let  everyone understand or draw the conclusion that Crimea is an  independent state and that, as such, it can decide on its future  on a contractual basis. In other words, it can decide on it in  a constitutional way, so to say, proceeding, however, from the  provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea only  and ignoring the laws and the Constitution of Ukraine.    There is yet another way that is also being discussed. I  would like us to discuss about this openly today. This way is  the restoration of the former Soviet Union -- the fact of which  is exactly the solution to all problems. In other words, all  the problems would be removed because there would be no states.  Their status would be changed. The problem of their  territorial integrity, sovereignty and so on, would acquire  quite a different nature, or -- let us say this openly -- states  would cease to exist as such. These are the two ways as they  are viewed in Crimea.    Why are they insisting on the first way? Because they are  not convinced that it would be such a simple issue for Crimea to  return to the Soviet Union and, speaking openly, it is not such  a simple and realistic option within the composition of states  of the former USSR. I stress: Any kind of explanations by the  power structures of Crimea that they are acting in this way  simply because Ukraine or its powers are so principled has  absolutely no basis to it. This is meant for naive people.  They say that if Kravchuk had not adopted these decrees on  reconstituting the structures of the state security bodies --  the Internal Affairs Ministry -- then, they say, perhaps the  Supreme Council of Crimea would not have adopted the law. Such  an explanation is being proffered. Furthermore, they say that  if President Kravchuk had not implemented the Supreme Council  resolution -- incidentally the Supreme Council gave me a month  to do this -- on creating a representation in Crimea, the  situation would not have become so exacerbated. So, these are  the explanations which some of them use to taunt us.    But this is not the point. I stress, the point is in the  implementation of a strategic policy by a force that has come to  power. These explanations are meant for the people and not as a  serious policy. Please tell me why the Crimean authorities  react so sharply to any Ukrainian -- I stress Ukrainian --  presence in Crimea? It is because they want to prove  unambiguously to everybody that Crimea and Ukraine have nothing  in common with each other. They say that there is something in  the constitution which could be interpreted differently. Once  again, however, this is meant for the people. They say to  Ukraine: You want to satisfy your ambitions that Crimea is in  the composition of Ukraine; then, de jure, we could write  something which is ambiguous but de facto you are not there  anymore: you are not present in the power bodies nor in relation  to any specific issue. This is the reality, and it is being  consistently implemented step by step in relation to the armed  forces, dual citizenship, and citizenship. If you analyze all  these problems then the result is unambiguous, and I came to  this conclusion at the very beginning.    It is therefore clear today that we need to define our  position in, as they say, an unambiguous way. Or we could, as  some people are proposing, agree to anything just to maintain  peace and quiet, and I am also in favor of this. But I am in  favor of peace and quiet in relation to one thing only -- to  place Crimea within the framework of the Constitution and laws.  If we can do this -- and we are obliged to place Crimea within  the framework of the constitution and laws -- then all other  issues will be resolved. I repeat: All other issues will be  resolved. There will be compromises, flexibility, and other  things, and everything will be done by Ukraine's executive  authorities and the Ukrainian president in order to find accord,  cooperation, and mutual understanding. But if this basic and  fundamental issue -- to the effect that Crimea is in the  framework of Ukraine's constitution and laws -- is not finally  resolved, then none of the other issues will be resolved. This  is the founding principle and we should begin from this.    What is happening in Crimea today is, I repeat, a very  dangerous precedent. We should give it a clear legal  assessment. The leadership of the Supreme Council of Crimea  ignores the fact that the Republic of Crimea is an autonomous  and constituent part of Ukraine, with broad rights in the  socioeconomic and cultural spheres, and in the sphere of  organizing social life. At the same time, the Republic of  Crimea, as an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine, is not  a bearer of state sovereignty and, in accordance with our  constitution, cannot enter into political relations with foreign  states.    The renewal of the principles within the Crimean  constitution that the Republic of Crimea builds its relations  with Ukraine on a contractual basis contravenes the autonomy's  constitutional status. They often cite the fact that in the  Russian Federation there are contractual relations between the  Federation and subjects of the Federation, particularly in  Tatarstan. If you familiarize yourself with this document which  we have here and which could be given to you -- it is not a  secret document, it has been published and so on -- yes, this is  an agreement, but even in the agreement which they are citing,  the authorities of the federal power are clearly defined: the  Army, the internal affairs bodies, and the security bodies all  belong to the authority of the federal power. In Crimea they  want these areas to be completely within the competence of  Crimea. This is nothing but a collapse of the entire defense  system, a collapse of Ukraine's sovereignty as a state and those  forces which should defend the inviolability of borders of the  state's sovereignty and integrity.    What is being adopted by the Supreme Council and the  president of Crimea is a practical transformation of autonomy  into a bearer of state sovereignty and its secession from the  composition of Ukraine, despite the slogans which may conceal  this. In a legal sense it is necessary to stress that the  constitution of Ukraine is valid throughout Ukraine, including  the territory of the Republic of Crimea. The autonomy's  constitution cannot contravene the constitution of Ukraine. The  territory of Ukraine, which also includes the territory of  Crimea, is single, indivisible, inviolable, and integral. Any  changes to Ukraine's territory or state borders are not  permitted without the agreement of the people of Ukraine. We  all, both the executive and the legislative powers, should  defend the integrity, inviolability, and indivisibility of our  state. I hope that nobody has any doubt about this here.    In connection with the attempts to introduce its own  citizenship within the Republic of Crimea, I stress: The  Republic of Crimea does not have its own citizenship which is  separate from Ukraine's. This is not envisaged anywhere.  Incidentally, I do not know, but perhaps someone has  information about world practice where, for example, part of a  state has its own citizenship. [Word indistinct] legal  assessment requires a decision by the leadership of the Republic  of Crimea with regard to the subordination of Ukraine's security  services, internal affairs bodies, and other armed formations.  In accordance with the law of Ukraine on the division of powers  between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Republic of  Crimea, and other laws of Ukraine, these issues cannot be  decided by the higher bodies of state power of the Republic of  Crimea. They are decided solely by Ukraine.    Blatant violations of Ukraine's Consitution, of Ukraine's  legislation, and of international legal norms are being carried  out by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea, despite the  fact that the higher bodies of state power of Ukraine, I stress,  have created exceptionally broad possibilities for independently  resolving the most important problems for the peninsula's  population. It was the Supreme Council of Ukraine itself that  gave the Crimean oblast the status of autonomy. Laws were  adopted on the division of powers between the bodies of power of  Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. A year ago -- as long ago as  June 1993 -- the president of Ukraine signed a decree on an open  economic system for the territory of the Republic of Crimea.  Following this decree -- and this is very important -- we gave  the Republic of Crimea the possibility of acting within broad  legal limits in the economic sphere, I stress within broad legal  limits. The Republic of Crimea requested that the Ukrainian  Government change the budgetary relations, and the Government  fully accepted the proposals submitted by the Republic of  Crimea. Therefore, today this issue has been taken off the  agenda, in the sense that Crimea's budget has certain rights,  although it is true that Crimea today does not fulfil its  obligations in relation to Ukraine's budget, and does not pay  what it should pay according to the norms and (?payments) of the  budget's clauses.    Second, the president of Crimea issued a host of decrees on  currency regulation and on taxation, which placed the Republic  of Crimea in an appropriate regional condition. We knew that  there were certain violations, but we did not demand that they  should be repealed because we wanted to give the Crimea the  chance to act autonomously in the economic sphere if the  Crimeans themselves wanted this. I stress, there are no poblems  today with regard to any restrictions in Crimea's economic  sphere. Moreover, we see that this is leading to certain  complications in economic relations, which has affected money  and other issues from one region to another.    Now we are also thinking about how we can take certain steps  on a Ukrainian-wide scale. I will tell you: I have instructed  the Government to prepare a whole package of documents on  changing the taxation system, which will be sent to the oblasts  for analysis, and then passed to the Ukrainian Supreme Council  for adoption. Concern is being caused by the fact that in order  to carry out its economic and political strategy, the senior  leadership of the Republic of Crimea is attracting, on a wide  basis, specialists and personnel from Russia. I think there is  even a certain contempt for local cadres, and there are such  experts in Crimea who are experienced and who could take charge  of the most important posts in the republic. However, the  problem is set in such a way as to make it seem as though these  cadres are not capable, and therefore one needs to attract  personnel only from Russia.    I am not even talking about certain violations here with  regard to the principle of Ukraine's law on citizenship. I  granted Premier Yevhen Saburov Ukrainian citizenship, but this  was an exception. I have the right to do this, but it is an  exception. But what about the others? There are no exceptions.  So once again, even here there are certain deviations from  Ukrainian laws. This is the practical and legal aspect, but the  moral and ethnic aspect of this lies in the fact that there is a  direct contempt for cadres who were raised in Crimea. This is a  direct contempt.    A number of resolutions on guaranteeing the socio-economic  development of the peninsula were adopted by the Ukrainian  Cabinet of Ministers. Among them are resolutions on the  division of property in state ownership, general state  ownership, and the property of the Republic of Crimea.  Therefore, I conclude that all issues pertaining to the economy  which the Republic of Crimea puts forward are being tackled by  the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Government. Taking  into account that, during the last month the leadership of the  Republic of Crimea has adopted a number of acts that contravene  the Ukrainian Constitution and Ukrainian legislation, the  president of Ukraine, as guarantor of the Constitution, has  repealed a number of decrees issued by the Crimean president.  You are aware of these decrees.    Taking into account the considerable complexity of the crime  situation in the Republic of Crimea and the growth in organized  crime and serious crimes, a decree issued by the president of  Ukraine reorganized the security service, the internal affairs  and justice bodies, and the main directorates of the relevant  bodies of Ukrainian state executive power in the Republic of  Crimea. Taking into account all these steps by the executive  authority, it must be noted that the situation that has arisen  in the Republic of Crimea requires the adoption of appropriate  acts by the Ukrainian Supreme Council. The situation whereby a  legal uncertainty exists in relations between Ukraine and its  autonomous part cannot remain indefinitely. We cannot permit a  further exacerbation of the situation on the peninsula itself.  Proceeding namely from these deliberations, I propose the  following:    First, to ensure -- and what is more, I would like it do be  done without delay -- the formation of a Constitutional Court of  Ukraine. The decisions of the Supreme Council of Crimea which  contradict Ukraine's Constitution and legislation must be  abrogated by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine.    However, the following variant is also possible: when the  Supreme Council itself abrogates the decisions by the Supreme  Council of Crimea, but then amendments should be introduced to  the Constitution. The Constitution does not envisage an  abrogation. It was envisaged to stop the effect of these  decisions by the Crimean parliament. Read carefully. So, we  stop them. Then you have already stopped them -- but for how  long?    I underscore that it should be clearly determined who is to  abrogate. It is the Constitutional Court which abrogates.    On my part, I can submit candidatures for the Constitutional  Court of Ukraine very soon.    Second, it is expedient to introduce amendments and  additions  to the Law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the  state power bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. This  law must determine, in a more exact and specific manner, the  competence of the autonomy, expand plenary powers -- however,  within the limits of the recognition of the main principal  postulate that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine. And it  is necessary to take into account the changes which have already  taken place. This is because the election of the president of  Crimea requires the introduction of relevant legal changes to  the law on the delimitation of powers between the state power  bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea.    By the way, it would be good for us to determine our stand  in  relation to actions by the Republic of Crimea concerning this  law. You will remember, when the Supreme Council was adopting  it, the following provision was entered into the resolution:  that it comes into effect when the Republic of Crimea brings its  constitution in line with the Constitution of Ukraine. But it  has not been changed to date. Moreover, such amendments have  been introduced which entirely ignore, or mainly ignore, the  Constitution and laws of Ukraine.    Third, I believe the following must also be done: to  introduce amendments and additions to the laws of Ukraine on the  security service of Ukraine, and on the militia, which was  adopted back in 1990, and other enactments which regulate the  activities of so-called power-wielding structures within the  Republic of Crimea. The situation there at present is not  simple, as far as the power-wielding structures are concerned --  the militia first and foremost.    In the current conditions, in order to preserve peace and  quiet on the peninsula, these structures within the Republic of  Crimea must be subordinate solely to the center, as is the case  in any state. We cannot and we have no right to allow the  bodies called upon to ensure the protection of public order, the  safety of the citizens and the state, to be turned into  political organizations. Every power institution should exercise  the powers established for it by law.    It is necessary to build budgetary relations between the  Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Crimean Government on a  legal basis. We have made such a decision at a governmental  level, but this must be regulated by law.    Next, with the aim of establishing contacts between the  Supreme Council of Ukraine and the Supreme Council of Crimea,  and more efficient parliamentary control over the situation in  the Republic of Crimea, I would propose setting up a  subcommission within one of the commissions that have already  been set up at the Supreme Council. This subcommission would  deal exclusively with Crimean issues at the Supreme Council of  Ukraine.    One can agree to the proposal by individual people's  deputies  of Ukraine on inaugurating the post of a Ukrainian vice premier  dealing with territorial issues, taking into account that not  only Crimean problems exist, but that, first and foremost,  territorial problems exist and will exist in the economic  sphere, too. I believe this is of great importance.    Completion of the negotiating process with Russia on  dividing the Black Sea Fleet is of principal importance for the  settlement of the Crimean issue. Apart from proportions and the  principles of division, this issue has two more aspects.    First, it is necessary to solve the issue of taking the two  fleets to different bases and, second, to determine clearly and  legally the status of the Russian fleet, which will be  temporarily based on Ukraine's territory. To determine the  status.    The solution of dividing the Black Sea Fleet will have a  significant positive influence on developments in Crimea and  will ease tensions in Ukrainian-Russian relations. The efforts  of the Ukrainian delegation, led by Acting Premier Yukhym  Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy, at the negotiations with Russian  Premier Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin in Moscow on 23-25 May  this year were targeted at achieving this very goal.    The stand of the Ukrainian side at these negotiations took  into account the fact that, in the present-day conditions,  Russia objectively has no real alternatives to basing its fleet  on the Black Sea. It has no alternatives. We accept this.  Ukraine is striving toward such a decision on the Black Sea  Fleet issue which, as a whole, would correspond to our national  interests and take into account in real terms Russia's needs to  ensure its security in a southerly direction. However, it is  clear that this issue will not be always be tackled in the same  way. Russia must set up a base for its fleet on its own  territory. This is how our delegation posed this question.    An agreement began to take shape on the fleet issues after  the negotiations in Moscow on 23-25 May. This refers to such  issues as the division of the floating means, on a principle,  according to which, Ukraine takes the necessary number of ships;  compensation for that part of the ships which Ukraine does not  need today, and for the use of certain Ukrainian territories by  Russia for the temporary basing of its fleet; determining the  conditions of granting part of the shore-based infrastructure of  Crimea to Russia on lease to ensure the needs of its fleet; and  the division of the coastal defense forces, marine infantry, and  land-based naval aviation which is part of the Black Sea Fleet.  Among these issues is the determining of the order of settling  accounts for the ships and vessels which had been written off by  the Black Sea Fleet during the period after 3 August 1992.    An agreement was reached at the negotiations to continue the  talks within the next two weeks on those issues which have not  been settled.    Therefore, esteemed people's deputies, the regulation of the  Crimean problem is of vital important for Ukraine, first and  foremost for the Republic of Crimea itself. This is an issue of  great politics today, and it concerns not only Ukraine. It is  today a problem on a European, even a world scale. Today we are  suffering both political and economic losses, and have not yet  found a wise solution to the Crimean problem for the sake of  peace on the continent, and for the sake of establishing  friendly and partnership relations with our neighbors.    If we do not solve this problem as the future demands, then  the consequences will be even more dangerous. In my opinion,  the way to resolve this problem is through strict adherence to  the constitutional regime, both by the power structures of  Ukraine and correspondingly by the structures of the Republic of  Crimea. In setting out my views and conclusions, I am counting  on the Supreme Council supporting the submitted proposals.  Thank you for your attention.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: Call to arms should be heeded Sir, In response to your recent articles, 'One more talking shop' (Observer, March 2), and 'Ten-Point plan for credibility' (March 3) may I make the following comments. First, the cynicism of Observer's comment, 'hands up anyone who hasn't yet formed a pro manufacturing industry lobby group?' is not becoming of your newspaper. This article actually refers to three 'pro manufacturing lobby groups'. Considering the dire state of the economy and in particular the manufacturing sector therein and the government's apparent lack of belief, interest or support, existence of such groups is hardly surprising. Politicians and the government should pay more attention to the 'call to arms' of dedicated, committed and active manufacturers, which have so far managed to escape the effect of ineffective and inept policies promoted by their political leaders. Second, I admire the 10-point plan set out by Dr John Pendlebury and David Shipley as it concurs almost exactly with what we in the UK Industrial Group brought to the notice of the public in October 1992 to an extremely positive press response, including your own newspaper. May I draw your attention once again to the UK Industrial Group which is now taking action on eight of this article's 10 points. Further liaison and long-term planning is needed on the points concerning the education system. May we therefore ask the government to back its sudden and vociferous interest in manufacturing by communicating with these committed groups. In particular, government should be taking note of the comments of these groups to effect a long-term industrial based economic strategy for the ultimate good of the UK and its people. David A Turnbull, director general, The UK Industrial Group, 7th floor, Victoria House, Victoria Road, Aldershot, Hampshire GU11 1JJ</p>

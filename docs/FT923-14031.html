			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Forte: Correction IN THE FT yesterday, we reported that Forte was one of four companies reprimanded by the Financial Reporting Review Panel for deviations from accounting standards. In fact, the review panel said it was satisfied with Forte's explanations in respect of four matters brought to its attention, and had concluded there was no cause for action. We regret the error.</p>

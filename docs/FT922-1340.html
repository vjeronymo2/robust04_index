			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UN close to Iraq oil deal UN AND Iraqi delegates yesterday reached tentative agreement on a limited resumptions of Iraqi oil exports solely for humanitarian purposes after six months of protracted negotiations. The accord would permit Iraq to export about Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil over a six-months' period, Mr Giandomenico Picco, the United Nations undersecretary and chief negotiator told reporters. 'I think that almost all the technical issues have been cleared up,' he said. He did not disclose technical details or conditions in the settlement, which has to be approved by the UN Security Council and the Iraqi government. A full economic embargo imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 bars any oil sales not specifically authorised by the UN Security Council. If accepted, the pact would represent a significant concession by the Iraqis, who have so far rejected any agreement that would impose limits and conditions on their oil exports.</p>

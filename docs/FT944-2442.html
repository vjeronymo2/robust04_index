			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Lloyd's plans rise in motor insurance Motor underwriters at Lloyd's of London are investigating the feasibility of a joint body to increase the number of policies sold by the insurance market to drivers, Ralph Atkins writes. Lloyd's syndicates account for about 15 per cent of the private car insurance market but trade as individual organisations under different names. This means potential customers contacting Lloyd's central organisation cannot be passed direct to underwriters, said Mr Peter Routledge, chairman of a Lloyd's Motor Underwriters' Association working party. Competition is also intensifying in the private motor insurance market with companies such as the Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line increasing their market share by selling over the telephone. Any joint Lloyd's scheme would have to overcome the problem of deciding how potential customers should be allocated to different syndicates.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / City seen as undamaged by ERM exit: Eddie George, incoming Bank of England governor, is blunt about budget deficit but buoyant about City's standing BRITAIN'S departure from the European exchange rate mechanism will not damage the City of London's standing as an international financial centre, Mr Eddie George, the incoming governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday in Tokyo. Mr George told executives from leading Japanese financial institutions that doubts about the City's standing and the UK's commitment to European economic integration were misplaced. Mr George was responding to concerns that heavy Japanese manufacturing and financial investment in the UK might be damaged if sterling's exit from the ERM had the result of confining Britain to the sidelines of the European market. He told a seminar organised by British Invisibles, the export promotion body for services, that the City's position depended on the completion of the single market rather than monetary integration. He said: 'Monetary integration is less critical than the single market to London's position, which has not depended upon the currency in which business is conducted and has not depended upon the posi-tion of the national curren-cy.' He said Britain would have plunged into a still deeper recession had it remained within the ERM at the cost of keeping interest rates high. In spite of signs of an easing of German interest rate policy, Mr George said: 'The divergences between the domestic policy needs in Germany and in the UK seem likely to persist for some time to come, and partly for that reason it is unlikely that the UK will re-enter the ERM for some time.' Even outside the exchange rate mechanism, the Maastricht treaty's convergence criteria for monetary union would help guide British policy. Mr George said Britain would be as likely to satisfy the Maastricht convergence criteria as most other EC countries.</p>

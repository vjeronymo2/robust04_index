			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- Boris Yeltsin has refused to  receive the former U.S. President, Richard Nixon, who is paying  an unofficial visit to Russia. He announced this during a short  conversation with journalists at the Kremlin Wall, after the  laying of wreaths at the grave of Yuriy Gagarin.    The Russian president said that: Nixon has met Rutskoy and  Zyuganov, but the interesting thing is that he came here to meet  me. After that, Yeltsin noted: I will not meet Nixon, the  government will not receive him, and Filatov [Yeltsin's chief of  staff] will not receive him.    It should be realized that Russia is a great country. It  simply cannot be played around with like that, the president  said, noting: I am impressed by the position taken by Bill  Clinton, because he phoned me and distanced himself from Richard  Nixon's trip."    Referring to Russian-U.S. relations, Yeltsin said that the  two countries' foreign ministers were due to meet in Vladivostok  shortly. He stated that: The U.S.-Russian partnership must be  preserved and developed. The president noted that Russian-U.S.  partnership: Is a great achievement that we worked very hard  for, and we must not lose it. Moreover, I am convinced that we  will not lose it, Yeltsin stressed.    Asked by the journalists about the Ames scandal in the  United  States, Yeltsin said: I would not like to draw any dramatic  conclusions from this. He expressed hope that it should not and  will not affect Russian-U.S. relations. Yeltsin believes that  one should not get upset about the fact that both countries are  conducting intelligence work.</p>

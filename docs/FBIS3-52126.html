			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic on 28 December  publishes on page 9 an approximately 2,000-word article by  Islamist writer Fahmi Huwaydi under the headline "From Mediation  to Dialogue." Seeing a need "to stop the civil clash and  achieve some reconciliation to lay the foundations of internal  peace and stability," the writer calls for dialogue among all  the political forces in Egypt, including the Islamists. "The  various challenges cannot seriously be confronted except through  the effective participation of all the political and  intellectual forces and trends," he maintains.    Huwaydi calls for learning from the lesson of Algeria,  which,  "after two years of reluctance when the country paid dearly,"  concluded that it was futile to try to ignore the Islamic trend.  He also notes contacts between the British Government and the  Irish Republican Army, quoting British Prime Minister John Major  as saying: "A responsible government can waste no chance for  peace, no matter how remote."    The writer criticizes the position of "some secular elite  groups" in Egypt for "putting all Islamists in one basket and  branding them with extremism and terrorism on the pretext that  one group actually practices terrorism and the other--the  moderate group--`hides' this evil intention." He says this  characterization is not lacking in falsehood, fabrication, and  slander.    In his call for dialogue, the writer draws attention to  three  points:    The Islamic trend and all political forces "denied  legitimacy" must be invited to the national dialogue. "All  political forces, irrespective of their trends, are partners in  the homeland and therefore have a right to contribute to its  present and future."    He states: "The Islamic trend is emphasized here for many  reasons, notably that it is the most powerful among the forces  denied legitimacy. It is also the party targeted by most of the  slander designed to exclude it from the dialogue.  Participation in the dialogue gives that dialogue credibility  and seriousness and may help it succeed eventually." The writer  adds: "I do not hide my intellectual affiliation with that  trend, affiliation with the project and the position, not beyond  that."    He goes on: "When I discuss the Islamic trend, I do not mean  a specific group, as some of those who like to offer  interpretations and fish in muddy waters may think. I am  concerned about the principle."    Finally, on the subjects of such a dialogue, the writer  proposes: "First, democracy, second, democracy, and third,  democracy."</p>

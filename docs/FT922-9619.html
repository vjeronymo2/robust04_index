			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Fininvest pulls out of contest for Channel 5 FININVEST Group, controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian TV entrepreneur, yesterday said it would no longer submit a bid for the Channel 5 television licence, which is scheduled to start broadcasting by early 1995. Its decision leaves The Entertainment Channel, a consortium of TV-am - the UK commercial breakfast broadcaster linked with the Daily Telegraph group - and Time Warner, and Five TV, a company backed by Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto, as the declared intended bidders. Bids must be lodged with the Independent Television Commission by July. Most estimates suggest that at least Pounds 200m is needed to launch Channel 5. Some critics suggest Fininvest might not have sufficient resources. Yesterday's decision is believed to be related to the uncertainty in Italian politics.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Accountants criticise draft audit regulations Leading accountants yesterday strongly criticised regulations published by the government as part of its pledge to reduce the audit requirements for smaller limited companies. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales attacked the government for failing to adequately consult before issuing draft guidelines which it said had resulted in 'bizarre transitional arrangements'. Its Financial Reporting and Accounting Group said the regulations were silent on the appointment, removal or resignation of the 'reporting accountant' who would take the place of the auditor. It said the definitions of which companies were entitled to exemptions and the method of calculating the proportion of minority shareholders required to demand an audit were unclear. The Department of Trade and Industry issued draft regulations on the small company audit last month after an announcement by Mr Kenneth Clark, the chancellor, on details of the relaxation in his November Budget speech. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has also written to the DTI saying the regulations would require the reporting accountant to perform detailed work which would all but nullify any attempts at lessening the regulatory burden. It said forming an opinion on whether the accounts had been drawn up in a manner consistent with company law would require a significant amount of work. It added that the timing of the regulation seemed unduly rushed and would trigger confusion among company directors while encouraging some delays in the filing of accounts in order to take advantage of the new rules. Other smaller practitioners have complained that guidelines on the regulations are being prepared by the Auditing Practices Board, which they see as having little understanding of smaller companies and firms.</p>

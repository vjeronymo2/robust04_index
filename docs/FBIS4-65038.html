			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Investment in East Curbed Recession"] </F>   [Text] On Monday [9 May] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky  accused the West of omissions concerning financial support for  the reform states of East Europe. "If the West European  industrialized nations had made joint investment efforts in East  and Central Europe, we would probably have saved ourselves part  of the recession," Vranitzky stressed when he opened the  International Social Economic Congress in Graz.    In his opening speech, the chancellor also warned that  accelerated structural changes might lead to the loss of too  many jobs in Austria and might endanger the country's  attractiveness as an industrial base. Whenever expenditure cuts  and restructuring are recommended, "jobs are lost in the end."    However, structures must not be improved in such a way that  industry is reduced to insignificance. It would be one of the  biggest mistakes to ignore the possibilities of cooperation  between state-owned and private enterprises, but the search for  a consensus must not lead to the preservation of the existing  structures.    Vranitzky stressed that the restructuring of state-owned  industries (privatization, cooperation) must not be carried out  on the basis of ideology but rather of economic criteria. He  also pointed out that the state continues to be economically  responsible even if it gives up its right of ownership.  Cooperation projects should not end at the Austrian borders but  must also include the neighboring countries and reform states,  the chancellor stressed. Thus, Vranitzky believes that Austria  is facing an era of "revolutionary industrial cooperation."</p>

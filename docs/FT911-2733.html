			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: JP Morgan drops S African ADRs JP MORGAN, the US investment bank, is withdrawing from the business of processing American depositary receipts (ADRs) of South Africa companies. The decision is a victory for US anti-apartheid campaigners, and a big blow to South African businesses which rely on ADRs as a means of access to US investors. In the past year two big US banks, Chemical Bank and Security Pacific, have stopped processing South African ADRs. JP Morgan said ADR activity had become increasingly viewed in a negative light and that its decision to withdraw was in deference to 'sincere and strongly held views on a uniquely sensitive issue'. The bank said it had responded to the views of its shareholders and clients, especially local municipalities and states. The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), which has played a prominent role in condemning US banks for promoting US investment in South African companies, expressed delight at JP Morgan's decision. It said: 'This sends a powerful signal to South African businesses and the government at a crucial time in their negotiations with the country's black leadership.' The ACTWU also called upon the US banks that still issue South African ADRs to follow JP Morgan's example, citing Citicorp and the Bank of New York as remaining issuers. Neither bank would comment. ADRs are baskets of foreign company shares held in custody by US banks. They are designed to make it easy for US investors to buy equity in overseas companies. Most South African ADRs, and all those handled by JP Morgan, are 'unsponsored', which means the bank has no commercial relationship with the South African companies, and only acts as a depositary for the ADRs. JP Morgan is the biggest processor of unsponsored South African ADRs. According to the ACTWU, the bank acts as a depositary for over 50 South African companies.</p>

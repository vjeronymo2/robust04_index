			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UMW'S HEALTH, PENSION BENEFITS SECURED IN PACT  </P> <P> United Mine Workers strikers won concessions on health care and pension  benefits and Pittston Coal Group got the ability to run its mines almost  nonstop in a proposed settlement distributed to miners Friday.  </P> <P> If approved by the UMW's rank-and-file in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky,  the settlement could resolve the union's bitter and sporadically violent 10  1/2-month strike against the nation's largest coal exporter by next week.  </P> <P> The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed contract from a source who  requested anonymity. Union members are due to vote on the pact Monday.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, Pittston would be able to hire contract truck drivers and  maintenance workers, as long as union miners are not laid off. And Pittston  would be able to run its mines on an around-the-clock, seven-days-a-week basis,  except for Christmas and the day shift on Sundays.  </P> <P> The UMW won its demand to maintain 100% medical coverage for employees,  pensioners and their families. Pittston also agreed to resume making  contributions to the union pension fund.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ROK Government reportedly came to the  conclusion on 22 May not to object to the exclusion of the issue  of resuming North-South dialogue from the official agenda of the  third-round North Korea-U.S. talks.    The government also established a policy that the government  will propose a delegates' contact for high-level North-South  talks and seek ways to improve North-South relations in general  by holding various joint commission meetings, including the  Joint Nuclear Control Commission, if North Korea agrees to  returning to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and inspections  of undeclared facilities in the third round of the North  Korea-U.S. talks.    The government policy is a step forward compared to when it  withdrew the precondition of the special envoy exchange for the  third-round of North Korea-U.S. talks announced on 15 April.  The policy is based on the analysis that, in the current  situation, assurance of North Korea's nuclear transparency can  be hastened by momentarily separating the resumption of  North-South dialogue from the nuclear issue to prevent it from  being a point of dispute.    A high-ranking government official said: "The government  position is that it would not object to not discussing the  resumption of North-South dialogue, including the implementation  of mutual nuclear inspections between the North and the South,  during the North Korea- U.S. talks."    The official continued: "Although North Korea disapproves of  the resumption of North-South dialogue, it will be inevitable  after the settlement of North Korea-U.S. talks, for instance,  during the process of supporting the replacement of North  Korea's graphite moderated reactors with light water reactors."    Linkage of the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, which  had been discussed in connection with nuclear inspections of  North Korea, with the future development of North-South  relations, is reportedly undergoing careful consideration by the  government.</p>

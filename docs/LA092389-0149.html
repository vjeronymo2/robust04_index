			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> STAINED GLASS GROWING IN POPULARITY  </P> <P> Scott Van Dyke knew precisely what he wanted to do first to the Irvine  townhouse he bought two years ago.  </P> <P> A neighbor's house where he had grown up had "this beautiful stained glass. . .  . I remembered the window. I had loved it as a child."  </P> <P> And his new home had a nondescript, 2-by-4-foot window.  </P> <P> So he sought out stained-glass artisan Gretchen McKay and together they  incorporated his memories into a glowing jewel of a window that is a mixture of  soft blue and lavender glass accents around an oval of iridescent glass. The  glass sparkles like an opal and reflects a rainbow of colors.  </P> <P> Judy Wright, meanwhile, wanted to add a special personal touch to the  5,800-square-foot, Southwest-style home she and her husband, Donald, built in  the hills of Yorba Linda.  </P> <P> "We like Mexico. We like Hawaii. We like the tropical feeling," Wright says. "I  kind of wanted the feel of Acapulco."  </P> <P> And that's what she has in the stained-glass windows at the front of her house.  </P> <P> Tall glass sidelights on each side of the double oak doors in Wright's entryway  are curved at the top to match the doors. They depict a tropical lagoon with a  combination of colored glasses and clear glass textured with a gentle swirl.  </P> <P> On one side, a large red, yellow and blue parrot perches atop a vine above  banana leaves, bird of paradise and a lagoon of swirling shades of blue and  green. The other side has more banana plant leaves, yellow flowers and a  lagoon. Two small bathroom windows carry out the theme in opaque, colored  glass.  </P> <P> Van Dyke and Wright have joined a growing Orange County trend -- using stained  glass and clear, textured leaded glass to personalize homes.  </P> <P> These custom works of art are being used in entryways, skylights, dropped  ceilings in kitchens and bathrooms and in stairwell windows. They are being  used to reduce sun damage by filtering sunlight from raked windows against  cathedral ceilings.  </P> <P> They are being used as insets in kitchen cabinet doors, windows in kitchens,  bathrooms and family rooms and to provide privacy when odd-shaped windows or  placement of windows defy the use of conventional window coverings. And they  are being used to enhance views or even obscure views that are unappealing.  </P> <P> Almost any windows -- including casements, crank-outs and double-hung windows  -- can be changed to stained or leaded glass.  </P> <P> First, a custom design is created for a particular window. Next, glasses are  selected from hundreds of choices of manufactured glasses that might be  colored, clear or textured.  </P> <P> Then, individual pieces are cut and fitted together with lead much the same as  a jigsaw puzzle is constructed. The window is then puttied to make it  watertight and fitted into place where it should last as a permanent artwork  for the life of the house.  </P> <P> And it's not as expensive as one might think. Prices vary from studio to studio  and depend on the amount of intricate detail in a design, but the going rate  for a simple design ranges from $50 to $85 a square foot.  </P> <P> Scott Van Dyke's window, for example, cost less than $500. The more detail a  design has, however, the higher the cost because it means more labor. Certain  glasses are also more expensive than others.  </P> <P> "The popularity is growing, very, very fast. It's extremely in vogue. . . .  When we started in business 14 years ago, we saw that it was quite popular  then," says Orris Barner of the Glasseye in Orange. Since then, Barner added,  interest in stained-glass windows has "multiplied time and time again."  </P> <P> Gretchen McKay of Contemporary Stained Glass in Villa Park says, "I'm so busy  right now I have about six months' minimum work." She is working on designs for  18 windows in one house, including a skylight of eight 3-foot squares of  stained glass. The skylight glass will have mother-of-pearl and peach tones and  will be backlighted with neon.  </P> <P> Barner says leaded glass is popular for two reasons. It's beautiful and it's  practical.  </P> <P> And, he says, traditional draperies have decreased in popularity and  stained-glass windows are "a great, great way for people to overcome that, to  afford themselves privacy or sun control or just a piece of beauty."  </P> <P> Barbara Benson of Benson Design Studio Inc. in Anaheim agrees that sometimes  stained-glass windows must be functional as well as beautiful.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we're framing a view and we use very transparent glass. Other times  we have a very heavy textured glass, either to obscure the view beyond or to  protect the image inside," says Benson. "If someone has a beautiful hilltop  ocean view, you're not going to put the bulk of your design right smack in the  middle."  </P> <P> McKay says that most of the people she deals with are not interested in  blocking a view. "They're more interested in enhancing a room," she says.  </P> <P> For some people, however, privacy is an issue.  </P> <P> "I just recently did a house down in the Dana Point area that had three windows  right on the bathtub," says Patrick Shane of Patrick Shane Glass Studio in  Tustin. "The bottom of the windows was bathtub height . . . People could look  right in."  </P> <P> The homeowners had not used the bathroom, says Shane, who replaced the windows  with opaque textured glass in a contemporary design; the homeowners can now  bathe in privacy.  </P> <P> Sometimes an installation may require privacy and the opportunity to enjoy a  beautiful view. In this instance, it's possible to have the best of both worlds  by using more opaque glass at the bottom of the window and more transparent  glass toward the top of the window.  </P> <P> In other instances, the homeowner may just want a beautiful window.  </P> <P> "To me it's like a work of art, a picture," Scott Van Dyke says of his  iridescent window. "The great thing is when the sun comes out and is right on  it and the colors are real vivid. It's just fantastic. . . . I get a lot of  pleasure out of it."  </P> <P> He bought his townhouse because the development's white wood buildings with  patios and latticework fences reminded him of his native New England. The  window enhances that feeling. It faces a sidewalk and has attracted quite a bit  of attention.  </P> <P> People just come by, he says, and knock on his door to ask about his window and  "just say they love it."  </P> <P> Van Dyke has plans to add stained glass to some kitchen cabinets and two small  windows in his front door.  </P> <P> Kris Mackey was also looking for beauty when she decided on stained glass for  the lakeside Irvine townhouse she shares with her husband, Wes.  </P> <P> She first fell in love with stained glass when she saw some antique church  windows at an auction. She had a small panel done in a floral design by her  front door and then decided to replace a stairwell window.  </P> <P> She worked on the design with Shane, basing the window on a photo of a  contemporary window in a German church. The result is a window with clear,  lightly textured glass at the top, followed by clear glass with a heavier  texture and a geometric design that seems to suggest flowing water with deep  blues, light green and rust colors. The sound of running water from the home's  atrium waterfall adds to the feeling.  </P> <P> "It lets a lot of light in and yet it gives you privacy," says Mackey. "Once I  had the one put in the stairwell, I just loved it. I felt so good. It had so  much warmth. . . . It's not something you would do for every window, but for  certain areas, it's just right."  </P> <P> The window cost $925, which Mackey feels is reasonable for a work of art that  is also a permanent window covering. In fact, Mackey is waiting for approval  from her homeowner's association for another stained-glass window in her  bathroom.  </P> <P> Judy Wright likes stained glass because "it personalizes your house. . . . To  me it brings you into the house. It's like something I designed."  </P> <P> In addition to the entry doors and bathroom windows, Wright has stained glass  on her second-story bedroom door, which can be seen from downstairs. A  half-circle window tops two French doors. The design of a trellis intertwined  with blue morning glories starts in the half circle and winds its way about  halfway down the doors. The clear background glass has a slight texture for  privacy.  </P> <P> Wright has more glass in her living room and library, where she chose clusters  of beveled glass on a background of clear and textured leaded glass for  half-circle windows above French doors and for an octagon window over her  fireplace.  </P> <P> Bevels are pieces of glass that have been ground and polished into prisms that  refract light, creating a rainbow of colors. Bevel clusters are several pieces  of beveled glass leaded together in a design.  </P> <P> Right now, beveled and textured glass without color are more popular than  colored glass. However, intricate beveled designs are usually much more  expensive than colored and textured glass.  </P> <P> Richard Ashoff, owner of Amethyst Glass in Irvine, says that 90% of his work is  centered on the bevel. "Our design is usually done in bevels, with the  background done in clear textures," he says. Sometimes pale, soft colors are  used on the border of these windows, but heavy color is rarely used in  Amethyst's designs.  </P> <P> Ashoff believes many people are reluctant to use color because they are  redecorating sooner and because "most of our clients will move in three to four  years." He says that an odd color might discourage potential buyers.  </P> <P> Benson and McKay say most clients are selecting leaded glass without much  color. "The trend towards non-colored stained glass coordinates with the trend  towards light-colored wood," McKay says.  </P> <P> Ashoff says a clear leaded-glass skylight with bevels has been Amethyst's most  difficult project so far. The skylight is a 4-by-12, barrel-shaped dome in a  Huntington Harbour home. The project took three months to complete because the  glass had to be painstakingly cut and leaded into a curved shape. The dome has  no color, but it takes on the color of the sky and sparkles with rainbows as  sunlight streams through the bevels and 300 lead crystals that adorn the  skylight.  </P> <P> "As your light conditions change from morning to sundown, you get an  ever-varying appearance to the glasswork," says Barner. "I've often referred to  it as art that is alive."  </P></p>

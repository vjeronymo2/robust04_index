			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Funding of Tecs set for shake-up A shake-up in the funding of Training and Enterprise Councils, the business-led bodies responsible for vocational training in England and Wales, is expected in the Budget today. It is understood that output-related funding will be introduced for Training for Work, the scheme for training the adult unemployed which the Tecs help deliver. About 75 per cent of the funding Tecs receive will be dependent on candidates getting a job, achieving a qualification or entering full-time higher education. At present about 70 per cent of funding is received regardless of how the trainee fares. Tecs receive a payment when they take on a trainee and are paid weekly instalments while the individual is on a course. By law Tecs are allowed to make a profit of only 7.5 per cent on their revenues. Under the new scheme they would not make a profit unless they put enough people into jobs or further education. The Treasury spends Pounds 762m a year on the Training for Work scheme but just 22 per cent of the 120,000 who completed six-month training courses in England and Wales in 1993-94 found a job, became self-employed or moved into further education. The Tec national executive proposed the output-related funding initiative in 1992 and the scheme has been tested in seven Tecs. It is hoped the new funding scheme will speed up the progress of Tecs, put people into jobs faster and get them qualifications more quickly.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (21): Curbs on noisy trucks - Impact of environmental legislation MOTOR VEHICLES have been the focus for environmental legislation since the early 1970s. But the most significant single event in the process was the coming into force at the start of this year of European Commission exhaust emission regulations which in effect make catalytic converters obligatory on petrol-engined passenger cars (and car-derived light commercial vehicles). The fitting of a converter implies the use of a fuel injection system rather than a carburettor, and of unleaded fuel. For larger, purpose-designed, petrol-engined commercial vehicles such as the Ford Transit, the situation is still under review, though it is likely that these, too, will be subject to tighter emission controls before long. These developments appear not to have forced up car prices as much as might have been expected, and there may be some unanticipated benefits from the fleet manager's point of view. Since the car manufacturer has to demonstrate compliance up to 50,000 miles, not only when the vehicle is new, exhaust systems which include catalytic converters are engineered to a higher standard and should last the fleet life of a vehicle without needing any kind of repair or replacement. Fuel injection systems, invariably now electronically controlled, maintain their accuracy of operation much better than carburettors and should need less attention - though when that is required, it may be expensive. It remains to be seen what will be the effect of EC emission limits now being drawn up on heavy vehicles, which are almost without exception diesel-engined. Indeed, the whole question of limits on diesel-powered vehicles, and even on passenger cars, is less clear than for those with petrol engines. Diesel engines are inherently clean in most respects but anxiety remains over particulate emissions and the limits which may be imposed on them. Current EC proposals fall well short of the drastic limits imposed in California, but any future European move, such as requiring vehicle exhaust systems to be fitted with particulate traps, could lead to significant increases in cost. Apart from direct exhaust emission regulations, there looms the prospect of legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging better fuel economy. In the US the approach has been to impose corporate average fleet economy regulations with penalties (for both manufacturer and buyer) for non-compliance. EC discussions have thus far leaned more towards the 'carbon tax' concept. Either approach would encourage fleet operators, especially of passenger cars, to move downmarket to smaller, lighter and more economical models. With the advent of the single market, many new checks have been added to the schedule of the annual vehicle inspection - the 'MoT test'. These new checks, especially on exhaust emissions, are likely to cause many more elderly and high-mileage vehicles to fail the test, but they will have little impact on the fleet market because the tests will (as always) only be required when the vehicle is more than three years old. One effect may be to set an even more decisive limit to the length of time for which fleets are prepared to operate vehicles; the effect on after-sales values of vehicles being sold out of fleets is harder to predict, though a higher test failure rate could increase demand for well-maintained and relatively young cars. A less widely appreciated aspect of environmental legislation is that concerned with vehicle noise. The setting of limits in this area is complex, since the test conditions as well as the actual maximum noise level have to be carefully specified. The current EC limit for cars is 77dB(A) but significantly stricter limits already exist in some countries - notably Switzerland, which specifies 74dB(A), in other words half the EC level. As a result, there has been a need to redesign exhaust systems. However, the severest effect of anti-noise legislation in the EC is likely to be on heavy goods vehicles. These have always produced much more noise than cars, but until recently their commercial importance, relatively small numbers and above all, the engineering difficulty and cost of achieving lower noise levels have argued against the imposition of severe limitations. That situation now seems likely to change, with the authorities requiring far lower truck noise levels, regardless of technical difficulty and cost. Likely techniques include the de-rating of engines to reduce peak combustion pressure levels, and the 'encasement' of power units within noise-insulators. If the limits are severe, noise-reducing measures in transmission and tyre design could also be required. Both first and operating costs may be notably increased in consequence. There has been far less legislation concerning the more recently fashionable aspects of vehicle design, including the elimination of harmful materials and the need for easier and more complete recycling at the end of economic life. To a large extent, moves by the vehicle manufacturers have outrun the pace of potential legislation. Thus the latest vehicles have already completely or largely eliminated asbestos from brake and clutch linings, cadmium from protective finishes, mercury from certain electrical components, and of course CFCs from air-conditioning systems. These changes have been made at small cost to the consumer and often with the bonus of improved system performance. Vehicle design for recycling is now being closely studied in engineering departments worldwide. The signs are that as with emission limits, some unlooked-for benefits may emerge for the fleet operator. Damage repair costs may be lower if body design takes ease of ultimate disassembly into account. Component costs themselves could be lower if, as seems likely, this design approach forces a switch to simpler panels and smoother shapes. The main counter-effect of such moves (and one which the vehicle manufacturers are trying very hard to overcome) is that cars may lose some of their visual attraction.</p>

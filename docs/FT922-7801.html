			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Madrid to press ahead with anti-strike laws THE Spanish government is to press ahead with tough new anti-strike legislation after failing to reach agreement with trades unions in negotiations last week. Just two weeks before a general strike planned for May 28, the government has decided to abandon negotiations on the law with the unions. Union leaders attacked the government's decision to take its proposals to parliament as 'provocative.' The law, certain to be passed in the next few months, seeks to regulate the way strikes are run. It would allow the state to impose minimum services during strikes, fine or sack strike leaders, withdraw state subsidies to unions, and give judges the power to decide whether a strike was political and therefore illegal. Growing union dissatisfaction over the strike law has added to ill-feeling between the government and the unions and the proposed legislation - along with Madrid's decision to save Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) this year by cutting unemployment benefits - helped trigger the half-day strike planned for the morning of May 28. The government ordered the jobless benefit cuts in April as part of its proposals to cut public deficits and take Spain into European Economic and Monetary Union by 1997. It believes it may have driven the unions into a corner by forcing them to strike.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AWARDING THE 26TH ANNUAL GOLDEN FEATHER AWARDS  </P> <P> For the 26th annum, the time has arrived to consider the hits and misses, the  triumphs and trials of what well may have been the most active year in jazz  history.  </P> <P> The activity may not have been at a new peak qualitatively, but in terms of the  number of people involved at every level -- as professionals or students,  musicians or critics -- the year was surely without precedent.  </P> <P> Many of the precedents were set in that prime focal point of jazz activity:  Japan. For a recent appearance by Miles Davis at Blues Alley in Tokyo, the club  slapped on a door charge of 40,000 yen -- about $292. Some of that profit  presumably must trickle down to the leader and even to his sidemen.  </P> <P> Other people and places offered evidence of the continuing innovative urge. The  following winners of this year's Golden Feathers come readily to mind:  </P> <P> MAN OF THE YEAR: Dizzy Gillespie. At 73, the composer-trumpeter-traveler can  probably count more airports on this year's schedule than any musician has ever  before accumulated. He hopped over the Berlin Wall during its demolition,  played one night stands in Moscow and Prague, wrapped his first major movie  acting role ("Winter in Lisbon"), and played dates in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba,  Chile, Denmark, England, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Namibia, the  Netherlands, Newfoundland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland. Honors have been  showering on him like confetti, climaxed by the Kennedy Center Award earlier  this month. Through it all, he has graciously spread the word for a music he  has come to symbolize. Best CDs are on Pablo and Verve.  </P> <P> VIRTUOSO OF THE YEAR: Eddie Daniels. Dual-handedly, this man has brought the  clarinet back to its rightful place with a series of albums that displayed his  astonishing emotional and technical power. At a recent Los Angeles concert,  teamed with pianist Mike Garson, he opened with Poulenc and Von Weber, closed  with Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins, proving that classical listeners are now  receptive to the serious presentation of jazz -- and vice versa. Several albums  in diverse idioms on GRP Records.  </P> <P> SMALL GROUP OF THE YEAR: The Harper Brothers Quintet. Drummer Winard Harper,  27, and trumpeter Philip Harper, 24, offered renewed evidence that in an era  almost overwhelmed by funk and fusion, unhyphenated acoustic hard bop shall not  perish from the earth. "The Harper Brothers" and "The Harper Brothers:  Remembrance" on Verve Records.  </P> <P> VOCAL GROUP OF THE YEAR: Inner Voices. Organized by Morgan Ames, this  four-women a cappella unit is a female counterpart to Take 6 in the beauty of  its blend and the ingenuity of its arrangements. Only one album, a Christmas  set just released on Rhino.  </P> <P> YOUNG MAN OF THE YEAR: Ryan Kisor. No, you have not heard of him, but it won't  be long. He is the astonishingly fluent 17-year-old high school student from  Sioux City, Iowa, who last month won first prize at the Thelonious Monk  Institute's Louis Armstrong Trumpet Competition, held at the Smithsonian in  Washington.  </P> <P> FATHER OF THE YEAR: Ellis Marsalis. Need we say more?  </P> <P> ALBUM OF THE YEAR (Instrumental): Stan Getz, "Anniversary" (EmArcy). The tenor  sax, always a supremely adaptable horn, was never more sublime than in Getz's  hands during this live session at a Copenhagen club. Incomparable backing by  Kenny Barron, piano; Rufus Reid, bass and Victor Lewis, drums.  </P> <P> ALBUM OF THE YEAR (Vocal): Carmen McRae, "McRae Sings Monk" (RCA Novus). With  15 Thelonious themes, set to ingenious lyrics furnished by Jon Hendricks and  others, and with a singer who knows Monk inside out, this could scarcely miss.  </P> <P> RECORD COMPANY OF THE YEAR: Mosaic. Devoted to painstaking reissues in  high-class, high-priced box sets, this mail order outfit has earned a unique  reputation. This year it made available most of the classic Commodore Records  catalogue, and last month the legendary Charlie Parker tapes preserved by the  late Dean Benedetti. No, your local store won't help; try 35 Melrose Place,  Stamford, Conn. 06902.  </P> <P> JAZZ MOVIE OF THE YEAR: A tough call. "Mo' Better Blues" boasted a splendid  sound track, but the plot fell apart. "Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones"  was a farrago of three-second sound-and-sight bites that seemed to equate rap  with jazz. It seems only fair to hold the award for "Benny Carter: Symphony in  Riffs." Though to date it has been shown mainly in England and awaits a wide  release here, it is just what a one-hour documentary on a jazz giant should be:  musically and historically valuable.  </P> <P> BIG BAND OF THE YEAR: The surviving big bands seem to consist of two classes:  those that work year-round and are aimed mainly at the nostalgia crowd, and  those that work sporadically because their music is ahead of the public's  attention span. In the first category are the ghost bands of Glenn Miller,  Tommy Dorsey et al.; also the not-quite-ghost bands led by Frank Foster and  Mercer Ellington under the names of Count Basie and Duke Ellington.  </P> <P> The second group comprises part-time orchestras led by, among others, Louis  Bellson, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Bill Berry, Bill Holman, the Frank Capp/Nat Pierce  Juggernaut -- all heard too seldom in-person or on records.  </P> <P> The award goes to a band heard even less frequently, the admirable  Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra. Ignored by East Coast critics who never check out  the Los Angeles scene, this ensemble owes its success to the multiple talents  of the bassist-composer/arranger-conductor John Clayton, and to his partners,  brother Jeff Clayton (saxes) and Jeff Hamilton (drums). They have only two  albums out, one backing singer Ernestine Anderson, and a far more  representative instrumental set, "Groove Shop" (Capri).  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> It was a year when modest talents too often earned immodest rewards. Harry  Connick Jr. is now a giant record seller and a motion picture actor, while Eric  Reed, a major pianist now with Wynton Marsalis, and Kenny Colman, one of the  finest singers in the Sinatra tradition, go all but unnoticed.  </P> <P> Again, blue notes abounded during a year that said adieu to Sarah Vaughan, June  Christy, Emily Remler, Pearl Bailey, Major Holley, Lee Castle, Al Sears, Mel  Lewis, Dexter Gordon, Art Blakey, Walter Davis Jr., Bill Hardman and too many  others. But as long as the Ryan Kisors and other players (and singers) of his  generation continue to flow out of the colleges and conservatories, our hopes  for the future remains strong.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry released a  communique at noon [1800 GMT] today confirming that the U.S.  Embassy kept the Ministry abreast of the incident in which Major  Ismael Lopez's bodyguard was killed. The document asserts that  authorization was never requested for the U.S. officer to leave  the country because the U.S. Embassy only kept the foreign  minister abreast of the situation by telephone.    Upon confirming the incident, the U.S. Embassy promised the  Salvadoran Foreign Ministry to prosecute the officer in  accordance with U.S. legislation as stipulated under the Vienna  Convention. Despite the official explanations provided by the  U.S. Embassy, the communique states, the Salvadoran Government  is not fully satisfied. Consequently, a letter of protest has  been sent to the Clinton administration demanding penalties  against the individuals who violated El Salvador's laws,  especially its immigration laws.</p>

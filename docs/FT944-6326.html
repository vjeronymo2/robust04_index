			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / A chance to flex some muscle: Falling tariffs and productivity gains mean bright prospects for Brazil's industry Brazil's businessmen are rediscovering a long-forgotten mood of optimism. Foreign investment is at record levels, some big car manufacturers are increasing their output, industrial recruitment is rising, and consumer goods producers are expecting a bumper Christmas. Part of the cause is the sharp fall in monthly inflation, from 50 per cent in June to about 3 per cent now, brought about by the introduction of the new currency, the Real, in July. The election as president from January 1 of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who played a leading role in planning the new currency, has also provided a lift, as he is expected to press on against inflation. But perhaps the biggest source of hope is the minor revolution that has occurred in the country's private sector over the past four years. Faced with falling import tariffs and the threat of foreign competition, companies have dramatically increased productivity. 'It's been a big shake-up for Brazil's business, but it has worked,' according to Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Federation of Sao Paulo Industries. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries and of its Brazilian cigarette subsidiary Souza Cruz, agrees. The outlook for Brazil was 'much better than for many years', he said on a recent visit. In the opinion of analysts, however, much remains to be done Contrary to international perceptions of Brazil as a mainly agricultural producer, the country's economy has been dominated by industry since the 1950s. Exports of goods such as soya and coffee are dwarfed by sales of mechanical equipment, cars, chemicals and textiles. Of last year's total exports of Dollars 38.8bn, less than a quarter came from unprocessed goods such as iron ore and agricultural products. Brazil's steel and vehicle industries are among the top 10 in the world. Brahma, its largest brewer, is the biggest in Latin America and is expanding into new markets such as Argentina. Brasmotor, a consumer goods conglomerate, is the world's second largest manufacturer of compressors and over the coming years could surpass the leader in the field, Matsushita of Japan. Brazil's two biggest food processing companies, Ceval and Sadia, have combined annual exports of over Dollars 1bn, helped by the country's cheap land and benign climate. Despite this industrial pedigree, however, Brazilian manufacturers grew lazy in the 1980s. They had little to fear from foreign competition because the average import tariff was 51 per cent. Moreover, as inflation mounted, so did uncertainty, and companies responded by cutting investment. But this changed in 1990, when then-president Fernando Collor announced sweeping free-market reforms that included tariff cuts and a privatisation programme to reduce the state's previously dominant role in the economy. The reforms, criticised for leading to increased unemployment and rising imports, were unfinished when Mr Collor resigned amid corruption allegations. Even so, their impact has been keenly felt. The steel industry, hampered by price controls and overmanning, was sold to the private sector and government price controls were lifted. The biggest steelmaker, CSN, which made losses of Dollars 729m in 1990, cut its workforce by a third ahead of privatisation last year. After introducing other productivity gains, CSN last year made a profit of Dollars 70m on sales of Dollars 1.9bn. Average import tariffs have fallen to 14 per cent as the government has prised the economy open to foreign competition. The process is due to be taken a step further next year when most tariff barriers will be removed in the Mercosul free trade area comprising Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Falling tariffs have contributed to a 25 per cent increase in imports between 1990 and last year. Total trade with Mercosul countries, previously neglected by Brazil in favour of the US and Europe, has increased sharply, rising by 38 per cent last year to Dollars 8.7bn. The threat of foreign competition worked wonders for Brazilian industry. Monark, one of the world's biggest bicycle makers, transformed its business as import tariffs fell from 85 per cent to 20 per cent. It spent Dollars 15m modernising its factories, halved staff numbers and factory space and started sub-contracting to reduce costs. Simultaneously, it increased production by 45 per cent to 1.9m units between 1990 and 1993 and cut the retail price of its standard bike from Dollars 320 to Dollars 120. 'We are now making bikes at internationally competitive prices,' according to Mr Daniel Galindo, marketing director. Despite these encouraging signs, most analysts argue that economic reform and restructuring must be taken further if Brazil is to close the performance gap between it and more successful economies. They say Brazilian companies need to improve productivity further. In Brazil's privatised steel industry, for example, a recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute, the management consultancy, suggested productivity was less than half that of US steelmakers, which themselves lag behind world leaders such as Japan. Mr Antonio Correa do Prado, economist at Sao Paulo's Dieese institute, says industry still bears the scars of years of high inflation. During that period, new investment was directed at protecting companies from the effects of inflation, through improving stock control for example, rather than at modernising production. As a result, Brazil has been slow to computerise in such areas as product design, he points out. Private sector analysts also argue that the government should relinquish control of the substantial areas of the economy it still owns. State controlled companies, which include the oil monopoly, Petrobras, and the electricity industry, have annual sales equal to more than 10 per cent of GDP, yet are widely considered inefficient. Telebras, the state-controlled telecoms company, is protected from competition by a state-imposed monopoly. But the government's cash shortage over the last decade left Telebras without funds to invest in network improvements. As a result, Brazil has only seven telephone lines per 100 inhabitants, compared to 13 in Argentina and 50 in Germany. Many politicians oppose breaking Telebras's monopoly, but companies are pushing hard for the development of improved communications and other infrastructure, to aid their own expansion. Brazil's other infrastructure, especially its education system, has also suffered from years of under-investment which some economists say limits the country's growth potential. Private sector companies that survived the high inflation years are ready to expand. Among the 500 biggest private companies average debt to equity ratio fell from 57 per cent in 1979 to 40 per cent last year. Bankers say companies can now comfortably absorb more debt to finance new investment. Brazil is also in a strong position as the only country in South America with a developed industrial base. Monark, for example, makes as many bikes in a day as Argentina produces in a month. This industrial muscle, combined with trade stimulants such as the Mercosul free trade area, should allow Brazil to expand exports in South America of products that are not yet internationally competitive on quality, or that cannot yet compete with Asian producers on price. Mercosul and other South American countries may become the testing ground for a more ambitious export effort once further productivity gains have been secured. Brazil's businessmen, who made profits despite high inflation and erratic government policies, used to promise they could make bumper profits if they had a stable economy and political system. With both prerequisites apparently in place, they now have the chance to prove it.</p>

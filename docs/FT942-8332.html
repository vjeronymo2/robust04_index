			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strengthening yen puts check on Nikkei's advance A rise in the yen discouraged investors and heavy selling initially depressed share prices, before arbitrage buying brought a recovery and left the Nikkei 225 average moderately ahead on the day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained 68.61 at 20,221.34 after a low of 20,034.21 and high of 20,302.46. The yen's advance to the Y103 level dampened investor confidence as many market participants had hoped for a retreat in the Japanese currency against the dollar after the increase in US interest rates. Selling by Nomura Securities depressed sentiment during the morning session, but a later rise in the futures market prompted index-linked arbitrage buying and small-lot bargain hunting. Volume amounted to 260m shares, against Wednesday's 290m. In spite of the fall in activity, some traders were optimistic due to buying support around the 20,000 level. The Topix index of all first section stocks was 0.29 easier at 1,634.40, while the Nikkei 300 closed 0.10 off at 298.78. Declines led rises by 522 to 430, with 217 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.39 to 1,334.47. Index-linked buying helped banks, which are heavily weighted in the Topix index. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y40 to Y1,990 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to Y1,670. Brokers were also higher, with Nomura Securities up Y20 to Y2,290 and Daiwa Securities gaining Y30 at Y1,690. The top four brokers reported the first rebound in earnings since 1989-90 thanks to a rise in brokerage and underwriting commissions. Some analysts pointed out that the brokers' own profits forecasts for the current year to next March seemed too conservative since active cost-cutting would help profits. 'The companies are still a long way from being truly healthy, but they are moving in the right direction,' said Mr Mark Faulkner, banking analyst at SG Warburg. The rise in the yen upset high-technology stocks. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, fell Y18 to Y992 and Sony declined Y100 to Y5,840. The government's announcement to freeze increases in public service charges until next year depressed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which had been applying for a rate increase for local calls. The stock dropped Y24,000 to Y855,000. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 47.57 to 22,371.42 in volume of 10.9m shares. Roundup Profit-taking eroded recent gains in some of the Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG encountered profit-taking after Wednesday's strong advance, the Hang Seng index ending 121.66, or 1.3 per cent, down at 9,354.98. The underlying mood remained buoyant, however, in response to the revival of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's new airport. Turnover was a strong HKDollars 4.99bn, but down from Wednesday's revised HKDollars 6.93bn. HK Telecom, which reported slightly better than expected 1993-94 results, picked up from a day's low of HKDollars 14.80 to end 20 cents down at HKDollars 14.90. Property issues were among the big losers. Cheung Kong fell HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 38.50 and Henderson Land slid HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 42 but SHK Properties was steady at HKDollars 53. KUALA LUMPUR was mostly lower, with buying mainly focused on cash-rich Malayan United Industries (MUI), which announced the acquisition of additional shares in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post. The composite index shed 7.29 to 1,002.98. MUI, which surged 32 cents to MDollars 4.02 in volume of 2.7m shares, has been aggressively seeking acquisitions since selling its MUI Bank and MUI Finance in January for MDollars 1.1bn. It bought another 5 per cent of SCMP to raise its stake in the newspaper concern to 20.6 per cent. TAIPEI's consolidation went on, with much of the selling aimed at industrials. The weighted index retreated 38.64 to 5,944.61 in turnover that fell to TDollars 58.31bn from Wednesday's TDollars 62.8bn. Late profit-taking was heavy in paper and plastic stocks, which posted moderate gains during previous advances. MANILA suffered for the second consecutive day because of anxieties over the extent of the damage caused by investigations into Bancapital Development Corporation, an unlicensed investment house that appeared to have closed leaving a trail of undelivered Treasury bills. The Composite index declined 43.78, or 1.5 per cent, to 2,855.57 in volume that fell to 739.97m shares, from 1.88bn on Wednesday. SYDNEY lost ground as profit-taking and a sharp overnight fall in commodity prices overshadowed the positive interim results announced by National Australia Bank. The All Ordinaries index closed 14.1 down at 2,093.7, but off a low of 2,084.6, in volume of 214.1m shares. NAB, which posted interim net profits of ADollars 868.8m, up from ADollars 507.3m, finished 2 cents higher at ADollars 12.16 after an early low of ADollars 12.00. Westpac, which returned to a ADollars 320.9m net interim profit, against a loss of ADollars 204.6m, slipped 15 cents to ADollars 4.84. WELLINGTON gave back most of the gains made on Wednesday, the NZSE-40 capital index falling 30.25 to 2,124.85. BANGKOK saw foreign demand push the SET index 25.64, or 1.9 per cent, ahead to 1,351.11 in heavy turnover of Bt8bn. The property development sector jumped 3.9 per cent, led by Natural Park, which rose Bt14 to Bt155, and Sammakorn, up Bt13 at Bt149. SINGAPORE edged higher, with much of the day's attention focused on Neptune Orient Lines, the shipping group, amid rumours of a bonus issue, the positive impact of a road show ahead of the listing of its US subsidiary, and talks of freight rate increases. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.44 to 2,329.60 in volume of 135.99m shares, while NOL closed 19 cents higher at SDollars 2.62 in turnover of 13.24m shares. SEOUL saw renewed institutional buying for large-capitalisation manufacturing issues which sent the composite index 4.86 higher to 951.73. However, swift profit-taking limited gains in primary blue chips. Posco, the steelmaker, was unchanged at Won67,300, off a day's high of Won68,800. JAKARTA moved higher for the fourth straight day, in spite of local profit-taking towards the close in response to rises in key domestic discount rates which may herald higher deposit returns. Strong foreign demand left the Jardine index 1.18 up at 101.67.</p>

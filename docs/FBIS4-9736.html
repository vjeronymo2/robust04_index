			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Right-wing parties have urged the administration  to send clear signals to the Carabineros on how far they can go  in dealing with street incidents. Spokesmen for right-wing  parties have indicated that certain attitudes recently displayed  by the Carabineros could be viewed as signals this institution  is sending to the Interior Ministry.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Miriam Leyman] Right-wing  politicians have interpreted recent actions by the Carabineros  as a clear signal to the Interior Ministry. Carabineros used  only water cannons during the incidents that took place in front  of the former Pedagogical Institute, while the dwellers of Villa  Francia were repressed in a much harsher manner. Independent  Democratic Union [UDI] Deputy Andres Chadwick said that this  kind of behavior could be interpreted as a warning, and pointed  out that there are the seeds of a conflict between the  Carabineros and the Interior Ministry.    The motives behind the friction are many: first, the  reshuffling of Carabineros high echelons, with which former  Interior Minister Correa [as heard] openly interfered; second,  the intentions of the current interior minister to transfer the  Carabineros from the Defense Ministry to the Interior Ministry,  against the wishes of the Carabineros; and third, the lack of  clear-cut guidelines concerning the extent of the institution's  powers to deal with public security matters. Chadwick explained  that all these motives could prompt the Carabineros to send  warning signals.    [Chadwick] All these actions can be considered signals. I  have no idea what the Carabineros could be thinking, as I have  not been in touch with them, but I can put myself in their  position. Whenever the Carabineros act harshly they are  immediately criticized, and steps were even taken to reshuffle  their upper echelons. On the other hand, when the Carabineros  take no action or get bored with all the complaining and avoid  harsh measures, they are criticized just the same. Their  attitude could be therefore interpreted as a sign that they need  the Interior Ministry to clearly establish what the Carabineros  are supposed to do, how far they can go, and what their  responsibilities are.    [Leyman] Center-Center Union Senator Francisco Javier  Errazuriz asked the Carabineros and the Interior Ministry for an  explanation of the lack of action under certain circumstances.    [Errazuriz] I believe that the situation is very serious.  Undoubtedly the Carabineros must explain why they stood by and  did nothing, but President Eduardo Frei must also explain  himself. He should make it clear whether this will be the  policy of his administration.    [Leyman] Both legislators agreed that the administration has  not defined the Carabineros' role as far as public order and the  security of citizens is concerned. This situation may be  irritating the Carabineros. [end recording]    The Interior Ministry has repudiated the violent incidents  that took place near the former Pedagogical Institute and in  Villa Francia. It announced that it would file lawsuits against  those who are found responsible for such incidents. In response  to articles published in certain media, the Interior Ministry  explained that it has not given the Carabineros any special  instructions for the handling of the incidents in question.  This is what Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario  Velasco had to say on the issue:    [Begin Belisario Velasco recording] The Interior Ministry  neither directs operations nor orders them to be carried out.  This is the Carabineros' job. As to general guidelines, the  administration obviously has a policy, and this policy calls for  preserving public order and security through the appropriate  constitutional mechanisms. These mechanisms are the Carabineros  and the Investigative Police. They have their own charters and  procedures which they must follow. Talks are under way with the  Carabineros so that every possible measure may be taken to  prevent clashes and to make sure that the Carabineros' reaction  will not be out of proportion with the actions of the  demonstrators. [end recording] [passage omitted]    Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange -- who went to  La  Moneda Palace for separate meetings with Interior Minister  German Correa and President Eduardo Frei to invite them to the  festivities marking the institution's anniversary -- explained  that the instructions for dealing with the incidents in question  were issued by Carabineros Metropolitan Headquarters.    [Begin recording] [Stange] Unlike what some people have  claimed, neither the Interior Ministry nor any other agency has  issued instructions for dealing with these incidents. I want to  make this absolutely clear.    [Unidentified reporter] General, aren't you afraid that a  softer approach will make the people lose respect for the  Carabineros, and that those who will suffer from the  consequences of this approach will criticize you?    [Stange] I do not believe so. I really do not believe so.  Because of this change of approach, the so-called day of the  combatants -- and I would like you to analyze what the word  combatant means in this context -- did not develop into  something much more serious. I really believe that this was due  to the Carabineros' calm attitude. [end recording]    Asked about the Carabineros' hostile attitude toward  journalists covering the Villa Francia incident, during which  Carabineros hurt a cameraman and damaged his equipment, Gen.  Stange answered that he knew nothing about it. [passage omitted]    The Interior Ministry has filed a lawsuit against all those  who may be found to be responsible for the incidents that took  place on 29 March near the Metropolitan University for  Educational Sciences, formerly called the Pedagogical Institute.  During these incidents a supermarket and a service station were  damaged. [passage omitted]    New incidents broke out again on 30 March in the  neighborhood  of the former Pedagogical Institute, along Jose Alessandri  Avenue in Macul District. The demonstrators blocked the avenue  and created a traffic jam. No arrests or injuries were reported  during this incident. Carabineros cordoned off the area. Their  plan of action appeared to be similar to that which they  implemented the day before in the same area. General (Luis  Pulgar), deputy chief of Carabineros Metropolitan Zone, arrived  at the site and talked to journalists. Gen. Pulgar explained  that the idea was to avoid appearing to be provocateurs.    [Begin recording] [(Pulgar)] The Metropolitan Headquarters  issued very clear instructions: We must not appear to be  provoking the demonstrators. Yesterday's incidents were  resolved, nobody was injured, and very few people were arrested.  Unfortunately, there were damages. We have made an evaluation  and our police procedures will have to change according to  circumstances.    [Unidentified reporter] Does this mean that the Carabineros  have a new strategy?    [(Pulgar)] Of course, we are changing our way of handling  various circumstances. [end recording]</p>

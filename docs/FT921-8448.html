			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Unions split by Lisbon's pay offer THE Portuguese government has increased its offer for this year's annual pay rises for public administration workers from 8 to 10 per cent, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. The improvement follows trade union calls for a national one-day strike today. However, the unions have split over the offer. The moderate UGT has agreed to sign the new annual agreement while the left-wing CGT has rejected the offer, saying today's strike in public services would go ahead. The UGT, which is close to the opposition Socialist party, was also criticised for signing the new agreement by Mr Antonio Guterres, who is expected to take over as Socialist leader this spring.</p>

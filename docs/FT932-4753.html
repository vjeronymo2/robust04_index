			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems select poll candidate THE Liberal Democrats yesterday selected a 48-year-old Southampton councillor as their candidate to overturn the Tories' 23,000 majority at the Christchurch by-election. The choice of Mrs Diana Maddock, the party's candidate for Southampton Test at the last general election, followed a weekend opinion poll suggesting that the government is heading for defeat in what traditionally has been one of its safest seats in England. Tory party officials said that no date had yet been agreed for the poll  - brought about by the death of Mr Robert Adley - in spite of suggestions that Mr John Major favours July 8 or July 15.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Military cooperation between the  Bundeswehr and the Polish Army will be increased further.  Inspector General Klaus Naumann and General Tadeusz Wilecki,  general chief of staff of the Polish armed forces, held talks in  the Defense Ministry in Bonn on 30 May and discussed the  deepening of cooperation, armed forces planning for the coming  years, and work in the NATO Cooperation Council. Earlier,  Naumann had received the Polish general with military honors.  Wilecki has come to the Federal Republic for a three-day visit  of the Bundeswehr.    Naumann also informed his Polish guest on the Bundeswehr's  new tasks. During his visit, Wilecki will acquaint himself with  units in Bavaria on the Bundeswehr's air defense organization  and the training of Army soldiers. Poland, which has joined  NATO's Partnership for Peace program, is seeking full  integration into the European Union (EU), the Western European  Union (WEU), and the North Atlantic Alliance. In September, the  FRG Navy, along with Polish and Danish Naval forces, will hold  joint mine defense exercises off the Mecklenburg coast. The  Polish Army is adjusting to NATO standards in its command and  armed forces structures.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PERSPECTIVES;  </P> <P> TILL '92, JAPAN CAN SAY YES  </P> <P> Japan has not simply traded places with the Soviet Union as Enemy No. 1. It has  also bruised U.S. pride. Americans think Japan knocked them off the top rung of  the economic ladder.  </P> <P> The media in both countries are having a field day reporting the salvos of  contentious statements and accusations crisscrossing the Pacific. Author  Shintaro Ishihara is right when he argues that trade friction between the two  countries is Americans' fault and that they should put their own house in order  before criticizing Japan. I understand Ishihara's indignation.  </P> <P> But Japan should be conciliatory, at least through the 1992 presidential  election in the United States, when George Bush might encounter pressure to  become a Tokyo-basher.  </P> <P> Postwar Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida was right when he said, "Japan prospered  as long as it worked hand-in-hand with the Anglo-Saxons." It is in Japan's best  interests to remain friendly with the United States.  </P> <P> Some Japanese will say this is weak-kneed diplomacy and kowtowing to foreign  pressure, an unpopular position in Japan. Historically, the Japanese have been  hard on yes-men who seemed soft on other countries.  </P> <P> But concession and compromise are essential for Japan's prosperity into the  21st Century. We must remove structural impediments to trade, give Americans  less reason to complain and wait patiently for the storm to blow over.  </P></p>

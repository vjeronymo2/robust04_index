			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Rally driver - Ballot Box Labour's Sheffield rally was brilliant, superb. It far surpassed anything that the Conservatives could have managed. It electrified the party's supporters and came across wonderfully on television. No that wasn't the judgment of Neil Kinnock's spin doctors. It was offered by Harvey Thomas. His last job? Stage managing the rallies which so triumphantly projected Margaret Thatcher for much of the 1980s.</p>

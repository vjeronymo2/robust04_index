			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Dollars 10bn US defence merger: Lockheed and Martin Marietta deal prompted by need to reduce high costs The world defence industry saw its biggest consolidation yesterday when Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two of the top three US defence contractors, unveiled plans for a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) merger. The new company, to be called Lockheed Martin, will oust McDonnell Douglas as the world's biggest defence contractor. On the basis of Lockheed and Martin Marietta's combined sales of Dollars 22.5bn last year, Lockheed Martin will be the 16th largest company in the US. The companies have assets of Dollars 17.8bn and presently employ 170,000 people. Cost-cutting in an extremely tough defence market is the main reason behind the merger. Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, told a press conference in New York: 'The arithmetic is simple. Three full factories are better than six half-full factories.' Approximately 60 per cent of the merged company's business will be military, with a further 9 per cent coming from the US space agency or civil government contracts. Job cuts are likely to be heaviest in central and administrative functions such as headquarters staff, property, information services and treasury. The two companies have largely complementary industrial operations, with Lockheed specialising in aircraft manufacture and Martin Marietta in electronics. Only in the space and missiles operations is there a significant overlap. Under the terms of the deal Lockheed shareholders will receive 1.63 Lockheed Martin shares for each Lockheed share, and Martin Marietta shareholders will receive the new company's shares in a one-for-one swap. The new company intends to pay a dividend of Dollars 1.40 a share, equal to that presently paid by Lockheed. The all-share deal was initiated by Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive of Lockheed, about five months ago. Negotiations were concluded in New York late on Monday night. Mr Tellep will become chairman of the merged company, with Mr Augustine becoming president. Mr Augustine is expected to succeed Mr Tellep on his retirement. On Wall Street, Lockheed soared Dollars 10 3/4 to Dollars 76 3/4 while Martin Marietta finished up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 48 3/4 , as news of the merger helped lift the Dow to its highest close since February 17. Among other defence stocks, Loral Corp rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 , E-Systems - widely considered as a possible candidate for acquisition - jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 42 1/2 and Northrop Grumman advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 after the Lockheed-Martin Marietta deal sparked speculation of further mergers among US defence contractors. Although the US defence industry has shrunk significantly since the end of the cold war, its rate of contraction has failed to keep up with the reduction in defence spending. Mr Augustine said: 'The fact is that the defence budget has been cut, is being cut, and there are simply too many companies in our industry to prosper or for our customers to afford.' Both companies have participated in earlier consolidations: Lockheed recently bought General Dynamics' F-16 fighter aircraft business, while Martin Marietta bought General Electric's aerospace business and General Dynamics' space systems division. But Mr Tellep said acquisition prices had gone too high. The deal is subject to federal anti-trust clearance, but both companies are optimistic of winning approval because the defence department has been pressing the industry to consolidate more rapidly. 'The bottom line is the national defence budget simply cannot afford all the inefficiencies that go with an industry in such a condition,' Mr Augustine said. The Pentagon said yesterday that while it viewed consolidation in the defence industry as inevitable, the merger would be reviewed by defence officials in conjunction with the department of justice and the federal trade commission.

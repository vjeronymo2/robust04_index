			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> HORACE SILVER SHINING ANEW  </P> <P> Pianist-composer Horace Silver has been a stellar participant in the modern  jazz arena since the early '50s, when he emerged as one of the more potent  improvisers and writers of bluesy and funky hard bop.  </P> <P> But in recent years, the edge and originality that marked his early playing and  that one found in compositions like "Nica's Dream," "Quicksilver" and "St.  Vitus Dance" has gradually diminished. Today's Silver is more melodic, less  hard-hitting. It's a change some will like, some won't.  </P> <P> Opening a two-week stand Tuesday at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood, Silver  led a sextet of New York-based musicians through a set of mostly new tunes,  with a couple of older vehicles, one the classic "Senor Blues," tossed in for  good measure.  </P> <P> And while "The Righteous Rhumba," "Hallelujah to Ya!" and "Mr. Blakey" had nice  enough melodies, were orchestrated for the horns in deft Silver fashion and  usually had varying sections, ultimately they sounded like so many other Silver  tunes that it was hard to tell them apart. The late-'50s "Senor Blues" or the  jackrabbit-paced "Nutville" (from the mid-'60s "The Cape Verdean Blues" Blue  Note LP) had more character, perhaps simply because they have stood the test of  time.  </P> <P> Overall, Silver and crew -- Mike Mossman, trumpet; Ralph Bowen, tenor sax;  James Genus, bass; Billy Drummond, drums -- were sharp as tacks, playing the  often involved melody lines from memory and soloing with elan, particularly  Bowen, a fluent, inventive improviser. The leader worked with his usual firm  energy, his lines marked by a keen sense of rhythm and blues phrasing.  </P> <P> Also, the empathy and dynamics Silver, Genus and Drummond, a fire stoker if  there ever was one, exhibited behind the hornmen and as a trio were  exhilarating.  </P> <P> Singer Andy Bey joined the band for four tunes, and his voice -- resonant and  vibrant on the bottom but a bit pinched up top -- served Silver's  metaphysically bent lyrics well. But a stronger selection of songs, perhaps  drawing on the still-wearing-well Silver library of comely originals, is needed  to make the band come alive.  </P> <P> Silver is at Catalina's through July 16, with Monday off.

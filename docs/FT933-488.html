			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Britain urges UN to update peacekeeping role BRITAIN yesterday called for far-reaching reforms of United Nations operations, to make its role more effective in combating international conflict and disorder. Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, urged wide-ranging modernisation of the UN approach to peacekeeping. He suggested that certain countries with well trained, equipped and available forces might be asked to be ready to provide the first wave of a peacekeeping force, giving other countries time to train and equip follow-up forces. But the corollary of early deployment by some countries must also be that they would end their deployment early, he insisted. 'A commitment to deploy early would of course need to be matched by a UN commitment to agree a firm end-date for the deployment. Exits are as important as entrances,' he said. Mr Hurd also recommended that many peacekeeping operations might be run more effectively by regional organisations or even by single countries on behalf of the UN. He repeatedly stressed there were bound to be quite finite limits to what the UN could do in the peacekeeping field, and he called for greater efforts to ward off impending conflicts by preventive diplomacy. Only the UN, he said, had the legal powers to act for the maintenance of world peace, and it could be helped to improve its record. But he warned it could not guarantee solutions to civil wars, 'nor even to that pernicious variant of a civil war which we see today in Bosnia'. Mr Hurd's insistence that the UN must be clear on its objectives before launching peacekeeping operations echoed remarks on Monday by President Bill Clinton. 'Any operation must have clear and achievable objectives, linked to a political process which offers reasonable hope of a solution and to which all parties should be committed. The mandate must be precise and finite. That means the Security Council must resist the temptation to become involved in the detailed conduct of operations. 'Where the UN is charged with executing as well as authorising a peacekeeping operation, all aspects of it should be handled by a single department in New York. That is why we have suggested the creation of an expanded Planning and Operations Staff for Peacekeeping'. In a reference to large arrears owed by the US to the UN, Mr Hurd urged all countries to pay their contributions in full and promptly. Moscow has called on the UN for an offical mandate to justify Russian peacekeeping operations in the neighbouring countries of the former Soviet Union, and appealed for voluntary contributions from other countries to help finance these operations. Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, made a renewed attempt to counter international reproaches over Russia's UN contribution arrears: Dollars 261m (Pounds 169.4m) for peacekeeping, and Dollars 81m on the regular budget. He said the international community should recognise that Russia had a legitimate interventionist role in its region.</p>

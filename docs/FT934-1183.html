			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Balance sheets bolstered Companies have used higher demand and falling interest rates to reduce borrowings and push balance sheets to their strongest level for seven years, government figures show. The healthier state of much of industry is also underlined by a large increase in trading profits in the latest quarter, and a rise in capital spending after a sluggish period early this year. In the third quarter companies turned in an overall financial surplus of Pounds 1.726bn at current prices. That compares with a deficit - an excess of spending to receipts - of Pounds 543m in the second quarter. Business also reduced its borrowing requirement over the two quarters, to Pounds 2.748bn from Pounds 6.726bn. The figures illustrate how company finances, which had been deeply in the red before and during the recession, have improved in two years. In 1990 companies chalked up a record deficit of Pounds 22.753bn. They borrowed Pounds 36.965bn to cover the deficit and used other financial transactions such as overseas capital spending and share investments. In the first nine months of this year, the surplus of receipts over spending for companies was Pounds 2.267bn, after a Pounds 6.758bn deficit last year. The third-quarter surplus was the highest for any quarter since late 1986, while the last time companies recorded a surplus for the whole year was in 1987. Between July and September, gross trading profits of companies net of stock appreciation came to Pounds 22.735bn, a 15 per cent rise on a year previously.</p>

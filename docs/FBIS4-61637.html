			<p>BFN     [Text] The Moscow government is ready to stop transfer of  money to the federal budget which is then allocated to Moscow  from the budget, Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov declared at the  sitting of the Moscow government on Saturday which was  discussing results of the fulfillment of the budget of the city  of Moscow for 1993.    Luzhkov believes that the Moscow leadership is forced to  make  this due to permanent debts of the federal budget to the Russian  capital. As the Minister of the Moscow government Yuriy  Korostelev, leader of the finances department, reported to  Interfax, as of January 1, 1994 this debt was 117 billion  rubles, and as of early May - 126 billion rubles.    The resolution of the capital's government says that "the  program on social-economic development of the city for 1993 has  been successfully fulfilled." At the same time the resolution  points out that "the results of the budget's fulfillment have  failed to create a base for financial support of additional  measures and to comprehensively form the funds for the starting  financing of this year."    In the course of the sitting chief of the state tax  inspectorate in Moscow Dmitriy Chernik reported that a total of  2,635 trillion rubles and 58 million dollars have been  transferred to Moscow's budget at the expense of taxes collected  on the territory of the city. In his estimates, about 21  trillion rubles will be transferred to the city's budget at the  expense of taxes. The city's budget will be approximately 21  trillion rubles. A more precise prognosis of the capital's  social-economic development and Moscow's draft budget for 1994  are to be submitted to the Moscow government before June 15.    On the proposal of Yuriy Luzhkov the Moscow government  dismissed several people guilty of using budget funds at their  own disposal. In particular, it fired chief of the medical  department of the Western administrative district where the  budget funds were spent for the procurement of "21 cars for  non-medical purposes and payment for foreign business trips."    According to Luzhkov, "today there is no more complex and  important work but the work aimed an efficient search for ways  to replenish Moscow's budget funds."</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The market continues inactive with prices untested at auction during the recess between the main selling seasons. The trade has been encouraged by large sales from the Australian stockpile last week - more than 12,000 bales and the largest weekly total since early December. These are related to Australian business with China and if further demand develops from one of Australia's main wool customers the outlook for the whole market next season is more hopeful. In the UK, problems related to the marketing of British wool persist.</p>

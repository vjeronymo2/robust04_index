Following his meeting today with President al-Hirawi, Milhim  Karam, doyen of the newspaper editors, cited the president as  saying that while Lebanon was following up on its complaint to  the United Nations over the Israeli piracy of Lebanese water, it  was hit by a new aggression that demolishes all the Israeli  excuses and pretexts.

Karam added that President al-Hirawi mentioned that three  brigades from the Lebanese Army will start a deployment in the  al-Shuf and 'Alayh Districts on 15 June to ensure the return of  the displaced persons.</p>

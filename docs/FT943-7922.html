			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Tight budget for Finland Finland's three-party centre-right government yesterday set a tight budget for 1995, alleviating fears that surging economic growth and a looming election might lead to relaxation of its tough fiscal strategy, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Spending is to be held at FM180bn (Pounds 22.5bn), excluding FM15bn in outlays linked to possible membership of the European Union. But it will mean a further round of heavy cuts and restructuring of the Finnish public sector. The budget forecasts a general government deficit of FM25bn, or 4.5 per cent of GDP, and a net borrowing requirement of FM60bn, or 11 per cent of GDP.</p>

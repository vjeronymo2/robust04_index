			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazil's 'twins' stress team-work Ahead of yesterday's World Cup semi-final against Sweden in Los Angeles, Brazilian strikers Romario and Bebeto admitted they were unimpressed with Brazil's showing to date. 'Technically, we haven't shown soccer of great quality,' said Romario. 'We're making up for it with strength and team-work. Individually, we have the obligation to play better.' US defender Alexi Lalas, out-gunned by Bebeto in Brazil's 1-0 second-round victory, said the South American team were 'dribbling maniacs' who hurtled at opponents at 100mph. Yet Brazil's brightest stars are under-whelmed with their team's showing. 'We're not playing that 'show soccer' people expected,' Romario said. 'We're playing a modern and efficient soccer.' Bebeto added: 'What matters is the end result. It's useless to play pretty and lose. Maybe it's not great soccer, but it's practical.' Brazil knew bitter disappointment in the last five World Cups. They were always among the favourites but somehow failed to win, often through over-confidence or theatrics - known in Brazil as 'playing in high heels.' Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has been criticised for implanting a scrappy style and causing the demise of Brazil's art-house soccer. But Romario defends him: 'We haven't yet been able to admire Parreira's work. But we should be grateful for what he's done. Someone like me wouldn't put up with the things he's had to take.' Arguably, Parreira's greatest feat has been to maintain harmony among a cast of prickly characters. And some observers say he has added desire, spirit and awareness to the Brazilian line-up. 'For many years, people said Brazil's yellow jersey was very pretty but had no heart inside,' said Romario. 'After this World Cup, I think they'll say it's a pretty jersey with 11 hearts inside.'</p>

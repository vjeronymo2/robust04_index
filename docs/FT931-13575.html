			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: German deal lifts ICI SHARES in ICI appreciated 26 to 1123p as news that the chemical and pharmaceuticals giant plans to swap plastics businesses with BASF, of Germany, gave a boost to fund manager enthusiasm. A number of analysts are broadly cautious about ICI ahead of its proposal to split its pharmaceuticals and chemicals divisions. However, institutions have begun to buy the stock for its cyclical attractions. Mr Charles Lambert, chemicals analyst with Smith New Court who has taken a very bearish view of the stock, said the exchange would be beneficial and, although the market had expected ICI to sell its polypropylene business, the swap for BASF's acrylics arm was an added benefit. However, he argued that yesterday's share price move was not justified by the news and that significant doubts remained over the demerger proposals. 'Quite clearly, if they are going to do it within the proposed time scale it would definitely necessitate a rights issue of Pounds 500m minimum,' he said. Under the swap, BASF will get ICI's west European polypropylene business, while ICI will get BASF's west European production of acrylics - best known in its use as Perspex. Bass pleases Relief at the Bass trading statement sent the shares higher yesterday, although the market remained firmly divided over the prospects for the group. The agm statement was cautious but not as gloomy as many analysts had predicted. The brewing and leisure group said that, while market conditions were tough and the outlook in brewing remained uncertain, there were areas of improvement. Kleinwort Benson shaved its forecasts and remained a seller, continuing to argue that 'the outlook is less than rosy in terms of domestic consumer recovery'. NatWest Securities was more positive, changing from a sell to a hold on the belief that the recent fall in the shares was overdone. Meanwhile, BZW believes that, in spite of the sluggish recovery picture, Bass is well placed in its key businesses to benefit from an early stage, while other earnings gains this year will come from cost-cutting. One other leading house was also said to be recommending a switch from Whitbread into Bass. The latter rose 13 to 595p in turnover of 4.2m. Whitbread 'A' declined 7 to 445p. Forte worries Hotel group Forte weakened as word leaked into the market that one house had turned bearish after meeting with the hotel group and was forecasting a dividend cut. Such concerns have hit Forte before, with bears of the stock already predicting a reduced dividend - NatWest Securities has suggested Forte may have to reduce from 9.9p to 6.5p. However, so far most other brokers have kept to a held dividend forecast. The shares fell 5 to 178p in large turnover of 9m. Banks strong Most of the banks were strong performers as they benefited from growing hopes that interest rates would be cut shortly. The market also decided that, having weathered the worst of the recession, they are well positioned for recovery compared with their European rivals. Barclays rose 15 to 412p and National Westminster, in spite of recommendations to switch out of the stock, improved 11 to 426p. Old bid candidate Royal Bank of Scotland gained 8 at 222p and Abbey National shrugged off a recent negative note from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew to add 8 1/2 at 360p. The rise and rise of HSBC continued, the ordinaries climbing 23 to 550p and the Hong Kong registered 22 1/2 to 532p. Turnover was generally heavy. Meanwhile, the bid fever that had prompted the sharp rise of Standard Chartered appeared to die down. The shares were 24 higher at one stage but were then sold down to close only 6 ahead at 636p. Brent Walker, 2 1/2 firmer at 13p, and Ladbroke, up 2 at 195p, continued to benefit from the prospect of longer betting shop hours. Granada was in demand as talk of a 25 per cent rise in the price paid for each Coronation Street episode lifted the shares. They closed 11 better at 359p. Euro Disney added 7 at 780p after announcing a tie-up with Air France. Better sales but at the expense of lower margins led to weakness in Burton, which became the latest retail group to present a cautious picture of recovery. The group said it had yet to detect any convincing signs of economic revival. While pre-Christmas sales growth was some 12 per cent ahead, margins declined by around 2 1/2 per cent. Many analysts reined in their forecasts, coming down from a Pounds 30m to Pounds 33m range to around Pounds 25m for this year. The shares later rallied to end a net 1 1/2 off at 71 1/2 p. Talk of downgrades at Associated British Foods sent the shares tumbling 9 to 485p. Revived suggestions that Dairy Farm might bid for Kwik Save circulated, the latter rising 12 to 806p. Regulatory worries were again in evidence in the water stocks, with Credit Lyonnais Laing suggesting that the effect of official intervention could be much more costly than at first thought. Among those hardest hit, Anglian fell 7 to 462p, Thames 7 to 472p and Wessex 6 to 576p. Food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan put on 15 at 440p as a big buyer was seen early on, with further interest being prompted by a strong buy note from Kleinwort Benson. After meeting the company, the house said that with half GrandMet's profits coming from the US it will be an early beneficiary of recovery there. The shares' recent underperformance also make them attractive, it is argued. British Gas was held down to a gain of only a penny at 287p as the company announced a Pounds 70m restructuring programme. Insurer Sun Alliance added 7 at 333p on what one analyst described as 'better end of average' new business figures. Sun's 1992 worldwide new premium income for life and pension business was up 60 per cent to Pounds 744m from Pounds 475m. An overnight surge in the pharmaceuticals sector on Wall Street helped to push up UK drugs shares. Glaxo advanced 15 to 717p and Wellcome 17 to 930p. Selling of Reuters Holdings continued ahead of the forthcoming figures and the shares fell 24 to 1330p. The deal with Taiwan Aerospace announced earlier in the week continued to boost British Aerospace, which climbed 8 to 210p in heavy trade of 7.3m. Kleinwort Benson favours the stock. Profit-taking in Rolls-Royce left the shares 3 down at 116 1/2 p. Volume reached 6.7m. Bargain hunters lifted Charter Consolidated and Johnson Matthey. Charter jumped 20 to 689p and the latter gained 9 at 489p. The strong market trend helped IMI shrug off the recent Smith New Court sell recommendation and register an improvement of 5 at 257p. News of the Dollars 300m deal between British Airways and USAir came shortly after the market close and had no effect on the day's trading. The shares eased 3 to 265p, having had 5m traded as the market awaited the outcome of yesterday's board meeting which discussed an internal inquiry into the 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic. NFC gave up 3 to 264p amid talk that it would soon announce a disposal to a US group. An analysts' visit to Ocean Group benefited the shares and they moved 15 ahead to 283p. A squeeze sent BAA 5 forward to 788p. Textile group Coats Viyella paused for breath following a rise on the back of an in-depth BZW buy note. The shares were steady at 214p as the house's textiles analysts travelled to Scotland to speak to institutions. Consumer credit group First National Finance Corporation firmed 5 to 76p as one institution bought a line of stock. Interior decoration group Colefax &amp; Fowler weakened 5 to 33p on recording a six-month loss of Pounds 192,000. Advertising agency More O'Ferrall moved forward 10 to 210p as investors bought for the dividend ahead of figures expected in March. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (101).

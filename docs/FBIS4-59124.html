			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, head of the </F> PLO Economic Department and deputy chairman of the Palestinian  Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development, by Rashid  Khashanah in Tunis; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Khashanah] What questions are included on the  agenda of the Economic Council for Development and  Reconstruction?    [Al-Nashashibi] Among the first questions which we have  begun to discuss in the council's meeting is the basic code  issue and the appointment of the heads of departments in view of  the interviews which the experts committee conducted with the  Palestinians nominated for these posts at the council's request  in Amman in late March.    [Khashanah] Is it true that the problem between the PLO on  the one hand and the United States and the World Bank on the  other regarding the council's formation was solved at the recent  Christopher-'Arafat meeting in Cairo?    [Al-Nashashibi] That is true.    [Khashanah] Did the agreement on the transfer of powers  signed in Cairo by 'Arafat and Rabin fulfill the Palestinian  leadership's expectations of the meeting?    [Al-Nashashibi] The important thing is for the agreement to  fulfill the Palestinian people's aspiration to freedom and  independence. That depends on our people's continuation of the  struggle for the sake of their aims. Because the agreement in  its present form does not achieve the necessary steps leading to  an independent Palestinian state. However, I am confident that  our people will struggle competently to regain their rights in  full.    [Khashanah] How will the outstanding issues be resolved?    [Al-Nashashibi] Experience with Israel so far does not  inspire optimism about an imminent solution to the outstanding  issues. However, our determination to achieve what we have not  yet agreed upon at this stage is the means to recover our  rights. [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] To what extent does the economic accord signed  in Paris between the PLO and Israel sever the linkage between  the Palestinian and Israeli economies?    [Al-Nashashibi] The accord reduces the chances of severing  the linkage and perpetuates Israel's control over the  Palestinian economy. The preamble stipulates that "the two  sides should continue to cooperate in the economic sphere in  order to establish a sound economic foundation on which joint  relations would develop" -- which conflicts with our basic aim  of building an economy free from the subservience imposed by  Israeli authorities during the occupation. I believe that the  preamble should have stipulated that the Palestinian people have  the right to establish their own independent national economy in  accordance with the states' and peoples' economic charter  endorsed by the United Nations and which guarantees "the  peoples' right to build their own national economies away from  any foreign intervention."

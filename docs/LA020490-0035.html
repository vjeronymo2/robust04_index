			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL PRO BOWL;  </P> <P> STRUGGLING AFC NEEDS VICTORY TO LESSEN STING OF SUPER BOWL  </P> <P> The AFC, suffering through a string of Super Bowl humiliations, will try to  regain some respect in the NFL's other bowl game -- the Pro Bowl.  </P> <P> The AFC, loser of six consecutive Super Bowl games by a total score of 240-82  but winner of three of the past five Pro Bowl games, takes on the NFC today at  Aloha Stadium.  </P> <P> Kickoff is 5 p.m. PST.  </P> <P> "It would be nice to win this one and finish up the season on a good note,"  said Denver safety Dennis Smith, whose team lost, 55-10, to San Francisco in  the Super Bowl a week ago.  </P> <P> Although most of football's best players will be in the game, some of the top  names will be absent, particularly at quarterback.  </P> <P> San Francisco's Joe Montana, Denver's John Elway and Cincinnati's Boomer  Esiason all are missing the game because of injuries.  </P> <P> Don Majkowski of Green Bay also didn't make it, listing personal reasons.  </P> <P> Montana and Esiason were voted as the starters for the NFC and the AFC;  Majkowski was the No. 2 quarterback for the NFC and Elway was to replace  Esiason, who withdrew earlier.  </P> <P> Warren Moon of Houston, the AFC starter, is left as the only quarterback voted  into the Pro Bowl who actually will play. Mark Rypien of Washington was a late  substitute for the NFC and Dave Krieg of Seattle was named to fill in for the  AFC.  </P> <P> Some players showed up for the game despite ailments, including running back  Roger Craig and safety Ronnie Lott of the 49ers.  </P> <P> The contest marks the 20th year for the AFC-NFC all-star format, which began in  1971 after the merger of the NFL with the American Football League. The NFC  leads the series 11-8.  </P></p>

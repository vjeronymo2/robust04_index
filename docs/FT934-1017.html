			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UN appeal for end to Bosnia arms embargo The UN General Assembly last night appealed to the Security Council to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia Hercegovina, a step long proposed by the US. The resolution, which is only a recommendation and which the Council is free to ignore, was adopted as Bosnia agreed to drop charges that Britain, by supporting the embargo, violated the Genocide Convention. Bosnia had prepared a case for submission to the World Court on the grounds that Britain, as the most ardent objector to lifting sanctions, was primarily responsible for their retention. It was evident from a joint UK-Bosnian statement which was issued shortly before the Assembly vote, that a strong inducement not to proceed with the case was Britain's pledge to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid as well as a renewed commitment to a negotiated political settlement. The Assembly resolution, adopted by 109 votes to none with 57 abstentions, called for an end to the 'working status' of Belgrade's UN delegation. In 30 operative paragraphs, it also called on the Security Council to ensure that Belgrade halted all military aid to the Bosnian Serbs and demanded an end to the siege of Sarajevo and other UN-designated 'safe areas'. Also proposed was the urgent reconvening of the London conference on former Yugoslavia to try to work out a settlement. The Security Council was called upon to ensure that the proposals in the 'Geneva peace package' conformed with the UN Charter, its previous resolution and the London conference principles. Bosnia has repeatedly charged that the plan prepared by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, violated the Charter and Council decisions.</p>

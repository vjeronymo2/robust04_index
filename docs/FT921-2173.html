			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Arcolectric falls to Pounds 318,300 Arcolectric, a maker of lighting and other electrical equipment, suffered a downturn from Pounds 446,665 to Pounds 318,299 in pre-tax profits in 1991 although turnover showed a marginal increase to Pounds 10.88m. Mr Rodney Collier, chairman, said the reduced profit was explained by reorganisational costs and lower than expected sales at the end of the year. He said the current sales outlook was good. Earnings per share came through at 3.8p (4.39p) and the proposed final dividend is 0.58p to make 1.11p (1.06p).</p>

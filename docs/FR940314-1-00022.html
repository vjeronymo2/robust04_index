			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact on small entities of the proposals suggested in this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking represents the next step in the process of licensing the world's first commercial low-earth orbit satellites offering both voice and data mobile satellite services (MSS). These satellites are to operate in the 1610&hyph;1626.5/2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz frequency bands (1.6/2.4 GHz bands). The proposed systems are to provide a wide range of services, including cellular-like mobile services to users anywhere, telephone service to remote areas that are not linked to a communications network, position location services, search and rescue communications, disaster management communications, environmental monitoring, paging services, facsimile transmission services, cargo tracking, educational communications, and industrial monitoring. In addition to offering these services to users in the United States, the proposed low-earth orbit systems have the capability to extend these offerings throughout the world. This can potentially expand markets for U.S.-developed goods and services and to make a major contribution to U.S. global competitiveness. It also offers the potential for significant economic and social advances in developing countries by providing an ``instant'' telecommunications infrastructure at minimum cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six applications to construct satellite systems in these frequency bands were filed by the cut-off date. Five proposed low-Earth orbit (LEO) systems. These were filed by Ellipsat Corporation, Motorola Satellite Communications Inc., Constellation Communications, Loral/Qualcomm Corporation, and TRW, Inc. The other application was filed by American Mobile Satellite Corporation. AMSC proposed to add the additional MSS frequencies to its geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) MSS system that was authorized in 1989. An international allocation for MSS in these frequency bands was made in February 1992; a domestic allocation was adopted in December 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A negotiated rulemaking was undertaken from January through April 1993 to assist the Commission in establishing technical and operational rules to govern this new service (hereinafter 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS) and in developing an arrangement by which all six pending system proposals could be accommodated. Neither the Commission nor the applicants were able to fashion a spectrum sharing compromise that was acceptable to all. The Committee did, however, reach consensus regarding other major technical issues. After the Negotiated Rulemaking was concluded, the LEO applicants, in two new ``partial settlement'' groups, submitted two new sharing proposals they assert would permit all LEO applications to be granted. Both proposals are premised on excluding GSO systems from consideration for licensing in these frequency bands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Licensing Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the applicants can develop or agree to an engineering solution or sharing scheme by which all proposed systems can be accommodated, the Commission generally adopts this approach if it is otherwise in the public interest. In situations where all applicants' proposed systems cannot be accommodated, the Commission must devise a method consistent with the public interest for choosing among them. In such cases, the Commission has, as an initial matter, imposed rigorous financial and technical requirements as a means of ensuring that those granted licenses are capable of expeditiously implementing state-of-the-art systems that will serve the public interest. If it is not possible to accommodate all qualified applicants, a further processing mechanism must be selected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Qualification Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a means of encouraging new technology and of realizing the unique benefits that a global system can provide, the Commission proposes a LEO design requirement (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(i)). It solicits comment on this proposal from both applicants and potential users, requesting that commenters address the potential for 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS systems to generate social, economic, and technical benefits, both domestically and globally, and the extent to which these benefits are realizable with LEO and GSO satellites. The Commission further proposes that systems be capable of serving all areas of the world, except for the polar regions, for at least 75% of each day. Specifically, the Commission proposes that satellite systems be designed so that at least one satellite is visible above the horizon at an elevation angle of at least 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; for at least 18 hours each day at latitudes less than 80 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(11)). To provide efficient and ubiquitous service to users throughout the United States, the Commission also proposes to require systems to be capable of providing continuous voice services to all areas of the United States (proposed rule &sect;25.143(b)(2)(iii)). That is, satellite systems must be designed so that at least one satellite is visible above the horizon at elevation angles of at least 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; at any given time in all areas of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Commission proposes strict financial qualification requirements identical to those in the domestic fixed-satellite service, where applications to implement space stations regularly exceed the number that can be accommodated (proposed &sect;25.143(b)(3)). Specifically, the Commission proposes that MSS applicants be required to provide evidence of current assets or irrevocably committed debt or equity financing sufficient to meet the estimated costs of constructing and launching all planned satellites and operating the system for one year. These requirements stem from the Commission's repeated experience that licensees without sufficient resources spend a significant amount of time attempting to raise the capital needed to finance a satellite system (here, $97 million to $2 billion), that these attempts often end unsuccessfully, and that qualified fully-financed applicants may be blocked from entry during this several-year period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All applicants will be given the opportunity to amend their applications to bring them into compliance with any final rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Processing Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While a sharing solution could not be developed during the Negotiated Rulemaking, the Commission believes that the recent LEO sharing proposals may form the basis for allowing it to proceed expeditiously with licensing. Both of the LEO applicants' proposals appear to allow up to five LEO systems to be accommodated in the 16.5 MHz of spectrum allocated to MSS in each transmission direction. This may be sufficient to allow all qualified applicants to be licensed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

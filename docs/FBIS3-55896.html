"The vanquished do not dictate terms to  the victors," he said, "Hence, Tbilisi will have to put up with  the fact that our relations must be based on agreements reached  between equal subjects of international law. The Georgian side  is constantly exploiting the problem of refugees. As for us, we  do not prevent them from returning to their home country."  Well-informed sources at the Georgian Foreign Ministry believe  that such statements made on the eve of the upcoming  Georgian-Abkhazian consultations scheduled for 11 January are  provocative and may bring about the most undesirable  consequences.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK blocks VAT deal on works of art EFFORTS to reach agreement on a new EC-wide tax on imports of works of art collapsed last night after Britain argued that the tax posed a threat to the main London auction houses led by Sotheby's and Christie's. British opposition cut hopes of ending the long-running dispute over harmonising VAT rates on second-hand goods in the EC, though ministers vowed to continue negotiating. The European Commission's seventh VAT directive covers all second-hand goods, but Britain has a special interest because of the London art market which faces stiff competition from New York and is not matched by any European operation. After several hours of tense negotiation at yesterday's meeting of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg, the Danes presented a compromise which briefly raised hopes of a deal. Sir John Cope, UK paymaster general, said Britain intended to back the Danish plan which proposed allowing it to maintain a reduced VAT rate of 2.5 per cent on imported works of art until the end of 1996. This would be lower than for the rest of the Community where member states would have paid an average 5 per cent, under the proposal. UK officials hoped they could extend the lower rate indefinitely beyond 1996, the year when the present transitional regime for VAT rates in the EC is due to end and new negotiations are due to begin. Sir John noted that Britain was determined to protect its market beyond two or three years. But several EC partners objected on the grounds that it was necessary to fix a date for harmonised rates across the EC sometime before the end of the century. Disagreements also arose about the treatment of works of art dating after 1973. Some member states felt that these 'modern' works should receive more favourable treatment. Another unresolved issue concerned German desire for more flexibility in the VAT treatment of used cars.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial office to Vice </F> Premier Yuriy Yarov followed by reply from Yarov: "Vice Premier  Yuriy Yarov: Government Will Redeem its Debts"]    [Text]Letter from Editorial Office    Respected Yuriy Fedorovich! Our newspaper's editorial office  has received a large number of letters in which our readers  basically pose the following questions:    When will the Russian Federation Government be able to  redeem  the interest-free consumer goods bonds (against automobiles,  television sets, refrigerators, etc.) purchased by citizens in  1990? The period for redeeming the bonds ran out in 1993, and  over this period the invested money has become devalued and  confidence in the government has been falling.    Will deposits made in Savings Bank accounts before the  beginning of price liberalization be indexed, and if so, when?  <H5>  Letter to Editorial Office </H5>   Like the editorial office of your newspaper, the Russian  Federation Government receives quite a few letters in which  Russian citizens ask questions about the fate of the 1990 state  targeted interest-free loan bonds for consumer goods.    In 1990 the USSR Government issued bonds equal in value to  the price of the corresponding consumer goods. It was envisaged  that these bonds would be redeemed during 1993 by releasing the  consumer goods -- cars, motorcycles with sidecars, color  television sets, compact tractors, videorecorders, two- and  three-compartment refrigerators, microwave ovens, "Zig-Zag"  sewing machines, "Vyatka-Avtomat" washing machines, and personal  computers.    Russian citizens acquired 3,654,000 bonds for various types  of commodities, including 143,700 for cars.    With conditions of strict state regulation of production and  distribution of output (in accordance with quotas and stocks  under a system of fixed prices), and taking into consideration  the prospects for further growth in output of consumer goods in  high demand, honoring the pledges the government had undertaken  was feasible.    With the transition to a new system of economic management  (without state orders for the production and delivery to the  consumer market of cars and cultural, consumer, and household  goods) and the actual absence of a number of goods prevented the  pledges being honored in 1993. For example, when 30,000 compact  tractors were due in 1993 only 7,000 of them were produced,  likewise the figures for videorecorders were 588,000 and 268,000  respectively. Apart from this, centralized deliveries of  certain types of goods from former union republics stopped  (like, for example, "Tavriya" automobiles from Ukraine and  "Minsk" refrigerators from Belorussia [Belarus]), for which  bonds had also been issued.    The Russian Federation Government is preparing a package of  documents which would allow a resolution of the problem by  redeeming all types of state goods bonds with a partial  indexation of their face value based on the federal budget's  actual potential.    Specifically, the Russian Federation Government adopted 16  April 1994 Decree No. 344 "On State Goods Bonds," in accordance  with which the Finance Ministry will redeem holders' 1990  targeted interest-free loan bonds for domestically produced  consumer goods (apart from for cars) in accordance with present  consumer prices, and for cars at 60 percent of their price. It  will also pay off liabilities in respect of pledges to suppliers  of agricultural output from the 1991 harvest. All these  measures will be taken between 15 June 1994 and 1 June 1995  using the federal budget's assets. In the draft 1994 budget 2  trillion rubles have been set aside to redeem bonds.    That is, despite all the difficulties, the government has  found an opportunity to repay its debt to the citizens of Russia.    The second set of questions concerns the indexation of  people's deposits in the Russian Savings Bank. This is an  important though fairly complex problem. Clearly, everyone  understands well that to instantly restore the deposits' value  might lead to an abrupt boosting of inflationary processes.  Moreover, the state does not today have at its disposal the  necessary financial resources to index all the deposits  realistically.    In connection with this, one possible way of resolving the  problem is to transfer state property, state enterprises'  shares, and land to the depositors. But time is needed to  identify the items of state property, part of whose value could  be transferred to offset the depositors' losses, and to  establish the conditions and time scales for their transfer,  that is, it is impossible to carry out full and immediate  indexation at the moment.    But the government is resolving these questions too.    In accordance with the Russian Federation Government's plan  for immediate action, which was confirmed by Russian Federation  Government Decree No. 192 of 9 March 1994, the Russian Ministry  of Finance, the Russian State Committee for the Management of  State Property, the Russian Ministry of Economics, and the  Russian Ministry of Social Protection of the Population have  been entrusted with the task of preparing the necessary  normative acts on these questions in May of this year.</p>

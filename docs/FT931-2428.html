			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Kohl's ties with industry hit a low THE long-strained relationship between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the business community in Germany has been further damaged by an extraordinary attack by a leading Kohl aide on the chief spokesman for German industry. Mr Friedrich Bohl, the minister in the Chancellor's office, who regularly speaks on behalf of Mr Kohl, issued an outspoken public rebuke of Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI), apparently for criticising the 'solidarity pact' agreed at the weekend. The official statement distributed by the government information office accused Mr Necker of 'sweeping and indiscriminate accusations' against the political establishment. Mr Bohl went on to suggest that the industry federation was itself responsible for increasing wage rates for years beyond the level justified by economic conditions, and in allowing a steady inflation of all the ancillary personnel costs in industry. His outburst was apparently directed at a speech delivered by Mr Necker in Munich on Wednesday, in which he accused 'the political establishment' of failing to adjust its promises to the downturn in the economy. Mr Necker said he was 'relieved' by the weekend agreement on how to finance the solidarity pact, but he also underlined his concern that it would depend too much on borrowing and tax rises, and too little on spending cuts in the west. The pact is intended to operate on two levels: as an agreement between the central government, the opposition and the 16 federal states on financing subsidies for east Germany in the medium-term; and as a deal with employers and trade unions on increased investment and wage restraint. The one element that is still missing is a deal on wages in the east: IG Metall, the giant engineering union, is threatening to hold a strike ballot in defence of its contract for a 26 per cent pay rise in April, and an increase of more than 30 per cent in 1994, to reach parity with western wages. The bitterness of Mr Bohl's statement took officials at the BDI by surprise. They regarded Mr Necker's speech as normal criticism from the private sector.</p>

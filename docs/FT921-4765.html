			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Markets Unease over the political outlook was evident in the weakness of both gilts and sterling this week. It was less clear in the equity market: the FT-SE shed only just over 1 per cent in spite of a wave of rights issues totalling well over Pounds 1bn in two weeks. Perhaps it helped that the news on the dividend front was better than expected, while the rights issues were hardly of the rescue variety so familiar last year. Perhaps equity investors have given up trying to second-guess the budget and election and are looking to the slightly longer term. Whatever the size of the giveaway on Tuesday, the resulting PSBR will be the floor for borrowing in 1992-3 regardless of who wins the election. Add in the Pounds 11bn increase in public spending announced in the autumn statement and a stimulative fiscal stance is guaranteed from the summer on. That said, there is considerable short-term downside risk. The chancellor may just pull off a vote-winning budget, but he faces an excruciating task. Too much prudence in a recession could lose the election; overdoing the tax cuts would be considered bribery. A false move in either direction could undermine sterling, scuppering for good any chance of interest rate cuts. That would certainly make this week in the equity market look like the calm before the storm.</p>

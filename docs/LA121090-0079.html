			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS STAGE NOISY BUT PEACEFUL PROTEST AT N.Y. CATHEDRAL  </P> <P> About 350 AIDS and abortion-rights activists raised a ruckus across from St.  Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday while a few sat quietly inside. It was a far cry  from the pandemonium a year ago that resulted in 113 arrests.  </P> <P> On Dec. 10, 1989, approximately 4,500 protesters gathered to dispute the  church's teachings. Some were arrested for chanting, lying down and chaining  themselves to pews during the service.  </P> <P> This time, four people were arrested -- six blocks from the cathedral -- when  they sat briefly in the street on 5th Avenue, blocking traffic.  </P> <P> Preparing for the anniversary, the Archdiocese of New York got a court order  Friday to keep protesters from disrupting services.  </P> <P> About 450 police officers were deployed. The church was closed after the Mass  began.  </P> <P> Some 25 members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP, and Women's  Health Action and Mobilization, known as WHAM!, walked out of the cathedral  during Cardinal John J. O'Connor's homily, but services were not disrupted,  police said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Renfeng [2621 0088 0023] and Wang Huiping </F> [3769 1979 1627]]    [Summary] The Vice Director, Han Jianjun [7281 1696 6511],  of the Hangzhou City Central Blood Station in Zhejiang Province  has developed a new technique to prepare medium-pure Factor VIII  and to inactivate the viruses in blood. Because Factor VIII  protein maintains its solid state at 4C and the solid and  liquid phases are in a balance state at 4C, Han was able to  skillfully separate the solid and liquid phases of  freshly-frozen plasma at 4C temperature. Using this  technique, he separated Factor VIII protein from the solid phase  by removing the undesirable proteins that dissolved in liquid  phase at 4C. The technique has greatly enhanced the  utilization rate of human plasma. After being separated from  plasma, the purified Factor VIII was preserved in sucrose and  glycine solution and viruses were inactivated for 10 hours at  60C. Using the new technique, the preservation rate of  Factor VIII's biological activity and in vivo recovery rate,  which reached 73.09 percent and 97 percent respectively, were  all much higher than using other conventional methods. According  to data released by Chinese Blood Transfusion Association,  China's annual output of medium-pure Factor VIII is about two  million IU (International Unit), which can only treat 14.1  percent of China's 60,000 hemophilia A patients.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN)--The European Union (EU) intends to  abolish most of the market barriers to Russian products as of  1995. This was announced by Federal Economics Minister Guenther  Rexrodt in a conversation with BERLINER ZEITUNG (Friday [13 May]  edition). Rexrodt, who conducted negotiations with Russian  counterpart Aleksandr Shokhin on the sidelines of the Yeltsin  visit to Bonn, said that, with the exception of "a number of  steel and textile products and the agricultural area," there  will be "totally open markets." He, therefore, considers  Moscow's complaints of blocked access to the markets as "not  quite justified."    The economics minister called the agreement achieved on  future deliveries of railway cars by Deutsche Waggonbau AG  Ammendorf to Russia a "breakthrough." The impending catastrophe  for the company in Halle has been averted. Rexrodt confirmed  during the conversation that Moscow had offered MiG-29's to pay  the debts owed to Germany. However, "we have rejected that. It  does not fit with our military and research plans. At present,  we are unable to agree to such a deal," the minister said.</p>

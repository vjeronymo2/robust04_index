			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / The death of the peasant Peasants are the great sanctuary of sanity . . . When they disappear, there is no hope for the race. Virginia Woolf IT STILL happens in remote parts of the Peloponnese, or in the heel of Italy. Rambling through the groves and terraces of Mediterranean polyculture, you come across a figure in the landscape. He is dressing vines, perhaps, or switching his goats to new pasture. You, a trespasser, give your most ingratiating smile. He, the proprietor or tenant, returns a toothless grin - and goes further. He bids you stay and take a draught of wine with him; then a slice of bread, some olives and a tomato; then, to send you on your way, some fruit of the season. It is a perfect encounter. It is the sort of humane simplicity for which bourgeois north Europeans yearn. It is the constitution of Arcadia - and has been for at least two centuries. From the safety of our stripped pine kitchens, it is easy to allow false honour to the peasant. Get chatting to that shepherd and, soon enough, you realise that he would swap his donkey for a Mitsubishi Shogun if he could. The peasant is most admired by those who (like Woolf) do not have to share his existence - and, still less, his wife's. Any decent study of rural history dispels visions of the picturesque felicity of subsistence as a livelihood. In Britain and France, during the last century, the state of agricultural labourers was wretched. Even writers prone to the idyllic were honest about this. In the French countryside around 1850 only three-fifths of the population ever got to drink wine, and meat - scrag end of rabbit, most likely - was a rare family indulgence. French peasants were kept poor and benighted by an alliance of taxmen, landlords and the clergy. The bon viveurs who broke the ground for Elizabeth David were not, as we would like to think, the peasantry, but city types. So, one can, in this sense, dismiss Woolf's apocalyptic dictum. If she still were with us, I think she would qualify her warning. Originally, it arose in a discussion of Thomas Hardy's Dorset yokels, and the type she had in mind - phlegmatic, besmocked, hands calloused by the dung fork - has long been consigned to sepia postcards. His disappearance can hardly be lamented although, naturally, one feels elegiac about the fading of certain techniques of cultivation and animal husbandry, and worried lest, one day, technological agriculture should collapse and we are left incapable of producing our own food. But no: it is not the end of the world; and in the case of the Dorsetshire labourer, or the Languedoc serf, probably good riddance. But it is the end of Arcadia, and it is the beginning of the end of pastoral values in European society. The companionship of strangers; food whose abundance is governed by season; pure water from a freshet brook or spring; a full panoply of stars at night . . . these are things and spiritual sensations we think we can do without. Ploughboys, these days, do not get seats in parliament; nor stewards of hedgerows, nor even shopkeepers who sell nails by weight and wrapped in newspaper. Call it progress, or the loss of collective sanity: the fact is that it is happening, and it demands a revision of earthly delights. Pastoral hankerings die hard. Britain's nabobs of urban development rarely face up to their own conquest by tarmac: they sneak down to the converted barn in the Dordogne, or the Provencale farmhouse abandoned by the farmer no longer permitted to farm. Here, there is still kindness from strangers; here, you can fulfil a part of the national curriculum, and show your children the stars in the sky. A month in this sort of country is what many of us take to be a marvellous retreat and writers, whether good (AS Byatt) or mediocre (Peter Mayle), have no trouble in its celebration. But we should face up to the truth: Provence is not guaranteed toujours Provence. Provence ultimately is no better inoculated against the 20th century than Merrie England. To cries of English indignation, a motorway is being driven through the Dordogne. And the statistics are simple enough: they show that the numbers employed on the land in France have roughly halved since the mid-1960s. As anyone who sojourned in France this summer will know, numbers are decreasing palpably still. French farming is bound the Euro-way of consolidation and homogeneous efficiency. Virginia Woolf is not around to express her views on Maastricht, the Gatt talks and the French peasants' revolt. But I take her message to extend that far; and I see, in the probable failure of rural France to prevent the treaty, a last hope vanished. The peasant is dead.

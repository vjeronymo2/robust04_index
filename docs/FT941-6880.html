			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Science research panels unveiled Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, is today expected to announce details of 15 panels of advisers to decide UK research priorities. Each panel will have 15 to 20 members and will cover a particular market sector in commerce or industry. The 15 sectors include services, such as finance, as well as high-tech industries such as information technology and electronics. Instead of the original plan to base the programme on about 10 'generic technologies' such as biotechnology or sensors, there will be a more wide-ranging approach giving as much emphasis to 'market pull' as to 'technology push'. Appointments expected include Dr Alan Calder, research and development manager of Zeneca Specialities, as head of the chemicals panel, and Prof John Hillman, Scottish Crop Research Institute director, as head of the agriculture, natural resources and environment panel. The panels, to be announced at the launch of the Technology Foresight programme, will consult this year before forming views on the market and technological developments of the next 10 to 20 years. The programme's steering group, chaired by Prof William Stewart, government chief scientist, will then produce national priorities.</p>

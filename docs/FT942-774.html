			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Court in Thailand acquits speculator Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission, the two-year-old stock market watchdog, received a setback yesterday when a local court acquitted an influential speculator and 11 associates of ramping the share price of the Bangkok Bank of Commerce in 1992. The court ruled that the commission, in its first ever prosecution, had insufficient evidence to show that Mr Song Watcharasrirong - known as Sia (tycoon) Song - and the other 11 acted in concert when they made an estimated Bt2bn (Pounds 52m) profit out of the spectacular rise in the price of the troubled bank's shares. Mr Rapee Sucharitakul, SEC spokesman, said the commission would appeal against the verdict 'all the way to the Supreme Court'. The SEC showed that most of the 12 investors worked from the same room, the same telephone numbers, trans-ferred large sums of money between themselves and bought blocks of shares in the Bangkok Bank of Commerce at or near the same time. On November 24, 1992 - six days after the SEC had filed criminal charges against Mr Song and his 11 associates - the Bank of Thailand said that the 12 people named in the charges had a combined investment portfolio worth Bt16bn. The Thai judiciary - which survived a vigorously attempted revamp during the caretaker premiership of Mr Anand Panyarachun two years ago - has rarely found against well-connected members of the establishment. Nevertheless, observers give the commission credit for getting such a case as far as it did; one of the 11 was the daughter of a former leader of the Democrat party which leads the ruling coalition government. Mr Mark Greenwood, managing director of brokers Asia Equity, said: 'It shows they are willing to drag suspects into court. Anyone engaged in questionable trading has to consider that. OK, maybe you'll get off but maybe you won't' Mr Song is also named in all four of the SEC's outstanding cases against speculators who allegedly cheated the public by manipulating share prices in 1992 and early 1993. The public prosecutor is preparing prosecutions in connection with the sharp movements in the shares of property company Krisda Mahanakorn and the Siam City Bank; the remaining two cases - involving the First City Investment and Rattana Real Estate - are still in the hands of the police. Although the Thai stock market fell heavily yesterday because of concerns over the falling dollar, Mr Sriyan Pietersz, Smith New Court's country representative, said: 'Many retail investors will give a sigh of relief because it means that they are probably a little bit beyond the reach of the SEC.'</p>

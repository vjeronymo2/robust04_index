			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 30 May (MTI) -- "The Hungarian Democratic  Forum (MDF) must admit that it has suffered a defeat in the 1994  parliamentary elections," MDF Chairman Lajos Fur told a news  conference tonight. "Although the defeat was bigger than  expected, the MDF cannot be wiped out of Hungary's political map  because it was supported by 600,000 voters," he said. "The Forum  prepares for its new role as a constructive opposition, keeping  the interests of the country and the entire Hungarian people in  view and unwilling to make a surrender of its principles and  ideals," the MDF chairman said. Fur expressed the conviction  that his party would return to power in four years. Prime  Minister and MDF Deputy Chairman Peter Boross congratulated the  MSZP and its chairman Gyula Horn. "Although it is not yet clear  what kind of government will be formed, I think the chance of a  governing coalition is smaller than it was before the second  round," Boross said. "The victorious party faces four difficult  years because it must come up to the expectations which brought  a victory for it," he said. "The MDF should accept the outcome  of the elections, and draw the conclusions," Boross said.</p>

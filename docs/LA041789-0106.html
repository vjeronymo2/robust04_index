			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MERCEDES MCCAMBRIDGE'S SON'S NOTE EXONERATED HER  </P> <P> In a letter found at his suicide scene, the son of actress Mercedes McCambridge  exonerated her of any wrongdoing in his investment thefts from a Little Rock  brokerage.  </P> <P> "Guilty: John Markle traded your account on an undisclosed discretionary basis.  I added funds to your account, I added losses to the Stephens account," said  John Markle in a letter to his mother about his trading practices at Stephens  Inc. of Little Rock. "Innocent: You are clearly innocent of any wrongdoing in  this matter. I am 100% responsible."  </P> <P> Markle, 45, a broker with Stephens, killed his wife, Christine; his two  daughters, Amy and Suzanne, and himself in their Little Rock home on Nov. 16,  1987, police said. All of the victims, including Markle, were shot more than  once. Police said Markle apparently wore a Halloween-type mask during some of  the shooting.  </P> <P> Markle's letter and other documents found at his house by police investigating  his death became public today at the state Supreme Court when the court  dissolved a stay that had been in effect while it considered his mother's  attempt to keep the documents from public disclosure.  </P> <P> The court previously had denied her petition, but she had requested a  rehearing. Today, the petition for a rehearing was denied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Letters, Diary Pages  </P> <P> Documents in the file included a 13-page handwritten letter by Markle to the  Academy Award-winning actress, pages from a diary he kept in a spiral notebook,  letters to his lawyer and miscellaneous papers.  </P> <P> The diary makes clear that in the month leading up to his suicide, Markle was  engaged in negotiations with Stephens over how much he should pay the firm for  his mishandling of investments that had the effect of transferring money from  Stephens' account to his mother's account.  </P> <P> Three days before the deaths, a diary entry said Markle had asked his mother  for cash, saying he would probably be sued, ruined and eventually end up in  jail.  </P> <P> The diary said Stephens was demanding cash payment of about $1 million by  Markle in the discussions about his handling of the account.  </P> <P> Two weeks before the deaths, Markle went to a gun shop to determine the value  of weapons he owned. He left a list of weapons and the value of each for his  attorney. It was found after Markle's death.  </P> <P> Markle also was conscious of his moods, including them in diary entries, and  often thought in terms of relying on God to help him get through his troubles.  </P> <P> Dairy entries included: "Anxious about all this now," "Uncertain today. I awoke  at 5:30 and was scared. I turned it over to God and went back to sleep until  6:30 to take Suz to school."  </P> <P> A diary entry on Oct. 27, 1987, said: "My wife Christine is the greatest woman  alive and my children are the very, very best. Amy got an A in algebra because  she knew it would make me happy. Suz is such a upward-looking person. None of  these people deserve me. I have put all of their futures in jeopardy. My  relationship with my mother has been destroyed. I fear I have placed my family  at considerable financial risk, i.e., I am broke and they (my) children have no  inheritance left because of my action. Christine says I have put the family  last and I have. There really is only one choice now."  </P></p>

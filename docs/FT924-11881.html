			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Stalling of Russian reform THE TENSIONS which have been building up within the Russian legislative and executive structures are now boiling over. Ministers are warning of coups, the parliamentary speaker talks of threats to his life, the parliament prepares to overturn the government and the president talks of future constitutional chaos. Some of this is the hyperbole attendant upon Russian political life. But much of it is real in substance, even if the forms can look like comic-opera. The battle lines which have been drawn are shifting: but the issues around which the struggle is intensifying are clear enough. Economic reform, of the kind advertised a year ago by President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, is largely stalled. Mass unemployment and even more rapid falls in production have meant that enterprise restructuring has not happened. Two weeks ago Mr Gaidar promised a return to a tighter monetary policy. There is, as yet, no sign of that either. It is not, however, true to say that the government has executed a U-turn; rather it is wallowing in a trough in which the old policy has not been abandoned, but no new one explicitly adopted. At one extreme, the communist/nationalist opposition calls for a restoration of the administrative-command system. The centrist case, put forward by General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president, and Mr Arkady Volsky, the leader of the industrialists' union, is for a 'Chinese variant': a strong state, which probably would have few pretensions to democracy, and a controlled infusion of capitalist relations. Mr Gaidar poured scorn on this, reminding deputies that the Chinese model had no place for an institution like the one in which they were sitting, but Mr Yeltsin is not so sure. In the political arena, the struggle is between the presidency and the parliament - with the presidentially-appointed government becoming more exposed as Mr Yeltsin shifts away from it. The parliament is not so much dominated by communists, as by people who have come under the influence of a national-populist mentality that rejects economic reform as a western imposition and a democratic state as weak. Irrespective of his personal bent - which has not, in practice, been particularly authoritarian - Mr Yeltsin is being corralled into autocracy because neither his own nor any other of the new institutions of power has roots in civil society, which is itself only under construction. Thus the political struggle is personal, factional and ultimately lawless. This gives Russian foreign policy a nervy edge. The emphasis now being given to the country's national interests impinges most obviously on the former Soviet republics. It is clear that the Soviet military is in the ascendancy in this sphere, successfully insisting on keeping armies in Moldova, central Asia, the Caucasus and, most recently, the Baltics, to guarantee the security of the Russian diaspora. Further abroad this is less clear, though the failure of efforts to broker a deal over the Kuriles shows that the nationalist current has set limits on what can be 'given away'. The scheduled negotiations with the IMF next month will reveal how far western assistance, meagre so far, is a factor in the reform process. Russia is an unstable, poor, but massive and militarily powerful state surrounded by even more unstable and poor republics, in which the pressures released by the collapse of the old system have not yet produced law-governed market democracies. The sharp drop in foreign attention is dangerous, for the outcome of the struggles now going on is global in its implications. The conference of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries on aid to the former Soviet states next week should be a forum for reassessing what can be done. The dilemma is a long-standing one: waiting for the Russian authorities to come up with a coherent programme of reform, before providing large-scale assistance, would ensure the failure of reform. Meanwhile, active engagement, with provision of sufficient funds to 'buy' a tolerable transition for the economy, would not guarantee success. Yet to persist in choosing certain failure over an uncertain success must be folly.</p>

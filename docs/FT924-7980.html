			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Disappointment at training commitment MR PAT WALLACE, who is in charge of government-funded training programmes at Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, called it an 'autumn non-statement'. He was disappointed that Mr Lamont had not mentioned training apart from making a brief reference to youth training. He was not the only disappointed training chief. 'I welcome the determination of the government to invest in the development of human capital,' said Mr Brendan McGuinness, director of education and training at the Engineering Employers' Federation in the west Midlands. 'I would have welcomed a stronger commitment in the actual statement to training,' he added. Mr Peter Harrisson, managing director of Linread, the fasteners group, said training was focused too much on the short term. 'You've got to see it long-term as an investment, and that is where one would have liked to have seen government putting some money in,' Mr Harrisson said. Mr Edward Roberts, chief executive of Heath Springs of Redditch and chairman of G10, the group which liaises between Training and Enterprise Councils and the government, said: 'From what we can see at first glance it is a help.' 'They haven't smacked the funding, and they have allowed us more flexibility,' said Mr Richard Archer, a member of the Birmingham Tec board and a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. The greater freedom for TECs to run their own operations and to have three year funding on some training projects Mr Archer classified as 'basic common sense'. It would will also help those who provide training. 'Our planning jumps from year to year. If the TECs get more stability, they can pass it on to us.' He observed it was less difficult to give people qualifications than to find them jobs when they had qualifications. 'I think the whole thing sounds very good for the West Midlands,' said Mr Roberts.</p>

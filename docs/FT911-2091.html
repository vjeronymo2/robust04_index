			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Jacobs Suchard set to generate SFr6bn sales PHILIP MORRIS, the US foods and tobacco group, has re-organised Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss company for which it paid Dollars 3.8bn last year, into a pan-European chocolate and coffee group which is expected to generate sales of more than SFr6bn (Dollars 4.1bn) this year. Mr Raymond Viault, the new chief executive, said yesterday that Jacobs Suchard had already contributed to the good first-quarter results of its US parent but he gave no figures. Philip Morris posted a 21.5 per cent advance to Dollars 942m in net earnings for the three months. Of the original Jacobs Suchard operations, Mr Klaus Jacobs, the majority shareholder, has retained the EJ Brach candy company in the US, the Nabob coffee business in Canada, the Van Houten bulk chocolate company in Europe and three small banks. The Asian, Pacific and Latin American operations have been transferred to other Philip Morris management divisions, leaving a core European business with 1990 sales of SFr4.3bn. To this has been added the Kraft General Foods operations in Scandinavia, France and Germany.</p>

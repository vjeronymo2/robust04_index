			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading DEALERS in stock index futures reported a dull day with most activity centred on rolling positions forward from the December contract ahead of its expiry next Friday, and into the March contract, writes Joel Kibazo. In its last week of trading, the December contract on the FT-SE started strongly at 2,736, a big premium to the underlying cash market. But that large premium soon faded as two leading traders turned sellers and December slipped, falling to the day's low of 2,715 at around 10.30am. Trading then settled in a narrow range of 2,715 to 2,720 for the next four hours until a firm Wall Street led to renewed buying, sending the contract forward once again. Most of the day's activity consisted of dealers rolling forward into the March contract. December finished at 2,731, 4 up from Friday's close and at a 10-point premium to the underlying cash market. Fair value has fallen to zero ahead of the contracts expiry on Friday. Turnover in December reached 8,663 lots, while the March contract saw volume of around 3,800 contracts. Volume in the traded options was poor, reaching only 16,634 contracts by the close, with the FT-SE 100 option accounting for 7,283 contracts of that total. Hillsdown was the most actively dealt stock option. It had 1,959 lots traded, and was followed by Scottish Power on 800 contracts.</p>

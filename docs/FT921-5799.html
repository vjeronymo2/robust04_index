			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Taxes and prices stay in political spotlight TAXES and prices will again dominate pre-election campaigning this week as Labour launches a fresh attack on Tory plans for value added tax and the Tories seek to play up the 'vicious circle' that they say would come from the interaction of the opposition's economic policies. The Liberal Democrats will highlight their 'shadow Budget' with a claim that Labour is being too cautious in its response to the recession. Today, in the last full week of campaigning before the Budget, Labour will focus on the prospect of an extension of VAT to house purchases, fares and funerals. Its attack will include a region-by-region survey of the likely impact on the cost of new homes. It says there is pressure from the European Community for moves towards harmonisation of VAT, but that if a Labour government were involved in the negotiations it would invoke 'a Maastricht-style opt-out'. Later in the week Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, will set out the principles of Labour's Budget proposals. The party will not spell out its plans in detail until after the Budget itself. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said on BBC's On the Record programme yesterday that Labour would bring in an emergency package that would take more than 220,000 people off the unemployment register in the party's first year in power. The Tories this week will contrast the claimed impact of Labour's plans, such as the minimum wage and the removal of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions, with the government's record. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said yesterday that a current lack of confidence was holding back recovery but this would be removed by the election - 'providing we win it'. While Labour is gratified by the impact of its attack on the government over the irresponsibility of borrowing for tax cuts, Mr Hurd insisted in a TV-am interview that there was no need for the Tories to be defensive about public borrowing. He said that the flexibility to respond as necessary to the recession came from being prudent in the years when debt could be repaid. The Liberal Democrats' Budget proposals will be launched on Wednesday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, and Mr Alan Beith, its Treasury spokesman. The plans include the expansion of the party's recovery programme, which is now intended to last two years and to create 600,000 jobs. In earlier estimates it had been expected to last one year and create 400,000 jobs. Mr Ashdown emphasised yesterday that most of the recent polls had indicated there would be a hung parliament after the election. He said on TV-am that in those circumstances he would vote down a minority government that did not offer proportional representation, even if it proposed a Scottish parliament. He added: 'At that stage you would have a government that rejected the judgment of the ballot box, sought to govern on a minority basis and therefore had objected to the democratic judgment of the British people.'</p>

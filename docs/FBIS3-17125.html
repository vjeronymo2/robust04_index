Asked by Interfax to comment on UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's statement that peace-keepers can't be sent to  Abkhazia now because of unsuitable conditions there, Jinjolia  noted that "there have always been conditions for a UN  peace-keeping mission."    In his words, Abkhazia's leadership adheres to a document  signed in Geneva on January 13 at the end of the second round of  Abkhazi-Georgian talks, envisaging the deployment of  peace-keepers on the border between Abkhazia and Georgia along  the Inguri river.    Last month Georgia changed its mind and called for  positioning peace-keepers in Abkhazia, something that the  Georgian leader Shevardnadze insisted on during his visit to  U.S. earlier this month and in his speech at the United Nations.  Meanwhile, the Abkhazi Parliament's Chairman Vladislav Ardzinba  has declared that the introduction of peace-keepers in Abkhazia  without its authorities' consent will be condemned as "an  occupation with all the ensuing implications."</p>

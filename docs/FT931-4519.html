			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Teachers back tests boycott THE PROSPECT of chaos in schools in England and Wales after Easter grew yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. Members of the 190,000-strong National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers voted overwhelmingly to boycott the assessment and testing associated with the government's national curriculum. In a secret ballot, 52,493 (88 per cent) voted in favour of the proposed boycott and only 7,154 (12 per cent) against in a 57 per cent turnout. 'The members' verdict is a stunning indictment of the government's policies on testing and assessment,' said NASUWT's general secretary Mr Nigel de Gruchy. He expects Friday's meeting of the union executive to give the go-ahead to the boycott. Baroness Blatch, the education minister, condemned the action as 'unprofessional' saying it would 'damage and disrupt children's education'.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Government aims to slam door on invasions of privacy: Green paper draws on European code - Lengthy court battles predicted / Public interest to be a defence THERE IS no right to privacy in English or Scots law, as former cabinet ministers, stars of television's ''Allo 'Allo' and members of the royal family can testify. The green paper on infringement of privacy published yesterday canvasses the idea of a new civil action giving individuals the right to sue anyone for damages who causes them distress by invading their privacy. Three years ago a committee chaired by Sir David Calcutt QC concluded that there was no overwhelming case for introducing such a cause of action. It considered, largely on principle and the availability of other options for protecting privacy, that stronger self-regulation by the press with the introduction of criminal offences to cover three forms of physical intrusion would suffice. Asked two years later to consider whether self-regulation had worked, Sir David concluded that it had not and that the government should consider a new civil action for infringement of privacy. Yet in the intervening years there was no obvious increase in public concern about privacy. Between January 1991 and July 1992 the Press Complaints Commission received 211 complaints on privacy including those concerning harassment and intrusion into grief or shock. Of those 109 were admissible and few went to full adjudication. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission receives only one or two cases a year relating to privacy. Even the green paper acknowledges that if a new civil action were created the total volume of cases reaching the courts under a general privacy law 'would probably be in the hundreds rather than the thousands'. The protections of privacy which Calcutt considered sufficient in 1990 are still in place. Seclusion can be protected by trespass and nuisance laws. Personal information can be protected by the laws of breach of confidence, copyright and contract, and private life by laws on defamation and malicious falsehood. The criminal law gives some protection from harassment and physical intrusions, for example under the Interception of Communications Act. In family life domestic violence laws protect spouses and partners from molestation. In recommending the creation of a civil action for infringement of privacy the government appears to have been swayed as much as anything by the express protection accorded to privacy in most other European countries and by the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides that 'everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence'. The French civil code provides that every person has the right to respect for his private life. The right applies only to individuals and not companies, but covers not only invasions of privacy by the press but also by banks, insurance companies, credit agencies and central and local government. French courts can award damages and make orders preventing publication of material which breaches the right of privacy. In Germany the civil code provides a right of action for damages against a person who 'wilfully or negligently injures the life, body, health, freedom, property or other right of another, contrary to the law . . .' In the US most states have statutes or a body of case law protecting privacy, including both criminal offences and civil actions. In Canada several provinces have privacy acts making wilful violation of privacy actionable. The green paper proposes the creation of a civil cause of action in England, Wales and Scotland for individuals in respect of conduct which constitutes an infringement of privacy causing substantial distress, provided that 'such distress would also have been suffered by a person of ordinary sensibilities in the circumstances of the complainant'. Privacy would cover a person's health, personal communications and family and personal relationships and a right to be free from harassment and molestation. The green paper asks whether publication of inaccurate or misleading information or of information 'putting a person in a false light' should be included as a category, and whether it would be appropriate for legislation to include 'appropriation of a person's identity'. The government does not intend to make someone who infringes another's privacy strictly liable. It proposes that a defendant be liable only if the infringement was intentional, reckless or negligent. The green paper proposes several defences: consent, both express and implied; absolute or qualified privilege equivalent to that in defamation cases; and a public-interest defence. It also canvasses the idea that there should be a defence of necessary protection, such as the employment of a private investigator to check on errant spouses or employees suspected of industrial espionage. The government is also seeking comments on whether it should be a defence that the matters in issue were the subject of public record or took place in public. The paper proposes that plaintiffs should be able to obtain an injunction preventing publication of material which would result in an infringement of privacy. The usual maximum level of damages would be Pounds 10,000, with awards of up to Pounds 25,000 in exceptional cases. As with defamation there would be no legal aid available. The government is seeking comments by mid-October. Infringement of Privacy. Consultation Paper July 1993. Available from the Lord Chancellor's Department or the Scottish Office.</p>

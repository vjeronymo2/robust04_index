			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the NASD proposes to amend its short sale rule to track provisions of SEC Rule 10a&hyph;1(e) (7) and (8) concerning short sales effected by special arbitrage accounts and special international arbitrage accounts (``arbitrage accounts''). Currently, the NASD's short sale rule only affords NASD members an exemption from the rule for certain short sales effected in arbitrage accounts. The exemptions from the SEC's short sale rule afforded by Rule 10a&hyph;1(e) (7) and (8), however, are available to any person and are not limited to members of an exchange or the NASD. Thus, the NASD is proposing to replace the word ``member'' with the word ``person'' in the exemptions for arbitrage accounts so that the NASD's short sale rule better tracks comparable provisions of SEC Rule 10a&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, to clarify that the onus for determining entitlement to an exemption falls squarely on options and warrant market makers, the NASD proposes to add new Sections (h)(2)(f) and (i)(4) to the short sale rule to provide that an NASD member will not be in violation of the NASD's short-sale rule if the member executes a short sale for the account of an options or warrant market maker that is in contravention of the options or warrant market maker exemptions, provided that the member did not know or have reason to know that the options or warrant market maker's short sale was in contravention of these exemptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD also is proposing several minor changes to its short sale rule and the accompanying rule governing the designation of Primary Nasdaq Market Makers. First, the NASD proposes to replace references to Nasdaq/NMS securities in these rules with the term Nasdaq National Market securities to ensure uniformity and avoid confusion. Second, because another NASD rule has been designated as Section 46, the same section number proposed for the short sale rule, the NASD proposes to delete the section numbers for short sale rule and the accompanying rule governing Primary Nasdaq Market Makers. Once this filing is approved, these Sections will be numbered sequentially with the next available section numbers. Third, the NASD proposes two minor amendments to the first paragraph of Interpretation C to the short sale rule to correct grammatical mistakes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(b)(6) and 11A(c)(1)(F) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. Section 11A(c)(1)(F) assures equal regulation of all markets for qualified securities and all exchange members, brokers, and dealers effecting transactions in such securities. Specifically, as noted in prior filings regarding the NASD's short sale rule, approval of the proposed short sale rule would result in equivalent short sale regulation in the exchange and Nasdaq markets and would work to prevent fraud and manipulation with respect to short sales in the Nasdaq market. Moreover, the NASD believes that affording index options market makers with an exemption from the rule for legitimate hedging transactions associated with their bona fide options market making activity will serve to minimize the potential adverse impacts, if any, on the options markets resulting from adoption of the NASD's short sale rule. In addition, in light of the safeguards proposed in conjunction with the index options market maker exemption ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the requirement that the short sales be hedges of existing or contemporaneously established index options positions and the limitation of the exemption to index options market makers on indexes with a substantial Nasdaq component), the NASD does not believe that the index options market maker exemption will subsume or eviscerate the effectiveness of the NASD's short sale rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as with the exemption for equity options market makers, the NASD believes it is reasonable and appropriate to approve the index options market maker exemption on an eighteen-month pilot basis. As noted in prior NASD filings concerning the NASD's short sale rule, in the absence of a comparable short sale rule for the options markets, it is not entirely clear to the NASD that abusive short sellers will not be able to circumvent the NASD's short sale rule through the use of the index options markets. Specifically, if index options market makers are not required to adhere to the NASD's short sale rule, the NASD believes it is possible that market participants would aggressively buy puts or sell calls on indexes with a large Nasdaq component confident in the knowledge that the options market makers likely to bear the other side of the contract would almost surely employ their short sale exemption to sell into the bid on Nasdaq. Accordingly, the NASD believes it would be prudent and consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to approve the index options market maker exemption on an eighteen-month pilot basis. During the term of the pilot, the NASD, in cooperation with the options exchanges, will conduct a thorough analysis of the market impacts, if any, resulting from short sales effected pursuant to the exemption. Depending on the results of the study, the NASD will consider whether to seek permanent approval of the exemption, modify the exemption, or withdraw the exemption. In this connection, it is the NASD's intention to not modify or withdraw the exemption unless it can be shown that the exemption is causing demonstrable harm to Nasdaq. Moreover, should it become clear during the term of the pilot that the index options market marker exemption is having an adverse impact on Nasdaq, the NASD will endeavor to make a good faith effort to work with the options exchanges to correct or rectify the concerns associated with the operation of the exemption before seeking to withdraw the pilot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD also believes that approving the exemption for qualified Nasdaq market makers on an eighteen-month pilot basis is consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. While the NASD continues to believe that Nasdaq market makers regularly performing an effective market making function must be permitted the flexibility to sell short when necessary to adjust quickly to market movements and that there are more compelling reasons to provide Nasdaq market makers with an exemption from the short sale rule than options market makers, the NASD, nevertheless, believes it is appropriate to thoroughly examine whether the Nasdaq market maker exemption is causing any adverse market impacts before adopting the exemption on a permanent basis. In addition, approving the Nasdaq market maker exemption on an interim basis is consistent with the proposed pilot exemption for options market makers. Finally, with respect to the other proposed amendments discussed in this filing, the NASD believes they will serve to reduce investor confusion concerning the application and operation of the NASD's short sale rule, thereby promoting efficient and fair markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The entire spectrum of the Israeli political  establishment, both right-wing and left-wing parties, have  condemned the bloodshed in Hebron. Minister Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer called on Yasir 'Arafat to take steps to calm the  Arab public and not inflame passions. Ben-Eli'ezer called for  the rapid separation of religious fanatics from both sides,  noting that he feared that there were additional extreme  right-wing lunatics who were capable of perpetrating such deeds.    Minister 'Uzi Bar'am said that whoever was responsible for  this crime, which put the Jewish people to shame, would receive  their just comeuppance in witnessing the rapid promotion of the  peace process and the division of Eretz Yisra'el between the  Palestinian and Jewish peoples. Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that  if any connection is proved between the shooter and the Kahana  Hay organization or the Committee for Security on the Roads then  immediate action must be taken to legally ban these  organizations.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that the way to fight  Arab terrorism is not through waging Jewish terrorism, which is  totally unacceptable. Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan said that  the criminal behavior of the shooter is a mortal blow to the  settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Knesset Member  [MK] Ra'anan Kohen said that this serious incident necessitates  the immediate convening, even today, of the Knesset's Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee. Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi  condemned the murder of innocent people in Hebron. The  reactions of the political establishment were reported by our  correspondent Hayim Hecht.    Tzvi Katzover, the head of the Qiryat Arba' local council,  said that the vast majority of Qiryat Arba' residents condemn  the massacre and are shocked by the murder of innocent people.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / 1.5p a mile M-way tolls could raise Pounds 700m Tolls on Britain's motorways could raise a total of Pounds 700m a year if applied across the 2,000-mile network, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday. Present government thinking is that cars would be charged a maximum of 1.5p a mile and lorries 4.5p a mile so that a car journey from London to Birmingham would cost Pounds 1.50. This is a lower rate than charged on continental European motorways, and is intended to prevent drivers diverting to side roads. Ministers intend to push ahead with detailed studies of an electronic tolling system which could be introduced by 1998, he said. Vehicles would carry a smart card on their windscreen which would be read automatically from overhead gantries. It also became apparent yesterday that bus companies face pressure to raise fares. When Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, put 3p a litre on petrol in his Budget he also announced that the bus fuel duty rebate, which usually compensates for such increases, would not be raised. London Buses estimates this will add Pounds 3m a year to its costs. However National Express, Britain's largest operator of scheduled coach services, said it planned to absorb the higher costs without increasing fares. Yesterday in a Commons written answer, Mr MacGregor promised that motorway toll charges would be devoted solely to the construction and operation of the motorway network. The Treasury had no objection to reserving such funds for a particular purpose because they were not taxes, he said. He also assured MPs that the government would take the level of charges into account when setting motoring taxes. Electronic tolling is being introduced in many other countries but systems are not yet sophisticated enough for Britain's heavily used motorway network. The transport department is to invite manufacturers to submit details of their technologies in fields such as smart cards. It will then set up a trial system within the next year. Organisations representing road users gave a lukewarm response to the government announcement. The AA and the RAC, motoring organisations, said they accepted the proposal reluctantly and only if the Treasury did not cut the roads budget to compensate for tolls. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said it was like adding a 2 per cent to 3 per cent value added tax by the back door. 'This is a deplorable move which will drive yet more people off public transport,' he said. National Express said it did not think motorway tolls would have a significant effect on its costs but that they might persuade more motorists to switch to coach travel. It called for a special toll rate for public transport vehicles.</p>

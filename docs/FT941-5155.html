			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / The mogul is the message: Potential conflicts of interest for a political mould-breaker Rarely has someone entered democratic politics and achieved such rapid success as Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. The sheer energy and audacity of his plan to become Italy's next prime minister at the head of his four-month-old Forza Italia movement has wrong-footed his opponents. From mid-January onwards, when he announced he intended to fight the March 27 general election, the other parties have watched dumbfounded the seemingly unstoppable ascendancy of Mr Berlusconi. His own polls give Forza Italia 37 per cent of the vote; other polls show large numbers of undecided voters but still give him the lead over his nearest rivals, the left-led Progressive Alliance, with 25 per cent support or more. But as the election campaign gathers pace, chinks are appearing in the armour of the 57-year-old owner of the Fininvest media empire. The strict laws governing the use of electoral propaganda deprive him of his principal instrument - exposure on his commercial television channels. Politically, his alliance with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, essential to launch Forza Italia in the north, is under strain. In the centre and south the National Alliance, the rebaptised neo-fascist MSI movement of Mr Gianfranco Fini, is ever more closely linked to Forza Italia and pulling Mr Berlusconi away from his preferred centre-ground to the right. Mr Berlusconi is running a presidential-style campaign, encouraging the electorate to vote for him as the personification of a new force in Italian politics. But the number of Forza Italia candidates likely to win seats is unclear, and his supporters could choose either of his two main allies, both established parties. Whatever the outcome, Mr Berlusconi's entry into politics has transformed the election into a genuine contest between the social democrat model of government proposed by the Progressive Alliance and a conservative rightwing preaching the virtues of business. The advent of the businessman-politician also raises serious questions. Mr Berlusconi is no ordinary businessman. He has created Europe's second-largest media empire after Bertelsmann of Germany in 25 years. Fininvest is Italy's third-biggest private group with a provisional 1993 turnover of L11,600bn (Pounds 4.7bn). Mr Berlusconi owns three national television channels. These, plus advertising and programme links with regional stations, give Fininvest control over 85 per cent of Italian commercial networks and a 45 per cent share of the national audience. His companies also account for 20 per cent of the domestic publishing market. In every venture so far he has come out on top - not least in his high-profile 1986 purchase of AC Milan football club, which he has turned into the most successful Italian team of all time. Can a man who wields such influence in politically sensitive sectors insulate himself from a conflict of interest once in high political office? The question is all the more relevant in a country where the dividing line between business and politics has long been blurred for mutual benefit. The incestuous relationship between the two fostered the all-embracing corruption that has so discredited Italy's postwar political system. Moreover, Mr Berlusconi is himself a product of this system. He made his first fortune in the rough and ready world of the Milan construction business, and was subsequently a member of the powerful secret masonic lodge P2 that symbolised the shadowy parallel system of power in the Italy of the 1970s. Mr Berlusconi is one of the few top businessmen not to have been directly touched by the corruption scandals. Nevertheless, his brother Paolo, who now runs the family property business, has admitted to paying bribes to local Milan politicians to secure development projects. Four of Mr Berlusconi's senior aides have been caught up in magistrates' investigations into illicit party financing: the Fininvest group, for example, is alleged to have given the main political parties substantial undeclared discounts in the 1992 general elections. 'Having been freed from the corrupting situation where politics controlled business, we now risk falling into the opposite trap of politics being under the thumb of business,' commented Professor Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister and the candidate of the left's Progressive Alliance who is fighting Mr Berlusconi in a Rome constituency. Since his campaign started, the nearest Mr Berlusconi has come to conceding a potential conflict of interest was his move in January to distance himself from management of the Fininvest group. He resigned from all his managerial positions, appointing a chairman, Mr Fidele Confalonieri, his faithful aide and friend since student days. This followed a management shake-up last October, when he created the post of chief executive for Mr Franco Tato, a professional manager who had been running the Mondadori publishing subsidiary. However, Mr Berlusconi retains ownership of Fininvest. According to Fininvest officials, he and his family own 51 per cent of the group via 22 'box' holdings (Holding Italiana numbers 1-22) and the remainder indirectly through two trust companies, Servizio Italia and Saf, set up by the big state commercial bank, BNL. This structure reflects the traditional Italian concern to limit tax liabilities and to conceal the precise individual stakes held by family members. Mr Berlusconi has used the Fininvest infrastructure as the core from which to organise Forza Italia. The national network of the movement's 'clubs' (modelled on AC Milan supporters clubs) is liberally sprinkled with Fininvest employees. Some 40 executives from the group are devoting themselves to the campaign. At the same time an undisclosed amount of Fininvest money has been ploughed into propaganda and organisational activities over the past four months. The state's Media Watchdog Committee, the ombudsman, has few teeth to control this sort of corporate involvement in a political campaign, or indeed corporate ownership by a politician running for office. 'There is no precedent for this kind of situation,' said a committee spokesman. 'The existing law does not envisage any trustee arrangement for the proprietary and beneficial interests of a media owner if and when they take public office. It is sufficient that he relinquishes an executive role.' Mr Berlusconi has a lot riding on his campaign. It is far from clear that he would continue as a professional politician if he lost. This perception has prompted sceptics to conclude that Mr Berlusconi is running for office in part to protect his business interests. Mr Luciano Benetton, head of the Benetton leisure wear group, said as much last week: 'Silvio Berlusconi's love of politics is motivated by a fear of losing his television interests.' Mr Tato, Fininvest chief executive, says quite openly: 'If Berlusconi loses, and the left wins, we risk losing one television channel immediately and a second within two years.' This could mean the loss of as much as a quarter of Fininvest's total revenue base. Mr Berlusconi's grip on the media has become a principal focus for his opponents' fire, which he has cleverly countered by claiming that the state-run RAI broadcasting channels are biased against him. He cannot disguise the fact, however, that no other European government has allowed one individual to accumulate such television power. The Italian press irreverently refer to Mr Berlusconi as 'Su' Emittenza' (a pun on the address for a cardinal which literally means 'his transmitter-ship'). His exceptional dominance of commercial television reflects the highly politicised world of the Italian media. As a result of complex horse-trading among the political parties the haphazardly devolved structure of national television networks was formalised in the 1990 'Mami law'. The law confirmed the presence of three state-run RAI channels and six national commercial channels, of which three were for Fininvest, confirming its dominant market position. The only other network of note was Telemontecarlo, in the hands of the Ferruzzi group. Mr Berlusconi got away with his near monopoly because the Christian Democrats and Socialists controlling parliament were obsessed with retaining their manipulative hold of the RAI and its news programmes. At the same time both parties, and especially the Socialists through their leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, were repaying Mr Berlusconi for his political support. Mr Craxi's Socialist connections also helped pave the way for Mr Berlusconi to take a stake in Spain's Telecinco and in France's first commercial television station. Efforts to reform the law have consistently been blocked because the main parties refused to surrender control of RAI. 'Everyone recognises the Mami law reflected the position of the political parties at a particular time and this situation of course no longer applies,' said a spokesman for the Media WatchDog Committee. Mr Berlusconi has already experienced pressure over his media ownership. Under a 1992 law limiting cross-holdings of newspapers and television interests media, he was obliged to offload a majority stake in his newspaper, Il Giornale, to his younger brother Paolo. This did not stop him this January ejecting the editor in a very public row, in a clear defiance of the spirit of the 1992 law. Now, with the RAI in desperate financial straits and the links with the old political parties severed, a rearrangement of television licences has become an important item on the agenda of the next government. The Progressive Alliance, dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), has said it will limit ownership of television channels to one per group. Even Mr Bossi, Mr Berlusconi's electoral ally, has suggested a curtailment of his television power. Thus, even if Mr Berlusconi comes on the winning side, the question of Fininvest's television power cannot be ignored. If he loses, more than just his political ambitions will be under threat.</p>

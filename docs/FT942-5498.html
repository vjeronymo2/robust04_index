			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Workers in public sector 'take more sick leave' Public-sector workers take an average of 10 days sickness absence a year compared with 7 1/2 days in the private sector, according to a survey for the Confederation of British Industry. Overall absence through sickness costs employers Pounds 11bn a year, says the survey. However, it acknowledges that this could be an underestimate because it takes no account of lost production. If the public sector were brought into line with the private sector, says the CBI, the saving for taxpayers could be Pounds 640m. But the survey also shows that while the cost of absence has fallen by Pounds 2bn, from Pounds 13bn in 1992, the number of working days lost has increased by 5m to 166m. This reflects the growth in part-time work and the fact that the cost of providing cover is lower for part-timers.</p>

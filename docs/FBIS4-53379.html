			<p>BFN     [Text] SINGAPORE, May 19 (AFP) -- It would not be in the  United States' interest to deny China its most favoured nation  (MFN) status, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said here Thursday.    Responding to questions at a business conference, Li said:  "MFN is mutually beneficial and the basis for our bilateral  trading relationship. The granting of MFN status and  preservation of MFN treatment is of fundamental interest to our  two countries."    Li's comments came as reports from Washington suggested US  President Bill Clinton was considering partial withdrawal of  China's trading privileges. He must decide on his course of  action by June 3. Clinton said last year that he would not  renew China's MFN status unless Beijing made "significant  overall progress" on human rights. Beijing has warned that it  would retaliate against a withdrawal of MFN, and Chinese Premier  Li Peng said earlier this week that China would not tolerate  interference in its internal affairs.    Li Lanqing said he had not heard of proposals for limited  penalities on Chinese exports as an alternative to total  withdrawal of China's MFN status but commented that the  privilege was "mutually beneficial" and important for bilateral  trade.    The three-day conference, organised by the New York-based  Asia Society, has attracted 800 business and political leaders,  mostly from Asia-Pacific.    Washington's decision to link China's MFN status to human  rights has been criticised by some Asian governments, worried  that a withdrawal would cause regional economic and political  harm.    Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong Tuesday warned that  any move to cut off Asia's booming economies from western  markets could trigger the formation of an Asian trade bloc.    "An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a  viable option," Goh told the same conference Tuesday.    Li said China would continue to modernise its economy, tap  opportunities abroad and provide conditions for foreign  investors to prosper.    "China's development cannot do without the world and the  world's development needs China's participation," he said.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The wool price rise continued and accelerated this week. Superfine merinos, now coming up for auction more widely in Australia, met with good demand from Italy, the leading world operator in this field. Prices for finer merino fleece throughout the wool market recovery, now well over a year old, have risen relatively more than other categories, and show no signs of losing ground. With the wool market recovering healthily after a brief setback towards the end of September, sales of Australian stockpile wool have also improved, and the schedule fixed by the government is filled well into 1995. Buying interest in the wool-using industry is not at present said to be buoyant though steady business and good rates of activity continue. The Australian Eastern states market indicator closed at 802 cents a kg, compared with 762 a week ago.</p>

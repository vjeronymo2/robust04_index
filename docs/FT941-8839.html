			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium market 'faces long haul' Market equilibrium in the troubled aluminium sector is unlikely before 1996, according to a study by Australian Mineral Economics. The forecaster says that, with market prices hovering above USDollars 1,000 a tonne and a record 4.2m tonnes of primary aluminium in world stockpiles, the industry 'now faces a long haul back'. Prices will remain weak in the short-term, it suggests, and could drop below the USDollars 1,000 a tonne in the first half of this year. AME forecasts an average price of Dollars 1,100 a tonne in 1994, rising to USDollars 1,400 by 1995. Consumption growth in 1994 and 1995 will average close to 4 per cent, it thinks, helped by the US economic recovery and improvement in other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The consumption growth in OECD economies 'will be slower than in previous cyclical upswings', the study says. But the upturn should be sufficient to outstrip primary production in the western world and CIS imports. Industry stocks, therefore, should see some reduction. Only in 1996 does AME suggest that prices could be moving back towards their 'long-term trend' at about Dollars 1,600 a tonne. By the late-1990s, it predicts further rises to Dollars 1,800 or higher, with stocks possibly dropping to as little as 1.2 months consumption by 1999. A new cyclical downturn could then see stocks rising again in the year 2000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- The State Duma has made  quite a good start. The main problems are ahead. They will  arise during the discussion of draft laws. The division of  forces in the lower chamber is not yet final. This is the  opinion of deputies of various political orientation in the  State Duma, expressed to ITAR-TASS.    "The Duma vacillates between utter uncontrollability and too  rigidly controlled decision-making of heads of groups," believes  Vasiliy Lipitskiy, head of the People's Party of Free Russia,  who was elected from a one-seat constituency and who has not  joined any faction in the Duma. He believes new factions may be  formed. Many deputies regret that the Duma does not have  clearly defined centrist forces "which could balance the  struggle which leads to shaky compromises," he said.    Another independent deputy, Irina Hakamada, general  secretary  of the Party of Economic Freedom, believes that the forming of  new groups of deputies is inevitable. The "Union of December  12" being formed by Hakamada and a number of her supporters will  soon amass 35 members and will become eligible for registration.    She refuted the supposition that the new group will be a  subsidiary of Russia's Choice bloc. "We are closer to market  reforms than anybody else, regardless of party affiliations,"  she said. (It should be noted Gaydar said that his group  discussed more than once reinforcing the Union of December 12  with members of Russia's Choice bloc).    Sergey Baburin, elected from a one-seat constituency, said  that 17 people so far applied for Russia's Path group that he is  forming. The group will exist de facto even while not  registered. He said other people with patriotic leanings are in  various party factions and in the "New Regional Policy" group.  Baburin, the leader of the Russian National Alliance, expressed  dissatisfaction with the fact that "the patriotic forces  relinquished key committees to Russia's Choice bloc and its  supporters." Nevertheless he believes there is every chance  that the Duma will be effective legislatively if it is effective  politically.    "The Duma has shown that it is effective," said Vladimir  Isakov, elected on the slate of the Agrarian Party of Russia.  Isakov, who was one of the most remarkable representatives of  the opposition in the former Supreme Soviet, believes the new  parliament has been able to avoid the main pitfall, that of  being bogged down in organisational matters for weeks. He said  the package vote on the list of deputy speakers and heads of  committees was a reasonable compromise that made it possible to  avoid wasting weeks on voting on appointments.    Assessing the alignment of forces in the Duma, he said that  it is split approximately in half with the left opposition  having a slight edge. Neither of the factions, nor any of the  sides has a guaranteed majority. So compromises should be  sought. Extreme decisions will not be passed.    Isakov said the main danger is that no decisions will be  passed on key problems of reform in the lower chamber. "We have  not yet tackled these matters," he said.    There are differences among deputies on the draft laws on  the  economy and the question of the media," said Kirill Ignatiyev,  representative of Russia's Choice faction. He believes the  structure of the Deputies Corps has already been determined. It  has two extremist wing (the right wing -- LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] and the left wing -- communists and  agrarians) and the centre which is formed of Russia's Choice and  other democratic factions.    He said there is no complete unanimity in the centre.  Russia's Choice, the group of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord and the Union of December 12 mainly vote in the same way,  while members of Yabloko and the new regional policy group all  vote differently.    Speaking highly of professionalism and proper conduct of  Speaker of the Duma Ivan Rybkin, Ignatiyev predicted that a  political alliance of Viktor Chernomyrdin and Ivan Rybkin will  gradually form. The government without reformers will rely on  the parliamentary majority which will include the extreme left  -- communists and agrarians, part of the "New Regional Policy"  faction and part of the group of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord, he said.    Leader of the Democratic Party of Russia group, Nikolay  Travkin, believes the Duma has a high potential in organising  itself. He believes this was shown by the fact that it had  completed the formation of working bodies on the fourth day of  work.    Travkin believes not a single political trend can earn half  the number of votes. This has a positive aspect as an  irresponsible decision will not be passed by the Duma in a rush.    Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy, representative of Yabloko group  said the voting on a package in electing the leadership of the  lower chamber and heads of committees had been an achievement.  Heated debates in the Duma immediately subsided. People  realised that there is an opportunity for actual specific work.    Shostakovskiy believes that during an intermission of  plenary  meetings, when work is conducted in committees, the role of  factions will decrease for some time. "Nothing could be worse  than continued political clashes and overly politisation. If  this were so, it would be an end of Duma, he said. The chief  task at present is to draw up a programme of the legislative  activity of the Duma and of each of its committees,  Shostakovskiy believes.</p>

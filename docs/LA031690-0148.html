			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RILEY, BREA OFFICIAL URGE USE OF COUNTY FUNDS TO EXPEDITE ROAD PROJECTS  </P> <P> With state and federal money for highway projects drying up, two Orange County  Transportation Commission members recommended Thursday that authorities dip  into county funds to add new freeway lanes, help ease the financial crunch on  three proposed toll roads and speed property acquisition for the Santa Ana  Freeway widening.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and Brea Councilwoman Clarice A. Blamer said in the  draft of a letter to be sent to county transportation officials that the county  needs "to put every transportation dollar to work as soon and as effectively as  possible."  </P> <P> "This illustrates our difficult financial situation," said Stanley T. Oftelie,  executive director of the County Transportation Commission. "We're going to be  spending the last resources we have. It's not going to be too long before the  cupboard is bare. There's just no money left."  </P> <P> Money for the projects would come from a cache of about $195 million that had  been earmarked mostly for construction of a planned elevated transit-way for  buses and car pools along the Santa Ana Freeway. In exchange, the state  Department of Transportation could reimburse the county or provide credit for  the construction of other projects, Riley and Blamer suggested.  </P> <P> Previously, the county funds had been left untouched, although the interest has  generated more than $21 million in road-reconstruction work and traffic-signal  coordination projects in recent years.  </P> <P> "We need to invest our resources in traffic solutions which provide  high-impact, high-priority projects," Riley and Blamer said in the letter. "The  transportation future for our county is now. Our ability to wait for a better  future has been stretched to the limit. . . . We need to act swiftly or we may  be engulfed in traffic congestion."  </P> <P> The recommendations from Riley and Blamer, who could not be reached for comment  Thursday, come as a precursor to a March 26 meeting of the Transportation  Commission and the Orange County Transit District.  </P> <P> Among projects spotlighted by Riley and Blamer are the proposed addition of two  car-pool lanes on the Orange Freeway later this year and widening of the  traffic-choked Riverside Freeway.  </P> <P> In addition, they recommend that county transportation officials explore  offering loans to the agency planning the three toll roads in southern and  eastern Orange County. The agency has experienced recent financial  difficulties.  </P> <P> Riley and Blamer also proposed that county transportation officials work with  the state transportation department to accelerate the purchase of land along  the Santa Ana Freeway for a widening project that will more than double the  number of lanes.  </P> <P> In recent months, a personnel shortage at Caltrans has hindered the agency in  expeditiously purchasing land along the freeway corridor, the two officials  said in the letter. Moreover, authorities say that state cash for property  acquisition will dwindle if a gas-tax increase is not approved by California  voters in June.  </P> <P> "We believe the agencies should work cooperatively to develop innovative ways  to keep the right-of-way purchase process moving ahead rapidly," the letter  says, adding that county money should be used to hire additional Caltrans staff  and buy land.  </P> <P> County officials are eager to buy the land as soon as possible, reasoning that  its cost will only continue to rise.  </P> <P> If money was available, work on the Orange Freeway car-pool lanes, which are  expected to cost $26 million, could begin before the end of the year.  </P></p>

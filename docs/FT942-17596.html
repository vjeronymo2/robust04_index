			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Downturn in France hits Ash &amp; Lacy A difficult year for its galvanising plants in France left 1993 pre-tax profits for Ash &amp; Lacy, the metalwork company, 9 per cent lower at Pounds 3.41m, against Pounds 3.74m. Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 54.2m, compared with Pounds 53.9m. The West Midlands-based company said that trading conditions had continued to be difficult, particularly in France which suffered a further weakening of demand affecting its large scale plants. UK galvanising increased sales and profits with a good contribution from the Midlands and manufacturing increased profits as a result of a good performance from the storage tank division. Earnings per share were 8.26p (9.76p). An unchanged final dividend of 3.9p maintains the total at 6.4p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Duncan Guy] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- Police on Sunday [17  April] night found four men who claimed to be Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] members being held captive in a cell in the basement  of the African National Congress regional headquarters in  Johannesburg after a fifth man told a patrol in Hillbrow he had  escaped.    Three of those inside were elderly and the fourth was a  14-year-old, said Witwatersrand Police Spokesman Col Dave Bruce  who added that they all showed signs of serious assault. He  said when members of the flying squad attempted to enter the  building, Lancet Hall, a man tried to prevent them from gaining  access by pointing a firearm at them. One of the captives said  he had been held since April 16.    Col Bruce also said the ANC members had told police the  captives were caught breaking into a vehicle and that they had  planned to call them when the flying squad arrived. The ANC  have not yet furnished comment.    ANC spokesman Mr Ronnie Mamoepa said he was not aware of the  details of the police report. "It is not the policy of the ANC  to hold people against their will," he said, adding that a full  statement would be issued later in the day.</p>

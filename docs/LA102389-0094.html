It was his second  game-winning field goal in the final seconds in the last three weeks.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay's Ricky Reynolds blocked a Ralf Mojsiejenko punt and returned it 33  yards for a touchdown in a 32-28 loss to Washington. It was only the second  blocked punt in the 13-year history of the franchise and the first touchdown  scored by a Bucs' punt-return unit.  </P> <P> Bobby Hebert threw touchdown passes of 54 yards to Floyd Turner and 37 yards to  Eric Martin on consecutive plays early in the third quarter to send the New  Orleans to a 40-21 victory over the Rams.  </P> <P> David Treadwell, who missed a 27-yard attempt with 16 seconds left in  regulation, converted a 27-yard field goal with 7:14 left in overtime to give  the Denver a 24-21 victory at Seattle.  </P> <P> Earl Ferrell scored two of his three touchdowns in the first quarter and  Phoenix ended its four-game losing streak with a 34-20 win over Atlanta.  </P> <P> Jack Trudeau threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Albert Bentley and Eric  Dickerson dashed 21 yards for another score in the final two minutes as  Indianapolis pulled away from Cincinnati for a 23-12 victory.  </P> <P> Warren Moon completed his first eight passes and threw three touchdown passes  in the first half, leading Houston to a 27-0 victory over Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Linebacker Mike Merriweather had one sack, one interception, caused two fumbles  and recovered one of them for Minnesota in the Vikings' 20-7 win over Detroit.  </P> <P> San Diego's Vencie Glenn scooped up a fumble by Maurice Carthon and returned it  81 yards for a touchdown -- the longest fumble return in team history -- in the  Chargers' 20-13 loss to the New York Giants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FILLING IN  </P> <P> Steve Young, taking over when Joe Montana suffered a slight knee sprain late in  the first half, threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice in the third  quarter to break a 17-17 tie and the San Francisco 49ers went on to defeat New  England, 37-20. Young completed 10 of 11 passes for 188 yards and three  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Frank Reich, in his second start in place of the injured Jim Kelly, threw three  touchdown passes as Buffalo routed the New York Jets, 34-3.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INJURIES  </P> <P> San Francisco safety Jeff Fuller suffered multiple fractures in his neck on the  second play of the 49ers' 37-20 victory over New England, causing nerve-root  damage that may cost him full use of his right arm. Team physician Dr. Michael  Dillingham said the injury is not life-threatening and that Fuller is in stable  condition, alert and able to move his extremities, in the intensive care unit  at Stanford University Hospital. Fuller also sustained a concussion. He was  injured when he tackled Patriot running back John Stephens. Fuller, was  administered oxygen before being taken from the field by ambulance to the  hospital.  </P> <P> Later in the game, the 49ers lost two other players to fractures -- linebacker  Jim Fahnhorst with an apparent stress fracture in his right foot and reserve  fullback Harry Sydney with a slight fracture in his left arm.  </P> <P> San Francisco fans got another scare in the closing seconds of the first half  when quarterback Joe Montana was carted off the field with an injured left  knee. However, Montana jogged back to the sidelines in the fourth quarter and  team officials said he could have returned to the game, if needed.  </P> <P> Phoenix, which has had 12 starters go down with injuries since the season  started, lost rookie defensive tackle Jim Wahler with a sprained left knee in  the third quarter and cornerback Carl Carter with a pulled right hamstring in  the first half of the Cardinals' 34-20 win over Atlanta.  </P> <P> Denver fullback Jeff Alexander was sidelined with a sprained ankle in the first  quarter of the Broncos' 24-21 overtime win over Seattle.  </P> <P> Cornerback Darrell Green of Washington suffered a dislocated left wrist in the  third quarter of the Redskins' 32-28 victory over Tampa Bay. He underwent  surgery Sunday night and will be out two to six weeks.  </P> <P> Running back Troy Stradford, who gained 53 yards in 15 carries, suffered a knee  injury in the Dolphins' 23-20 victory over Green Bay. Stradford will be  sidelined indefinitely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE GREAT OUTDOORS  </P> <P> Houston Oiler Coach Jerry Glanville was bitten by a poisonous water moccasin  snake as he walked through high grass near his home Saturday.  </P> <P> He was hospitalized Saturday night and came to the Astrodome on crutches for  Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.  </P> <P> Glanville discarded the crutches, however, and came onto the field with the  team without a noticeable limp.  </P> <P> The Oiler coach was bitten on the top of his right foot after he stepped on the  large snake near a home under construction in his neighborhood southwest of  Houston.  </P> <P> After Houston's 27-0 victory, Glanville reserved his biting comments for  Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll, with whom he has openly feuded since 1987.  </P> <P> "I thought Chuck was in my neighborhood yesterday but I guess not. We'll talk  about that later, let's enjoy the team win," said Glanville, who was scheduled  to be tested by doctors again after the game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOWLIGHTS  </P> <P> Lars Tate was Tampa Bay's leading rusher with seven yards in six carries in a  32-28 loss to Washington. The Bucs finished with one yard on the ground in 10  carries.  </P> <P> Atlanta linebacker Aundray Bruce was ejected from the Falcons' 34-20 win  against Atlanta with 10:27 left in the first quarter for leaving the bench to  join in a brief on-field fight, which started after a hard sack of Phoenix  quarterback Gary Hogeboom by linebacker Marcus Cotton.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh defensive end Keith Willis helped the Oilers to a touchdown with  consecutive 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Willis was flagged 15  yards for bumping an official and another 15 yards for throwing his helmet  after the first penalty.  </P> <P> The Phoenix-Atlanta game, played in 78-degree weather, drew just 33,894 at  74,724-seat Sun Devil Stadium, the smallest crowd since the Cardinals moved  from St. Louis last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MILESTONES  </P> <P> Eric Dickerson, who rushed for a season-high 152 yards in 31 carries in  Indianapolis' 23-13 victory over Cincinnati, established a team record with his  17th 100-yard game, surpassing Lydell Mitchell on the all-time Colt list.  </P> <P> Christian Okoye of Kansas City carried the ball a team-record 33 times, gaining  170 yards and scoring twice in the Chiefs' 36-28 victory over Dallas.  </P> <P> J.T. Smith had seven receptions for 96 yards in Phoenix's 34-20 victory over  Atlanta, moving him into a tie for fifth place with Mel Gray on the Cardinals'  all-time receiving list. Smith has 351 career receptions.  </P> <P> Roger Craig of the 49ers established a team record for rushing touchdowns with  a three-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter of San Francisco's 37-20 victory  over New England. With his 62nd career touchdown, Craig surpassed Ken Willard  on the all-time 49er list.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STREAKS  </P> <P> Stephone Paige of Kansas City had two catches for 33 yards, extending to 55 his  streak for games with receptions, in the Chiefs' 36-28 victory over Dallas.  </P> <P> Tight end Mickey Shuler of the New York Jets had three catches for 34 yards,  extending to 85 his streak for games with receptions, in the Jets' 34-3 loss to  Buffalo.  </P> <P> Miami extended its NFL record to 19 consecutive games without allowing a sack  in a 23-20 win against the Green Bay Packers. Since last allowing a sack, the  Dolphins have attempted 766 passes -- including 740 by Dan Marino. Tackle  Ronnie Lee, center/tackle Jeff Dellenbach, guard Roy Foster and guard Harry  Galbreath have started each of the games during the streak.  </P> <P> Anthony Carter of Minnesota had one catch for 16 yards, extending to 56 his  streak for games with receptions, in the Vikings' 20-7 victory over Detroit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IN QUOTES  </P> <P> New England linebacker Ed Reynolds, on playing in the Bay Area: "I don't think  a lot of us were crazy about coming out here to play. There was a lot of death  out here. I thought we came here out of respect for the fans. Any time there is  a catastrophe like they had here, your mind is on it, but we were also getting  an opportunity to play the champions, and any time you have that, you want to  play."  </P> <P> Patriot fullback Mosi Tatupu: "It was kind of a weird atmosphere around here.  It was kind of an awkward feeling having to come here to play a game. We just  had to try to remember to win the game."  </P> <P>  San Francisco center Jesse Sapolu: "You do your best to move on, even while  you know people are still trapped under that freeway."  </P> <P>  Miami kicker Pete Stoyanovich after his 27-yard field goal gave the Dolphins a  23-20 victory over Green Bay: "I remembered one thing -- he (holder Scott  Secules) said if it ever happens again, turn toward him so he can be in the  picture."  </P> <P> Quarterback Ken O'Brien after the Jets committed three turnovers and were  called for nine penalties in a 34-3 loss to Buffalo: "Mistakes, week after  week, are killing us. It seems we're pulling the noose a little tighter on  ourselves all the time."  </P> <P> Bubba McDowell, Houston's rookie safety, who had two interceptions in the  Oilers' 27-0 win: "Coach (Jerry) Glanville told me on Monday that I couldn't  make any more rookie mistakes."  </P> <P> Paul Palmer, a former first-round draft choice of Kansas City signed this week  by Dallas, on playing against his former team: "I was taunting the (Kansas  City) coaching staff a little bit. My fiancee said, 'Now, they'll know what  it's like to hold their breath every time you carry the ball.' I felt like that  today. It felt good to get that touchdown against the Chiefs defense because  they're exceptional against the run."  </P> <P> New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor on quarterback Jim McMahon, who  completed only 12 of 27 passes for 133 yards in San Diego's 20-13: "He's a  gutsy player, but it's a different type of Jim McMahon now. Maybe they're  asking him to do different things here."  </P> <P> Seattle kicker Norm Johnson, on missing a 40-yard field-goal attempt in a 24-21  overtime loss to Denver: "I was waiting for that kick all day long. Then when I  finally get the opportunity, I miss it. Forty yards is nothing. I can make  those in my sleep."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TONIGHT'S GAME  </P> <P> Chicago at Cleveland, 6 p.m., PDT -- Some of the Chicago Bears worry about  their health when Coach Mike Ditka periodically gets angry.  </P> <P> Linebacker Mike Singletary worries about Ditka's health.  </P> <P> "That's the only thing that scares me when he acts like that," Singletary said  as the Bears (4-2) prepared to meet the Cleveland Browns (3-3).  </P> <P> Ditka talked of mellowing after suffering a heart attack last Nov. 2. Yet he  let the health problems sideline him for only one game, and last week he became  angry after the Bears dropped their second consecutive game, committing six  turnovers in a 33-28 loss to the Houston Oilers.  </P> <P> "I mellowed the week I was in the hospital," Ditka said. "I got excited last  week. Every once in a while, you have to blow off some steam, and I blew off  some steam."  </P> <P> Both teams have been dogged by injuries. Chicago's defense has been riddled by  injuries to Richard Dent, Dan Hampton and Jim Morrissey. In Cleveland, there is  concern about quarterback Bernie Kosar's right elbow, which he sprained last  season.  </P> <P> Kosar threw a career-high four interceptions last Sunday in Cleveland's 17-7  loss to Pittsburgh, but said his elbow is fine. "I don't think it's a problem,"  Kosar said. "I've been throwing the deep ball pretty good -- not as good as I'd  like, but the distance on my throws hasn't been a factor."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Chairman Huang Kun-hui of  the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] on Saturday blasted Beijing  as "irresponsible, unresonable, and having no basic respect of  human rights" or its handling of the Lake Qiandao disaster, in  which the charred bodies of 24 Taiwan tourist and eight mainland  crew members and guides were found aboard a tour boat.    "There are so many doubts that have yet to be cleared up  about the disaster," Huang said in a press briefing held at  Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The briefing was  attended by some 150 foreign and local reporters, as well as  relatives of the Taiwan victims.    The deaths occurred March 31 on Lake Qiandao, or Thousand  Island lake, in the coastal Province of Zhejiang. The bodies  were found one piled on top of another, most of them burned  beyond recognition, in the lower-deck cabin of a cruise boat.    Huang listed several challenges to Beijing's claim that the  deaths are accidental, and not the result of a robbery.    --The cruise was first reported missing at 5 p.m. on March  31  and was found on fire at 8 a.m. the next day. How could the  searchers fail for 15 hours to find the burning boat, and how  could the fire last for so long?    -- Why were the 32 victims found in the lower-deck cabin?  Why didn't the four crew members, reported to be excellent  swimmers, or any on the other victims jump off the boat to  escape the fire?    -- Why were only the upper parts of the bodies charred while  their lower parts remained roughly intact?    -- Why were only a few personal belongings of the victims  found, and not all the belongings they were known to be carrying?    -- Why were autopsies performed on the bodies without the  prior approval of the relatives?    -- Why did Beijing bar the relatives from taking pictures of  the ship and reject their request to take the bodies back to  Taiwan?    -- Why didn't the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan  Straits, which is authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan,  immediately inform its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange  Foundation, about the incident? Why did Beijing refuse to allow  the SEF to provide humanitarian assistance to the relatives on  the mainland?    -- Why did Beijing bar reporters from approaching the site  and from interviewing the relatives?    While calling on international human rights organizations to  show more concern about the incident, Huang said that Beijing's  failure to clear up doubts about it would be tantamount to  confessing its disregard for human life.    He said that Taiwan will change its policy towards the  mainland, pending the results of Beijing's investigation.    Huang also noted that the fifth round of cross-strait  technical talks, scheduled to be held later this month in  Taipei, will be postponed until the Lake Qiandao tragedy is  properly resolved.</p>

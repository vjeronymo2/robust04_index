			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Ambassador Hatano by Moritatsu Tahara, </F> reporter, MAINICHI SHIMBUN in New York; date not given]    [Text] [Boxed item: Yoshio Hatano was born in 1932. In  1953, he quit his studies at Tokyo University's Law Faculty to  work at the Foreign Ministry. Before assuming his current post  as ambassador to the United Nations in February 1990, Mr. Hatano  served as head of the Personnel Division of the Minister's  Secretariat, head of the Middle Eastern and African Affairs  Bureau, and ambassador of Japan's UN delegation in Geneva.]    Some say that the United Nations entered a new era after the  Cold War ended, when it was faced with an upheaval in the  international situation, i.e., the Gulf war. The advent of this  new era was marked by the appointment of Butrus Butrus-Ghali as  UN secretary general (January 1992). We asked Yoshio Hatano, UN  ambassador, who has played a role in the "history of the new  United Nations" for three-and-a-half years, including the two  years in which Japan was a non-permanent member of the Security  Council (until 1993), to describe the current situation at the  United Nations.  <H5>  Mountains of Requests for PKO Missions </H5>   [EKONOMISUTO] What effects have the recent cataclysmic  changes, including the collapse of the Berlin Wall, had on the  United Nations?    [Hatano] During the Cold War, the United Nations did not  reach agreements on any political problems. Nor did it reach  agreements on economic problems either, since the interests of  advanced nations and developing nations conflicted. Ultimately,  the United Nations managed to justify its existence by handling  social problems like refugee aid and human rights.    When the Cold War ended, the Security Council began to agree  on political problems as well, and to lay the groundwork for  world peace and security. I first became clearly aware of this  change during the Gulf war.    The United Nations had acquired the confidence and the  assertiveness to establish a "just peace" by intervening in  disputes.    [EKONOMISUTO] Do you mean that the UN Secretariat has gained  confidence?    [Hatano] No, I was referring to all the member nations.  Furthermore, expectations of the United Nations are overly  high. Now the prevailing notion is that the United Nations will  intervene to establish a just peace any time a dispute occurs  anywhere in the world.    Consequently, the United Nations now has no choice but to  respond to these expectations. Even when it cannot expect to be  successful, it cannot just stand back and do nothing. In  particular, requests are beginning to come in from all over the  world for PKO [peacekeeping operations] missions.    The atmosphere is such that the United Nations cannot refuse  requests from other regions, because it dispatched PKO personnel  to Cambodia. The United Nations has received mountains of  requests for PKO missions. Many of them have been rejected, but  the United Nations will have to take action in response to some  of them.    [EKONOMISUTO] Some say that the United Nations has reached  the limit as far as PKO is concerned.    [Hatano] Apparently, Secretary General Butrus-Ghali thinks  that UN intervention will, of necessity, increase in the future.  Then we have the question of how the United Nations will  intervene, but that will depend on the effectiveness of previous  Security Council resolutions. Therefore, nations that are not  members of the Security Council have a difficult time making  their influence felt.    [EKONOMISUTO] Does that mean that the Cambodian operation  was  successful?    [Hatano] Some members of the Security Council are of the  opinion that the lessons learned from the Cambodian operation  can be applied to Somalia as well.    One of those lessons is the merits of having refrained from  using armed force. Furthermore, Japan sponsored a Cambodian aid  conference, without waiting for the dispute to be resolved. The  parties involved in the dispute realized that peace would bring  them many tangible benefits. Another is the benefits from having  maintained a cooperative relationship with local leaders, like  Prince Sihanouk. That approach has been praised by members of  the Security Council as well.    [EKONOMISUTO] But the financial burden on member nations,  including Japan, seems to be ballooning, with no end in sight.    [Hatano] Two years ago, at a Security Council meeting at  which the advisability of a particular PKO mission was being  discussed, I asked, "Where will the money come from?" The reply  I received was something like, "We are discussing peace and  security. One cannot attach a price to peace and security." But  recently, all member nations have begun to give serious  consideration to the financial problem. This sort of awareness  is increasing.    [EKONOMISUTO] Does that mean that some members are having  second thoughts about PKO, now that the expense has risen so  high?    [Hatano] I think it means that every nation is on the verge  of being unable to shoulder its share of the PKO budget, which  is three or four times the UN general budget.    For instance, if a peace agreement is reached in the former  Yugoslavia, the cost of PKO in Yugoslavia alone will amount to  three or four times the UN general budget. This is higher than  what had been anticipated. It has become difficult for the  members to justify the expense to the financial and taxation  authorities at home. However, there is the argument that the  alternative, war, would be far more costly.    [EKONOMISUTO] Do a majority of Security Council members, who  rule on PKO missions, feel that the financial limit has been  reached?    [Hatano] I don't think the limit has been reached yet, but  we  are approaching the limit as far as contributions are  concerned. The situation is becoming difficult for the United  States, whose share is so large, and even if Russia wanted to  contribute, it doesn't have any money.    [EKONOMISUTO] Is there some regret over the Security  Council's having authorized so many PKO missions over the past  two years?    [Hatano] Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has often mentioned  something to that effect, but I'm not sure he would be able to  say no to a request.    For instance, Japan has been criticized by other nations for  being unenthusiastic about PKO: "We cooperated with you in  Cambodia. Don't you care about Africa or the former Soviet  Union?" The secretary general, too, may find it difficult to  refuse one request after granting another.  <H5>  Japan and the Reformation of the Security Council </H5>   [EKONOMISUTO] Then there is the problem of reforming the  Security Council. Does the international community feel that  reform is necessary?    [Hatano] I think that it does, without question. I have  often  said that the world is losing confidence in the Security Council  in its present form. I think that doubts about the legitimacy of  the Security Council, as it is now, have become a world issue.    The Security Council is set up so that a mere 15 nations now  decide the fates of 184 member nations. All the non-permanent  member nations have questioned the Security Council's current  state.    The more vocal criticisms have been voiced by developing  nations which became members after the United Nations was  established. In other words, even though the North-South balance  of the United Nations has changed, the North-South balance in  the Security Council has not, and they want to see that  corrected.    In the second place, Japan and Germany have become major  powers, both economically and politically. One questions the  advisability of keeping these two nations out of the Security  Council.    Another problem is the lack of transparency of the Security  Council -- the opinion that more member nations should be able  to participate in the Security Council's decision-making  process, even indirectly.    [EKONOMISUTO] The permanent member nations of the Security  Council say that if it acquires more members, it will be less  efficient.    [Hatano] At first glance, one gets the impression that the  Security Council is efficient because its membership is small.  But one might question how many of the decisions made by the  Security Council, which is now being subjected to criticism,  have been effective. During the past two years, it has issued  many resolutions and president's declarations, but the truth is  that many of them did not produce the desired results.    On the other hand, there is no point in making the Security  Council an organization with dozens of member nations, one that  has difficulty reaching a conclusion. This is a question of  balance, so some have suggested keeping the current 15 members,  and adding a few.    [EKONOMISUTO] How has Japan's status in the United Nations  changed?    [Hatano] Japan is now a major presence at the United  Nations.  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali said so himself when he visited  Japan.    In material terms, Japan is the second-largest contributor  to  the United Nations, after the U.S. Japan ranks high in providing  human resources as well. Japan has provided five top-ranking  officials in UN organizations, including Special Envoy to  Yugoslavia Akashi, High Commissioner for Refugees Ogata, and WHO  Chairman Nakajima. Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has said that  the only nations having so many of its citizens in key positions  at the United Nations are the United States and Japan and, in  actuality, Japan is viewed as a major force there. Furthermore,  Japanese who are members of important committees were elected to  those committees with huge majorities of votes.    It is probably not my place to determine whether Japan is a  major power at the United Nations. However, an objective point  of view is that Japan has already become a major force within  the United Nations. Despite that status, people are saying that  Japan's political aspirations are those of a middle-sized  nation, so we will probably hear more accusations of avoiding  responsibility.    [EKONOMISUTO] Is it appropriate to assume that Japan desires  to become a permanent member of the Security Council?    [Hatano] All the members are aware of Prime Minister  Hosokawa's address to the UN General Assembly, and of media  reports. They also know that until now, Japan has not declared  its intention to establish equality with other nations.    That is why the secretary general expressed his wish for  Japan to become more active, on his second visit to Japan, by  saying "the United Nations would benefit from Japan's becoming a  permanent member of the Security Council."  <H5>  The UN Bureaucracy </H5>   [EKONOMISUTO] The members' opinions of Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali seem to vary wildly.    [Hatano] I think he's a strong leader. He's been called  stubborn, and an autocrat, but he will not go against his  beliefs.    He says, jokingly, "I'm past 70 now. At this point, my  character is not going to change," so he seems to be aware that  he has been criticized in various ways.    The members recognize the secretary general's strong  leadership and his ability to get things done. Furthermore, he  has a great affection for Japan.    [EKONOMISUTO] Even a man with such strong leadership ability  may find it difficult to reform the bureaucratic structure of  the Secretariat. The United States and other nations say that  there is too much inefficiency.    [Hatano] It could accurately be called an inefficient  organization. But it is the member nations who are to blame,  not the secretary general. The developing nations are opposed to  the reform and rationalization of economic development, which  the secretary general feels should be given top priority.    The secretary general has himself criticized the  bureaucratic structure of the United Nations, and is doing his  utmost to reform it. Nor are the member nations at all happy  with the bureaucratic structure, but they protest when personnel  reductions are suggested. No nation wants one of its citizens to  lose his UN job. The advanced nations are guilty of this, too.  They say rationalization is necessary, but they don't want any  of their people to be laid off. The same goes for Japan.    [EKONOMISUTO] Is the United States an exception?    [Hatano] The United States is hoping that the United Nations  will rationalize its headquarters, and downsize it. Since the  United States is the host country for UN headquarters, and bears  25 percent of the burden of the UN general budget, and 30  percent of the PKO budget, the United Nations has been quite  cautious in its relationship with the United States.    [EKONOMISUTO] At a time when the roles of the United Nations  and its Security Council are growing in importance, Japan is not  one of the (nonpermanent) members of the Security Council.    [Hatano] I think this will put us in a very difficult  position.    If, by some chance, the United Nations decides to augment  the  PKO in the former Yugoslavia, then we'll be told, "All right,  Japan's share is $500 million." Japan is unable to voice its  opinions during the decision-making process at the Security  Council.    Then, there is the problem of nuclear weapons on the Korean  peninsula. If, in the worst case, a proposal for sanctions  against North Korea is brought before the Security Council, we  will have to wait outside the Security Council hall until the  member nations' ambassadors come out and tell us how the debate  is proceeding.    Of course, we would hold thorough discussions with the  United  States and other nations on the subject before it is debated in  the Council. But that is quite different from being able to  participate directly in the discussion.    Three-and-a-half years ago, when I arrived in New York to  assume my current position, my first experience was the Gulf war  problem. I waited outside the Security Council until the member  nations' ambassadors emerged, and asked them, "What happened?  What happened?" That scenario was repeated, and the result of  the debate was that Japan was presented with a bill for $11  billion, and was criticized, to boot.... A situation like this  would be unthinkable in Western Europe. The conventional wisdom  there is "no taxation without representation."  <H5>  Japan's Status in the United Nations </H5>   [EKONOMISUTO] Nevertheless, has Japan's importance increased  over the past three tumultuous years?    [Hatano] Until PKO's increased scale, until the PKO budget  reached three or four times the UN general budget, Japan's  contribution to the general budget was 12.45 percent, or $1.1  billion. Now that our assessed contribution has risen to more  than 12 percent of a PKO budget of more than $3 billion, Japan's  status has certainly risen.    Furthermore, Japan is popular with the member nations. The  developing nations count on Japan to act as their  representative, to convey their views to the advanced nations.  They feel this way partly because Japan provides economic aid,  but their overall expectations of Japan are quite high.    On the other hand, the advanced nations view Japan as a  nation that espouses the same value system as they do. There  aren't many occasions on which the advanced nations and  developing nations form separate opposing blocs, but in  committees, the Human Rights Committee for example, the  difference between the two groups is marked.    I receive requests such as, "Japan is the representative of  the Asia group, isn't it? Please explain Asia's position to the  advanced nations, and try to convince them." On the other hand,  the advanced nations will tell me, "Please explain our position  to the Asia group." The good side of this situation is that  Japan might be said to be acting as a bridge between the two  blocs of nations. The bad side is that we can find ourselves at  a disadvantage, caught in the middle.    Once, when we were deciding upon candidates for an election  within the Asia group, one of the ambassadors said, "Japan's  views are not representative of Asian views, and its people run  for election too often. The best thing Japan could do for the  Asia group would be to leave it. That would also be in Japan's  best interest." I was quite shocked by that statement, but I  learned a lesson from it.    When we continue to gain favor with the advanced nations and  the developing nations, and are viewed by both groups as a  nation that is doing a good job, we know that Japan has a very  visible presence. In other words, Japan has become a major power.    It is time for Japan to assert its own opinions. Even if we  make enemies, it's time for us to follow through. We may end up  making enemies temporarily but, in the long term, Japan will  become a nation that is respected and trusted.</p>

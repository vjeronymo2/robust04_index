			<p>BFN     [Text] Portugal's foreign, economic, and industrial  policies will be a key point at today's meeting of the PPE  [European Popular Party] being held near Lisbon. Foreign  Minister Durao Barroso addressed the meeting a few moments ago.  Walter Medeiros reports.    [Medeiros] Barroso's speech started with strong praise for  Lucas Pires. Then he praised Europe and Portugal's role within  it. Durao Barroso stressed that Portugal is European, without  ambiguity, and that it joined the European Community not for  economically driven and merely financical reasons, but with  clearly political objectives.    Then came a warning: Durao Barroso said the enlargement --  of  course -- but also the mechanisms that depend on the transition  of this enlargement, must not jeopardize the effectiveness of  the European Union [EU].    [Begin Barroso recording] We believe that the adaptation of  the Union's institutions and decisionmaking mechanisms to the  needs of the enlargement to other European states must not mean  a loss of effectiveness within the European Union, or, as many  wish, it must not contribute to turning the European Union into  an extended area of free exchange [as heard]. [end recording]    [Medeiros] The future is unknown, but there is a safe port  called Europe, Durao Barroso said. It is necessary to defend  safe values such as Europe, and it would be a mistake not to do  so, he added.</p>

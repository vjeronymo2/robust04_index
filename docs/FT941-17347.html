			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Labour costs 'cheapest in UK' Labour costs in the UK are lower than in any other leading industrial country, a book published today says. International and Comparative Industrial Relations, by Professor Greg Bamber and Mr Russell Lansbury, ranks hourly labour costs for production workers in the UK below Germany, Sweden, Canada, Italy, the US, France and Japan. The figures are based on 1991 local currencies converted into US dollars.</p>

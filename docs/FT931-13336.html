			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: Dangerous shots ANTHROPOLOGY AND PHOTOGRAPHY 1860-1920 edited by Elizabeth Edwards Yale Pounds 19.95, 275 pages W EUGENE SMITH AND THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ESSAY by Glenn G Willumson Cambridge Pounds 55, 351 pages CAN YOU trust a photograph? Do you believe that the camera never lies? Or is a photograph the most dangerous medium of all, apparently a straightforward image but one in fact selected and determined by the photographer's frame of cultural reference, and, as it is reproduced, consciously or unconsciously encouraging a social or ideological stance? Two exceptional new books on the history of photography address this question from different, but equally fascinating, backgrounds. Anthropology and Photography traces the creation and use of photographs in early British anthropology, and is worth buying purely for its abundant 19th century photographs of Fijian cannibals, Hiawatha-style chiefs, Congo dancers and the rest. But its point is our changing evaluation of these photographs, which at the time were seen as objective documentation of inferior, exotic races but now demonstrate the prejudice and cultural conditioning of the age. So a soft-focus Samoan woman from the 1890s, her naked breasts garlanded with flowers, is a classic western male erotic fantasy not worlds away from Sarah Bernhardt on stage. South Sea Islands youths with limed blond hair and huge earrings are captioned 'dandies'. Saddest are six Batwa pygmies, kidnapped in central Africa, exhibited 'live' at the Hippodrome with 17 polar bears and some Scottish dancers, and so famous that they were invited to the House of Commons. The photograph of them dressed in children's sailor suits taking tea on the terrace with MPs is a giveaway of the 1900s anthropological belief that 'primitives' were in the 'childhood of mankind' stage. 'What did they think of the greatest Legislature in the world? What dim conception did they form of its purpose and work?' asked the photographer Benjamin Stone. It is through such anecdotes, or case studies, that this book builds up a cumulative picture of the worldview that made colonial domination possible. In the Andaman Islands, an officer fascinated by 'junglees' ('wayward but attractive children') took stereotyped photos like 'Andamanese Shooting, Dancing, Sleeping and Greeting'. They were sent home doctored - for example bunches of grass were scratched on to the plate of a naked chief and his wife, both smoking pipes. Symbolic emasculation, but the photos helped the army learn more about the Andamanese, and its policy of subjugation worked: a final photo shows a dance celebrating Edward Vll as Emperor of India. The interpretation of photographs in this book also tells anthropology's own story, from its start as an unreflective, patronising study of 'primitive' people to a self-conscious discipline examining meaning in any society. Several decades on, W Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay is an account of the camera as political and social advocate, seen through the work of Life magazine's most famous photographer. Eugene Smith took shots for the human interest photo-essays that made Life a mass circulation, high-quality magazine. But he was also an absolutist and a driven man, formed by the Depression, when his bankrupt father killed himself, and by the moralism of his Catholic convert mother. As a war photographer, he switched from warmonger (he wrote home about a knife 'good for Japs, underbrush or steak') to pacifist whose photos were so unrelenting about the human cost of war that the Pentagon censored them. At Life, as photo-essays like 'Country Doctor' and 'Spanish Village' show, he had a mission precisely of his time: to portray and improve life for the ordinary poor through a new type of intimate, immediate picture which showed everyday peopke working, eating, getting ill, giving birth. But did he really photograph Everyman? With carethis book examines the genesis of specific photo-essays, from choice of topic through research to the selection of strongly interpretative images from a 2,000-negative contact sheet. The result was benign propaganda, finding the 'perfect' American example: the young and photogenic country doctor, his stoop, look, gesture implying exactly the mix of hard work, poverty, committed satisfaction; the Main Street, Anytown, setting which must also be picturesque (Kremmling beneath the Rocky Mountains was chosen). For Smith, the triumph was to portray a secular saint; for Life, to tell a human story with a topical health care angle; for 'Amerika', Life's Russian translation, to advertise, by cropping and centering and magnifying, the great American dream. Gradually Smith's political mission clashed with Life's - in 'Spanish Village' he wanted to stop US aid for Franco - and he resigned, had breakdowns, died at 59 with Dollars 18 in the bank. But anyone interested in the social outlook that saw the rise and fall of 'Everyman' magazines like Life and Picture Post, and in the history of photographic journalism and how newspapers manipulate material, will enjoy this account of his life and work. As Smith realised, the visual image is becoming our dominant mode of communication. But one reason it is so powerful is that most of us don't have the visual grammar to respond to it in the sophisticated way with which we dissect and interpret words. Both these elegant volumes are compelling and topical attempts to change that.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Commercial freedom for nuclear body urged THE UK Atomic Energy Authority should have more freedom to undertake commercial activities outside the nuclear industry, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said yesterday. The authority is now known as AEA Technology, and it exploits expertise gained from the nuclear power programme. The commission said AEA was 'significantly inhibited' by constraints which prevent it manufacturing non-nuclear products and forming joint ventures outside the nuclear field. It has investigated AEA as part of its programme to review all public-sector bodies. The commission also said that AEA's businesses, which range from atomic research to petroleum services, 'rest uneasily in the public sector where their entrepreneurial activities are inevitably somewhat constrained'. The MMC concluded that AEA could generate higher net revenue. The report identified weaknesses in financial and project control, investment appraisal and marketing. Monopolies and Mergers Commission: UK Atomic Energy Authority. HMSO, Pounds 19.40.</p>

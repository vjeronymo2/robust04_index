			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Is That U?Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, who started a controversy when she  refused to let the U.S. national anthem be played before a recent concert,  donned a wig and duped protesters and a television reporter at a Wednesday  night performance in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. O'Connor, whose hair is closely  cropped, wore a brown shoulder-length wig and baseball cap as she sat outside  the gates of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center before the show. O'Connor  mingled for nearly an hour as a half-dozen demonstrators asked her fans to  boycott her performance. At one point, a television reporter for WNYT in  Albany, who did not recognize O'Connor, interviewed her for a reaction story.  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

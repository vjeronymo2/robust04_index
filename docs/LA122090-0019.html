			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAND UP AND BE COUNTED;  </P> <P> NEEDED: AN EARLY YES OR NO VOTE AUTHORIZING THE POSSIBLE USE OF FORCE AGAINST  IRAQ  </P> <P> President Bush now suggests that he may be ready to ask Congress to endorse the  use of force against Iraq. A willingness to seek specific congressional  approval implies at least a bend in what until now has been the  Administration's unyielding insistence that the President already possesses  full constitutional authority to commit U.S. forces to war, without getting  explicit legislative authorization beforehand. Should Bush make good on his  hint by asking Congress to approve the use of force when it convenes on Jan. 3?  He should, because a clear expression of congressional opinion is urgently  needed.  </P> <P> Congress and the President continue to joust over the two-centuries-old  ambiguity in the Constitution touching on war-making powers. Congress has the  legal responsibility to raise armies and declare war. The President, as  commander-in-chief, has control over the military. Congress says that its  constitutional role is clear; its leaders insist at a minimum on Congress'  right to give or withhold approval prior to the President's ordering troops  into combat.  </P> <P> No modern President has been willing to accept that view. All have contended  that for them to do so would be to dilute the lawful powers of the chief  executive.  </P> <P> The argument goes round and round and nothing is resolved. The courts, most  recently in a suit brought by 54 House members, have repeatedly chosen to steer  clear of involvement in this dispute. In normal times, the debate over war  powers is largely of academic interest. In times of international crisis, like  now, the confrontation becomes compelling. Yet it's evident that neither  Congress nor the President is prepared to yield on what each regards as its  constitutional responsibilities. The best course is to seek a political  resolution.  </P> <P> Bush should ask Congress when it comes back into session two weeks from now for  an early yes or no vote authorizing the possible use of force against Iraq.  </P> <P> If Congress says yes, it may provide just the nudge needed to convince Saddam  Hussein that the string has finally run out and that he dare not delay his  withdrawal from Kuwait any longer. If Congress says no -- if, in effect, it  says that the country does not support going to war -- then that would of  course be a major political signal that the President could hardly ignore. A  coherent foreign policy requires an end to the uncertainty, the pointless  bickering and, yes, the cheap posturing. The question should go before  Congress, and Congress should make its choice.  </P></p>

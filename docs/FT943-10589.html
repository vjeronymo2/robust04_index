			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / MoD insists on final say over aircraft order The Ministry of Defence yesterday insisted that it would have the last word on whether Britain should buy the US Hercules or the European Future Large Aircraft to replace the RAF's ageing transport fleet. The move came in spite of the formation of a committee of officials from several Whitehall departments to oversee debate on the project. The MoD said that any conclusions the committee reached would be advisory, and that defence ministers would decide. The decision was not thought likely to go to the cabinet. The formation of the committee comes after intense lobbying over which aircraft to buy. The committee will consider the industrial implications of the decision for the UK, as well as military needs. In addition to the MoD and the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Welsh and Scottish offices and the Foreign Office will attend. Corrosion of the old Hercules airframes and heavy use means that up to half of the existing fleet of 60 aircraft may need to be replaced or refurbished before the year 2000. British Aerospace, the company that would build the wings for the FLA if Britain joined the project, has argued strongly that its lead in wing design would be lost to French and German companies if the RAF bought the US aircraft. It says that the FLA will be bigger and faster than the C-130J Hercules, and that, if the UK becomes a full member of the programme, it will be worth Pounds 5.5bn and secure 7,500 British jobs. If the UK does not agree to buy the FLA, however, BAe role as wing manufacturer is likely to go to DASA of Germany. Lockheed, the US manufacturer of the C-130J, has said its aircraft will be ready to meet the RAF's immediate need by 1996. The FLA still faces uncertain development costs and will not be available until the next century. Lockheed estimates that UK participation in the C-130J will be worth Pounds 2.2bn and will secure 3,500 jobs in Britain. The defence ministry has also opposed providing development money for the FLA project from which it withdrew in 1989. BAe has, however, suggested that the FLA would be built by the Airbus consortium using civil aircraft methods and that the development costs could be included in a fixed purchase price. The MoD said that it took all factors into account when making decisions, and that defence ministers were best placed to judge military requirements. Both companies expressed satisfaction at the committee's formation. Lockheed welcomed the establishment of the sub-committee 'particularly as all of the facts and claims on both sides - the C-130J and the FLA - will be exposed . . . to the scrutiny of officials'. BAe 'welcomed the discussions being broadened to include the rest of Whitehall'. No time has been set for the committee to reach a decision and it has not yet met. However, the MoD had hoped to decide which aircraft to buy before the end of the year. There was some expectation that a decision would be announced with the Front Line First defence cuts and equipment orders last month, but a publicity campaign by BAe is thought to have scuppered that possibility.</p>

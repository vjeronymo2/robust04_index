			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Federal Supreme Court [STF] Chairman Luiz Octavio  Gallotti has released two notes to the media about the  self-authorized wage increases for the Judicial Branch.    In one note the STF answers criticisms that followed the  wage  increase. The other note states that he is surprised at the  government argument that it does not have funds to pay the  increase because the funds requested for the increase are  already deposited in the Bank of Brazil.    STF Chairman Gallotti yesterday released two notes to the  media. One note rebuffs criticisms of the Judicial Branch, and  the other states that the Judicial Branch payroll is being  processed normally.    The STF chairman states that he does not understand the  government allegation that there are not enough funds for the  increase because the funds were deposited on 18 March in the STF  account in the Bank of Brazil. Gallotti said the deposit of  funds is compatible with the administrative decision by the STF  justices on 10 March.    According to figures released by the STF, the deposit of  1.75  million URV's was more than was requested. The STF president  said the justices have correctly implemented the provisional  measure creating the URV, respecting the Constitution.    Gallotti did not want to comment on a possible revision of  the provisional measure or on the salary cuts as announced by  the government. The STF chairman says he does not make  decisions on his own and the STF will make a statement only when  it receives an official communique from the government.    Regarding criticism of the Judicial Branch, the STF  president  acknowledges the right to disagree but he says the criticisms  were made without moderation. He added that if there is  disagreement among the government branches, he will not  encourage it.    Meanwhile, President Itamar Franco met with Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso and confirmed that the government will  not pay the wage increase for the Judicial Branch. The  president has ordered the Bank of Brazil to discount the wage  increase deposited for judicial and legislative branch payrolls.    President Itamar Franco again guaranteed yesterday that the  wage increase authorized by the STF is illegal and that the  government will not pay anything that goes against the law.  After meeting in Planalto Palace with the finance minister he  authorized the release of an internal Finance Ministry provision  ordering the Bank of Brazil to discount the 10.9-percent wage  increase from the payroll of the Judicial and Legislative  Branches.    [Begin Franco recording] I said and reassert: The government  will not pay anything outsid the law. We consider the STF is  not complying with the law established by the provisional  measure. Therefore we will only authorize the funds we think the  STF should receive. [end recording]</p>

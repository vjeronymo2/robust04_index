			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Hafnia Perhaps they just got carried away by anti-Maastricht sentiment. Whatever it was, local institutions must now deeply regret that, with more than a hint of chauvinism, they turned down Skandia's offer for Hafnia at a price more than double the level of the Danish insurer's languishing B shares. As yesterday's admission that employees other than the dismissed deputy general manager were involved in unauthorised and costly share transactions further underlines, Hafnia is in a frightful mess. Thanks to some generous underwriting the company will at least receive the DK2bn proceeds from this week's rescue rights issue. Unfortunately, though, its long-term survival can only be assured if it can dispose of stakes so expensively and rashly acquired first in fellow Danish insurer Baltica, and then in Skandia. The annual carrying cost on these investments is DK500m alone. By all accounts the 33 per cent Baltica holding has been widely hawked around, but no serious takers have emerged. Skandia's spread of interest might be more enticing for an institution with pan-European ambitions - but then the Swedish group's defensive voting structure is a turn-off for all but the most persistent adventurers. Given the continuing market pressures on the insurance industry elsewhere, this year's excitements in Scandinavia may turn out to be little more than a sideshow.</p>

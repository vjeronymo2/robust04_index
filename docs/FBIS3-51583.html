Velasquez and at  the same time welcome President-elect Rafael Caldera. The  meeting was also an occasion to award Governors Enrique Salas  Romer [Carabobo State] and Carlos Tablante [Aragua State].  Andres Velasquez [Bolivar State governor] decided not to  participate.    President Velasquez said: "To me, it is a very pleasant duty  to convene this--the last governors meeting of my  administration. Fifteen days from now, on 2 February, Dr. Rafael  Caldera will be sworn-in as constitutional president of the  Republic for the next five-year term. This event will mark the  Constitution of the executive and legislative branches for the  1994 to 1999 term."    The president told the governors he was grateful for their  valuable cooperation to the national government as well as to  his administration.    He referred to the past six difficult months of a country in  crisis during which the governors played a very fundamental  role. In a country with an oversized, centralized system, he  described the decision to have direct elections for governors as  the most significant revolutionary event of the century.    President Velasquez--who from within the State Reform  Commission was one of the individuals who presented the bill  leading to the direct election of governors--said that as he had  promised when he took office, he had been able to create the  Ministry of Decentralization, and Minister Allan Brewer Carias  has prepared a memoir that includes a 1,000-page guideline.    "What I would like to tell all of you once more is that  democracy will be more difficult to defeat when there is no  longer one single group to defeat," Velasquez stated.    He wished each governor the best success, adding that he  does  not need any official position to continue being a staunch  supporter for decentralization. He added that he is  enthusiastic about the progress the country had accomplished in  each of its regions.  <H5>  Joint Effort by the People </H5>   During his remarks, Rafael Caldera thanked outgoing  President  Velasquez for the invitation to meet personally with the federal  governors.    "I believe the situation through which the country is going  demands a joint, positive, and fruitful effort by the central,  state, and municipal government. These last two have acquired  progressive autonomy ever since it was decided to submit the  election of governors and mayors to a popular vote," Caldera  said.    He added he is convinced the country's main problems demand  a  joint effort by all sectors of the public.    For example, he cited the problems of personal safety and  social issues such as housing and education, as well as health.    "President Ramon J. Velasquez has given us an example of  magnitude, a very permanent and persistent disposition to  acknowledge the willingness of the various entities to take on  the necessary responsibilities. I believe that task must  continue," Caldera added.    He mentioned immediately the fiscal deficit, which he  described as severe, and said he needs the understanding of all  sectors of the public. The president-elect added that fiscal  deficit and currency devaluation force everyone to practice  austerity measures and double our efforts to ensure a more  effective tax collection campaign.  <H5>  VAT [value-added tax] and Banco Latino </H5>   The president-elect added that the fiscal deficit problem is  growing constantly worse. The governors have clearly  acknowledged that in their respective states, and throughout  Venezuela in general, people react emotionally to implementation  of VAT. It is obvious that many circumstances have contributed  to this emotional reaction, and among these circumstances are  organizational problems and Venezuela's difficulty in collecting  taxes, which, in this specific case, are felt much more keenly.    Caldera explained that added to the pressure of inflation is  the abuse perpetrated by many unscrupulous sectors that have  used VAT as a pretext for speculation, forcing President  Velasquez to adopt measures provided for in the Consumer  Protection Law three years after implementation of the economic  readjustment measures.    Caldera said the reformation of the tax system requires  harmony, which is a priority in dealing with the fiscal deficit.    The president-elect also discussed the government  intervention of Banco Latino: The situation of a huge banking  institution in which are deposited the savings and resources of  a considerable number of institutions and individuals--many of  them with connections to the various sectors of national  life--is another issue that makes this deficit situation very  serious.    This is why I feel obligated during this, my first meeting  with the governors, to beg them to be especially understanding  about this problem. The fiscal deficit does not involve only  the national government. It is a problem that involves the  entire public sector and--I would dare say--the entire  Venezuelan nation, because there is no sector of public life or  civilian society that is not affected by this situation, with  which it is our duty to deal.    Caldera described the panorama as serious, delicate and  worrisome, yet tempered by a positive element: the favorable,  general expectation expressed by all the social sectors after 5  December [the presidential elections]. The people have  acknowledged the problems the new constitutional term must  resolve, and there is hope that our efforts will be directed  primarily toward helping the Venezuelan people.  <H5>  An Explosive Situation </H5>   Caldera said he has initiated talks with certain branches of  the international financial system, especially with the World  Bank, and that he is encouraged by that organization's  acceptance of the struggle against poverty as a priority.    Caldera cited the recent violence in [name indistinct] del  Estero in Argentina, the civil war in Chiapas State, Mexico, and  the incidents in Sabaneta and other Venezuelan jails, and he  said they were not chance coincidences, rather, the effects of  the same cause which in all of these countries could become  explosive.    In reference to the pledge made by the United States and  countries in this hemisphere to strengthen democracy, Caldera  said:    I insist that democracy, political rights, and freedoms must  have an economic foundation but also a social foundation, which  are inseparable; harmonious solutions are required to achieve  the genuine strengthening of a system of life which, as the  preface of our Constitution states, is the only system  compatible with human dignity; it is the system whereby the  general public enjoys freedom of political and human rights.    Caldera reiterated his gratitude to President Velasquez and  acknowledged the huge effort he made to fulfill the historic  task entrusted to him.  <H5>  To Pursue Decentralization </H5>   The governor of Carabobo State and president of the  Association of Governors said that yesterday's meeting in  Miraflores was to bid farewell to President Velasquez and  welcome Caldera.    I believe that if this meeting served a purpose, it was the  consolidation of the Territorial Governors Council which,  established through a decree issued by President Velasquez,  created a body that unifies the president, his ministers, and  governors to make certain important decisions. Dr. Caldera's  presence proves that his government will lend continuity to the  decentralization policies initiated by President Velasquez; at  least that is how we have interpreted it.    The governor added that it was a cordial meeting during  which  the governors expressed to President Velasquez the entire  country's acknowledgement of the wise manner in which he was  able to overcome the crisis.</p>

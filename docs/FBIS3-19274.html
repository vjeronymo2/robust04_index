			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Christer Larsson] </F>   [Text] Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn is backing  down from previous statements and is now saying that there may  have been some form of hidden military cooperation between  Finland and Sweden. Her changed view follows an interview this  morning by "The Echo" program with Kaarlo Pitsinki, party  secretary of the Finnish Social Democrats in the Sixties, who  himself also took part in the secret military cooperation  between Finland and Sweden.    Kaarlo Pitsinki, party secretary of the Finnish Social  Democrats in the Sixties and provincial governor until 1982,  told the "Morning Echo" that he himself had worked for Swedish  military espionage in Finland directed against the Soviet Union.  But he also confirmed that the chiefs of Finland's own  espionage and counterespionage were those who handled the  regular military intelligence cooperation with Sweden. "The  Echo" has reported on this three times in the past, with the  help of Swedish sources. Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth  Rehn has three times put her own defense chiefs against the wall  in order, as she says, to find out the truth. Her own defense  chiefs have three times denied all forms of hidden military  cooperation, even with Sweden. After this, they declared that  if the information obtained by "The Echo" turned out to be true,  it would be such a scandal that either the defense leadership or  she herself would have to resign. This is what Kaarlo Pitsinki  had to say about that this morning:    [Begin Pitsinki recording] She is speaking against her  better  judgment (?or) she is in the wrong job. [end recording]    [Larsson] This is what Elisabeth Rehn tells "The Echo"  today.    [Begin Rehn recording] I must again come back to what  Pitsinki is saying, namely that I am evidently in the wrong job  since I am not familiar with my own military and my own defense  force. Yet, I would like to claim that among the defense  ministers in Finland I am probably better informed than many of  how we work. [end recording]    [Larsson] Now, for the first time, the Finnish defense  minister is also beginning to back down from her previously  categorical position, which was that there was never any hidden  military cooperation in any form, even with Sweden, during the  Cold War.    [Begin recording] [Rehn] I might perhaps not be surprised if  one thing or the other occurred in the fifties between persons  with different interests, but as for later periods, I would be  very surprised if anything like that could be documented, if it  happened.    [Larsson] The sixties, seventies?    [Rehn] Very surprised.    [Larsson] But do you want to rule it out?    [Rehn] I have learned that you must never say never about  anything, but I would like to say that I find it extremely alien  [words indistinct] claimed here, but as I say, I am no expert.  I find it very strange to have to speculate about something I  am definitely not an expert. Ask me about today's defense and  that of the future and I will be very expert on that.    [Larsson] And nothing is going on today?    [Rehn] There is no established cooperation between our  defense and foreign nations. Whether there is any individual --  no one can know. [end recording]    [Larsson] That was Elisabeth Rehn. Kaarlo Pitsinki has  himself many times wondered why official Finland continues to  pretend that there was never any regular intelligence  cooperation, even with Sweden.    [Begin recording] [Pitsinki] I have been wondering about  that, I have been wondering about precisely that. She must know  about the regular cooperation.    [Larsson] Why is it so important, then, to deny this  cooperation? For the sake of the Russians?    [Pitsinki] That is the only reason.    [Larsson] Does anybody believe that this is unknown in  Moscow?    [Pitsinki] No, I don't think so, it is part of the act. [end  recording]</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> KIM LEMASTERS RESIGNS AT CBS  </P> <P> Kim LeMasters, the boyish-looking executive responsible for the CBS television  schedule, resigned today as president of CBS Entertainment.  </P> <P> A successor was expected to be named shortly.  </P> <P> The network currently is in third place in the prime time ratings, as it was  last season and the previous season.

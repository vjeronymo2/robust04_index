In a statement to MENA, Ambassador Kamal said that the  Palestinian leadership does not favor the idea of holding  meetings like this before concrete measures are taken to protect  the Palestinians, in Hebron in particular and in all occupied  territories in general.    He stressed that the PLO refuses to resume the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations until after Israel commits  itself clearly and unambiguously to protecting the Palestinian  people under their occupation. It must also agree to the  presence of an international protection force as stipulated in  the Gaza-Jericho agreement, disarm the settlers when they are  outside their settlements, release the Palestinian detainees,  and discuss the issue of the settlements as a whole as soon as  the executive agreement on self-government in Gaza and Jericho  first is signed.    The Palestinian ambassador revealed that Palestinian-Israeli  contacts were held through a third party in the wake of the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre regarding holding meetings in Oslo  between Palestinian and Israeli officials, but the PLO refused  to hold such a meeting.    On the other hand, informed Palestinian sources in Cairo  stressed that the wording of the UN Security Council resolution  on the Hebron massacre, which will be voted on on Monday, will  determine whether the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will be  resumed or not.    The sources said that citizens in the occupied territories  want the international community and especially the Security  Council to take a clear stand on the Israeli crime and to ensure  their safety from the Israeli settlers' barbaric actions. They  noted that the Palestinian people in the occupied territories  reject a resumption of the negotiations without achieving these  demands.    Observers believe that PLO cannot not make agree to resume  the negotiations without such a resolution from the Security  Council, otherwise it would face such popular wrath that it  might affect its position.    The Palestinian sources said that if the Security Council  issues an appropriate resolution, the negotiations will be  resumed in Washington at the beginning of next week and this  will be followed by meetings in Cairo to discuss the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.</p>

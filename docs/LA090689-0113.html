			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOVER TALK SENDS CONRAIL STOCK SOARING  </P> <P> Shares of Conrail, created in the 1970s as the holding company for several  bankrupt Northeastern railroads including Penn Central, closed at a new high  for the year Tuesday on speculation that the freight carrier may be a takeover  target, analysts said.  </P> <P> Conrail stock closed at $45.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 87.5 cents.  Its previous 52-week high was $44.375. The stock has risen almost 15% in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> Conrail, formally known as Consolidated Rail Corp., declined to comment on its  stock activity.  </P> <P> Provident National Bank analyst Andrew Geller tied Conrail's gain to the  potential for a buyout or restructuring after Conrail's statutory takeover  protection ends next April.  </P> <P> The government, which had taken over the struggling railroad companies, sold  shares to the public in 1987 at $28 a share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stock Restrictions  </P> <P> Since then it has been solidly profitable, earning $142 million or $2.07 a  share in this year's first half on revenue of $1.75 billion. In 1988, the  freight railroad, whose market extends from the Northeast to Chicago, earned  $306 million or $4.44 per share on revenue of $3.49 billion.  </P> <P> Under the spinoff plan, non-rail buyers are blocked until April 3, 1990, from  acquiring more than 10% of Conrail, while other railroads can buy more than  10%, but not vote their shares before then.  </P> <P> Terms of the spinoff also restrict until Oct. 21, 1991, the amount of net  income Conrail can use for dividends and stock buybacks. Under the restriction,  Conrail currently has $107 million available for such uses, it said.  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert rail analyst Linda Dunn said she has been recommending  Conrail as the most attractive restructuring candidate among rail stocks due to  its strong balance sheet and its upcoming loss of takeover protection. She  estimated Conrail's break-up value at $70 a share.  </P> <P> Geller said there was also speculation "Conrail will try to do something to  forestall (a takeover) by trying to get its stock price up." He said it might  pursue a large cash dividend or stock buyback.  </P> <P> Although Conrail has recently raised its dividend and may do so again in the  future, it is limited in the amount it can distribute to shareholders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large Dividend Needed  </P> <P> Geller said Conrail may ask Congress by the end of the year to remove the  dividend restriction in order to take steps to boost the price of the stock.  Conrail stated previously that it would not seek favors from Washington until  it completed a "strategic process" to enhance share value.  </P> <P> Salomon Bros. analyst Michael Lloyd said the dividend restriction made takeover  speculation premature.  </P> <P> If an acquirer could not pay itself a large dividend before October, 1991, the  purchase would be less attractive, he said. "I can't believe anybody would be  getting excited about it right now," he added.  </P></p>

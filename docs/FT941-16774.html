			<p>940107 FT  07 JAN 94 / Sud Marine yard in liquidation The Sud Marine shipyard, one of the largest yards in the port of Marseilles, was put into liquidation by a French judge yesterday, adding to the woes of the economically depressed city. The yard's 615 workers, who have been occupying the shipyard for the past 10 days to protest against the threatened closure, vowed to continue their occupation to try to force the French government to rescue it. The Sud Marine's future has hung in the balance since November when it went into receivership. Bouygues, the French construction company, was mooted as a possible rescuer. But it failed to agree a deal with the government, and in the absence of any other potential buyers, the authorities have liquidated the yard. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said the Sud Marine was not competitive in terms of pricing and performance. Mr Robert Vigouroux, socialist mayor of Marseilles, blamed the shipyard's demise on the long history of industrial unrest at the city's docks. Liquidation of the Sud Marine is a bitter blow to Marseilles, which has faced economic problems after years of industrial decline The city, once a prosperous fulcrum for trade between France and its North African colonies, has suffered severely from the dismantling of the French empire. Marseilles' population over the past decade has fallen by 100,000, down to 800,000. The level of unemployment at 20 per cent is almost twice the national average for France, rising to 30 per cent in the poorest areas of the city. The conservative French government has continued efforts initiated by the previous socialist administration to try to make the docks more efficient by modernising labour practices. But the reforms have triggered a wave of strikes and stoppages by protesting dock workers.</p>

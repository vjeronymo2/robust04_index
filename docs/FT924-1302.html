			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Qantas adds piece to BA's global jigsaw - Paul Betts and Kevin Brown assess the UK airline's deal with the Australian carrier A SIGNIFICANT piece of the British Airways global jigsaw fell into place yesterday. The Australian government's acceptance of BA's Pounds 291m (Dollars 442.32m) bid for a 25 per cent stake in Qantas, the Australian national carrier due to be privatised next year, has fulfilled the UK airline's ambitions to forge a strategic partnership in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market. Both Lord King, BA's chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, have long stated their intent to negotiate a series of partnerships to enable BA to become a truly global airline. The strategy has involved a series of simultaneous moves this year in three different markets. In Europe, BA has expanded its base in anticipation of next year's European single airline market by acquiring large minority stakes in the French regional carrier TAT and the newly-established Deutsche BA venture in Germany. Its takeover of the ailing UK independent carrier, Dan-Air, has further strengthened its presence in the UK and Europe. And it now expects to launch next year, or possibly in 1994, a new Moscow-based joint venture airline called Air Russia which will initially operate services from Moscow to European cities using western-built jets. In the US, BA is fighting to win US government approval for its proposed Dollars 750m acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier. This is perhaps the most important deal in BA's expansion strategy, since it would consolidate BA's strong position on the busy North Atlantic market and give it broader access to the domestic US market - the world's single biggest airline market. The USAir deal is entering a vital phase. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, will tomorrow put pressure on President George Bush during talks at Camp David to approve the BA investment before the deadline for the proposed transaction expires on December 24. The US government has come under pressure from other big US airlines to oppose the deal if it fails to secure greater access for US carriers into the UK, and especially London's Heathrow airport. The UK has tabled a three-stage proposal to liberalise the UK-US air transport market, but has insisted the US first approve the BA-USAir transaction. This has so far been rejected by the US and unless a breakthrough is secured over the weekend, BA's partnership ambitions in the US could be frustrated. But the Australian government will have provided some consolation. By winning the Qantas bid against tough competition from Singapore Airlines, BA has strengthened its position in the Asia-Pacific region. The UK airline has produced a 32-page document detailing the benefits of its association with Qantas. Among the key advantages are: access on the Pacific market to the west coast of the US; greater access into fast-expanding south-east Asian destinations such as Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore and Jakarta; and a significant opportunity to tap the domestic Australian market, since Qantas has now absorbed Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic carrier. Although Qantas will remain independent, there is likely to be close integration of the two airlines' schedules, especially on the competitive London-Bangkok/Singapore-Sydney route. The two carriers also have a common culture, with solid reputations for aircraft maintenance and passenger service, although Qantas has been burdened by financial problems over recent years. The two airlines also operate similar fleets, using the Boeing 747-400 as the backbone of their long-haul services. But BA had to fight to the very end to clinch the Qantas deal. It had to increase its offer at the last minute yesterday to fend off Singapore Airlines, which had been led to believe it was the favoured candidate. BA is thought to have added about ADollars 50m to its initial offer of about ADollars 600m, but still paid less for its 25 per cent stake than many analysts had expected. Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian finance minister who handled the sale, insisted that BA had paid a premium for its strategic stake, suggesting that the airline's value is somewhere between ADollars 2bn and ADollars 2.6bn (USDollars 1.79bn). However, a final judgment on the winners and losers from the deal will have to await the Qantas flotation next year, which the government hopes will raise between ADollars 1.5bn and ADollars 2bn. If the sale goes well, BA will be seen to have bought a bargain, and the government will exceed its targeted return of ADollars 1bn after recapitalisation costs of ADollars 1.35bn. If the return is at the lower end of the range, BA's stake will look more expensive. One clear winner from the deal appears to be Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, who argued strongly for a bigger infusion of fresh capital than the ADollars 1bn suggested by the government. The ADollars 1.35bn provided by the deal is less than Mr Dix had sought, but sufficient to reduce the airline's ratio of debt to shareholders' funds from 75:25 to nearly 50:50. Mr Dix may turn out to be a loser in a more personal sense, however, since the agreement to form a new board means he is not guaranteed a place. Qantas returned to the black last year with a pre-tax profit of ADollars 148m, and is believed to be operating profitably in the current year, in spite of the effects of continuing slow economic growth. The airline will receive a substantial cash flow boost from its merger with Australian, although it has only recently begun to integrate international and domestic services. Qantas has shed several thousand staff over the last two years in preparation for privatisation, and analysts say it has significantly improved efficiency. It also owns one of the world's newest airline fleets and boasts an excellent safety record. However, the Australian airline industry has been in turmoil since a nationwide pilots' strike in 1989-90 was followed almost immediately by deregulation of domestic aviation. This triggered a price war which caused the collapse of one independent airline and heavy losses at Ansett Australia, the domestic market leader, which is owned by TNT and News Corporation. Qantas/Australian Airlines has suffered less, but has been exposed to tough competition and tight margins on domestic routes. Competition is expected to intensify over the next two years as moves towards a common aviation market with New Zealand are completed. But through its partnership with BA, Qantas expects to increase significantly its international market reach, especially in Europe and North America.</p>

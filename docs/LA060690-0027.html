			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK AIRPORT PLANS MAY FACE RIGOROUS SCRUTINY;  </P> <P> EXPANSION: THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL HAS CONDITIONALLY REQUIRED THE AIRPORT  AUTHORITY TO SUBMIT ITS 2,000-FOOT TAXIWAY PROPOSAL TO THE CITY FOR APPROVAL.  </P> <P> In the latest chapter of a longstanding feud, the Los Angeles City Council on  Tuesday conditionally approved requiring Burbank Airport to submit its plans  for a 2,000-foot taxiway to rigorous scrutiny by the city.  </P> <P> If the proposal wins final council approval, its significance may be tested as  early as mid-July when Burbank Airport expects to begin building its Taxiway B  extension. Los Angeles has complained for years about airport noise and is  eager to block any plans that would sharply expand the airport terminal.  </P> <P> Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority spokesman Victor Gill said that the  proposed law is moot and illegal, and that the authority has no plans to accede  to it.  </P> <P> The U. S. Supreme Court has previously prohibited cities from imposing special  land-use restrictions on land already zoned for airport use, he said.  </P> <P> Gill called the move another attempt by the city to prevent takeoffs and  landings along the airport's main north-south runway. The southern approaches  to the runway are over neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We'll find out if it's meaningless," said Greg Nelson, a chief deputy in Los  Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs' office. "We're certainly not going to take  Burbank Airport's word that our legislation means nothing."  </P> <P> To be enacted, the proposed zoning ordinance must be approved a second time by  the council, receiving at least 12 votes from the 15-member council. The  measure needs more than a bare majority because it would override an earlier  Planning Commission decision and because Wachs wants the measure to become  effective as soon as it is published -- instead of after the normal 30-day  waiting period.  </P> <P> The ordinance will come back to the council for further action next week.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure that before anything is permitted to be developed on this  site that it go through a full environmental review and that the matter come to  the council for approval," Wachs said in an interview.  </P> <P> "We're concerned that the land will be used to expand the number of flights  into and out of the airport, and anything that would be done in this regard is  of enormous concern to us," he said.  </P> <P> But Gill said extending the taxiway would not allow an increase in airport  traffic nor is it related to the terminal expansion plans.  </P> <P> Rather, the extension is a safety step, Gill said.  </P> <P> Aircraft now using Taxiway B must cross the north-south runway to prepare for  takeoff, a maneuver that would be unnecessary if the extension is built.  </P> <P> "It's not a good safety situation," Gill said. "It's not dangerous, but it  creates an opportunity for accidents."  </P> <P> Under the zoning measure voted on Tuesday, the airport would be required to get  Planning Commission approval for any construction project on land within the  boundaries of the city of Los Angeles, including the 54 acres where the Airport  Authority wants to build the extension.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission would have to find that any construction would be  beneficial to the public and would not harm other developments already in the  area, and that all negative environmental impacts would have to be remedied in  order to endorse any proposed development.  </P> <P> Gill said such terms would make it politically impossible for the airport to  win any land-use permits at Los Angeles City Hall.  </P> <P> The Taxiway B expansion project has been under consideration by the airport  since 1985.  </P></p>

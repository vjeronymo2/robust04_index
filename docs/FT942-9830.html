			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo confirms Algerian discovery Lasmo, the independent exploration and production company under threat from a hostile bid by Enterprise Oil, yesterday confirmed the discovery of potentially big reserves in Algeria, writes Robert Corzine. The announcement was made on the eve of Lasmo's expected publication of its defence to the Enterprise bid. Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer, said reserve estimates for the three discoveries in the Hassi Berkine oil field amounted to 324m barrels of oil and natural gas condensate. There was a possibility that as much as 900m barrels could be recovered.</p>

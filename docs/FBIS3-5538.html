			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] held a  national meeting of general secretaries from its local branches  at the Nihon Kyoiku Kaikan building located at Hitotsubashi,  Tokyo, on 5 March. In his speech, General Secretary Wataru Kubo  said: "A party that cannot change its policies has no other  choice but to stand isolated." Thus, he indicated his view that  the SDPJ's basic policies on foreign affairs and defense have to  be reviewed so the SDPJ will be able to deal with the future  realignment of political parties. Kubo disclosed a plan to set  up a "Project for Promoting Cooperation in Election Campaigns"  (tentative name) within the SDPJ, pointing out that promoting  cooperation among the ruling coalition parties in the next  national election campaigns is the task to be dealt with at  present.    After indicating his view that full-fledged political  realignment is close at hand, Kubo showed his resolution to  unify various political forces centering around the social  democratic and liberal forces. He said "we must prepare for the  possibility that we may have to make a decision on transforming  into a new party."    Kubo further said, the SDPJ and Komeito failed to reach an  accord aimed at obtaining political power in 1980; and the SDPJ,  Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United  Social Democratic Party also failed to reach an accord to this  end in 1989 because of "discord on basic policies". He  emphasized the need for party reform, including the review of  the party's basic policies, indicating his concern over the  possibility of being isolated as "a party that cannot respond to  structural changes" if the SDPJ should fail to effect policy  changes.    With regard to electoral cooperation, Kubo admitted that  several issues, such as the issue of the cabinet reshuffle, have  revealed the existence of a "bipolar structure" in which the  SDPJ, the DSP, and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] form one group and  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito form another.  However, he stressed: "We are not at odds with each other. It  is premature to consider this as the fixed framework of the  realignment." Thus, Kubo indicated that the ruling coalition  parties, including both Shinseito and Komeito, should promote  cooperation in election campaigns for the time being with the  common objective of supporting the Hosokawa administration.    Prior to Kubo's speech, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama gave a  speech. While indicating a positive stance on cooperation among  the ruling coalition parties in election campaigns, Murayama  commented on the concept of forming a large floor group among  the ruling coalition parties advocated by some members of the  ruling parties, saying: "It is impossible for parties with  different views on the state system and on the Constitution to  unite as one force." Thus, Murayama indicated that the issue of  cooperation in election campaigns should be discussed  independently from the issue of realignment of the political  parties.</p>

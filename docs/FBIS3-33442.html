			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Melisa Soto from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Caldera today signed an order  dropping charges against Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Arias  Cardenas and nine [number as heard] other officers who  participated in coup attempts on 4 February and 27 November  1992. Here is Melisa Soto with details.    [Soto] The officers who received the presidential pardon are  Lt. Col Francisco Arias Cardenas, Major Marisela Arevalo, Lt.  Ramon Rodriguez Chasin, Aviation Lt. Juan Carvajal Mas,  Technical Sergeant 3d Class Tony Armas, Army Captain Frank  Rafael Morales, Army Capt. Juan Carlos Hidalgo Pandare, Lt. Jose  Gregorio Vielma, and Lt. Jose Felix Alvarez. All of them were  tried and convicted and are now serving sentences in the San  Carlos Garrison and Lino de Clemente Battalion, except for Lt.  Col. Arias Cardenas, who is still confined in a military  hospital after undergoing dental surgery.    It is also worth noting that today Lt. Colonel Hugo Chavez  Frias did not appear at the military court as is customary.  According to his legal advisers, who are also temporarily  serving as the attorneys for General Carlos Diaz Rangel [name  and title as heard], Chavez will not appear in court to be  handed a warrant for his arrest [as heard] because he feels the  proceedings contain a series of irregularities. As his advisers  explained, the president is being deceived because some of the  convicted officers have received manipulative offers to get them  to request discharges, including offers of scholarships and cash.    [Begin recording] [Defense attorney Tomas Noriega,  identified  by caption] We feel that this officer, or, rather, these  officers who have come to talk to Major Carlos Diaz Reyes about  this subject are hampering his right to a defense, and the  position of these officers undermines the defense of those  patriots who rebelled against corruption and the awful situation  in the country. The time that has passed since then has proven  -- and President Caldera has admitted this -- that if it had not  been for the 4 February events, he would never have been elected  president.    [Defense attorney Jesus Bello, identified by caption] In  public remarks made during the election campaign, and later  after being elected president, Dr. Caldera offered to release  these officers without any conditions or restrictions. This is  why I feel the president must know that these officers fulfilled  their duty. He must also know that his public promises, as well  as the promises he made over the telephone to Col. Chavez and  Maj. Diaz Reyes when they were held in Yare -- promises that he  would release them once he was elected -- are the reason why the  people are still clamoring for their release, and the president  must heed the people and help these officers be reincorporated  into the National Armed Forces. [end recording]    [Soto] According to Lt. Col. Chavez Frias' legal advisers,  other officers who are being tried for the 4 February and 27  November coup attempts have received similar promises.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Letter: Unilever's divided view of social chapter queried Sir, It was interesting to read the endorsement of the Maastricht treaty by the chairman of Unilever, Mr Michael Perry (Letters, October 9). There is just one thing that puzzles me, and that is Mr Perry's enthusiastic support for the exclusion of the UK from the social chapter. Could he explain why the improved rights to consultation and information for workers, which the chapter will help bring about, should apparently apply to employees of Unilever NV but not Unilever plc? What have his British workers, and our members, done to deserve this second-class status? I was under the impression that both companies are part of the same transnational operating in an integrated European Community. Have I got it wrong? I think we should be told.

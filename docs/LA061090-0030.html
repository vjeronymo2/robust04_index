			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DICEY ICY TRUTH  </P> <P> In the June 3 News and Briefs column, the "Quick Fact" about one ton of ice  being 10 feet on each side is grossly in error.  </P> <P> A 10-foot cube would equal 1,000 cubic feet, and a ton of ice equally only  about 36 cubic feet. Therefore your cube would be about 27 tons.  </P> <P> One ton of fresh water is 35.96 CF. The specific gravity is 1.0, while ice is  .9166, which allows it to float. A ton of ice would equal a cube of slightly  more than 3.3 feet on each side. So there!  </P> <P> LIONEL C. MEEKER  </P> <P> Temecula  </P></p>

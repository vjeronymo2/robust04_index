			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Personal View: A way out of recession AS pressure mounts on the UK government over interest rates and the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), one of the oddest features of the recent parliamentary session was the sight of Conservative backbenchers arguing for devaluation, a policy which the Tory party has historically opposed. The truth is that neither an ERM realignment nor lower interest rates would be an easy answer to Britain's economic woes. Sterling's downwards adjustment within the ERM would be so damaging to its credibility that higher interest rates would follow; while a cut in interest rates combined with sterling's withdrawal from the ERM would cause a substantial depreciation of the currency. This would result in price increases for imports and serious inflationary knock-on effects. Because the British economy is today both more open and more integrated with its European partners, devaluation would be a less effective weapon than it was 20 to 30 years ago, or than it still is for the US. Devaluation aside, there is still much the government can do. Some clues can be found by comparing the impact of the recession on southern England and Scotland. Gross domestic product north of the border has held up better than to the south. One consequence is that unemployment in Scotland has risen proportionately less than elsewhere in the UK. More significantly, house prices have continued to advance modestly in Scotland, whereas in south-east England they have fallen by some 30 per cent since their peak at the end of the 1980s The reasons behind the recession's uneven impact have to do with the housing market. Scotland has just over 50 per cent of its housing stock in owner-occupation compared with nearly 70 per cent in England as a whole; the figure for the south-east is even higher. In the buoyant late-1980s, the government's encouragement to home ownership, coupled with easy availability of mortgages following financial deregulation and the shortage of private rented accommodation, forced house prices to rise sharply, especially in the south-east. Easy credit fuelled the boom, as people increased their consumption expenditure. Inevitably, when the government raised interest rates in 1988 to control the credit explosion, the south was hardest hit. Property prices fell and thousands of homeowners found themselves with mortgages exceeding the value of their house. As recession began to bite, many could no longer afford repayments and house repossessions have risen sharply. By contrast, Scotland has a much lower percentage of home ownership. The relative house price stability there has meant that the impact of recession on consumer expenditure has been less severe than in England. Many argue that a period of increased general inflation will be necessary to rectify this imbalance between asset values and outstanding debt before recovery can get under way. This seems a counsel of depair. Certainly something must be done to put some life back into the housing market. Further encouragement to home ownership through the raising of mortgage tax relief might give short-term benefit but at the cost of perpetuating an expensive distortion and compounding the core problem. A mortgage benefit scheme would be a better idea but would be costly. But the real oddity of the housing market is the virtual absence of a private rented sector, a surprising anomaly after 13 years of a Conservative government pledged to the free market. Elsewhere in Europe, where there is little local authority-owned housing, private rented accommodation plays a significant role, both subsidised for social housing and on a straight commercial basis. Two factors killed the UK private rented sector: rent controls, which have now been removed; and competition from the subsidised publicly-owned sector and from owner occupation, the latter benefiting from mortgage tax relief. As a result, the quality of private rented housing has deteriorated. What is needed to lift the private rented sector and the overall housing market are fiscal incentives of the kind outlined by the housing inquiry chaired by the Duke of Edinburgh and published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in June 1991. To ensure these incentives help to generate recovery from the present recession they would need to be on a sufficiently large scale. This could probably be achieved only if financial institutions could be persuaded to invest in the sector and if the incentives were targeted at social as well as commercial housing. Critics argue that increased government spending on housing will push up an already large public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). But the PSBR is largely a product of the recession which this expenditure would be aimed at ending. Increased state spending on housing would in turn attract much-needed investment from a previously untapped source, helping to upgrade a poorly-maintained housing stock; it would improve labour mobility, essential to the health of the economy; above all an enlivened private rented sector would help to stabilise the housing market both in boom and recession.

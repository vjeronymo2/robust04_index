			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Independent to accuse Murdoch of predatory pricing Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, plans to go to the Office of Fair Trading next week to accuse Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation of predatory pricing by reducing the cover price of The Times to 20p. The renewed accusation that Mr Murdoch is trying to drive other papers, such as The Independent, out of the market through such tactics was backed by Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary. He wrote yesterday to Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, urging him to investigate the national newspaper pricing war. As the row over the price-cutting intensified, the Stock Exchange said it had found no evidence that last month's sale of 12.5m shares worth Pounds 73m in The Telegraph group by its proprietor Mr Conrad Black had any connection with this week's cover price cut of The Daily Telegraph from 48p to 30p. The investigation had been asked for by the institutions which bought the shares, now worth Pounds 30m less because of the cover price cut. Telegraph shares fell another 17p to 332p yesterday compared with the price of 587p at which Hollinger, Mr Black's Canadian holding company, sold the shares. In the national newspaper industry, it became clear yesterday that few, if any, other national newspapers plan to enter the price-cutting battle - at least for the time being. The exception is The Independent, which may soon reduce its price from 50p. The rise that took it to that figure came at the time of the initial Times cut from 45p to 30p and is now acknowledged as a mistake. It is likely to go to 45p, in line with The Guardian, following pricing experiments by The Independent which suggested a significant circulation boost at that figure. The paper first complained to the OFT about predatory pricing last September when The Times went to 30p - a complaint that was rejected. The company feels its case is much stronger now. Mr Matthew Symonds, the paper's executive editor, said: 'If this is not predatory pricing, I don't know what is.' When The Times was at 45p, Mr Symonds said, the news trade received 17.5p of the cover price and News Corporation 27.5p. Because the news trade margin had been fully protected, News International was now receiving around 2.5p for each copy. Mr Cook told Sir Bryan that a reduction of competition if other titles were forced out of the market would not be in the interests of readers. The price, Mr Cook said, 'is an ugly battle for domination between media barons, and it is readers who are likely to be the long term casualties from the fallout'.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Modestov, candidate of military sciences: </F> "American Intelligence Prefers NEZAVISIMAYA: The Use of Open  Information Sources"]    [Text] Aside from the so-called human intelligence (Human  Source Intelligence--HUMINT), which presupposes work with agents  and proxies, the interrogation of defectors, or the questioning  of persons who are visiting the country being investigated or  who have left it, and also together with an analysis of open  sources (Literature Intelligence--LITINT), intelligence  information in the American classification is procured with the  aid of diverse technical facilities of signals intelligence  (Communications Intelligence--COMINT), reconnaissance by  electronic means (Electronic Intelligence--ELINT), and space and  aerial photography reconnaissance (Imagery Intelligence--IMINT).    When studying the question of the composition of  intelligence  information it is of fundamental importance to evaluate the  correlation of such information procured from agent sources and  information obtained with the use of legal possibilities,  including notification, official contacts with informed persons,  open-source analysis, and the gathering of information by way of  personal observation during visits to accessible facilities,  exhibitions, parades, exercises, and festivals, thanks to  personal participation in conferences and symposia, and with the  aid of various technical means of reconnaissance.    According to R. Hillenkoetter, director of U.S. central  intelligence in 1948, "80 percent of intelligence information is  obtained from such conventional sources as foreign books,  journals, and S&amp;T reviews, photographs, the data of  commercial  analysis, newspapers, and radio broadcasts and also from general  information obtained from persons who have an idea of affairs  overseas."    Another American specialist in the field of intelligence, W.  McGovern, observed: "It is very hard to compute mathematically,  but I am inclined to believe that in the process of the  preparation of strategic decisions approximately 20 percent of  the basic information comes from clandestine sources,  approximately 80 percent, from open, legal sources."    This viewpoint accords entirely with the opinion of a number  of foreign specialists in the field of intelligence expressed at  the end of the 1970's to the effect that 20-25 percent of the  information procured by the intelligence community of the United  States comes from open foreign sources (newspapers, journals,  radio broadcasts, and so forth), 20-25 percent from the reports  of employees of official missions of the United States in other  states, and approximately 5 percent from unofficial sources, and  technical types of reconnaissance account for the rest.    All these estimates are quite a plausible reflection of the  possibilities afforded in the processing of open sources. An  undoubted authority in the field of the organization of illegal  intelligence-information activity, V.I. Ulyanov (Lenin), wrote  in this connection: "Legal material is particularly  important.... It would be no exaggeration to say that it is  still possible on the basis of legal material alone to somehow  write a professional brochure, on illegal material alone, it is  impossible. Gathering illegal material... it is impossible also  acquiring knowledge... which is scattered in a mass in brief  newspaper reports and in special industrial, medical, land  association, and other publications."    Let us, however, turn to modern examples from the experience  of the American special services. Despite the fact that we have  always been considered overseas a closed society, in which the  free exchange of information is limited, many American  specialists in the field of intelligence believed that even  under these conditions "there is a considerable amount of  information that may be collected from accessible materials."    Thus in the Soviet period of our history 11 of our most  important military journals and newspapers, including KOMMUNIST  VOORUZHENNYKH SIL, VOYENNO-ISTORICHESKIY ZHURNAL, and VOYENNYY  VESTNIK, were of the greatest interest to the American military.  In addition, specialists of American intelligence would make a  close study of a considerable number of less well-known and more  specialized periodical publications.    American experts always carefully studied the texts of  official speeches of our country's top officials. An analysis of  the formal and structural features of these texts made it  possible to uncover contradictions in the Soviet leadership.    The polemic that developed in the CPSU Central Committee  Politburo in 1969-1974 around the question of the essence of the  Soviet military doctrine, in which Politburo members Andropov,  Brezhnev, Grechko, Gromyko, and Kulikov found themselves  involved, is given as an example. The parties' positions were  reconstructed by American researchers by way of a content  analysis of the Soviet leaders' public speeches based on  material of the newspapers PRAVDA and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA.    Similarly, an analysis of the political information  published  in the open press of the USSR enabled specialists of the U.S.  intelligence community to formulate valid forecasts as to who  would fill the position of general secretary of the CPSU Central  Committee in the period 1982-1985.    As the well-known American Sovietologist P. Steven  (University of Virginia) observed, the policy of perestroyka  largely contributed to an improvement in the work of specialists  on the Soviet Union. "The resolve of the media in the USSR to  illustrate problems of interest to us, the broadening of  contacts between scientists of our two countries, and the  growing readiness of Soviet politicians and officials and also  representatives of science to freely and candidly discuss many  questions with colleagues from the United States--all this  increased considerably the extent and the quality of the  information available to us. Specifically, we were able, thanks  to the increased quality of information about Soviet society, to  evaluate anew the work of former citizens of the USSR and the  East European countries, on whom we had depended earlier in  obtaining information at first hand, but whose personal  partiality was sometimes reflected in the reliability of their  information."    The source base of the report CIA SOV S87-10043  "Enterprise-Level Computing in the Soviet Economy," which was  published in 1987, was studied for an analysis of the  composition and structure of intelligence information pertaining  to our country.    Some 347 open sources, including 295 Soviet (85 percent),  were used in the course of work on the report. The statistics of  quotation by newspaper are given below (see chart 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-037-67A>      FIGURE </FIG>     On problems of military policy at the end of the 1980's the  most important sources of information were the newspapers  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, which accounts for 75 percent of all  references, and PRAVDA (16 percent) (see chart 2).    The situation changed noticeably at the start of the 1990's.  Interest in our open sources (newspapers, particularly) became  more diversified. Thus in the works of American analysts on  military-policy topics in 1993 the most quoted Russian  newspapers were the publications indicated in chart 3.    The information on the budget of the U.S. intelligence  community is sufficiently eloquent also. Spending on  intelligence has always been classified, but, employing special  research procedures, an approximate level of this spending of  $30-32 billion (some American experts put this amount at $34  billion) may be established.    A relatively modest amount of these funds is spent on  personnel. The funding of procurement activity (mainly with the  aid of technical means of reconnaissance) accounts for the main  expenditure (approximately 80 percent). It is significant that  no more than 3 percent of the intelligence community's budget is  spent on agent methods of operation. The remaining resources  (approximately 17 percent) are spent on information and  analysis, and also on administration, international cooperation,  personnel training, and other purposes.    Determining, as a whole, the dependence of intelligence  information on the sources of this type or the other (agents,  technical means of reconnaissance--TSR--or open information  material) would not seem possible. But the greatest volume of  intelligence information is compiled, in the opinion of various  specialists, from open sources and with the aid of TSR, which is  not mutually contradictory, being an intersecting estimate made  with approaches differing in terms of their criterion.</p>

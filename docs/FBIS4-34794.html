			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Francisco Bravo Lacayo] </F>   [Text] It cannot be denied that our unity was shattered at  the Sandinist Front Congress. The outcome of the congress was  logical and foreseeable, given the intense preparatory activity  carried out by Commander Daniel Ortega and his sympathizers, who  took advantage of their strategic positions in the party  apparatus.    But does this mean that the front is irredeemably doomed to  division and failure in the civic battles that lie ahead?    We sincerely believe it is not. Everything will depend on  how  and in what manner pending issues are dealt with, on how the  Sandinist comrades led by Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado are  treated, and on how they react.    In spite of everything, we believe that the seeds for  unity in diversity were planted, and the only reason  more was not accomplished was the lack of time and space. If  Daniel's deeds match his words, he will find a way to stanch  possible wounds and to prevent the cracks that threaten to widen  from irreversibly destroying the unity that is so  badly needed.    It is not a question of approaching the problem of unity  from  romantic positions, but of standing firmly on the principles  that demand viable unity as a sine qua non for  solving the myriad problems that are assailing most Nicaraguans.    We are alarmed by Comrade Monica Baltodano's statement  threatening to oust Sergio Ramirez as head of the Sandinist  delegation at the National Assembly, rather than appealing to  him to try to coordinate the effort. The same is true of  BARRICADA Editor Carlos Fernando Chamorro.    If the threat of removal materializes, it will be a  demonstration of ayatollah-like intolerance that will have an  adverse impact on our people's mentality, and as a consequence,  it will be another nail in the coffin of the Sandinist Front's  aspirations to return to power.    That is why we said yesterday that we must put an end to  vengeance, that virulent disease that has plagued us Nicaraguans  and prevented us from reaching a consensus to save our country.    It is necessary and positive for all the factions in the  Front, be they large or small, majority or minority, to avoid  exaggerating their differences. Each person should do his part  to contribute to the spirit of brotherhood that should prevail  in a revolutionary organization.    The congress adopted positive resolutions that at least  challenged the old rhetoric. Sandinists should take heed and  continue working on this unfinished task.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (18): Looking after your luggage - Airlines have tightened up their procedures You know the feeling. You're standing in the baggage hall long after everyone else on your flight has collected their bags, watching two suitcases doing desultory circuits of the conveyor belt - and neither of them is yours. Meanwhile, your suitcase is probably making similar sad circuits at another airport - not necessarily in the same country or even the same continent. Theoretically, of course, this should not happen. Airlines have tightened up their procedures in the wake of the Lockerbie bombing, which was traced to a bag travelling unaccompanied. And if you're flying business or first class, your bag should have a tag indicating that it belongs to a premium class passenger and should be handled accordingly. There are steps you can take to prevent your luggae going astray. The most important thing you can do is not check in your bags - a golden rule for regular travellers is to carry as much as possible as hand luggage. Airlines are a bit sticky about how much you can carry on, so some passengers will go to extraordinary lengths. Mr Mark McCormack, founder of the International Management Group, recommends in Hit the Ground Running, his guide to hassle-free executive travel, that you get someone else to look after your bags, out of sight of the desk, while you check in unencumbered by anything more than an innocent suitpack and briefcase. Then you retrieve your other bags and proceed to the gate where, with a bit of luck, you can convince the agent that the check-in desk said it was OK for you to carry on your other encumbrances. This may be a desperate measure but it does spare you from the lonely vigil by the baggage carousel. Generally, in first and business class, you can carry on an overnight bag, a briefcase (or a handbag), plus a coat, a camera and an umbrella. This is, of course, of most use to women but men should take note of the vast size of handbag that some women carry in addition to other hand luggage. There's nothing to stop a man sporting a biggish shoulder bag and arguing that it counts as a handbag should anyone object to it. Perhaps the only time that you will be prevented from carrying on too much is if you are travelling on Concorde. The cabin is surprisingly cramped and there is not much room for hand luggage, so British Airways may insist that you check in your suitpack. However, your bag will be given the attention you expect: it is zipped into a clearly labelled cover and the airline promises that it will be off the jet and into the baggage hall before you are. Should you be forced to check in your bags, there are steps you can take to lessen the chances that they go astray. The main thing, say the carriers, is to make sure the bags are clearly and securely labelled - both inside and out. Paper tags are a waste of time as they can be ripped off, so opt for something more sturdy. Another tip is to make sure that your home address is not on the outside label. This is a signal to thieves that the house is probably empty and therefore a target. However, your home address should be on a label inside the case so that if it does go astray, it can be returned. It may seem obvious, but a sturdy lock will slow down a potential thief, as will a hard suitcase. Travellers debate the virtues of soft bags versus hard bags, but airlines are clear that hard-sided cases are safer, as a protection both against theft and from accidental damage. The downside of this is that they are heavy before you start filling them up and there are weight restrictions on checked bags, with the meanest, not surprisingly, being in economy where you will be limited to 20kg of luggage. Remember, also, that suitcases and bags look alike and business travellers in particular are likely to grab the first black Samsonite they see without necessarily checking to make sure it is theirs. The airlines advise that you should try to make your bag look different. That could mean putting a bright strap around the case or using stickers. One way to avoid losing luggage is to insist on taking direct flights, wherever and whenever possible. If you do have to change aircraft, your bag will also need to be switched over, and this is a weak point, although improvements at London Heathrow should reduce the risk for passengers who transfer from international BA flights to domestic flights. If the worst happens and your baggage goes AWOL, you must take immediate action. Go to the baggage handling services and tell them that your luggage is missing, and make sure that you fill in the forms. Don't put this off - you will have all the necessary information to hand and the sooner you alert the carrier, the sooner you will be reunited with your luggage. The staff will haggle with you over what you need to buy as replacements and try to beat you down, assuring you that your bag will undoubtedly turn up on the next flight. Chances are that it probably will - most bags are delayed rather than lost - but you still need clean clothes, a change of underwear and some toiletries. You will do better for compensation if you are on your outward rather than return journey - the carrier will reckon that you have all you need at home. If the missing bag fails to turn up within a reasonable time - ie overnight  -then you will need to give the airline more detailed information about what was in it. This is where it pays to have a list with you (among your hand luggage, of course) of exactly what your suitcase contained. If you forget to tell them about your expensive leather trousers or silk dress, you will only kick yourself. British Airways says that it reunites 95 per cent of lost bags with passengers within 48 hours. This should get even better as it has recently joined the airlines' World Tracer scheme, which notifies all lost baggage to a computer in Atlanta in the US. This matches straying bags to bereft passengers and automatically puts the case on the next flight. It is very unlikely you will lose your bag for good - European airlines mislay about 10 suitcases in 1,000 - but that does not absolve you from taking basic precautions. And the best thing you can do is insure your luggage against loss. While the airline which has lost your favourite Louis Vuitton suitcase will be suitably apologetic, it is ultimately only liable to pay compensation of Dollars 20 per kilogramme under the Warsaw Convention. The moral is: insure your bags, label your bags inside and out, and know what is inside your bags. Other than that, you are at their mercy.</p>

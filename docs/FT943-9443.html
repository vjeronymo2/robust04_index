			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Arts: Three sisters in search of their roots - Theatre Just as Muriel Spark's novel The Girls of Slender Means recalls a time 'when all the nice people were poor', so sophisticated pre-war American films evoke an era when all the nicest Americans sounded English. Reminded of this by The Sisters Rosensweig, I was amused by a coincidental reference to Muriel Spark in Wendy Wasserstein's comedy. This is an Anglo-American affair par excellence. The action amiably unfolds in the Holland Park home of Sara (Janet Suzman), a high-powered American in international banking who reads 'very good' pieces in the Financial Times (as who does not?). The time is the recent past, when the Soviet Union was collapsing and Dollars 400 were worth Pounds 200. As old alliances crumble and the world takes on a new shape, the characters too try to focus on themselves, their context and their identities. Sara's visiting sisters are Pfeni, traveller and author, involved with a bisexual English theatre director (whose hit musical based on the Scarlet Pimpernel sounds all too plausible), and Gorgeous Teitelbaum, self-styled 'housewife, mother and radio personality' who enjoys fame as an agony aunt of the air waves back home, a cross between Doctor Ruth and Clare Rayner. Gorgeous is the sister who succeeded: she married a lawyer, had children and moved to the suburbs. She insists on lighting the candles and covering her head with a tea-towel for the Jewish sabbath ('A seance?' asks the teenager's boyfriend as he enters). The secular Sara is thoroughly anglicised, after two divorces coolly keeping emotional commitment at bay, and intends her teenage daughter for Oxford. None are - or is, as a stickler for grammar reminds us on stage - as secure as we think. Gorgeous's husband Henry, it is revealed, is out of work and aspires to write Chandleresque thrillers which he researches in mean streets and low dives, somewhat hampered by an adherence to Diet Coke. Theatre director Geoffrey, having turned to Pfeni on the rebound from a gay affair and desolation at the Aids striking his circle, ultimately decides he misses men though he envisages himself and Pfeni as 'the most remarkable friends'. And Sara's defences are breached, to her resentment, by the nice and the ordinary: a widowed furrier, or rather a politically correct purveyor of 'synthetic animal protective coverings'. The most articulate of the three, Sara finally describes herself (unjustly) as 'a cold and bitter woman who has turned her back on her family, her religion and her country.' Even her daughter backs out of a nationalist adventure with her Lithuanian boyfriend. It falls to the daughter to ask the question that might apply to all of them: will they always be watching, never belonging? They puzzle ruefully about their identities, taken to extremes in the young girl's lament that she is neither European nor English nor American nor Jewish. Of course, some might think this points the way to the new internationalism; but the play's message seems to be gently in favour of roots and a cultural identity - if you can find them. It sounds rather sombre, but the writing is literate, amusing and wryly resigned to the uncertainties against which Chanel suits and financial tycoonery are no protection, and international luvvidom no defence - as the director admits, he has no sense of who he is except in the darkened theatre where he makes it all up. A success in the US, the piece, for all its humorous Jewish self-deprecation and family argument (none of it very intense), is less Neil Simon than Philip Barry, the pre-war American author of such comedies as Holiday and The Philadelphia Story: urbane, concerned, the heartbeat belying the shrug of the well-heeled and grudgingly self-aware. A good cast could be better; Michael Blakemore's production could give more thrust to these over-controlled and emotionally slightly languid characters. But Janet Suzman brings her intelligence to Sara, and the younger generation are sweetly and convincingly portrayed by Hellena Schmied and James Arlon. About Maureen Lipman as Gorgeous I have a problem. Ten seconds into any Lipman performance I begin to giggle helplessly. While this might - should she opt to play Medea, Phaedra or Hedda Gabler - suggest in one or other of us an unsuitability for our chosen profession, as long as she plays comedy our relationship goes swimmingly. 'The Sisters Rosensweig' is at the Greenwich Theatre (081-858 7755).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PASOK and PKK Cooperate"] </F>   [Text] The Greeks have created opportunities for militants  of the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] to carry out their activities  in Greece. They have also provided funds for the PKK and  supported that organization in the international domain. Many  Greeks participated in the rally the PKK militants organized in  Germany for "Freedom to Kurdistan" and carried banners of the  Greek Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK]. They chanted  slogans against Turkey, which they described as the "common  enemy."    Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that the Greeks facilitate  efforts by PKK militants to escape from Turkey through the Greek  islands in the Aegean Sea.    It will be recalled that several Greek deputies and generals  visited PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in the al-Biqa' Valley some  time ago. They informed him that they will give every kind of  support to PKK's "justified" struggle against Turkey.  Meanwhile, the Greeks are trying to establish a radio for the  PKK in Greece. The PKK radio will be in an area close to the  Turkish border and will broadcast on the FM band. Furthermore,  they have allowed the PKK to open an office in central Athens.    It has been reported that relations between the Greek  Cypriot  side and the PKK go far beyond the visit of Greek Cypriot  deputies to PKK camps and the opening of a PKK base in south  Cyprus. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacted the  Colt [as published] firm some time ago to convey the serial  numbers of M-16 rifles the Turkish security forces impounded  from PKK militants and ask for information on the country that  purchased them from that firm. The officials responded by  disclosing that the rifles in question were sold to south Cyprus.</p>

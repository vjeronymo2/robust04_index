			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 1 Jun (AFP) -- It was officially  announced today that Dante Caputo, the Argentine who is serving  as UN-OAS special envoy on the Haitian crisis, reached an  agreement with Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer to send a  mission that will monitor the observation of the embargo against  Haiti. Today, Caputo met with President Balaguer in Santo  Domingo. Following the one-hour meeting, Caputo announced that  the Dominican Republic will accept a mission "of no more than 60  people." Caputo and Balaguer also agreed on "a maritime  cooperation plan to combat contraband going into Haiti." This  plan will be sponsored by the United Nations.    The UN-OAS special envoy said a group of experts will arrive  in the Dominican Republic next week. They will offer technical  advice on overseeing the embargo. Caputo also said the UN "will  encourage its member-states to offer their assistance" to the  Dominican Republic in monitoring the embargo.    In terms of humanitarian aid -- the only type of aid  permitted under the total UN embargo -- Caputo said that  tomorrow, Dominican authorities will receive, via the Foreign  Ministry, "an exact list of what can and cannot be sent across  the border."    The meeting between Caputo and Balaguer also was attended by  the Dominican Armed Forces chiefs of staff; Leon Fuerth, special  assistant to U.S. Vice President Al Gore; and Robert Pastorino,  U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic. Caputo, who visited  the Dominican Republic last week with William Gray, U.S.  President Bill Clinton's special envoy, must return to New York  today to meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The Dominican Republic and Haiti share a 300-km border and,  according to foreign sources, fuel has been crossing into Haiti  across this border.</p>

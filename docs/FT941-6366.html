			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / People: Fisons finds FD in Hankinson Fisons has concluded the long search for a finance director by appointing David Hankinson, formerly of Ranks Hovis McDougall and Lucas Industries. Hankinson, 54, is a well-known figure among the ranks of finance directors. He achieved some prominence a year ago when he left RHM on its takeover by industrial group Tomkins, only five months into a three year contract earning Pounds 160,000 a year. This came less than a year after he left Lucas Industries with a Pounds 352,000 handshake. From 1989 to 1992 he was finance director at Lucas Industries and, between 1986 and 1989, finance director at Rover group holdings. He left when the government sold its stake in the company to British Aerospace. Hankinson graduated in law from Cambridge and qualified as an accountant with Arthur Andersen. After 11 years there, he joined Midland bank as a financial controller and moved on, via George Wimpey, to Guthrie Corporation, his first finance director post in 1979. He worked at Wilkinsons Sword and Chloride before Sir Graham Day headhunted him to be group finance director at Rover. Fisons has been hunting for a finance director since the early retirement of Roy Thomas in December 1993. It is still seeking a chief executive - Cedric Scroggs was ousted in December 1993 when the company issued a profits warning. 'A number of candidates' have been seen and the search is continuing, Fisons said yesterday. (See Observer)</p>

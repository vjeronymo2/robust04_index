			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, 19 Apr (INA)--Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf,  personal envoy of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn and  foreign minister, has relayed a message from his excellency the  president to Indonesian President Suharto on recent developments  in the relationship between Iraq and the UN Security Council, as  well as on bilateral ties.    The message was conveyed during a meeting in Jakarta today  between President Suharto and Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. During  the meeting, the foreign minister said Iraq has honored all its  commitments. Consequently, the UN Security Council must fulfill  its commitments per Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 by lifting  the economic embargo clamped on the Iraqi people.    For his part, President Suharto said he was happy to meet a  personal envoy of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn. He  said: It is only natural for Indonesia to play a significant  role in promoting the just Iraqi demand to lift the unfair  embargo clamped on it.    President Suharto said Indonesia's role in this is dictated  by the strong bilateral ties and by the fact that Indonesia is  the current chairman of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM].  Indonesia can play this role through its efforts at the NAM  Coordination Bureau, the NAM Liaison Office in New York, and the  NAM group at the UN Security Council, President Suharto said.    At the end of the meeting with the Indonesian president, the  foreign minister and his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alatas held  a news conference in a Presidential Palace hall.</p>

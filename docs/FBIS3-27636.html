Under preferential policies, more than 200 projects have  been  started in the development zones. The 1993 total output value  of the zones reached more than two billion yuan (about 229.9  million U.S. dollars).    Wang Xiaofeng, deputy governor of Hainan, pointed out that  in  regard to the general industrial structure, the province will  put emphasis on heavy industry in the west while stressing light  industry in the east.    The province will pour 17 billion yuan into building these  development zones.    It is expected that by the year 2000, the zones will have a  total of 200,000 employees. At that time, the province's total  industrial output will be 43 billion yuan.</p>

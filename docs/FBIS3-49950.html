			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 20 Jan (TANJUG)--In connection with the  signing of the joint statement on the normalization of relations  between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia in Geneva  yesterday, Vladislav Jovanovic, federal minister for foreign  affairs, said that the two sides agreed to resolve all problems  by political means. "I hope that this means renouncing violent  means, especially war, as a means of resolving disputed issues,"  Jovanovic said in today's interview with Montenegrin Radio.    The opening of an office in Belgrade and Zagreb means  precisely that--not more and not less. This is not the  establishing of diplomatic relations or the recognition of  Croatia, Jovanovic stressed.    The problem of the Republic of Serb Krajina should be dealt  with in line with the Vance-Owen plan, through direct talks with  representatives of the Croatian Government. The Geneva  agreement does not prejudice the solution for Krajina, the  foreign minister said.    The minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Serb  Krajina [RSK], Slobodan Jarcevic said during the same program  that the RSK views the agreement between Jovanovic and [Croatian  Foreign Minister Mate] Granic only as the normalization of  relations between two countries, which he does not oppose.    "The RSK adheres to its stance that is must preserve its  state, and that it must participate as an equal partner in all  agreements on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. If  Croatia signed the agreement hoping to return the RSK into its  state framework, it is wrong," Jarcevic stressed.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Letter: Quality and productivity in education Sir, In the past 10 years industry and commerce (and readers of the FT's Management features) have learned that dedication to continuing improvements in quality of goods and services to meet rising customer expectations, almost invariably brings added benefits of less waste, lower costs, higher productivity and an improved working environment. Those unwilling to change attitudes, methods and organisation have not survived. Dedication to quality improvement techniques, better use of time and other resources is just as likely to yield improved, more cost-effective service and elimination of waste in the labour-intensive fields of research and education; better quality and productivity need not mean less personal contact with students or larger classes. If teachers and academics (like Mr George Bernard, Letters, April 12) say: 'productivity cannot be raised except at the expense of quality' who is asking for a free lunch - and who will pay for it?

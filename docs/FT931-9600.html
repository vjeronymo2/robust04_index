			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Industrial Control Services improves 30% to Pounds 2.37m INDUSTRIAL Control Services Group, the electronic safety systems manufacturer which obtained a listing last May, yesterday reported a 30 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits. For the six months to November 30 profits rose from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 2.37m. Earnings per share increased to 3.82p (3.47p) out of which an interim dividend of 1.33p will be paid. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 29.9m), as did operating margins which improved to 9.1 (8.7) per cent. Operating profit, including Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 30,000) of foreign exchange gains, was Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 2.62m). The group also benefited from interest savings arising from the flotation proceeds and interest rate cuts during the period. Interest charges fell to Pounds 357,000 (Pounds 805,000). Mr Peter Hall, chairman and chief executive, said that although the global economic position continued to affect adversely the rate of investment in ICS's markets, 'increased safety and efficiency standards in the oil and gas industries continue to create opportunities for retrofit projects for the group.' He said continued focus on reducing costs had ensured that both margins and competitive position had been maintained which had enabled ICS to invest in a strong sales operation in the Middle East.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / MP calls for belt-tightening over Pounds 2.4m bill for top brass' cooks Ministry of Defence top brass were urged to tighten their belts yesterday after the disclosure that more than 100 serving officers are entitled to cooks' services at the public's expense. The insight into the lifestyle enjoyed by Britain's senior officers comes just ahead of the completion of an independent review of 'representational entertainment' in the armed forces, including domestic assistance and official residences. The MoD said Sir Peter Cazalet, former chairman of the armed forces pay review body, who is conducting the study, was due to report back in January or February. It said the review - the first of its kind - would help ministers see 'what we have got and whether we need it'. The cross-party Commons defence committee is also making inquiries into the use of the 77 official service residences in Britain and abroad. The disclosure on cooks came in a Commons written answer by Mr Nicholas Soames, the armed forces minister and former food minister. Mr Soames listed 114 posts that are entitled to cooks at an estimated cost of Pounds 2.4m in the present financial year. Officers ranging from the First Sea Lord to the Captain of the Admiralty Interview Board and the 'Commodore Minor War Vessels' are entitled to cooks. The Navy is particularly well catered for: 65 officers are covered, compared with 23 in the Army and 26 in the Royal Air Force. Mr Stephen Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, who tabled the question, called on Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, to consider 'as a matter of urgency whether in the 1990s this historic entitlement is still appropriate'. Mr Byers said the figures showed a misplaced sense of priorities within the armed forces. 'At a time when public spending is under pressure and squaddies serving in Bosnia are making do with reduced rations, senior serving officers need to tighten their belts,' he said. The government disclosed earlier this year that the latest valuation for official service residences was approximately Pounds 34m. It said total maintenance and furniture and equipment costs for the last two financial years for all residences was about Pounds 5m, as was the annual cost for domestic and household staff.</p>

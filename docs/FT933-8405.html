			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Gamble to squeeze out corruption: South Korea's president is taking a risk at a time when the economy is sluggish Mr Kim Young-sam has sprung the biggest surprise of his six-month presidency. Announcing last Thursday night an immediate ban on the use of aliases in financial transactions, he boldly stepped up his campaign against pervasive corruption in South Korean public life. The requirement that owners of financial accounts disclose their identity is intended to end the bribery which has enriched those at the top, and to weaken the system of bureaucratic patronage which, the president believes, is hampering Korea's international competitiveness. Mr Kim said the move would eliminate 'the dark link between politics and business', depriving officials of the ability to hide ill-gotten money. It was also intended to stamp out tax evasion and the underground economy, which is estimated to equal 20 per cent of gross national product. Mr Kim is taking a big gamble at a time when the economy is sluggish; he acknowledged that 'in the short term, the (real-name) system is likely to cause a variety of ill effects'. Liquidation of accounts held in false names sent share prices down 8 per cent by Saturday's stock market close. There were worries that a capital shortage could cause problems for small and med-ium-sized businesses which have depended on unofficial lending markets largely financed by money held under false names. The move could also precipitate flight of capital abroad or into property as investors seek new tax havens, though the government promised to prevent this. Mr Kim's broader aim is to reduce centralised management of the economy by bureaucrats and politicians, and to give greater play to market forces in order to restore the country's industrial competitiveness, which has lagged in recent years as wage costs have risen and productivity has dropped. The president had bitterly attacked the status quo during 20 years of opposition to the military dictatorship which collapsed in 1987. When he abandoned the opposition in 1990 and became the conservative government's presidential candidate in last December's election, suspicions grew that he was really a politician of the old school. But his record in office has restored his reformist credentials. First, he ousted the authoritarian old guard at the top of the military establishment and the intelligence agency, and imposed civilian control over these powerful organisations in an effort to complete Korea's transition to democracy. Then came an aggressive anti-corruption campaign, which exposed bribery among senior government officials, military officers, university administrators, bank presidents and corporate executives. Top politicians and government officials have been forced to disclose their assets. The government audit agency and the tax authorities have been ordered to uncover corruption in government and business. The campaign has won Mr Kim immense popularity, with approval ratings of 80 per cent or more. But he is not without critics. The reform programme has been blamed for disrupting the economy, which grew by 3.9 per cent during the first half of 1993 compared with the same period in 1992, slow by comparison with other Asian countries such as China. The central bank forecasts that the growth rate for the full year will be 5.7 per cent, below the government target of 6 per cent. The Federation of Korean Industries, the leading business lobby group, has complained that uncertainties created by reform proposals on streamlining the country's big business empires, labour policy and financial liberalisation have dampened corporate investment. Officials who process corporate proposals for new investment have delayed decisions because they fear being accused of corrupt practice. 'It is easy to forget that the system of pay-offs did allow businessmen to get things done under a regime of strict bureaucratic controls,' says the head of research at a western broking company in Seoul. 'Remove the only way around the regulations, without changing the actual rules, and you have accomplished nothing except to make it harder than before to function,' he added. However, Mr Sanjoy Chowdhury, chief Asia/Pacific economist for Merrill Lynch, the US broking house, says: 'President Kim needs to show determination in correcting the structural faults that threatened Korea's future prosperity. His programme offers progress in that direction, although more may need to done.' The challenge facing Mr Kim is to reduce government control over the economy because the current system, once praised as a model for developing countries, is criticised as outdated for Korea's mature economy. The government no longer appears able to guide industrial development efficiently. Instead, the bureaucracy's taste for micro-management hinders restructuring of industry. Taming the bureaucracy would improve prospects for implementing economic reform in three main areas: Financial liberalisation: easing state controls on banks and capital markets and reducing the government's role in credit allocation, in order to make more efficient use of capital and stop pouring money into uncompetitive companies that the government deems strategic. Industrial policy: the government wants to reduce the dominance of the large conglomerates, the chaebol, and to promote small and medium-sized companies. The aim is that the chaebol should concentrate on a few core industries. Fiscal policy: promoting economic equality by broadening the tax base, cracking down on tax cheating and closing loopholes. Mr Ahn Chung-ni, a professor of political science at Seoul National University, says: 'Kim is engaged in a race against time in achieving his political and economic reforms. He has to push as fast as possible and keep his conservative opponents off-balance.' Politically, Mr Kim appears safe for now. He has used the anti-corruption campaign to strengthen his position within the ruling Democratic Liberal party. Internal opponents, mostly linked with previous military-backed governments, have been forced to disclose fortunes gained through questionable means. The reform programme has deprived the main opposition Democratic party of a strong alternative message to attract voters. The biggest threat to Mr Kim is a faltering economy, which could cause his popularity to fall. There are some healthy signs: wage growth has slowed as lower inflation and worries about job security have persuaded workers to accept moderate pay increases; and exports have risen because of the depreciation of the Korean won against the Japanese yen. Most economists predict that growth will accelerate in the second half of the year. But the slowdown in the Chinese economy - a growing market for Korean products - could undermine exports, and a rise in interest rates as a result of the introduction of the real-name system could depress investment. There are indications that Mr Kim is prepared to tone down reforms to keep the economy going. Investigations of corruption in the banking, construction and defence industries appear to have been curtailed in an attempt to restore business confidence. However, Mr Kim has indicated his determination to press ahead. The next few months will test his skill in balancing long-term goals against the need to revive economic growth quickly. South Korea's future depends on his success.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (8): Jostling for the Deng inheritance IN the first week of November, as a winter chill began to settle over Beijing, Chinese leaders gathered in the Great Hall of the People to celebrate publication of volume three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. In the way of things in the Chinese leadership this was much more than a publishing event: it was both an acknowledgement that the end was drawing nearer for China's 89-year-old patriarch, and an attempt to reinforce commitment to his reforming legacy among possible waverers in the ranks of Communist party conservatives. Preparations for the post-Deng era have come more and more to dominate the ruling party's internal discourse, and to preoccupy its main personalities who are only too well aware of the difficulties that lie ahead. Manoeuvring for life-after-Deng touches almost all aspects of politics in China, and the struggle for power and influence can only intensify as the moment of reckoning approaches. Reformist legacy The redoubtable Mr Deng, who re-emerged 15 years ago from political oblivion to steer China towards the international mainstream, and away from its years of isolation and despair, knows that words alone will not be sufficient to guarantee his reformist legacy, but time appears to have run out for him to re-shuffle for the third time the deck of leaders who will succeed him. For the potential weakness of his legacy lies not in whether his inventive theories stand the test of time - Mr Deng has 'theories' while Mao had 'thoughts' - but in the political durability of those who have been designated as his heirs. Nothing would place the Dengist legacy under greater threat than a crumbling at the centre brought about by bitter factional strife and the absence of strong leadership. While, Mr Deng - who was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution - has proved remarkably adept since his rehabilitation in 1977, at re-fashioning Chinese ideology in his own image, with useful catch-phrases, such as 'Chinese characteristics', to provide a veneer for capitalist reforms, he has been much less successful in selecting and nurturing potential leaders. His earlier creations did not stay the distance: namely Mr Hu Yaobang, who reigned briefly as party general secretary, before he was ousted by conservatives for being too liberal, and Mr Zhao Ziyang, who fell because of his alleged sympathies for the Tiananmen protesters in 1989. In the bitter aftermath of Tiananmen, Mr Deng was obliged to look beyond the central leadership group in Beijing for an official untainted by the tragic June events. Hence, Mr Jiang Zemin's elevation from the relative obscurity of Shanghai party boss to general secretary of the Communist Party. Since then, Mr Jiang has also been appointed chairman of the Central Military Commission and state president. But in the eyes of Chinese and foreign observers, far from bolstering the 67-year-old Mr Jiang's position, these additional appointments suggest weakness. After all, Mr Deng, who has exercised more power in post-revolution China than anyone except Mao himself, has never been premier, president or party boss: he has not needed titles to assert his authority. In what was almost certainly an acknowledgement of the inherent flimsiness of the leadership group chosen to carry on Mr Deng's work, much was made in late 1992, and early 1993, of a collective leadership with Mr Jiang at its core. This collective rested on the shaky foundations of the avuncular, although hardly inspiring, Mr Jiang, and the Premier Li Peng, who was laid low by a heart condition in April. He returned to active duty in September. Mr Li, whose public image is that of a fairly ineffectual careerist, suffers from the lingering fallout of his involvement in the decision to crack-down on the pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Both Mr Jiang and Mr Li are regarded as relatively conservative, although they are not averse to trumpeting reformist slogans, if that conforms with the prevailing current. The strength of the leadership appears to lie in its second tier, in the persons of Mr Qiao Shi, the 68-year-old chairman of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, and in Mr Zhu Rongji, the 65-year-old senior vice-premier in charge of the economy. Both are members of the seven-man standing committee of the ruling politburo. But while Mr Qiao, who has long been responsible for overseeing China's security apparatus, enjoys widespread factional strength, doubts persist as to the reformist Mr Zhu's ability to continue his meteoric rise in the party and state hierarchy, once his mentor, Mr Deng, departs from the scene. Mr Zhu, who has has had a fairly bruising campaign since mid-year in defence of his 16-point austerity programme, will have made some powerful enemies, both at the centre and in the provinces. His status as a relative newcomer - he was mayor of Shanghai before his transfer to Beijing in 1991 - renders him vulnerable in the factional struggles that swirl constantly about the leadership group. Loyalties The affiliations and loyalties of other members of the Politburo standing committee - Mr Li Ruihuan, the 59-year-old propaganda chief, Mr Hu Jintao, 50, who is in charge of Party discipline, and General Liu Huaqing, 77, the senior military figure - are something of a mystery. Beyond the jostling for power among the leading candidates in preparation for the post-Deng era is the wider issue of just how well equipped is the Communist party itself to deal with the challenges ahead. The anti-corruption campaign launched in the second half of the year was recognition that the party's tattered prestige was continuing to be undermined by a widespread perception that officials were profiting personally from the economic boom. But in spite of a rash of executions of allegedly corrupt officials and a continuing noisy public campaign, the long-suffering masses appear not entirely convinced that the rectification drive is much more than window-dressing, since those ensnared have been, almost without exception, relatively low-level functionaries. People believe that the problem reaches high into the party itself, and that among the main offenders are the sons and daughters of senior officials. In all the calculations about the way ahead politically, the military remains the great imponderable. There is no doubt that in the post-Deng era  -as it does now - the People's Liberation Army will play a key role. Support of the top generals will be crucial for whomsoever emerges on top, however, and ultimately the army remains the guarantor of party authority. The professionalisation of military ranks has not changed that.</p>

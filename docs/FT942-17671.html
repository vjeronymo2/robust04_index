			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Air France to canvass support from workers Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, is to seek a vote of support from the company's 40,000 staff in an attempt to push through a recovery plan which he says is vital for the airline's survival. Mr Blanc's decision to launch a referendum on his recovery package follows his failure to win the backing of trade unions for the plan. By Thursday's deadline, only six of the airline's 14 unions had signed the restructuring programme, which aims to increase productivity by 30 per cent over the next three years through 5,000 job cuts, a wage freeze and promotions, and other efficiency measures. Mr Blanc, who has threatened to resign if the plan is rejected, called for a 'clear and massive' response to help save the state-owned carrier, which suffered an estimated loss of FFr7.5bn (Pounds 880m) last year and has debts of almost FFr40bn. A capital injection of FFr20bn from the state is conditional on staff support for the plan. Results of the referendum will be announced on April 11. Mr Blanc's chances of success in the poll have been boosted by the support of Force Ouvriere, the largest of the airline's unions, which played a key role in the wave of strikes which scuppered a previous rescue plan last October. The failure of the plan prompted the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, then chairman of the airline, and represented a serious setback for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's centre-right government. Force Ouvriere said a ballot of its members had resulted in 90 per cent support for the restructuring package. The second and third largest unions at Air France, however, refused to accept the restructuring package. Mr Raymond Besco, general secretary of the communist Confederation Generale du Travail, said the referendum 'does not respond to the fundamental problems of the airline'. But he added that the union was not advising members how to vote. The Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail, the third largest union, also rejected the plan. 'The measures represent, in a different form, those which were massively rejected during the conflict last October,' said Mr Francois Cabrera, a union official.</p>

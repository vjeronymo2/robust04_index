			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Inspections Ordered for Boeing 737: The Federal Aviation Administration has  ordered emergency inspections of Boeing 737s built in the past two years after  a steering wheel came off in a co-pilot's hands during flight.  </P> <P> Boeing said an inspection after the plane landed revealed that a pin fastening  the wheel to the steering column was missing. In its inspection order, the FAA  said "this condition is likely to exist on other airplanes." The FAA and Boeing  said the missing pins did not mean 737s were unsafe.  </P></p>

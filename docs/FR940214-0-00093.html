			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Waiting Period (Interim Provision)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the law become effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply on November 30, 1998. The Act imposes a waiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of 5 business days (defined in the statute as days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on which State offices are open) before a licensee may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sell or deliver a handgun. As defined in the Act, the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``handgun'' means_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> (A) a firearm which has a short stock and is designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be held and fired by the use of a single hand; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) any combination of parts from which a firearm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in subparagraph (A) can be assembled.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Basically, the waiting period provision makes it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlawful for any licensed firearms importer, manufacturer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonlicensed individual (transferee), unless the licensee_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Obtains a statement of the transferee's intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to obtain a handgun containing the transferee's name,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address, and date of birth appearing on a valid photo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification, a description of the identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document, a statement that the transferee is not a felon,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under indictment, or otherwise prohibited from receiving or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possessing the handgun under Federal law, and the date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement is made;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Verifies the identity of the transferee by examining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the identification document presented;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement, contacts the chief law enforcement officer of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the place of residence of the transferee and advises such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer of the contents of the statement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Within 1 day after the transferee furnishes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement, transmits to the chief law enforcement officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the place of residence of the transferee a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Waits 5 business days from the date the licensee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chief law enforcement officer before transferring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handgun to the transferee (during which period the licensee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has not received information from the chief law enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee would be in violation of law); or receives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice from the chief law enforcement officer of the place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of residence of the transferee that the officer has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that the transferee's receipt or possession of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the handgun would violate the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the items in (1) above, the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request certain additional optional information about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee to facilitate the transfer of a handgun and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist law enforcement officials in verifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee's eligibility to possess a handgun. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optional information includes the social security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number, height, weight, sex, and place of birth of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee. The optional information will help minimize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the misidentification of handgun purchasers as felons or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other prohibited persons whose receipt and possession of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firearms violate the law. For example, this information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would distinguish the transferee from a prohibited buyer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having the same name and date of birth as the transferee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, therefore, help expedite the transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to the sale or transfer of the handgun, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law requires a licensee, who receives a report from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chief law enforcement officer containing information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violates Federal, State, or local law, shall within 1 day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicate any information the licensee has concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer to the chief law enforcement officer of the place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of business of the licensee and to the chief law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement officer of the place of residence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As provided in the Act, the term ``chief law enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer'' means ``the chief of police, the sheriff, or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The law requires that the chief law enforcement officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 5 business days make a reasonable effort to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether the transferee is prohibited by law from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving or possessing the handgun sought to be purchased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for records relating to a proposed handgun sale that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would violate the law, law enforcement officers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to destroy within 20 days the purchaser's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement, any record containing information derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statement, and any record created as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice referred to in (3) above. Furthermore, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records may only be used to carry out the purposes of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, and no information in the records may be conveyed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any person for purposes other than complying with the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

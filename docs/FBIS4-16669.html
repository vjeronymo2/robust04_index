			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Oleynik] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg, 18 Apr -- "It may be confidently  asserted today that mass privatization in Russia will be  completed by 30 June and, moreover, it will be completed  successfully," Anatoliy Chubays, vice-premier and chairman of  the State Committee for the Management of State Property  [Goskomimushchestvo], said. He was speaking at a news conference  which was part of the third annual sitting of the board of  governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development which opened in the Taurida Palace today.    The vice-premier cited a number of figures to corroborate  his  optimistic forecast. According to data from the state property  committee, more than 50 percent of the gross national product is  currently being produced by the non-state sector. By 1 July, 70  percent of industrial enterprises will be in the hands of  private individuals, predominantly in the form of joint stock  companies. Forty million Russians have become shareholders in  various enterprises as a result of cheque privatization.    "We have solved the problem of attracting people to  ownership, the second stage of lifting state control over the  economy and attracting money to the privatized enterprises is  now beginning," Chubays stressed. "The second stage of  privatization will begin on 1 July, based on monetary demand.  This will enable us to resolve the important issue of the  influx of investment into the Russian economy."    The chairman of the state property committee also reported  that -- by a decision of the Russian Government - he and  government Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Zaveryukha had been given  responsibility for carrying out the privatization of land. A  draft program for this would be drawn up on the basis of  experience in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and would be presented for  consideration by the government of Russia in two months time.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECOVERY EFFORT BEGINS AT CAMPEAU CORP. RETAIL UNIT;  </P> <P> RETAILING: EX-TREASURY SECRETARY G. WILLIAM MILLER, THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE  OPERATION, IS IN CHARGE OF THE FIRM'S COMEBACK TRY.  </P> <P> Sinking into bankruptcy is awful. But for Campeau Corp.'s department store  operations, trying to make a comeback could be a miserable experience, too.  </P> <P> A common quick-fix approach for an ailing company, a speedy sale of assets to  raise cash, would be very difficult for Campeau for, among other factors, legal  and tax reasons. At the same time, the 1990s are expected to breed brutal  competition among department stores -- a terrible time for companies that are  trying to turn around their finances.  </P> <P> "Cash-rich competitors want your turf," explained Sanford C. Sigoloff, a  retailing turnaround specialist who led Wickes Cos. out of bankruptcy in 1985.  He now heads L. J. Hooker Corp., the bankrupt parent of Bonwit Teller.  </P> <P> Campeau's recovery effort began Tuesday as the Toronto-based concern gave its  U.S. retailing holding company a new name and officially announced the  appointment of its chairman. As reported in Monday's Times, former Treasury  Secretary and Federal Reserve Chairman G. William Miller is the new chairman.  </P> <P> He will head Federated Stores Inc., which previously was known as Campeau Corp.  (U.S.). The holding company is now the parent of Southern California's Ralphs  supermarket chain along with the two department store divisions that filed for  bankruptcy court protection on Monday, Federated Department Stores and Allied  Stores.  </P> <P> Miller's retailing empire, which was crushed by $7.7 billion in debt, faces  immediate problems as well as long-term ones. For starters, customers who are  concerned by news of the bankruptcy might take their business elsewhere.  </P> <P> The stores, meanwhile, may dig themselves into a deeper hole by missing out on  some of the best spring merchandise.  </P> <P> Federated and Allied have won bank approval for $700 million in fresh  financing, freeing the stores to buy new goods. But the recent uncertainty  concerning the divisions' financial status allowed their competitors to get a  head start in placing orders.  </P> <P> The Campeau stores also need to smooth over hard feelings among some angry  apparel manufacturers and other suppliers. Ostensibly to keep suppliers happy,  the chains last Wednesday mailed out payments for due bills.  </P> <P> The snag, however, was that many of the checks weren't processed by the  Federated and Allied banks before early Monday, when the Chapter 11 bankruptcy  cases were filed. Consequently, a lot of money will be held up, perhaps for a  long time, in bankruptcy proceedings.  </P> <P> "If the checks don't clear, they (the stores are going to have a serious  credibility problem," said Estelle Rose, controller of Nicole Miller Inc.,  which sells women's apparel to Campeau's Bloomingdale's and Burdines stores.  </P> <P> A source close to the situation said company officials wanted to hold off on  the Chapter 11 filing to give all the checks time to clear. But, the source  said, Campeau officials grew worried that if they didn't hurry, a creditor  might file a suit that would put the stores into a more worrisome involuntary  bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Over the longer haul, Federated and Allied will face a litany of industrywide  problems. Many analysts expect a shakeout among department stores in coming  years as a result of increasing competition from discounters and specialists  such as Toys R Us and Home Club.  </P> <P> On top of the problem of too many stores, demographic trends are expected to  work against retailers. As baby boomers get older, analysts say, they will be  tighter with their dollars and look even harder for bargains.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, prosperous chains such as Nordstrom, Dillard Department Stores and  May Department Stores are expected to use their financial muscle to squeeze  struggling competitors.  </P> <P> There's little chance that matters could be helped swiftly by selling the  comparatively well-off Ralphs supermarkets chain or the nine Federated and  Allied department store groups. Campeau released estimates prepared by its  investment bankers at Merrill Lynch last week indicating that Federated and  Allied's debts exceed their assets.  </P> <P> In addition, selling some of the chains individually would produce hefty bills  for capital gains taxes. Financial specialists estimated that Ralphs' parent  would have to pay $270 million in extra taxes if it unloaded the chain.  </P> <P> Moreover, selling off prosperous businesses can be self-defeating.  </P> <P> "If they (the chains) are good, you need them to bring in cash. If they're not  good, you don't get the prices you need," Sigoloff said. "You're damned if you  do, and damned if you don't."  </P> <P> Sigoloff said that tedious bankruptcy proceedings can scuttle potential deals  by presenting delays, typically, of at least three months and sometimes much  longer. A case in point: Campeau's efforts to sell Bloomingdale's have faltered  because of concerns about bankruptcy at a time when fewer and fewer firms are  interested in buying retailers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Federated and Allied stores may be hard-pressed to hold on to  top-flight executives as bankruptcy proceedings -- estimated to take anywhere  from 18 months to several years -- drag on. "It's tough to keep an organization  together when there's doubt about its long-term viability," said Philip  Johnson, senior vice president of human resources at Chicago-based Marshall  Field department stores.  </P> <P> For now, though, the U.S. retailing organization is assembling a new top  management team. Along with appointing Miller on Monday, the company confirmed  that Ronald W. Tysoe, currently president of Campeau's Canadian and U.S.  operations, will stay on as president of the new U.S. holding company.  </P> <P> It also announced that James M. Zimmerman will remain president and chief  operating officer of Federated and Allied.  </P> <P> As expected, however, John W. Burden III, chairman and chief executive of  Federated and Allied, will quit effective Jan. 31 "to pursue other interests."  The company has offered his job to Neiman-Marcus' head, Allen Questrom, but has  not received an answer.  </P> <P> Not all of the issues that the new top executives will face are clearly  defined. Given the size of the bankruptcy case -- it's by far the biggest ever  in U.S. retailing and, by one measure, the fourth largest in the nation's  history -- there are plenty of imponderables.  </P> <P> Said Johnson of Marshall Field: "We're in unchartered territory."  </P></p>

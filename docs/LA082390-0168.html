			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> HAYES LEADS A STELLAR QUINTET  </P> <P> His cohorts playing with a smoldering heat that often burst spontaneously into  flame, drummer Louis Hayes led a stellar New York-based quintet through an  auspicious debut set Tuesday at Stingaree Gulch in the Sheraton San Pedro.  </P> <P> The lineup of Charles Tolliver (trumpet), John Stubblefield (tenor sax), George  Cables (piano) and Clint Houston (bass) represents the upper echelon of the  modern mainstream players who came to prominence in the '60s. That was a time  when individuality and intensity marked the music, and those qualities were  consistently evident in the group's performance that included Jerome Kern's  "Yesterdays" and Tolliver's "Ruthie's Heart."  </P> <P> Hayes, known for his work with Cannonball Adderley, Oscar Peterson and a band  he co-led with Woody Shaw, is a masterful leader, pushing and prodding his  players from the trap set, but never overwhelming them. In tandem with Houston,  a monster bassist with a buoyant bravura of a sound, Hayes delivered the kind  of energy that allows for spirited, inspiring improvisations.  </P> <P> Tolliver and Stubblefield made good use of this handsome musical platform. On  "Heart," a catchy, dancing opus, the trumpeter emitted a tone with a bright,  burnished core surrounded by a buzzing sonic outer surface and worked mostly in  the middle register. His ideas were stated with a rat-a-tat rhythmic precision  that swung hard, and he occasionally let loose with a wild, free-flung line.  Stubblefield, who also has a distinctive, open sound that's part murmur, part  shout, sometimes examined the chordal structure of a song like "Yesterdays"  with a Coleman Hawkins-ish exactness; sometimes, employing a firmly controlled  circular breathing technique, he allowed a seamless flood of notes come pouring  off his fingers.  </P> <P> Cables comped zealously behind the horn players, and soloed with equal fervor,  scoring with some rollicking chordal improvisations. Houston was another terror  in his solo moments, exhibiting a fertile imagination and a commanding  technique that could bring off whatever came to his mind, though he, like  Cables, could use a bit of space in his sometimes note-heavy excursions. Hayes  had a brief extemporaneous spot on "Blues for Macao"; otherwise he used his  considerable abilities to further his partners' efforts.  </P> <P> This exceptional ensemble closes Saturday.

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Trade News: EC revises list of tariff cuts on industrial goods THE European Community yesterday presented a revised draft list of tariff cuts for industrial products in the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks, but admitted it fell short of the target set by ministers of a one-third overall reduction in import duties, writes Frances Williams from Geneva. The EC offer, described by a senior official as 'illustrative' and a basis for negotiation, would lower tariffs across the range of industrial products by an average of nearly 25 per cent. However, for countries such as the US and Canada, the reduction is nearer 30 per cent while for others, notably Japan, it is less generous. This reflects what EC negotiators say are unsatisfactory offers from the other side. Community officials said the Uruguay round target had been missed because the US had rejected the across-the-board formula approach favoured by the EC and others. Instead, it had insisted on a request and offer approach to the tariff negotiations, alongside reciprocal zero-for-zero deals in particular sectors. 'It is now clear this is not leading to a satisfactory outcome,' a top EC negotiator said. However, US officials complained yesterday that the EC appeared to be pulling back on parts of an 'emerging maximum package' the two sides had agreed to aim for last month, which would have combined additional zero-for-zero sectors with reductions in remaining very high tariffs. The EC offer mixes a tariff reduction formula, including bigger reductions for the highest duties, with some sectoral initiatives. Officials claim that, after applying formula cuts averaging one-third, the EC would be the only leading trader with no duties on industrial products above 20 per cent. The Community is also proposing to scrap all duties on pharmaceuticals, medical and construction equipment (and is prepared to do so for steel, if current problems can be settled). In addition, it has offered to harmonise tariffs on chemicals, at rates ranging from zero to 6.5 per cent, and on textiles where the maximum duty would be cut to 12 per cent. However, the EC has not met US demands for zero-for-zero deals, for instance on electronics and wood and paper products.</p>

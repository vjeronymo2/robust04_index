This  important event in SRV-Malaysia neighborly ties attracted good  attention in the region and the world.    This successful visit not only further strengthens  SRV-Malaysia friendship and cooperation but will also contribute  to futhering the aspirations of the people of Southeast Asia for  peace, stability, development, and prosperity. During his stay  in Malaysia, our general secretary was solemnly and warmly  received by the highest government leaders, the ruling National  Front, the United Malays National Organization, and the  Malaysian people.    Talks between General Secretary Do Muoi with Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamed on ties and issues of mutual concern were held  in an atmosphere of sincerity and friendship. Comrade General  Secretary Do Muoi highly evaluated Malaysia's great national  development achievements, which have been rapid and stable, and  its increasing world reputation. He thanked the Malaysian  Government for its sincerity in sharing its precious experience  in national development and management. He aslo welcomed  Malaysia efforts in strengthening and expediting relations with  Vietnam. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed expressed his  admiration at Vietnam's economic development and belief that  Vietnam will develop and prosper like other nations in Southeast  Asia.    General Secretary Do Muoi's visit has enhanced the mutual  understanding and trust between the leaders and peoples of the  two countries. Vietnam's important achievements in the  renovation and its open-door foreign policy to diversify and  multiply party and state ties, together with the Malaysian  Government's policy of improving relations with Vietnam are very  important elements for both countries in developing their  potential and accelerating friendship and cooperation for their  peoples.    Among new developments in Southeast Asia and in the Asia  Pacific, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi's visit is a new and  vivid manifestation of Vietnam's policy of wanting to befriend  all nations to strive for peace, independence, and development.  Vietnam has joined the Bali Agreement, become an ASEAN  observer, and participated in some ASEAN activities in  preparation of its joining ASEAN at an appropriate time.    Persisting on the four-point policy announced by General  Secretary Do Muoi in Bangkok in his October 1993 Thailand visit,  Vietnam supports initiatives for increased cooperation. This  includes Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed's initiative on the  East-Asia Economic Caucus. Vietnam is also ready for joint  cooperative institutions in the Asia Pacific such as the Pacific  Economic Cooperation Council [PECC], the Pacific Basin Economic  Council, and so forth.    At the 10th PECC General Meeting in Kuala Lumpur on 25  March,  our general secretary emphasized Vietnam's consistent policy in  maintaining good ties with nations in the Pacific. Vietnam  places on priority the duty of broadening cooperation with  nations in the Pacific and the development of ties with all  nations in the world for the acceleration of better and broader  friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries in  Southeast Asia. At the same, it advocates negotiations to  settle all things left over by history or newly arising  problems. We ensure that all nations in the Asia Pacific will  find in Vietnam a positive counterpart and a reliable customer.    Our open-door foreign policy, independence, and sovereignty  has been welcomed by friends. Malaysia highly evaluates the  positive developments in bilateral ties. The SRV-ASEAN ties has  opened many potential areas for long-term cooperation. It also  emphasizes the need for a common voice on issues of mutual  concern.    Our people welcomes the success of General Secretary Do  Muoi's visit to Malaysia. We are happy at the new developments  in SRV-Malaysian friendship and cooperation, which meet the  aspiration and benefit of the peoples both countries for peace,  cooperation, development, and prosperity in the entire region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Augusto Martinez, executive director of </F> Colombia's Chamber of Commerce of Cartagena de Indias, by Pedro  Otero, in Cartagena de Indias; date not given; from the "Evening  Information Review" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Otero] Does the Cartegena de Indias Chamber of  Commerce have any kind of relationship with the Cuban Chamber of  Commerce? Cartagena de Indias and Santiago de Cuba are sister  cities through a decision by their respective mayoralties. I  believe they probably have some sort of ties. Cartagena de  Indias is a Caribbean city. I believe the Cartagena de Indias  Chamber of Commerce might approach Caribbean countries. The  Association of Caribbean States will be established soon, and I  believe Colombia will be part of that organization.    [Martinez] Since the resumption of relations between Cuba  and  Colombia, Cartagena de Indias has benefited greatly from this  new phase of relations with Cuba, and due to certain  characteristics and agreements on many aspects -- economic,  geographical, and cultural -- we have maintained close contacts  with the Cuban delegation in Colombia.    We have already established a number of contacts -- in  addition to the establishment of a fraternal relationship  between Cartagena de Indias and Santiago de Cuba that you  mentioned -- after holding meetings with the Cuban Embassy and  charge d'affaires to study the possibilities, and we are  virtually organizing a number of activities, beginning with a  business mission from Cartagena de Indias and the entire  Atlantic Coast to Cuba, which we will organize.    We are planning to organize this group in July, and we want  to involve businessmen not only from Cartagena de Indias but  also from Barranquilla and other areas along the coast because,  according to information we have received from the ambassador  and the charge d'affaires, there are enormous possibilities to  establish two-way exchanges, not only from Colombia to Cuba, but  there are also many business activities in Cuba that are  competitive.    With the opening and the tourist boom in Cuba, the island,  its businessmen, and its tourist sector require a number of  goods and services that are not being offered. There is an  enormous potential there. Colombian businessmen could find a  market; in fact, some have already approached us to establish a  direct relationship with Cuban businessmen through the  Association of Businessmen and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce.    We have not yet had official contact with the Cuban Chamber  of Commerce. We have started efforts given the possibility of  organizing this mission. We hope to invite not only the Cuban  Chamber of Commerce but also the chambers of commerce of the  entire Caribbean area to a meeting in Cartagena de Indias,  possibly next year, of Caribbean chambers of commerce and  businessmen affiliated with them.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Howard set to face his critics: Carbon targets are attacked as unrealistic MR MICHAEL How-ard, environment secretary, will open a government conference today on how Britain should meet international targets to combat global warming and will face accusations that government emission forecasts are unrealistic and keep changing. Mr Norman Lamont said in his Budget statement that Britain had put in place measures to get two thirds of the way towards the target of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. According to government forecasts the UK needs to cut emissions by 10m tonnes of carbon (mtC) to a level of 160mtC. Workshops organised by the Department of the Environment in preparation for today's conference in London came to the conclusion that the 10mtC figure was too low. The main concern to come out of the workshops, which included industrialists and environmentalists, was that emissions were forecast to rise steeply after the end of the decade, largely due to rising traffic levels. The workshops have also sent to Mr Howard their view that the voluntary basis of present government schemes is inadequate. Environmentalists are likely to question today why the Department of the Environment has issued several conflicting sets of figures since the Budget to explain how the 10mtC target will be met. In evidence to the Commons environment committee on Wednesday the Department of the Environment said the newly formed Energy Saving Trust and information and education schemes would contribute savings of 2mtC to 3.5mtC this decade. This indicates a larger role for the trust, which is intended to encourage households to save energy, than the department forecast soon after the Budget, when it predicted a saving of 2.5mtC. The department's estimate of the part played by new building regulations has also fallen in the past two months, from 0.5mtC to 0.25mtC, according to its evidence. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said: 'We had the initial commitment from the chancellor, reiterated by the prime minister, and it now seems that they are juggling the figures between different programmes to make them add up.' The Department of the Environment said yesterday: 'The figures given on Wednesday are our latest estimates.' The trust's prominent role has sparked scepticism from environmentalists and from the utility companies. It announced its first scheme this week after taking more than a year to set itself up.</p>

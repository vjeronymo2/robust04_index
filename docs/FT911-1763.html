			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Wellcome pre-tax profits up by 10% WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceutical group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to March 2, in the face of strongly adverse currency movements. The Pounds 181m profits for the six months were above market expectations of Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m and Wellcome shares closed 63p up at 582p. Operating margins jumped from 21.9 per cent in 1990 to 24.3 per cent this year. Wellcome said three factors were responsible: reduced costs; a Pounds 5m cut in research and development spending after exceptional growth last year; and an Pounds 8m reduction in pension costs, following a revaluation of the UK pension fund. Mr John Robb, chief executive, said the underlying profits growth was 28 per cent, after adjusting for currency movements. Because more than 40 per cent of Wellcome's sales are in the US, the accounts suffered from the weakness of the dollar this year. The group's turnover for the period was unchanged from last year, at Pounds 732m. This translates into an 11 per cent sales increase on a constant currency basis. The anti-herpes drug Zovirax remains Wellcome's best-selling product. Its sales rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 208m, with growth particularly strong in Germany where Wellcome signed a joint marketing agreement with Hoechst last year. However, sales of the anti-Aids drug, Retrovir (AZT), fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 78m. The number of prescriptions for Retrovir is rising steadily, but patients are taking the drug in increasingly lower doses - often at levels below those recommended by Wellcome and the medical authorities. Mr Robb said recent reports from the US suggested that dosage levels were now stabilising. If so, Retrovir sales would begin to grow again. The accounts include a Pounds 6m extraordinary charge resulting from a tampering incident in the US last February, when an unknown person put cyanide capsules into packages of Wellcome Sudafed decongestant. The write-off covers costs of recalling Sudafed and advertising to restore confidence in the product. Earnings per share for the half year were 13.2p (11.9p). As a sign of confidence, the board has doubled the interim dividend to 3p. Since March, the dollar has strengthened and Wellcome's sales volume has increased. Sir Alistair forecast continued earnings growth for the second half. Lex, Page 18</p>

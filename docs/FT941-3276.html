			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / US and Moscow close to Balkan peace plan Washington and Moscow believe they are within days of reaching an overall peace plan for former Yugoslavia. Details of the proposed settlement emerged as the United Nations said it planned to lift the nine-month Serb siege of Maglaj in central Bosnia, preferably with Serb consent, but using a 'more muscular' approach if necessary. The complex US-Russian peace proposal involves Serbia recognising the pre-war borders of Croatia and giving up some territory it gained in the war in Croatia which ended in January 1992. It also involves acceptance by Washington and Moscow that territory in eastern Bosnia held by Bosnian Serbs will enter into a loose union with Serbia proper. Underpinning this plan is an acceptance by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic that he make some concessions in return for the the west gradually lifting sanctions against Serbia. US State Department officials are preparing public opinion  - and the UN  - for the phasing out of sanctions in an attempt to end the war in the Balkans. The negotiated compromise would mean the US would no longer have to send ground troops into Bosnia to oversee implementation of any peace plan. Mr Stephen Oxman, US assistant secretary of state, said any moves to ease sanctions would be linked to 'positive steps taken by the Serbs in the negotiating process'. US officials said sanctions against Serbia would be 'phased out'. Although both US and UN officials were reluctant to say when the sanctions would begin to be lifted, they said a meeting in Croatia next week could tip the balance in favour of peace. Serbs from Krajina, the self-styled republic in south-western Croatia, will meet Croatian officials at the Russian embassy in the Croatian capital Zagreb. This is the first such meeting since Croatia broke away from the Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation and declared independence in June 1991. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the region, met Mr Milan Martic, leader of the Krajina Serbs, in Belgrade yesterday to explain the goal of next week's meeting. The Russian envoy said the agreement would end military and other hostilities between Croats and Serbs in Croatia. But UN diplomats said it would also involve Serbia making some territorial concessions. Mr Martic still insists that the Krajina Serbs would never live in an independent Croatia and that the region should be linked to Serbia proper through corridors stretching across Serb-held territory in north and east Bosnia. However, Mr Milosevic, whose government once provided Krajina with a military and economic lifeline, is increasingly inclined to break Belgrade's links with Krajina and recognise Croatia's current borders, in return for the lifting of sanctions. Russia will insist that if Croatia wants control over Krajina, it must grant extensive autonomy to the Serbs. 'There cannot be genuine peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina if tensions remain in Krajina,' said Mr Churkin. 'We thought that while we keep working very hard on Bosnia-Hercegovina, we should not forget the very thorny issue, very explosive issue' of Krajina, he added. The future status of Bosnia will also be discussed tomorrow in Washington between Mr Churkin and Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to former Yugoslavia. Bosnia's Croats and Moslems are expected to sign a draft constitution for a federation in part of Bosnia, and a 'general framework' for a confederation with Croatia. The Bosnian Serbs, who control about 70 per cent of Bosnia, remain reluctant to join the federation. Instead, UN diplomats said Washington and Moscow are likely to accept that the Bosnian Serbs have a special relationship with Serbia as the price to be paid for an overall peace settlement.</p>

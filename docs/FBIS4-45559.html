			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Jose Nadal Payva, the Peruvian Air </F> Force, FAP, commander, by unidentified reporter; place and date  not given]    [Text] [EXPRESO] Gen. Nadal, could you tell us how the FAP  participates in drug enforcement actions?    Nadal: The FAP has been carrying out joint  operations with the PNP [Peruvian National Police] since 1985,  seeking to neutralize drug trafficking activities in Peru.    In 1981 we verified that traffickers and terrorists had  formed an alliance. The FAP then began to operate from the  Santa Lucia Base because illegal activities like that threaten  national security.    Through Decree Law No. 25426 of 10 April 1991, and Decree  Law  No. 042-DE/FAP of 16 June 1992, the FAP was legally empowered to  control all landing strips in Huallaga and other places where  coca is grown. The FAP is thus responsible for destroying  clandestine landing strips and for downing planes intercepted in  Peruvian air space that refuse to obey orders to land.    To carry out its mission, the FAP uses its A-37, T-27, Y-12,  and T-41 planes as well as gunships that can operate day and  night.    EXPRESO: What are the results of these operations?    Nadal: Since 1991 the FAP has spotted,  intercepted, captured and/or destroyed about 200 Peruvian and  foreign aircraft that have violated the Civil Aviation Law  and/or engaged in trafficking. More than $1.2 billion resulting  from drug trafficking and 3.6 tonnes of cocaine paste have also  been seized.    The FAP, the Peruvian Army, and the PNP have destroyed  clandestine landing strips and cocaine paste laboratories in  various areas including Caballococha and Puerto Maldonado. It  should also be mentioned that more than 7,000 flight hours have  been invested in enforcement operations. Considering our  limitations, the balance of our participation is encouraging and  positive, not just because of our achievements but also because  of the high morale of our troops.    EXPRESO: What contribution is the FAP making to  the current pacification process regarding the civic actions and  social aide in general?    Nadal: The FAP has stepped up its participation,  as far as civic actions and social aide is concerned, through  the following activities: Granting free medical attention in  clinical medicine, odontology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology,  pediatrics, gynecology, urology, cardiology, traumatology,  pneumology, and various types of surgery, as well as medical  evacuations, distribution of medicines, massive vaccination, and  providing air transportation for civil personnel in emergency  cases in outlying towns where the FAP has personnel stationed.    During this year the FAP has performed some 710 flight hours  transporting to and from the interior approximately 15,500  people and 100,000 kg of foodstuffs, clothing, equipment, and  machinery necessary for the national pacification process in  which the national government is engaged.    Moreover, we have organized and implemented youth clubs  called "Los Aguiluchos" [Little Eagles] that involve  approximately 1,500 children between 6 and 12 years of age who  receive clothing, civilian-patriotic teachings, talks on the  prevention of drug addiction and infectious diseases, remedial  courses, sports, handicraft, and recreation.    This social assistance also reaches the parents with  periodic  conferences on subjects like "Responsible Parenthood" and "Child  Psychology."    The FAP also facilitates communication free of charge for  local inhabitants at certain hours of the day.    EXPRESO: You headed the Peruvian delegation to the  latest International Air Fair in Chile. How does our FAP  compared with the technological and scientific developments  displayed there?    Nadal: The fair was visited by more than 900,000  spectators where 31 countries exhibited their goods. The FAP  used the opportunity to create a landmark in its relationship  with the sister Latin American Air Forces by reasserting the  well-known professional level of its personnel through a  presentation, which was described as excellent both from the  operative as well as technical viewpoint, operating M2000  aircraft and state of the art technology.    The FAP Aircraft Maintenance Service (Seman) has proven that  it is able to deal with high technology and that it provides FAP  planes with excellent service. This can also be applied to  other types of Peruvian or foreign aircraft.</p>

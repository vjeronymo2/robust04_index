			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: BCI offer closes three days early The public offer in Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's leading banks, closed last night, three days ahead of schedule - confirming the success of the government's privatisation programme. The shares went on sale on Monday at L5,400 each. There were indications last night that only about a quarter of the 1m-plus people who had applied for shares were likely to receive any. In total, 260m shares were available to private investors. However, IRI, the state holding company which was disposing of its entire 54 per cent stake in the bank, placed a further 240m shares with institutions. On the Milan stock exchange last night, BCI closed slightly lower at L6,026 amid heavy turnover. Trading in the shares on sale in the public offer begins on March 17. The heavy subscription follows similar strong demand for two earlier privatisation issues. IRI raised almost L1,750bn (Dollars 1bn) by selling its stake in Credito Italiano in December and the government received almost L2,400bn from shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the financial services group. Credito Italiano, the Italian bank privatised last December, reported a 4.9 per cent increase in net profits to L218.6bn for 1993 as tax charges more than doubled to L640bn. During a year in which banks saw a sharp fall in interest rates, Credito's gross operating income rose 86 per cent to L1,574bn. Interest income was up 11 per cent at L2,532bn while fee income more than doubled to L1,351bn. Banca Ambrosiana Veneto (Ambroveneto) yesterday reported gross operating income of over L790bn for last year, up 11 per cent on 1992. The Milan-based bank, which will reveal net profits later this month, said the outcome reflected its strategy of developing customer services, thus lifting non-interest income.</p>

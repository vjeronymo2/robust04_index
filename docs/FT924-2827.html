			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and Options Trading DERIVATIVES had a dull session in which the weakness in sterling led to a sharp decline in stock index futures and turnover in traded options fell to its lowest level in recent weeks, writes Joel kibazo. After a steady opening at 2,784, the December contract on the FT-SE moved ahead to 2,789, within the first few minutes of trading. However, this turned out to be the day's high, the contract then going into decline, pulling the underlying cash market lower, as dealers focused instead on the weakness of sterling. The low of the day was recorded over lunch when December fell to 2,756. After a period of sideways trading, the contract staged a brief rally brought about by a firm opening on Wall Street and speculation ahead of today's Bundesbank meeting. December finished at 2,763, down 12 on Tuesday's session and around 7 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover at 6,862 was substantially down on Tuesday's figure. Rolling forward into the March contract continued and business in March totalled 1,834 lots. Total volume in traded options was a mere 16,641 contracts with the FT-SE 100 option recording only 2,615 lots against Tuesday's 9,394 contracts. Glaxo was the busiest stock option and traded 1,864 lots, with the March 800 puts the busiest series, followed by British Steel at 1,806.</p>

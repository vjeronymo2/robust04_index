			<p>BFN     [Text] Komarno, west Slovakia, June 5 (CTK) -- "Those  Slovaks who want to have a stake in the future have to prevent  the sale of Slovak national interests carried out by Premier  Jozef Moravcik's government, reads a Slovak National Party (SNS)  statement given to CTK today [no closing quotation mark as  received]. The SNS will run the autumn early election campaign  in coalition with twelve small parties, according to a decision  by delegates at the 6th SNS conference yesterday.    "In (ex-premier Vladimir) Meciar's opinion it will be better  if the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will run on its  own and other nationalist parties will form a coalition with the  SNS," SNS Deputy Chairwoman Eva Slavkovska told CTK on Saturday  [4 June]. Although HZDS popularity dropped five percent from  April, a May opinion poll showed it to be the most popular party  with support running at 21 percent.    The SNS is not afraid of competing for nationalist votes  against the HZDS since the two parties had agreed on a correct  line, something that would make post-election cooperation  easier, Slavkovska said.    The coalition bloc, provisionally called the Slovak Popular  Bloc (SLUB), is to include the Christian Social Union (KSU), the  Slovak Soldiers' Association (ASV), the Confederation of  Political Prisoners (KPV), the Slovak National Democratic  Movement (SNDH), and other nationalist parties and movements.    Father Anton Hlinka, a former VOA and RFE employee who  returned to Slovakia after the November 1989 revolution, and  Julius Binder, who led the construction of the  Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric project, have lobbied for the  bloc.    The conference decided to abolish honorary chairmanships of  Vitazoslav Moric, Marian Andel, and Jozef Prokes, who, unlike  the SNS Chairman Jan Slota, favor a coalition with the HZDS.  However, the decision was not influenced by Slota, Slavkovska  said.</p>

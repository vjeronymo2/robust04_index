			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Observer: Mild and bitter If November is going to be the warmest on record in Britain, what next? Unfortunately, Bill Foggitt, the Thirsk weather sage, has been basking in hospital during Britain's unseasonally warm autumn weather, so he has not been able to sniff the air as much as he would wish. Now recuperating at home, he reports that the recent mild autumn spell, similar to those of 1944 and 1947, is not going to last. While the wet October and November of this year were similar to those of last year, that is where the similarity ends. Though last year's wet autumn was followed by a white Christmas and an extremely cold February, Foggitt is not predicting a white Christmas this year. It has happened in successive winters only once this century, he says: in 1963 and 1964.</p>

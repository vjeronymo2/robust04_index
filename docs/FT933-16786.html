			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Germany's partners to keep up pressure THE Bundesbank's interest rate cuts will go some way to ease tension in the European exchange rate mechanism and may limit criticism of German monetary policy at next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Tokyo. But, although the half-percentage point reduction in the discount rate to 6.75 per cent was more than the purely symbolic cut forecast by many pundits, economists and commentators yesterday said Germany's trading partners would expect further rate cuts from the Bundesbank in the future. In recent weeks, foreign governments have been piling on the pressure for a lowering of German borrowing costs in successive meetings of international monetary officials. The tension increased sharply in the days ahead of yesterday's Bundesbank council meeting in Leipzig. Late last week, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, found himself embroiled in a Franco-German row after demanding a German rate cut. On Wednesday, President Bill Clinton joined the fray by saying the Bundesbank should 'continue to lower interest rates' to boost the US and global economies. While economists in Germany yesterday emphasised that the Bundesbank had limited room for manoeuvre in view of continuing high inflation, a high public sector borrowing requirement, even after recent budget cuts, and the relative weakness of the D-Mark on foreign exchange markets, many outside Germany said the Bundesbank must do more. 'I don't think anyone will ease the pressure totally because of these cuts,' predicted Mr Gerald Holtham, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, in London. 'Given Germany's plans for tax increases and spending cuts, interest rates should go down a lot further, to about 3 per cent,' he said. However, Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, said the bigger than expected cut in the discount rate showed that Germany was more ready to assist the world economy than many people anticipated. He said he expected the discount rate cut would be followed quickly by reductions in bank lending rates which should be positive for its own economy. Yesterday's rate cuts would enable the Bonn government to appear at next week's G7 summit proclaiming that Germany had taken steps both to reduce interest rates and limit its budget deficit, Mr Remsperger said. The Bundesbank's comment that it was 'continuing its policy of cautious rate cuts' indicated that German interest rates had further to fall. However, nobody should expect any promises at next week's G7 meeting because central bankers would not be attending the talks. In the ERM, the Bundesbank decision prompted rate cuts in Denmark, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, while Austria and Switzerland, which link their currencies to the D-Mark, also cut rates. There was no early move to follow the German rate cuts in France, although officials welcomed the Bundesbank move. In Britain, the Treasury also welcomed the German action but made clear that UK base rates at 6 per cent would stay unchanged for the time being. However, Mr Gordon Brown, the Labour party's economics spokesman, said the government should announce a cut in rates as part of Europe-wide interest rate reductions. Mr Brown said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, must ensure that next week's G7 summit 'addresses the need for co-ordinated worldwide action to boost growth and employment'.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / People: Partnership Sourcing Sir Derek Hornby, chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board and the former chairman of Rank Xerox, has taken over as chairman of Partnership Sourcing, the three-year-old joint venture between the CBI and DTI which has just received another two years of funding from the DTI. Sir Derek takes over from Lord Joseph; the latter spawned the idea as the result of a trip to Japan but stood down last summer because he now spends more time in America. Kenneth Cherrett, director, moves up to become director general - the position Sir Derek previously occupied. Cherrett, 50, a secondee from the TSB where he had been director of corporate relations, has now taken early retirement from the bank. Neill Irwin, on secondment from ICL, becomes director. The group is shortly expecting the results of its 1993 survey on partnership sourcing. Last year showed a heightened awareness of this philosophy of encouraging closer co-operation between companies and their suppliers in the name of greater efficiency. Among companies surveyed, 90 per cent had heard of the concept, compared with 70 per cent 12 months before, though only 48 per cent (up from 45 per cent) of purchasers and 37 per cent of suppliers (34 per cent) had adopted a scheme.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Business aims to find a common purpose in Belfast: A charity that runs an initiative to break down city barriers has taken up the challenge of Northern Ireland THE CHARITY Common Purpose aims to find solutions to social problems in cities. It brings together decision-makers from the public, private and voluntary sectors, and declares in its promotional material that there is 'almost no limit to what can be achieved within a city when its key people from every sector . . . work together'. It is a bold claim and, after testing it in 17 mainland cities since the charity was launched in 1989, Common Purpose has this year taken its message to Belfast. Organisations seeking to break down barriers between the communities in Northern Ireland risk accusations of presumptuousness or naivety. 'Working together' and 'common purpose' are far from obvious descriptions of many aspects of life in the province. But the request for Common Purpose to bring its initiative to Belfast came from within the city, and is supported by business and voluntary sector leaders. Common Purpose draws recruits from among those who are rising to the top of organisations, operating through discussion sessions and a series of visits and study programmes covering education, health, crime and other social issues. Participants in the first year's programme in Belfast come from organisations including Ulster Bank, Boots, Royal Mail, Shelter, Ulster University, the city council and the probation board. Common Purpose's Belfast programme is its standard one - it does not contain overt sessions on sectarianism - but local promoters of the initiative were determined controversial issues must not be avoided. 'If we failed to consider the divisions within the community the whole thing would be a waste of time,' says Mr George McGrath, British Telecommunication's deputy chief executive in Northern Ireland and chairman of Belfast Common Purpose. 'We were satisfied that these issues would come out as part of the natural examination of aspects of Belfast life. 'It would hardly be possible to discuss crime and punishment, or send the Common Purpose team out with a police or army patrol, without considering the issues that cause division in our society.' Ms Louise Ward Hunter, Common Purpose project leader in Belfast, says early experience indicates that the scheme is avoiding the danger of the exchange of views becoming no more than a repetition of familiar partisan slogans, or generating an artificially polite atmosphere in which straight-talking was avoided. This is supported by evidence from the other efforts to break barriers being made by business and voluntary sectors in the province Mr George Mackey, chief executive of Laganside Development Corporation and an active supporter of Common Purpose's move into Belfast, is also chairman of Business in the Community in Northern Ireland. BITC is trying to strengthen business-community links in a province where sectarian divisions are not the only problem - unemployment at 14.4 per cent is the highest in the UK and an estimated 95,000 children live at or below poverty levels. BITC's Seeing is Believing programme, like Common Purpose, brings business leaders into contact with aspects of life that do not appear on their regular agendas. There are, for example, 400 people serving life sentences in Northern Ireland due for release relatively soon, and a BITC team has been set up to help handle the training and employment aspects of their re-entry into society. Mr Mackey says the reaction of some business leaders during prison visits associated with the initiative has been a 'mixture of voyeurism and shock'. Like Common Purpose, the programme was not set up to promote discussion on violence, crime and punishment in the Northern Ireland context, but has succeeded in doing so. Ms Julia Middleton, founder of Common Purpose, decided to take the scheme to the province after being approached by Mr Quintin Oliver, director of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action. She is convinced that the popularity and speedy acceptance of the scheme in mainland Britain - 1,500 people with an average age of 38 have already taken part and pilots are planned in France and Germany next year - should ensure that it will withstand the potential difficulties of its introduction in Northern Ireland. Mr Oliver regards such voluntary-sector initiatives as uniquely important in the province. 'A combination of direct rule, the poor reputation of local government and a remote Civil Service with extensive decisionmaking powers denies people the opportunities for grassroots political activity that are available elsewhere,' he says. 'So charities and voluntary organisations have a particularly vital role.'</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOFFREY MAKING ITSELF AT HOME AT CAL STATE L.A.  </P> <P> Joffrey Ballet veteran Beatriz Rodriguez smiles as she gazes out toward the  hills and freeways that surround and create a relatively isolated, pastoral  setting at Cal State L.A.  </P> <P> "This is so different from the high-rise construction around (N.Y.) City  Center," she says, describing the mid-Manhattan area where the company is  based. "There you go outside and see nothing but buildings; here you have  sunshine and trees."  </P> <P> Rodriguez and the five dozen dancers and staff members of the Joffrey Ballet  are currently in residence at Cal State L.A. for a six-week rehearsal period  that marks a new partnership between the Joffrey and the 20-campus California  State University system.  </P> <P> It also represents the company's first attempt to become genuinely bicoastal --  a promise made to Angelenos in 1983 when the Joffrey became the resident dance  company at the Los Angeles Music Center.  </P> <P> "Wherever the Joffrey has gone, we have always made inroads as builders, and we  want to be a catalyst here in Los Angeles," explains artistic director Gerald  Arpino.  </P> <P> "There is an interaction that happens because the company is here," adds  Joffrey executive director Penelope Curry. "It makes people feel they are  really ours and we belong. Cal State L.A. has allowed us to bridge the gap.  They have closed the circle on making the Joffrey a truly bicoastal company."  </P> <P> The university is providing a handsome physical plant for the Joffrey in its  fifth-floor complex at Martin Luther King Jr. Hall. Newly refurbished, it  contains two practice studios and a rehearsal hall equipped with floors built  according to professional standards, dressing rooms with showers, offices, a  video room and a lounge for the dancers.  </P> <P> "They are very well equipped," says Rodriguez.  </P> <P> Curry concurs. "They are the best facilities the company has ever had as far as  an environment to rehearse in, and we will be sharing those facilities with the  dance students at Cal State L.A. and the Los Angeles County High School for the  Arts," she says.  </P> <P> The university has also provided the company with access to all recreational  facilities, including an Olympic-size pool and year-old student housing, "which  is geared to condominium-type living," explains Dean Bobby R. Patton of the  School of Arts and Letters.  </P> <P> "In New York you feel like a pneumatic drill, but here you can't get me off the  campus," Arpino says of his apartment. "I'm doing very concentrated work here  and having the quiet of the campus and the outdoors brings your center to you  in a more luxurious way."  </P> <P> Future facilities available to the Joffrey for rehearsals and special  performances include the $21-million Luckman Fine Arts Complex, which will  contain a 1,200-seat theater and a smaller experimental theater and is  scheduled for completion in 1991.  </P> <P> Once that happens, Curry sees an opportunity "to rehearse our ballets on a  stage, to do photo calls and make special little showings in a proscenium  atmosphere.  </P> <P> Although the Joffrey pays rent for the Cal State L.A. space, Curry points out  that it is "substantially lower than we would pay anywhere else -- and though  we will continue to perform at and maintain offices at the Dorothy Chandler  Pavilion as its resident company, Cal State will be our actual home as far as  rehearsals are concerned." (A press conference scheduled today will announce  further details of the residency.)  </P> <P> The new relationship began 18 months ago when Cal State Chancellor W. Ann  Reynolds and Arpino were discussing mutual interests.  </P> <P> They concluded that bringing the Joffrey onto the campus would add a  professional edge to the training program sought by Patton.  </P> <P> "It will give the students an example of what the real world is going to be  like after they get their bachelor's degrees," Arpino explains. "It will  introduce a new way of sponsoring the arts by combining arts and education, at  a time when we are threatened by cuts from Washington."  </P> <P> And it will at last give the company and Arpino a physical home in Los Angeles  where, he says, "I can come to create new ballets and be a part of a productive  scheme."  </P> <P> In exchange for a home base, the Joffrey will offer master classes, symposiums  and workshops in dance, costume design, the technical aspects of production,  business management and fund-raising in the arts as well as access to  "Nutcracker" rehearsals this winter at the Music Center.  </P> <P> Ensemble showings by Joffrey and Joffrey II dancers will be held on Cal State  campuses throughout California, auditions for ballets will be held in King  Hall, two- to three-day residencies by dancers during their off time in January  and February are in the planning stages and, according to Patton, a "two-week  tour of the campuses by Joffrey II is expected in 1991."  </P> <P> "We are working out a five-year agreement with the CSU system, which will be  finalized in the fall of 1989," says Curry.  </P> <P> Part of that agreement, Patton says, involves locating a coordinator for the  partnership who will "raise National Endowment for the Arts funds for matching  grants to commission works that the Joffrey will be doing."  </P></p>

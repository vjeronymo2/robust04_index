The statement said that being unable to defend the  territorial integrity of the republic, the resist the  aggression, to improve the conditions the people of Azerbaijan  live in existing Azerbaijani authorities intensify the struggle  against the opposition to conceal the discontent caused by the  fact that Azerbaijan signed the "shameful" Bishkek Protocol.  The capture of the headquarters of the People's Front, military  encroachment upon the office of the National Independence Party  and the editorial office of the "MILLIYET" newspaper, the  attempt to capture the editorial office of the "AZADLYQ"  newspaper, use violence against the participants of peaceful  meeting in Ordubad, the dispersal of the women's demonstration  in Baku, closing of the "BMT" private TV channel, introduction  of the political censorship, persecution of some of the  Parliament's deputies and some other facts witness the  intensification of the struggle against the opposition.    The latest appearance of Milli Majlis speaker Rasul Guliyev,  who had signed the Bishkek protocol, on TV is considered an  attempt to convince people, by scaring them, that it is  impossible to reject that document, as well as a try to spread  capitulative trends.

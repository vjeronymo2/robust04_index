			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / InterCity chief to lead franchise bid for ScotRail MR CHRIS GREEN, managing director of British Rail's InterCity subsidiary, is to become director of ScotRail next year, and intends to lead a bid by its management for the franchise to run it under the government's privatisation scheme. He will set up a shadow franchise company to run ScotRail for up to a year before the government puts the franchise up for offer. ScotRail operates all passenger services in Scotland except for InterCity services. Mr Green, a former managing director of Network SouthEast, has a high profile among BR executives and should be in a strong position to gain the backing of financial institutions for a management bid for the franchise. He will take over from Mr Cyril Bleasdale, who will retire on April 1, and who had himself hoped to lead a franchise bid. Mr Green's appointment was among those of 24 directors designate who were named yesterday by British Rail to run passenger services until they are franchised. The Gatwick line, one of the first due for franchising, has been separated from the Anglia Region, and Mr Rob Mason, currently the franchising director on the board, will be its director. ScotRail has also been designated one of the first parts of British Rail to be franchised. The Department of Transport stressed yesterday that it was committed to maintaining train services on the west coast main line to Glasgow after privatisation. This followed a leaked report from a committee of civil servants and BR officials which raised the possibility of the operators of the west coast route ceasing to run trains between Preston and Glasgow because of aggressive competition from the more modern east coast main line. The document, disclosed by Mr Brian Wilson MP, a Labour transport spokesman, said that 'in the longer term' competition from the east coast 'will certainly cast doubt on the economics of the (Euston-Glasgow) sleeper. It may cause west coast to review whether they should service the market even with day trains.' The department said the route would be franchised as a whole and the franchisee would not be able to pick the parts on which to operate trains. Mr Green described the leaked document as 'an academic paper on what would happen if there were unregulated competition'. He thought the franchisee would have to operate passenger and sleeper services to Glasgow, for which a subsidy would be paid. Mr Green said he would definitely be bidding for the ScotRail franchise as long as he believed there was a viable business. He acknowledged the management team might face rival bids from other potential franchisees. The bus company Stagecoach is believed to be interested in bidding. British Rail said last night that Mr Green wanted to become 'more closely involved with delivering train service improvements'. Hill Samuel to advise on Channel rail link, Page 6</p>

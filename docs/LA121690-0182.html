			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE EX-COUNCILMAN AND WIFE ARRESTED IN PROPERTY LINE DISPUTE  </P> <P> An argument over a half-built redwood fence between neighboring properties  resulted in the arrest Saturday of former Lawndale Councilman Dan McKenzie, 75,  and his wife, Dolores, 71, for allegedly violating a court order.  </P> <P> Eleanor Ballesteros, 65, and her daughter Audrey, 30, had won a temporary  restraining order last week that required the McKenzies to move their cars from  their side yard to enable workers to finish building the six-foot redwood fence  between the properties.  </P> <P> When the McKenzies refused to comply with the order, sheriff's deputies  handcuffed them and took them to the station about 8 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> "It's an unfortunate situation," Lt. Larry Schwartz said. "We were forced to  comply with the dictates of the court order, but we don't consider (the  McKenzies) criminals."  </P> <P> For more than 20 years, an ivy-covered chain-link fence stood between the two  properties. The fence, which was built in 1958 by the former owner of the  Ballesteroses' property, was placed a foot short of the property line.  </P> <P> Dan McKenzie, who served on the council six years before retiring in April,  says the former owner gave him the extra strip of land when he discovered the  fence was in the wrong place "because he didn't want to move the fence."  </P> <P> But the Ballesteroses say there never was any legal transfer and that the  property is rightfully theirs.  </P> <P> The McKenzies and the Ballesteroses haven't been friendly for years. Eleanor  Ballesteros has accused Dan McKenzie of spray-painting slurs about Mexicans on  his garage and calling her and her daughter derogatory names. McKenzie, who  denies the charges, says Ballesteros constantly takes pictures of him and his  wife in their yard and that he believes she was responsible for killing his  dogs with rat poison last month. Ballesteros denies killing the dogs.  </P> <P> Their relationship was further soured last month when the Ballesteroses decided  to tear down the chain-link fence and replace it with the redwood fence, which  was to be built closer to the original property line.  </P> <P> Eleanor Ballesteros said in a court declaration that when the contractors began  to build the fence on Dec. 3, Dan McKenzie "deliberately pushed his camper in  front of the workers and directly in the path of where the fence was to be  built." McKenzie, however, says he hasn't moved the camper for five or more  years.  </P> <P> Then last week, the Ballesteroses received a temporary restraining order  requiring the McKenzies to remove two other cars and the camper from the  Ballesteroses' property so they could finish building the fence. When the  McKenzies refused, Eleanor Ballesteros called the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Dan McKenzie posted $250 bail, but deputies allowed his wife to go without  posting bail. Deputies then drove them home, Schwartz said. The McKenzies' cars  were not towed from the area, however, because the court order wasn't specific  enough to allow deputies to enter the McKenzies' property, Sgt. Dan Rosenberg  said.  </P> <P> The judge who issued the temporary restraining order is scheduled to make a  final decision about the property line dispute on Jan. 2. Eight days later, the  McKenzies are to appear on charges of violating the court order.  </P></p>

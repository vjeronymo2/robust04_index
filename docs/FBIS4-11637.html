			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Walid Junblatt, leader of the Lebanese </F> Progressive Socialist Party and refugee affairs minister, by  Randah Taqiyy-al-Din in Lausanne; date not given]    [Text] [Taqiyy-al-Din] What is your opinion of the  disbandment of the Lebanese Forces party and arrest of some of  its officials like retired Major Fu'ad Malik?    [Junblatt] That measure was needed because the Lebanese  Forces phenomenon can only grow through a small partitionist  scheme in a Christian area and on Christians' bodies. If we go  back and read the speech by Samir Ja'ja' after the Sayyidat  al-Najah Church explosion, we can try him, regardless of the  legal or criminal evidence. We can try Samir Ja'ja' because he  wanted to arouse sectarian feelings and to say that the state is  impotence, and to say, look, here we are. He delivered this  speech on the same day the Sayyidat al-Najah bomb exploded. But  we should not confuse the Lebanese Forces' disbandment at the  political, security, and economic level and the issue of  freedoms.    There are people suspected of being key Forces financiers,  some of whom may have laundered their money inside the country.  These must be prosecuted.    [Taqiyy-al-Din] Do you support the government's ban on news  bulletins in the media services?    [Junblatt] The government should long ago have studied the  media issue and passed a clear law on the visual and audio media  services. As a result of the Forces issue, the government  hastily issued the decision in question. Unless the government  draws up a clear bill on Tuesday (today) and speedily sends it  to the Chamber of Deputies, we will consider that there is an  unconstitutional and undeclared state of emergency in the  country. I warn that we cannot tolerate such a situation.  Because later, and under the slogan of suffocating and  controlling freedoms, the situation will affect the theater  issue and the opposition. That is, I personally am a member of  the government but oppose it sometimes, so how about the  legitimate opposition? If this situation continues, it will set  a precedent we have never heard of before in Lebanon except in  the days of Amin al-Jumayyil and the Shahabis.    [Taqiyy-al-Din] Some Christians are frustrated and believe  that the state is using two scales: disbanding the Forces and  not touching Hizballah, for example.    [Junblatt] The frustration theory is aimed at partitioning  the country and hitting the achievements of the al-Ta'if  agreement. We should give that up. Hizballah, the Islamic  phenomenon, or the national phenomenon -- that is, the  resistance -- is a different matter. It is natural for this  phenomenon to perform its activities and maintain its presence  in the south, only in the south. No one can put pressure on  this phenomenon before the land in the south has been liberated.  But the Christian frustration and the speeches delivered by the  patriarch (Nasrallah Sfayr) and other leaders are sometimes  aimed at striking at the al-Ta'if agreement or proposing  Christian self-security, as advocated by some voices following  the Sayyidat al-Najah Church explosion, to the extent that some  of them wanted to close the Nahr al-Kalb tunnel in order to say:  "We are here...this is our self-security" -- which is  unacceptable.    [Taqiyy-al-Din] If the involvement of Samir Ja'ja' is  proved, do do you support his arrest, or do you believe that it  would aggravate sectarian disunion?    [Junblatt] When the Sayyidat al-Najah Church incident took  place, I urged that those concerned be investigated and  prosecuted and that the senior security officials of Ja'ja',  like Ghassan Tuma in Paris, Pier Rizq, known as Akram, and  others in Paris or in Canada, should be brought to the country.  A very violent statement was issued by the Forces at the time,  but I did not respond to it because I knew they were seeking to  provoke me, that is all. I support the prosecution fully. I  believe that Samir Ja'ja' must be arrested and condemned if it  is proved he has certain links, as his history is eventful. I  also believe that one of the security measures which should be  taken is to close the crossings to the south in order to limit  the Israeli infiltrations from Jazzin and elsewhere and prevent  security elements from infiltrating the country and planting  bombs or booby-trapped cars. The people of the south might  complain in the end, but the people of the Golan have been  steadfast for over 20 years and continue to safeguard their  Arabism. I do not believe that the people of the south will  abandon their Arabism.    [Taqiyy-al-Din] What stage has been reached in your efforts  to return the evacuees to the mountain?    [Junblatt] The evacuees issue is linked to financial  resources, and this issue and the other plans proposed by the  state should be given every effort. We note some laxity on the  part of some circles, which are interested in other projects  which I believe are not among the priorities. Maybe the  evacuees issue is not as "useful" as the conferences palace or  the railroad project, but it should be given priority over the  conferences palace, the railroad project, and the central Beirut  project. We and [Prime Minister] al-Hariri are cooperating to  give the fund a sufficient loan, but of course, we have to speed  up this matter, because evacuees cannot wait.    [Taqiyy-al-Din] How do you view the situation in the  Arab-Israeli negotiations?    [Junblatt] I said in the past, and I repeat and stress now,  that we are at an impasse, because Israel is procrastinating and  will not return the land. Nor will it give the Palestinians the  right to sovereignty over the land and resources, especially  water resources. It is an issue of time, as far as Israel is  concerned. It is trying to absorb the Hebron shock and tomorrow  it will invent something new. At present they are involved in  the whirlpool of distracting the PLO with the protection issue,  and there will be strange and amazing chaos among the  Palestinian police, the Israeli Army, and the settlers, who will  all be carrying weapons. It reminds me of the situation in  Beirut during the chaos in the days of 'Arafat. We used to form  joint committees, unified forces, and so on...the same situation  has moved to the West Bank, but the difference is that we are  dealing with a clever group, that is the Jews.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BICC rights to raise Pounds 154m BICC, the cables and construction group, yesterday launched the first large rights issue since the general election triggered a sharp rise in the stock market. The FT-SE 100 index has gone up by nearly 12 per cent since April 9. BICC shares had gained 10 per cent before yesterday's announcement of the Pounds 154m issue at 285p a share. The news was not unexpected and BICC's share price advanced 9p to close at 356p. It was helped by the group's statement that it intended to hold the dividend at 19.25p. Equity analysts have been expecting a wave of rights issues since the market started to rise, although there is some doubt as to whether the total for this year will match last year's record Pounds 9.26bn. BICC's issue, on a 1-for-5 basis, takes this year's running total over the Pounds 1bn mark. Mr Robin Biggam, chairman, said the money would be used partly to expand the cables businesses in continental Europe and North America and partly to reduce debt. Negotiations were fairly advanced on one US purchase. The fragmented North American industry, badly affected by recession and price pressures last year, was ripe for regrouping and companies could now be bought relatively cheaply. On the Continent, BICC had already announced the acquisition of KWO in what used to be East Germany and was considering other purchases. Mr Biggam estimated that about half the rights issue proceeds would be used for acquisitions this year. The immediate effect will be to strengthen the balance sheet. December's net debt of Pounds 35m has had Pounds 90m added to it by the inclusion of Grupo Espanol General Cable, in which BICC now has a majority stake. There remains nearly Pounds 100m of off-balance sheet debt, mainly associated with a joint property venture at Spitalfields on the edge of the City. BICC also has Pounds 177m of convertible capital bonds which it counted as equity, rather than debt, in arriving at year-end shareholders' funds of Pounds 685m. Last year the group, which also owns the Balfour Beatty construction company, suffered a 56 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Pounds 81m after Pounds 42m of property write-downs and provisions for losses on the Channel tunnel contract. The exceptional charges knocked nearly 15p off earnings per share, which at 10.7p fell well short of covering the dividend. The rights issue will add more than Pounds 10m to the dividend bill of Pounds 54m, largely paid out of reserves last year, and will aggravate the problem of unrelieved ACT. On current trading, BICC said there had been no first-quarter improvement in its main markets. However, operating cashflow was up on last year. Some signs of recovery had been detected in the US and the outlook in the UK had become more encouraging, although little impact was expected before next year. See Lex</p>

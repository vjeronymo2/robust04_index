			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Northern Investors net asset value rises Northern Investors Company, the venture capital group, reported a net asset value per share of 289.4p at its March 31 year end. This compared with 276.8p at September 30 and with 255.6p a year earlier. The surplus before tax improved to Pounds 446,000 (Pounds 373,000) and the net surplus was Pounds 348,000 (Pounds 287,000) for earnings per share of 9.3p (7.8p). The final dividend is 5p (4.5p) for an 8.5p (7.5p) total. Mr Michael Denny, chairman of Northern Venture Managers which manages the portfolio, said the overall performance of the company's investments had been satisfactory. However, he did not foresee much improvement in the economy generally over the coming months. The emphasis would remain on seeking out sensibly-valued and well-managed businesses, he added.</p>

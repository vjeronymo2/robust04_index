			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: CPC earnings edge ahead in third quarter to Dollars 125m After-tax earnings at CPC International, the US-based food group that makes Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn oil, edged ahead 3 per cent to Dollars 125.4m in the third quarter. The main factors hindering profits growth were difficult economic conditions in Brazil, which affected the group's Latin American consumer food earnings, and flat operating income at Best Foods, CPC's North American consumer food business. World-wide sales advanced by 9 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn, with CPC attributing the rise to acquisitions in North America and Europe, a strong performance from its Asian consumer food operations, and good results from the corn refining business. Worldwide operating income rose by 5 per cent, but higher financing charges limited growth to 4 per cent at the pre-tax level. Earnings per share rose from 79 cents to 83 cents.</p>

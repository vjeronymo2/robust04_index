			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Heseltine nears defeat over Post Office sale: Backbench rebellion likely to make privatisation too risky for government The government was last night on the brink of shelving plans to privatise the Post Office in a move that would deal a bitter blow to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. A final decision on whether to include a Post Office bill in next year's legislative timetable was scheduled for today's meeting of the cabinet. Barring the unexpected, ministers are likely to conclude that privatisation would be too risky. But there were warnings last night for Mr John Major, the prime minister, that he could face a backlash from the party's right wing if he backs away from the proposals completely. The likely retreat follows a meeting at Westminster yesterday at which a group of some 15 Tory backbenchers - more than enough to cancel out the government's Commons majority of 14 - told Mr Heseltine they would be unable to support sell-off proposals. Some rebels are understood to have told him that they would regard even the sale of a minority stake in the corporation as unacceptable. Sir Keith Speed, Conservative MP for Ashford, who attended the meeting said afterwards: 'There is still plenty of blue water between us.' Downing Street said last night that Mr Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, would report back to their cabinet colleagues today. Mr Heseltine told MPs earlier this week that unless privatisation plans were included in the Queen's Speech on November 16, the project would have to be dropped until after the next general election. Yesterday's developments came after Mr Heseltine tabled a complicated plan for partial privatisation in a last-ditch attempt to rescue the proposed sale. That would have involved a 40 per cent sale of the Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, and the transfer of another 20 per cent to an independent trust. The remaining 40 per cent would have remained in the public sector for at least two parliaments. Management of the Royal Mail would have been free to make investment decisions. Mr Heseltine's move was being portrayed last night in some circles as a tactical error. One Tory backbencher said it had given MPs the impression Mr Heseltine was trying to privatise the Post Office by the back door. A retreat would also deal a blow to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who has been every bit as vigorous as Mr Heseltine in promoting privatisation. MPs who attended yesterday's 45-minute meeting, at which a government whip is also understood to have been present, afterwards expressed confidence that Mr Heseltine would have to abandon his plans. Mr Robert Hicks, the MP for Cornwall South East, said it would now be 'unwise to make any reference to privatisation of the Post Office in the Queen's Speech'. Mr Gary Waller, MP for Keighley, said Mr Heseltine had given the impression that he had failed to convince the cabinet's industry committee that he could get legislation through parliament without wrecking amendments. Mr Steven Day, Tory MP for Cheadle, said rebels were 'standing firm in their belief that the Post Office and Royal Mail should remain within the public sector'. Sir Keith Speed said it was time for the government to have 'a fresh look' at whether it was possible to adapt Treasury rules to give the corporation greater commercial freedom.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) on Tuesday [31 May]  unveiled a list of auto components cited by Japan's six minicar  makers for a proposed parts unification program.    The program among the six carmakers -- Honda Motor Co.,  Mazda  Motor Corp., Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Motors  Corp., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Daihatsu Motor Co. -- is intended  to trim their manufacturing costs for a minicar or vehicle with  an engine displacement of 660 cc or less, MITI said.    Unified parts will total 84 out of 20,000 items usually  needed to assemble one automobile, MITI said.    The proposed unification will cover most of the important  auto component systems -- engines, electronics, lighting and  measurement equipment, transmission, braking systems, body and  attached equipment such as audio and air conditioners, MITI said.    MITI hopes parts makers will be cooperative with the  industry  plan, a MITI official told a news conference.    MITI proposed the latest program as a prescription for  Japan's minicar makers to survive intensified price-cutting  competition.    The program will help secure a stable parts supply for  consumers while promoting auto parts standardization and curbing  unnecessary model changeovers, the official said.    The auto and auto parts industries should formulate specific  unification programs in a manner that would not cause problems  under the Antitrust Law, the official said.    Transparency should be also ensured in selecting components  subject to unification, the official said.</p>

Specifically, for sanctions imposed on or after February 1, 1991, section 1867(d)(3) of the Act requires the appropriate PRO to review the case prior to the imposition of a civil monetary penalty or physician exclusion sanction, except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals or when an individual is denied a screening examination. Given this statutory direction, we do not believe it would be appropriate to place additional requirements on PROs in this regard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that HCFA require hospitals to maintain a record of the disposition of all individiuals seeking emergency care. If the individual were transferred, such a log would bear the initials of the physician authorizing the transfer and identify the reasons for the transfer, the receiving hospital, and the person accepting transfer for that hospital. Such records would educate hospital personnel about the statutory requirements, deter violations, and provide an audit trail to assist HHS in performing its monitoring and enforcement duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that we require each hospital to maintain a record of all patients it transfers and of those it receives, as recommended by Report No. 100&hyph;531 of the House Committee on Government Operations on March 25, 1988. Another commenter believes HCFA should periodically review a random sample of transfer files from every transferring and receiving hospital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that the hospital must maintain a central log or record of how it handles every individual that comes to its emergency department for HHS and its agents to monitor compliance with the statute. The OIG has reported that a lack of a central record on the disposition of persons seeking emergency services hampers HHS' ability to monitor compliance (Office of Inspector General, ``Patient Dumping After COBRA: Assessing the Incidences and the Perspectives of Health Care Professionals'' (August 1988)). Hence, we are amending the regulations at &sect;489.20(r)(3) to require a hospital to maintain a central log of all individuals who come to its emergency room seeking assistance and the disposition of such individuals, whether they were or are refused treatment, transferred, admitted and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged. Such a record will permit HHS and the State survey and certification agencies to select and gain access to individual medical records for further inquiry. However, we are not prescribing a standard form at this time. Our condition of participation for medical record services, at &sect;482.24(b), requires hospitals to maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient. Additionally, our enforcement procedures include a review of a simple of patient records. The sampling technique takes into account emergency room triage and unreimbursed care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 80 percent of the 6600 hospitals participating in the Medicare program are accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). JCAHO-accredited hospitals are required to maintain a control register and initiate a medical record every time an individual visits the emergency service (Standard ES.6). The JCAHO-mandated control register must contain at least the names of all persons (including the names of individuals dead on arrival) seeking care, as well as their age and sex; date, time, and means of arrival; nature of the complaint; disposition; and time of departure. The regulation at &sect;489.20(r)(3) merely requires the name of the individual and the disposition of his or her case. We believe maintaining a register of individuals seeking care is an industry standard and will not impose an additional burden on the 20 percent of hospitals that are not accredited. We have found a control register or control log to be invaluable in identifying records to be reviewed during our complaint investigations. We have not found any hospital that is not maintaining a log of some sort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that we clarify that hospitals and physicians investigated under these provisions be held to the standard of care based on accepted medical practice. Alternatively, they should be held to the standard of care utilized by the PROs under section 1154(a)(6)(A) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All physicians and hospitals are required to provide adequate medical care. PRO physician reviewers base their assessments on their education, training and experience, and assess the issues noted previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters recommended that we include provisions similar to the PRO quality assurance corrective action methods in section 1154 of the Act to allow for education and other actions to bring about positive improvement, instead of resorting to sanctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation emphasizes correction over sanctions. Hospitals that have violated these requirements are permitted the opportunity to correct the deficiencies and avoid termination. To date, 96 percent of violating hospitals have been able to avoid termination by correcting the deficiencies that led to the violations. However, the Department's primary responsibility is toward people who need health care, and in cases in which a hospital either cannot or does not correct its deficiencies, we believe it is appropriate to terminate the hospital from the Medicare program quickly. In addition, the law includes authority to exclude physicians and impose civil monetary penalties against hospitals and physicians. This serves as both a remedial function and a deterrent function. This may also motivate corrections and improvements to prevent future violations of the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

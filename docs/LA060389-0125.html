			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SHOOTING GALLERY DEATH IS RULED A SUICIDE  </P> <P> The death of a 19-year-old man who shot himself Thursday night at a public  shooting gallery was not an accident but a suicide, the Orange County coroner's  office said on Friday.  </P> <P> The victim, Ricky Son Dang of Huntington Beach, died after shooting himself in  the head at 7:44 p.m. at the Firing Line, 17921 Jamestown Lane. Police  initially reported the death as an accidental shooting.  </P> <P> But on Friday, authorities said that subsequent investigation determined that  the man deliberately shot himself.  </P> <P> Apparent reasons were the young man's despondence over "education and family  problems," authorities said.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Police Lt. Charles Poe said Friday that investigators found  that Dang went to the shooting gallery Thursday night with several male  teen-age friends. Poe said Dang rented a .380-caliber pistol, put it to his  head and shot himself. Poe said Dang did not disclose his suicide intentions to  his friends and fired the shot with no warning. The young friends "were shocked  and stunned," Poe said.  </P></p>

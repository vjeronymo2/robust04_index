			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  has stressed that if Sudan continues to take measures against  Egyptian interests in Khartoum, Egypt will not remain silent; it  will reconsider its policy toward Sudan.    During a news conference he held today, the foreign minister  said that despite allegations, which all have a weak and illegal  basis, the Sudanese authorities' acts against Egyptian families  on the day preceding 'Id al-Adha demonstrate the reckless  attitude of the brothers in Sudan, not only in taking these  measures but also in their timing and implementation.    Continuing, 'Amr Musa said: We disagree with the Sudanese  measures and the way they were implemented. The Sudanese  authorities chose the easiest but worst way to harass Egyptian  families residing in Sudan. This runs counter to Islam and also  lacks decency. The decisions, which were based on completely  false premises, were meant to harm relations and halt any  efforts to promote them, the foreign minister added.    At his news conference, the foreign minister said: I was  preparing to visit Sudan, but the Sudanese authorities have  decided to oppose Egypt's request to join the Preferential Trade  Area [PTA] for Eastern African States. Egypt's application was  opposed solely by Sudan, which threatens Egyptian interests and  prevents the Egyptian people from enjoying economic cooperation  with the East African states. When the Sudanese Government  resorted to this stand, I decided to cancel the visit.    The foreign minister said that Sudan opposes Egyptian  membership in the PTA even though Egypt has refused to take part  in any international conference that might take a stand against  Sudan or its interests. He said that this Egyptian position  stems from Egypt's historical viewpoint favoring integration  between Egypt and Sudan and fostering the brotherhood of the two  peoples. Consequently, we cannot do anything against Sudan's  interests. We have demonstrated this stand in the field of  human rights and in the UN Security Council, UN General  Assembly, the World Bank, and the IMF, 'Amr Musa added.    Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa suggested that there is  a  minority in Sudan trying to poison relations between Egypt and  Sudan. However, Musa affirmed that Egypt will take steps only  when it believes it will be necessary and useful.    During the news conference, the foreign minister said these  Sudanese measures will have a negative impact on the relations  between the two peoples. He reiterated Egypt's firm stand  concerning the unity and territorial integrity of Sudan, even  though the Sudanese Government's measures are meant to mar its  relations with Egypt and other countries. The foreign minister  pointed out that a minority in Sudan will not succeed in  affecting the historic and deeply-rooted relations between the  Sudanese and Egyptian peoples.    Regarding the situation in Yemen, the foreign minister  described it as tragic and regrettable, stressing the interest  in the issue of Egypt and President Husni Mubarak, as well as  their keenness to find a solution to the problem there. He  maintained that no Arab state would approve of the current  situation in Yemen. We must candidly condemn the use of force  between brothers, he said. Musa added that no one would have  expected that Yemen, which was united four years ago, would end  up in such a tragic political situation.    The foreign minister said that unity is a legitimate  objective for all Arabs, and this also applies to the people of  Yemen, both north and south. Musa added: We cannot but support  the voices which call for unity. However, unity cannot be  safeguarded by military action, the foreign minister said.    To a question about 'Ali Salim al-Bid's secession and  decision to establish the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 'Amr  Musa said: Let's wait for a while so that we can deal with the  tragic situation and infighting between the Yemenis. He said no  Arab state can take a mere observer stand regarding the  situation in Yemen. He underlined the recent contacts by  President Muhammad Husni Mubarak with the Yemeni president and a  number of officials.    Foreign Minister Musa said the failure to reach a  cease-fire shows the extent of the tragedy in Yemen. He added  that the Arab world as a whole must handle the tragedy by  halting the fighting, disengaging the armies, and seeking to  reopen dialogue between the Yemenis in the north and south,  because they are all Yemeni and are one nation. As for the  continuing political situation, he noted it is up to the Yemeni  people themselves. He emphasized that such a clash may generate  a continuous conflict in most parts of Yemen.    Commenting on the Nonaligned Movement ministerial conference  due to be held in Cairo on Tuesday, Musa said President Husni  Mubarak will inaugurate this conference, in which 108 countries  will take part, and that Egypt has so far received notice that  85 ministers will attend. He added that the conference will  discuss all pressing political issues, such as  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and the effects of GATT [General  Agreement on Trade and Tariffs].    He pointed out that Serbia and Montenegro are not the  natural  inheritors of Yugoslavia and hence they cannot inherit  nonaligned membership automatically. He stressed that  Belgrade's military operations and military policy against  Bosnia, Croatia, and other republics that used to comprise  Yugoslavia are acts of aggression and violations of the UN  Charter.    He said that given these violations, Belgrade cannot  automatically participate in the Nonaligned Movement's meetings,  noting that because of all this, Egypt did not send an  invitation to Belgrade, a measure that was agreed upon with  Indonesia, who currently chairs the movement.    Musa commented on the current crisis caused by Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat's statements in South Africa about a  jihad. He said president 'Arafat played a major role in leading  the Palestinian action that recently led to the transitional  agreement called Gaza-Jericho and it was 'Arafat who signed the  joint statements in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo. He added: If  we count on statements coming out of Israel and Palestine we  will end up nowhere.    The foreign minister said: It is not right for us to  hesitate because of a statement that might have been distorted  or not quite understood. But what is certain, we feel, is that  President 'Arafat is determined to implement the Declaration of  Principles and the concluded agreement and to press ahead toward  a peaceful settlement between the Palestinians and Israelis  according to the principles of land for peace and rights for  rights according to the Madrid formula.    He expressed his belief that we should not make any  decisions  based on any statement that we are not sure of as to form,  content, and text, especially one that would harm rather than  serve the peace process. He reiterated Egypt's readiness to  advance the peace efforts in the right direction.    Musa expressed hopes for a settlement to the Libyan-Western  crisis, a halt to the escalation of the situation, and a  solution based on the need to respect international legitimacy  and the Libyan people's right to respect for their sovereignty  and rights.    The foreign minister said tensions between Iraq and Kuwait  cannot be eased without an official Iraqi stand affirming that  the Kuwait issue has ended and acknowledging that Kuwait is a  sovereign Arab state. He explained that in the absence of this,  there can be no talk about Arab relations and Iraq's return to  the Arab fold.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Time Bomb in Asia"] </F>   [Text] President Clinton's greatest success to date has  been to avoid getting involved in foreign crises. He did not  give in to the pressure of those who advocate an active, global  U.S. leadership in the belief that in the absence of clear-cut  evidence of its determination, the Washington administration  will be ridiculed by both friend and foe. As an opponent of the  Vietnam War and one who moved into the center of the political  arena in the quarter century since then but is still afraid of  the unforeseeable cost of involvement, Clinton is willing to  take the criticism and pay the price of doing nothing, on the  assumption that the price of doing something is much higher.    This has been his attitude so far in the case of Bosnia and  of Haiti, but his ability to tread the same path with North  Korea is gradually decreasing. Clinton's behavior vis-a-vis the  radical, conservative regime in Pyongyang last year resembled  the way the governor of Arkansas would treat Republican  legislators in Little Rock: pompous declarations and threats  wrapped in incentives, culminating in a compromise depicted as a  success. This system has barely worked with Congress in  Washington, where Clinton carried fateful votes with a minuscule  albeit decisive majority, but it is not effective when the  adversary is a foreign leader who has been ruling his country  since toddler Bill Blythe -- he changed his name to "Clinton"  years later, in honor of his stepfather -- was in kindergarten.    Kim Il-song has long strived to attain the nuclear  capability  that would enable him to threaten South Korea, punch a hole in  the U.S. nuclear umbrella protecting it, and promote his goal of  military or political reunification of both parts of the Korean  peninsula. Thousands of U.S. troops stationed south of the 34th  parallel would presumably become hostages in the event of an  invasion from the north. Although Washington could respond with  a nuclear strike on the north if the south were facing defeat,  the north's nuclear weapons directly aimed at thousands of  Americans and millions of Seoul residents might force the  leaders of the south to make concessions without engaging in  combat.    Clinton had hoped to force North Korea to stop striving to  attain nuclear capability by subjecting its facilities to  international supervision, but he failed. After precious months  of evasions by North Korea and the U.S. agreement to put off  joint maneuvers with the South Korean Army, North Korea  consented to partial -- hence useless -- supervision. Clinton  hesitated for a month before he approved the stationing of  Patriot missile batteries in South Korea to protect it from  North Korea's surface-to-surface missiles which, as far as is  known, are not outfitted with nuclear warheads but might be  equipped with chemical ones. In his capacity as troubleshooter,  Clinton's concern about causing an escalation through his  response made some sense. This logic, however, is two-sided  logic (Washington versus Pyongyang), whereas Clinton's problem  is much broader: regional (how will the PRC and Japan proceed)  and global (how will the message of U.S. feebleness be  interpreted).    Hesitancy will not help Clinton. He will ultimately be  compelled to use force or lose what is left of his credibility  in Tokyo, Beijing, and other capitals at a time when his global  nuclear arms control initiative is supposed to be the crowning  glory of his foreign and defense policy efforts in 1994 and  1995. The clock in the nuclear time bomb is ticking. If it  goes off, it will mean that Clinton was tragically late.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Accountancy Column: Caparo-Touche saga ends with a twist in the tale - Andrew Jack argues that the pre-court settlement leaves important issues for auditors untouched A significant chapter in the history of auditor liability closed in the last few days with the settlement of one of the most important legal cases for accountants in many years. A decade after the ill-fated acquisition of Fidelity, an electronics group which issued accounts later shown not to reflect the true financial position, its auditors have made a payment without admission of liability to Caparo, the mini-conglomerate controlled by Mr Swraj Paul which bought the company. Four years after the original case went to the House of Lords on a point of principle that left Touche Ross victorious and many of its competitors delighted, the firm has now paid over some Pounds 1.35m to Caparo in advance of a related legal action that was due to be heard in the courts in October. Yet again, it means that independent observers - not to mention interested parties such as accountants and their insurance underwriters  - have been deprived of the chance to publicly scrutinise a firm's audit methods and determine whether or not there was negligence. The payment is particularly surprising to those who had earlier witnessed the determination of Touche to prove its innocence and fight the case so tenaciously - while Mr Paul was equally determined to see justice done to vindicate his contrary view. It was back in June 1984 that Caparo Industries began buying shares in Fidelity, mostly after the unqualified accounts for the year to March 31 1984 had been issued. It was able to complete the acquisition of the company by October that year. The 1984 accounts showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.3m, sales up 23 per cent on the previous year to Pounds 41.1m and the value of stocks up 54 per cent to Pounds 7.5m. Caparo claims it was on the basis of these audited figures that it launched its take-over - and would otherwise not have gone ahead. Once in charge of the company it soon discovered that the figures were substantially overstated. This led to the first Caparo action - against both Touche Ross and the directors of the company - in July 1985. The writ suggests that instead of the claimed profit, Fidelity had made a loss of at least Pounds 465,000. Caparo argues that the difference is explained by a combination of putting in the accounts stock that did not exist, under-providing for obsolescent stock, and under-providing for sales credits. It seems that a series of stock sheets were forged and altered, and then withheld from the auditors making copies of sample sheets. It argues that Touche was negligent because a proper audit would have highlighted many causes for concern. These included abnormally high stock figures compared with previous years' accounts; knowledge of the inadequacies of Fidelity's stock system and stock-taking procedures; and rigorous controls to check and verify the information the stock-take produced. Based on its own expert witness report, Caparo also argued that Touche should have reviewed monthly sales and returns and investigated unusually high figures such as those in March 1984; thoroughly circularised and followed-up for responses from debtors; and received all relevant information including full and proper representations by management before signing off the accounts. In January 1991, Mr Justice Webster found in the High Court that Mr Steven Dickman and Mr Robert Dickman, two Fidelity directors and substantial shareholders also sued by Caparo, were guilty of dishonesty on a number of counts relating to information presented in the accounts. They have since become bankrupt. But none of the substantive points relating to the auditors ever reached the ears of the court. Touche argued that it simply had no 'duty of care' to Caparo, as a third party that was not a shareholder at the time of the issue of the accounts. The firm's view was ultimately upheld in the House of Lords. Auditors were accountable only to existing shareholders and the company itself, the ruling said. In many ways, Caparo harks back to an even more significant legal judgment more than 60 years ago, which was also taken against a predecessor firm of Touche. In 1931, Judge Cardozo in the New York courts ruled in the Ultramares case that auditors should not have 'liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class'. Mr Emile Woolf, a partner with accountants Kingston Smith, says that the handful of tort actions since Caparo has taken an equally restrictive line to limit auditors' duty of care. The draft EU fifth directive would have reversed Caparo across member states, but seems to be languishing. The result is that auditors are now able to largely shrug off the threat of third party actions. Meanwhile, the effect of Caparo has been to shift the battleground to actions in contract: where the company itself sues its auditors for breach of its agreed obligations. None are more feared by the firms than those brought by the receivers and liquidators to large failed companies - themselves accountants and under a legal duty to pursue the maximum return for creditors. It was this route that Caparo latterly chose in its efforts to pursue Touche. Since the House of Lords prevented an action in the name of the third party share purchaser of Caparo, it sued as Intersound Consumer Electronics, the name by which Fidelity itself is now known. Touche was originally sued in the Caparo case for Pounds 13.4m - the cost of the acquisition - plus the return had the money on the purchase been more wisely invested, as well as costs and interest since the date of the purchase of Caparo: giving a total sum probably in the range of Pounds 25m-Pounds 35m. The difficulty is that Fidelity as a company only experienced a change in ownership, and its shareholders in fact benefited from Caparo paying too high a price. As a result, the only loss apparently suffered by Fidelity in contract is the few tens of thousands of pounds in fees paid to the auditors because the accounts were not accurate. In consequence, Mr Woolf says the Touche settlement seems 'surprisingly high'. Mr John Magill, the Touche partner who co-ordinated the litigation, says simply: 'The costs of these things are absolutely enormous. It made good commercial sense to reach an amicable settlement.' Asked whether he maintains the view that Touche is confident of the adequacy of its audit and that it would have won the legal case, Mr Magill says: 'We would not have settled for that amount of money for any other reason.' He will not comment on any of the substantive points of alleged negligence raised by the case. Mr Woolf believes that Caparo was necessary to prevent 'open-ended liability' against auditors under all circumstances. In the short-term, he would like to see contributory negligence permitted in contract cases as it is in tort, so that the plaintiffs are under an obligation to mitigate losses and cannot simply entirely rely on the defendants. In the longer-term, he would welcome a shift to the approach elsewhere in Europe of 'several liability' where the courts can apportion damages between the parties being sued based on the degree of culpability. By contrast, the present English approach of 'joint and several liability' permits one party such as auditors to pay all damages even if only marginally implicated. But he argues that Caparo goes too far in protecting auditors under all circumstances even when there is clear negligence, and an explicit understanding that their work will be relied on by a third party. There is a public duty for limited companies to file accounts, and for those accounts to be 'true and fair'. The auditor has been granted a monopoly to verify this financial information, and needs to be held accountable. After all, the audited figures are the same figures whoever reads and acts on them.</p>

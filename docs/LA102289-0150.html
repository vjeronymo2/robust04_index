			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WAGE HIKE FOR TRANSIT DISTRICT MECHANICS  </P> <P> How interesting to learn about the generous 12% wage boost afforded the  mechanics and service workers at Orange County Transit District (Oct. 17)  through auspices of the Teamsters Union.  </P> <P> While the Teamsters are not yet in power as a representative of OCTD, they have  negotiated a contract by simply ignoring the United Transportation Union, which  is currently the bargaining agent with some months remaining on its contract.  </P> <P> What is even more difficult to understand is the clause in this new contract  that calls for pay bonuses for employees who meet attendance and productivity  goals.  </P> <P> Once again the OCTD management shows us how it "manages" the bottomless pit of  money that taxpayers continue to throw at it. Strange as it may seem, I always  felt that it was up to the management to see to it that the employees showed up  at the job every day, otherwise they are fired.  </P> <P> And as far as bonuses for productivity goals, again, they either produce as the  standards require or, again, we fire them.  </P> <P> I would like to have the OCTD explain the details of this $500 pay bonus plan  to coerce employees to show up for their jobs and/or to perform to the work  standards as established.  </P> <P> RICHARD LIGHT  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

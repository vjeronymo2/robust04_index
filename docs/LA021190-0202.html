			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GYMNASTICS;  </P> <P> NEBRASKA'S KIRKSEY WINS ALL-AROUND AT UCLA MEET  </P> <P> From the beginning of the meet it was clear that Patrick Kirksey of Nebraska  could still be considered the top college gymnast in the country.  </P> <P> The defending all-around NCAA champion was the best all-around gymnast again  Saturday night when he led his team to victory in the UCLA Men's Gymnastic  Invitational at Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> Nebraska, the top-ranked team in the country, scored 283.075 points to easily  beat UCLA. The Bruins, however, provided the only intrigue of the night when  they edged Minnesota by .55 in the final event to finish second with a score of  279.2  </P> <P> Minnesota finished at 278.8, followed by New Mexico at 273.075 and Arizona  State at 271.5. Illinois, the defending NCAA champion, finished last at 269.95.  </P> <P> "Next to the NCAA championship, this is our biggest meet of the year," said  Kirksey, who is also the defending all-around champion of this meet. "There is  so much competition in this meet that I can't worry about it or I would go  crazy. I've got three people on my own team who are excellent and then at UCLA  there's Chris Waller, (Chainey) Umphrey and Scott Keswick. Minnesota has John  Roethlisberger. It's a great meet."  </P> <P> Minnesota stayed close to Nebraska for the first three rotations. But the  Cornhuskers pulled three points ahead of the Gophers with a strong team  performance in the floor exercise in their fourth event.  </P> <P> The Bruins, trailing Minnesota by 1.3 points after the fourth rotation, pulled  to .15 of the Gophers with the top team score of on the parallel bars.  </P> <P> Falls by Waller and Keswick in the high bar, the Bruins' final event, appeared  costly, but the Gophers scored low enough on the parallel bars to put UCLA  ahead.  </P> <P> "This is only our second meet of the year so I feel good about our  performance," said Keswick, who won the parallel bar event with a 9.85.  </P> <P> UCLA was not ranked because it had not competed in two meets until Saturday.  </P> <P> Umphrey, a member of the U.S. national gymnastics team, seemed to be the  biggest crowd pleaser. His explosive performance on the rings, which he won  with a score of 9.8, and on the high bar brought the most applause from the  crowd of 2,500.  </P> <P> The top score of the meet was by Licurgo Diaz-Sandi, when his near-perfect  floor exercise brought the Arizona State gymnast a 9.9.  </P></p>

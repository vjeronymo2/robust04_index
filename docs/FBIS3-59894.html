			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Rogov, president of the Center for </F> National Security and International Relations: "Ukrainian  Nuclear Missiles, Targeted at the Skies, Could Alter the Balance  of Forces on Earth"]    [Text] The amendments that deputies of the Supreme Council  of Ukraine made in ratification of the START I treaty could  upset the balance of forces in the world.    The consequences of the step taken by Ukraine have not been  recognized with us as yet, unfortunately. The point being that  we are present not simply during Ukraine's revision of its  former position in respect to nonnuclear status. A new nuclear  power, a nuclear superpower, even, is being created before our  eyes. After all, in terms of the quantity of strategic nuclear  arms deployed on the territory of Ukraine and declared by the  Supreme Council to be its property, it is today entirely  comparable with what the Soviet Union had 25 years ago, in the  period when the Soviet-American negotiations that led in 1972 to  the signing of the SALT 1 treaty began. Even following the  reductions to which the Ukrainian leadership has consented,  Ukraine will have more nuclear arms than Britain, France, and  China put together.    Why has this happened? Why has Ukraine renounced its former  positions? Such an outcome of events was, I believe, to have  been expected. The commitment to the adoption of nuclear-free  status was made by Ukraine in the period when the struggle for  sovereignty was under way. Ukraine was not an independent state  at that time. The situation changed drastically following the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, when the formation of new  independent national states began, and Ukraine, like any other  state, is taking the path of recognition of power factors,  primarily military-power factors, as the basis of its position  in the international arena and status in the system of  international relations. And if Russia, the United States, and  other nuclear states are not about to give up their nuclear  arms--it is only a question of a reduction thereof--why should  we expect any different a position of Ukraine? The formation of  a new independent state, when its position is still quite  fragile, is evoking in Ukrainian political circles--and not only  among nationalists--an aspiration to rely on some power levers.  Nuclear weapons under these conditions are coming to be  perceived as a guarantor of Ukraine's independence and as a  means of deterrence against interference in its internal affairs.    From Russia's viewpoint, such a development of events is,  naturally, extremely undesirable. After all, this means that  Soviet nuclear weapons have not one successor--Russia--but two  and, possibly, three, considering that Kazakhstan also is  refusing to recognize the nuclear weapons on its territory as  Russian property and is essentially, albeit with a certain lag,  taking the route carved out by Ukraine. Thus, Russia will become  the sole state in the world that will have on its borders three  nuclear neighbors, counting China. This geostrategic situation  could have extremely negative consequences if account is taken  of that entire complex of territorial national border  contradictions that exist even now and that could emerge for  Russia with its neighbors in the future.    Ukraine's step will have negative consequences also for the  system of international relations as a whole. After all, the  appearance of a new nuclear power or superpower, even, is a most  severe blow to the status of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty, which is already experiencing the strongest pressure as  a result of the actions of North Korea, Iran, Iraq, India, and  Pakistan as it is. How might the world community impede the  nuclear ambitions of some states and agree to the acquisition of  nuclear weapons and nuclear status by others? The logic of the  Nonproliferation Treaty is confounded, and it may be expected  that at the conference reviewing this treaty, which is scheduled  for 1995, Ukraine's actions will be used by many opponents of a  continuation of the nonproliferation regime to undermine it and  to deny an extension thereof. In addition, in the new multipolar  world that has come to replace the bipolar system of the cold  war period, the prospect of the proliferation of nuclear weapons  would bring about an abrupt destabilization of the situation.  Use of the nuclear factor to become a power center could make  the process of the preservation of stability in the multipolar  world practically unmanageable.    It has to be said that the Ukrainian leadership's decision  represents a most important miscalculation of Russia. Two years  ago at Belovezhskaya Pushcha, and in subsequent agreements of  the CIS, the question of ownership of the nuclear weapons was  avoided. Nebulous, essentially meaningless wording of the  "unified control over nuclear weapons" type was employed  instead. Under conditions where each republic had become a full  successor of all Soviet property on its territory, such wording  could not have prevented a division of the military inheritance  among the republics, and now, it is becoming clear, the nuclear  inheritance also.    For a long time, unfortunately, the Russian leadership  ignored the problem, putting its faith in the United States and  the West forcing Ukraine to abandon its claims. But this did not  happen. And Russia itself contributed to the increased  suspicions in respect to itself in Ukraine, making territorial  demands, inflating the conflict over the Black Sea Fleet, and  using economic levers as a stick in relations with Ukraine. All  this played into the hands of the circles in Ukraine that are  doing everything possible to rid themselves of the Chernobyl  syndrome and build Ukrainian sovereignty on the classical  factors of power politics.</p>

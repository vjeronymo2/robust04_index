			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LYNWOOD;  </P> <P> YOUTH GROUP DENIED PERMIT TO SELL BEER AT MALL OPENING  </P> <P> The Lynwood City Council last week refused to grant an East Los Angeles youth  group a permit to sell beer during the opening of a new indoor mall.  </P> <P> The Hollenbeck Youth Center's request to sell beer during the grand opening of  the Lynwood Marketplace was not approved after the council could not get the  two votes required to discuss the matter.  </P> <P> David Fuentes, a representative of the center, promised that the group would  provide security and strict control over the sales, but some council members  were not convinced.  </P> <P> "Selling beer in a parking lot with so many kids around does not seem  reasonable," Councilwoman Evelyn Wells said.  </P> <P> Wells said the opening Saturday was a success, with more than 50,000 in  attendance during the weekend.  </P> <P> The Marketplace, which contains more than 100 small shops, is at 3100 E.  Imperial Highway in a former Montgomery Ward department store.  </P> <P> Electronics, leather goods, plants and beauty supplies are among the shops in  the two-story, 800,000-square-foot mall.  </P></p>

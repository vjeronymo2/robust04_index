			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Soap wars force delay in board changes at Unilever Unilever's problems with its revolutionary new detergents appeared yesterday to have disrupted the orderly succession to the Anglo-Dutch group's top job. The company announced a postponement of previously announced boardroom changes amid mounting evidence that Persil Power and Omo Power, the detergents launched this spring, have failed to meet their targets. Unilever spent some Pounds 200m to bring its most ambitious new product in 15 years to market. But it has made no dent in the sales of Procter &amp; Gamble, its American rival, which has about 35 per cent of the Pounds 6bn a year European detergents market against Unilever's 22 per cent. P&amp;G launched an unprecedented public campaign against the product, which Unilever had hoped would help it recapture the lead in European detergents it lost to P&amp;G in the 1980s. Unilever said that Mr Niall FitzGerald, vice-chairman of Unilever plc, the British half of the Anglo-Dutch group, and head of its detergents business, would not be joining the special committee, the triumvirate that runs Unilever, as planned after next May's annual meeting. His move to the special committee, announced last December, had been widely seen as a precursor to his taking over from Sir Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever plc, who is due to retire in May 1996. Mr FitzGerald 'has expressed the wish to continue as detergents co-ordinator for a further period', Unilever said. He would now join the committee in 1996. The delay means the special committee will be down to two men for up to two years, an unprecedented situation in Unilever's 64-year history. The two special committee members are Sir Michael and Mr Morris Tabaksblat, chairman of Unilever NV, the Dutch arm. The third person is almost always heir apparent to one of the co-chairmen. Mr FitzGerald, a 49-year-old Irishman, would be the youngest chairman in Unilever's history. 'Nothing has changed except the timing,' a senior businessman close to Unilever said yesterday. 'He wants a year pressing the flesh to reassure the troops.' It would be unusual, however, for a new chairman to take up his post without serving on the special committee. Asked whether the change meant Sir Michael would extend his tenure, Unilever said:'That would depend on events and needs.' The original version of the new Power detergent, sold as Persil in the UK and Omo on the Continent, was criticised for damaging some fabrics. The group was forced to change the formulation after a flaw made it react to some dyes. People, Page 11</p>

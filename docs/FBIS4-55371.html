			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 12 (MTI) -- Gyula Horn, chairman of  the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), left Borsod county  hospital in Miskolc in a reassuring condition today, hospital  director Zoltan Katona told MTI. On May 5, the car carrying  Horn back to Budapest from an election rally in Miskolc ran into  a truck parked on road No. 3 between Nyekladhaza and Emod. The  party chairman suffered a fractured cervical vertebra, a broken  wrist and a concussion in the crash.    Dr. Katona said Horn is in quite a good condition, and he is  returning to his family in Budapest. He will invariably need  longer-term outpatient care and must undergo rehabilitation  treatment, Katona added. Driver Istvan Mosolygo and the other  passenger Jeno Zsidey have also left the hospital.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENTAL OUTLAY CUTS INTO BUDGET FOR U.S. DRUG ENFORCERS;  </P> <P> $4 MILLION BEING SPENT ON EMPTY OFFICES  </P> <P> The Drug Enforcement Administration, despite mounting budget pressures, is  paying $324,000 a month in rent for a 12-story headquarters building and seven  floors of a twin structure that it will not occupy for at least three more  months, The Times learned Thursday.  </P> <P> By the time the DEA starts moving into the facility in April, it will have paid  $4.2 million in rent for the space, which was secured a year ago to permit the  agency to consolidate its operations.  </P> <P> DEA officials acknowledge that the additional cost is contributing to cutbacks  in its operations budget for such things as agent travel and equipment  purchases but insist that it is having no impact on investigations.  </P> <P> The budget pressure on drug enforcers has become so intense that President Bush  said in a published interview Thursday that the all-out war on drugs he  promised in his inaugural address would be mainly an educational rather than a  law enforcement effort. He said in the interview that the "overriding problem  of the deficit" would make it difficult to increase spending on enforcement to  keep drugs out of the country.  </P> <P> Top DEA officials contend that paying rent for a year on an unoccupied building  is "not phenomenal" and "not exclusive to the DEA" and that renting the  structures early was necessary to pin down the space.  </P> <P> While agreeing that the office-space "market was a lot tighter" when the lease  was negotiated and signed last year, an official of the General Services  Administration, the agency that manages real estate for the federal government,  said it is far from ordinary for a building to remain vacant that long.  </P> <P> "Where we pay for unoccupied vacant space is the rare, rare exception," said  Paul Chistolini, assistant regional administrator for real estate and  development in GSA's national capital region.  </P> <P> Officials said the GSA has wanted to accelerate "the building-out," or final  touches on the structures so the drug agency could speed up its move to cut the  time the buildings stand vacant.  </P> <P> But Donald P. Quinn, DEA's assistant administrator for operations support, said  that even if the agency had done so, it still would have had to pay rent  through November on its downtown Washington headquarters. That could have been  avoided only if the GSA had found another government tenant for the space.  </P> <P> The situation is "something over which DEA has no control," Quinn said, citing  "one horror story" where a government-leased building stood vacant for three  years.  </P> <P> Chistolini said there was a 1984 incident in which a government-leased building  in Hyattsville, Md., remained empty for up to three years because a tenant  moved out and GSA was unable to find a replacement.  </P> <P> DEA officials do not dispute that the multimillion-dollar expenditure is  pinching the agency's operations.  </P> <P> "It's something you have to absorb within the budget," Quinn said, citing  cutbacks in headquarters expenses and travel, the deferral of equipment  purchases and tighter procedures for using rental cars.  </P> <P> Also, some West Coast DEA agents, insisting on anonymity, said that cutbacks  instituted last October have limited money for informants, training of local  police and purchases of evidence-related material.  </P> <P> However, Quinn and Thomas C. Kelly, DEA's deputy administrator, maintained that  the office space outlay -- equal to less than 1% of DEA's fiscal 1989  appropriation of $534.5 million -- has had no impact on investigations that the  agency conducts.  </P></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: Fiat plans new car in S America FIAT'S subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina are planning a cross-border venture to build a replacement for its Uno compact model, currently made in both countries. Mr Franco Macri, whose Argentine company Sevel builds Fiats and Peugeots under licence, said planning was still at a very early stage. However, the new project already figured in Fiat's L40bn (Pounds 16m) long-term investment planning up to the year 2000. Fiat owns its Brazilian subsidiary outright, but only 15 per cent of Sevel. Production will maximise available industrial capacity in Argentina and Brazil. The two companies will buy components from suppliers on both sides of the frontier, and to a lesser extent from elsewhere. As well as selling in Brazil and Argentina, the car would be exported to Italy and other markets. Both countries' car industries have developed strong trade links in recent years. Sevel already swaps vehicles, motors and gearboxes with Brazil and its parent company's factories in the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices at sales this week continued the rise which has characterised the 1994/95 selling season, with auctions resumed in all primary markets during the past five weeks. There has also been good demand for Australian stockpile wool, with disposals far exceeding the present monthly fixed schedule. Buying interest stretches well forward, with inroads now being made into the months from January onwards when stockpile sales will be twice the present rate. The rising wool price trend is also bringing out steady business in wool textile semi-manufactures, though there is considerable price resistance and raw wool markets are showing more buoyancy than applies further down the manufacturing line. The Australian Eastern states market indicator ended the week at 739c/kg, compared with 728c/kg a week before.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Applied Holographics cuts losses Applied Holographics, the USM-quoted producer of holographic products for security and packaging uses, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 276,395 for the year to the end of March. The result, which compared with losses of Pounds 2.26m last time, came on turnover ahead to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 4.96m) despite a fall to Pounds 700,066 (Pounds 1.37m) in hot stamping foil sales following a deal agreed a year ago to sell the business to Whiley Foils. Gross margins were affected by the slower than expected transfer of production to Whiley. Losses per share were 1.3p (losses of 11.2p). The company's deficit now stands at Pounds 17.5m. Floated 10 years ago, the company has never made a full year profit. However, directors were confident about current year prospects against a background of 48 per cent and 47 per cent growth respectively in sales in the security and packaging product ranges and the completion of restructuring to focus on the core business. Mr David Mahony, chairman, said shareholders, mainly large institutions, had been 'very patient'. 'They have understood what the company was trying to do and have seen it through. They see the potential there,' he added. Three investment trusts, new investors in the company, had taken up a placing of 997,620 new ordinary shares, raising Pounds 800,000 for investment in production equipment. Operating losses were Pounds 219,014 (Pounds 1.39m).</p>

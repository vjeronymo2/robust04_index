			<p>BFN     [Text] Maseru April 8 SAPA -- There is no guarantee a  crisis will not erupt again in the Lesotho Army unless the  causes are addressed, according to a report by the presidents of  Zimbabwe and Botswana on their peacekeeping mission to Lesotho  in February. Mr Robert Mugabe and Sir Ketumile Masire visited  Lesotho at the request of Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief  Emeka Anyaoku after a Lesotho Army mutiny in January.    Their report said that after the government's initial  unsuccessful efforts in 1993 at reconciling its differences with  the army, the main opposition Basotho National Party [BNP] and  other political parties, it appeared to have taken no further  action.    At the end of 1993 there had been little or no dialogue  between the government and other political groups, said the  report.    The Basotholand Congress Party, which won elections in April  last year, found itself in contradiction with a civil service  and an army that had been recruited and trained to serve a BNP  government. Personnel of the two institutions were partisan and  ill prepared to serve a BCP government.    The army mutiny arose from a demand for a 100 per cent  salary  increase, which the government felt was a "smoke-screen hiding  the real intention of overthrowing the government of Prime  Minister Ntsu Mokhehle".    The report said the government should have taken  counter-measures against the mutiny earlier. It said there had  been signs in November of an impending mutiny, when young  officers began disobeying their commanders and senior officers.    The Mugabe-Masire report said the monarchy in Lesotho should  reign rather than rule. There was much uncertainty and a marked  degree of unhappiness and suspicion on the part of the Basotho  people with regard to the monarchy, the report said. It  suggested amendments to the constitution.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The first MP coming from  Estonia's Russian-speaking community, Social Democratic Party's  Sergey Zonov, will start work in the Estonian State Assembly  (parliament) Wednesday [23 March].    Zonov replaces Ardo Ojasalu, who was appointed the head of  the country's Tax Department and has to step down as MP, as the  next candidate on ticket of the 1992 parliamentary elections.    Zonov in today's interview with BNS said he was going to aim  his activity in the parliament toward the adoption of  legislative acts that would contribute to integration of  Russian-speakers into Estonia's life and to equal rights in the  society.    In Zonov's words the population in Estonia could be viewed  as  divided into five categories: legal citizens of Estonia, those  applying for Estonian citizenship, those applying for the  citizenship of some other country, citizens of other countries,  and those who have to make up their minds yet. Zotov says the  country's stability will depend on what will be the official  policy toward the last of these five categories.    He said it was essential for Estonia that as many as  possible  of those still making up their minds would choose to apply for  Estonian citizenship. In order to achieve this, it is  necessary, beside other things, to better inform people about  the application rules, work out a national language learning  program, and abstain from extremist statements in politics.  Apart from this, many problems of legislative and bureaucratic  character need to be resolved, he added.    "It is also important that Russia withdrew its military  units  from Estonia, because this is a problem over which particularly  active speculation is going on. It may be that upon the final  withdrawal other issues for speculation will be found, but  currently this is the main one," Zonov said in the interview.    He said he was going to use the "good team" that his Social  Democratic Party and the Moderate coalition, part of which the  Social Democrats are, have in the parliament. He said also his  own good personal contacts with Estonian politicians were a  factor that would positively contribute to his work.    "I have people whom I know well practically in all factions  of the parliament," Zonov said, adding that these contacts had  been established during his work at the Estonian Popular Front  and the Council of Estonian Citizens.    Zonov told BNS that he was ready to work closely with the  organizations of Estonia's Russian-speakers, but was not going  to allow himself to become their tool in the parliament or  enforce ideas that are contradicting his own.</p>

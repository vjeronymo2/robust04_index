			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Japanese Mayor announces resignation A Japanese regional mayor arrested for alleged bribe-taking, Mr Toru Ishii, yesterday announced his resignation, as public prosecutors continued to question him about links to four leading construction companies, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Prosecutors arrested Mr Ishii on Tuesday after allegedly uncovering evidence that he accepted Y100m (Pounds 627,000) from the companies in the expectation that they would be awarded public works contracts. Executives from the four companies have been arrested, but say the money was not intended as a bribe. In announcing the resignation, officials in Sendai, where the mayor has ruled since 1984, said Mr Ishii had decided to resign to ensure stable government and 'avoid political confusion'. He was sponsored by the ruling Liberal Democratic party and some opposition parties. The case has cast a shadow over a general election to be held on July 18, and made some companies reluctant to donate funds to the LDP, though the Keidanren, the federation of business associations, yesterday said that it would again back the party. Meanwhile, the Shinseito, or Japan Renewal Party, formed by a rebel LDP faction, yesterday 'deeply' apologised for past links to that party and for the role that its members played in 'maintaining a system of one-party rule'.</p>

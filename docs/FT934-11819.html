			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Pinter plays the memory game - Theatre Part of what makes Harold Pinter's plays so striking, and so strange, is the large degree to which they are poetic. His economy, his ambiguities, his fragmentations all, it seems to me, come from a poetic impulse. And the meanings that his plays so mysteriously lodge in your mind operate upon you like meanings in poetry - modernist poetry in particular. The prose his characters speak, though never fancy, feels much closer to true poetry than most of the verse drama written this century. In Old Times (1971), three characters begin by recollecting the past that first brought them together. But Kate and Deeley (who may or may not be married) and Anna (who once lived with Kate) never all shared the same past. They are three sides who only now become aware that they form a triangle. Deeley and Anna use memories as if competing for Kate, staking rival claims in her past; whereas Kate, more gradually, comes to recall the past by way of declaring her independence from them. Sometimes the 'present' time seems to jump forward an hour or so, or 20 years back. Simple words, like 'gaze' and 'float', keep gathering in force. Old songs, too. Meanwhile the meanings of the play multiply and multiply. Not only are Deeley and Anna competing for Kate, but Anna is the past, competing against Deeley the present. Female bonding competes with male-female bonding. There is also a sense not only that Anna will always know sides of Kate unknown to Deeley, but also that Deeley's most sincere original feeling was for a man he never knew - his now absurd obsession / identification with the actor Robert Newton. A wonderful play: funny, poignant, troubling. This Birmingham Rep revival shows that its meanings have also increased in the light of Pinter's later work. Bill Alexander does marvels in making the play's intimacies project into the lengths and depths of this tricky theatre. Ruari Murchison's large, sparse, circular set solves the problems of scale with elegance and amplitude. As in so many roles, Tim Pigott-Smith comes across as a naturally insensitive type, out of his depth, with an interestingly loutish potential for helpless violence. As usual, he slightly overdoes every inflection, while nonetheless getting the general plan of the character vividly right. Carol Royle's Kate however, is too preoccupied with her own lovely exterior, while too drab in utterance. As Anna, Estelle Kohler is beautifully alert to every nuance in the script. Even the more actressy features of her style all serve to reveal the play. Kohler also sings very well. Deeley and Anna quote several old songs; Alexander is surely wrong here in omitting the specified chunks of 'Smoke gets in your eyes' - the most telling of them all ('Something deep inside/ Cannot be denied'). But the way they sing the last stanza of 'They Can't Take That Away from Me' - just as Pinter directs, - is superb. They are still in competition, and yet Kate, the object of their competition, eludes them. When Pigott-Smith hurriedly half-speaks ' - No, no, they can't take that away from me', his words have new intimations of feeble despair. Old Times is at Birmingham Rep until Nov 20. 021-236-4455</p>

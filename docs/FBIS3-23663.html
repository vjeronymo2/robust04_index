Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, the  commander of joint peacekeeping forces, communicated to  reporters that the situation may grow worse after 15 March.    According to information from the general, antigovernment  formations armed with Stingers, mortars and heavy artillery are  beginning to concentrate on the Afghan coast.    The frontier regions of Shayertuz, Kumsangir and especially  Pyandzh, where according to some data the main forces of the  Tajik opposition are concentrated, are evoking serious concern.    The situation in Kurgan-Tyube is becoming explosive. A year  and a half ago it was here that the civil war in the republic  began, claiming the lives of tens of thousands of inhabitants.  Local armed confrontations between uncontrollable groupings that  had formerly comprised the Popular Front are ongoing there.  General Pyankov feels that "any provocation from either side  could lead to slaughter."    The situation in Tajikistan also depends directly on  development of events on the Afghan coast. The possibility is  not excluded that Afghan General Rashid Dustum, who is an ally  of Prime Minister Khekmatiar in the war against Kabul, may add  to the troubles of Russian servicemen. Most likely Dustum will  begin pushing the detachments of the opposition across the  border to the Tajik side. As for whether this prediction is  correct, time will tell. But it mustn't be forgotten that the  radical faction of the Tajik opposition is supported by the  Afghan prime minister.    On the other hand, Western observers in Tajikistan are not  prone to exaggerating the scale of the danger from without. They  feel that the positions of the powers that be may be seriously  undermined by internal political instability.    In the meantime, Russian forces in Tajikistan continue  suffering losses. A 30-year old private serving under contract  was shot point blank with an automatic round from a passing  Zhiguli at a checkpoint of the Kurgan-Tyube regiment.    The term of the mandate of peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan  expires on 15 April. Tajik authorities intend to ask the heads  of the Central Asian States and Russian to lengthen the term of  their stay another half-year. Boris Pyankov has no faith in  contacts with the Tajik armed opposition. The consent given in  principle by the opposition to negotiations with the authorities  in Dushanbe appears to be nothing more than a political gesture,  which would hardly remain viable in the evolving situation. The  Tajik opposition is heterogeneous. And most likely, Russian  First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Adamishin was  able to attract only its moderate faction.    The positions of the sides are so far apart that it is hard  to count on any compromise between them.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: US pensions hit by shift in Treasury market - Corporate efforts to tackle the 'double whammy' caused by falling long bond yields For many US companies, the retreat in the Treasury bond market of the past six weeks has not gone far enough. Even after a one-half percentage point rise since mid-October, long-term bond yields are still a point lower than at the start of the year. One result: a massive addition to corporate pension fund liabilities, and pressure on many companies to raise cash contributions to their funds before the end of the year. Long-term bond yields matter because they are one of the most important elements in the equation used to assess the scale of a pension fund's liabilities. They provide the discount rates used to calculate the present value of a fund's liabilities: future payments the fund is expected to make are discounted back to their current value. The lower the discount rate, the higher the present value. According to the Department of Labor, a one point fall in the discount rate will add 10 per cent to the liabilities of a typical pension fund. On that assumption, the liabilities of private sector US funds have jumped Dollars 75bn since the end of last year. Falling bond yields have a second harmful effect. They reduce the expected long-term investment returns on pension plan assets, further undermining the finances of some funds. This double whammy is only partially offset by companies' lowering of their assumptions of future wage increases: this has the effect of lowering the liabilities of defined benefits schemes, in which pension benefits are based on salaries. General Motors may have hogged the headlines in recent weeks with its gargantuan pension fund deficit, but the reported earnings and shareholders funds of many US companies will suffer this year as a result of falling bond yields. GM, though, remains way out in front. By its own estimate, its deficit at the end of this year will reach Dollars 24bn, towering over other underfunded pension plans. Chairman Mr John Smith said steps announced last month marked the company's plans to bring its deficit down quickly, but it still has a long way to go. Two factors have made lower bond yields of particular concern to many US companies this year. First, the assumptions used when calculating pension liabilities are being policed actively for the first time. The SEC has warnedmany companies which used a high discount rate last year to use a rate reflecting current market yields. In the past, companies have picked their own discount rates, making it possible to smooth the effect of interest rate movements. A survey of 350 clients by Towers Perrin, a benefits consultancy, found rates ranging from 5.5 to 10 per cent at the end of last year. That latitude is about to go. In a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board at the end of September, the SEC said discount rates should reflect the yields on bonds rated double-A or better 'at the next measurement date'. One effect of this approach will be to make the scale of pension fund liabilities more volatile in years to come. GM, with a discount rate of 8.6 per cent for its US funds at the end of last year, remains higher than many. It has already brought the rate down faster than market rates, though: between end-1990 and end-1992, while long-term bond yields fell around 0.8 percentage points to 7.3 per cent, GM's discount rate fell by 1.5 percentage points. According to Goldman Sachs, 45 companies in the S&amp;P 500 had discount rates higher than 9 per cent at the end of 1992. Some of the companies with the biggest deficits were close to this level, though not actually above it: Westinghouse (9 per cent), Exxon (8.5 per cent), Chrysler (8.38 per cent) and Ford (8 per cent). The second factor making lower bond yields of particular concern this year is the planned legislation which would force companies to cut their deficits more quickly. Backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the new law would refine a formula introduced in 1987 which failed to force companies to make greater efforts to fund their deficits. It would also remove the ceiling on contributions to the PBGC, forcing the companies with the biggest deficits to pay more of the agency's costs. Companies' reactions to these developments have been modest so far. In part, this is because the scale of their pension fund commitments will not be known until the end of the year. With the bond market swinging so sharply, there is still time for the picture to change before the year-end. 'Everybody's attitude at the moment is to ask what everybody else is doing,' says Jerry Spiegel, a vice-president at Towers Perrin. 'People are running tests on what would happen if they had to use a discount rate of 7 or 7.5 per cent, but they haven't done anything yet.' To reduce the cash impact of higher contributions, many companies are exploring ways of injecting other assets into their pension plans. Handing over shares in the parent has been a favoured route, though the Department of Labour applies restrictions to the proportion of the sponsoring company's shares that can be used to meet pension obligations. GM is currently seeking regulatory approval, and freedom from excise duty, for a proposal to hand Dollars 5.7bn of stock into its pension plan. It is not alone. Tenneco has received preliminary approval from the Department of Labor to transfer Dollars 150m of shares it owns in Cummins into its pension plan. One of only six companies listed by the PBGC as having a funding ratio below 50 per cent, Tenneco had a pension deficit of Dollars 249m at end-1992. Other solutions being explored include transfering properties to meet pension fund liabilities and merging underfunded plans with more robust ones, says Mr David Walker, chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' employee benefits committee.</p>

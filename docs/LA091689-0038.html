			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY TEAMS AT CSUN WILL RUN DEEP  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge cross-country Coach Don Strametz describes this year's  Matador squad -- both men's and women's teams -- as his deepest in several  years.  </P> <P> But don't expect either team to be at its best when the season opens with the  Fresno Invitational at Woodward Park this morning.  </P> <P> Strametz said that because he worked his team hard throughout the week, his  expectations would not be high. "I usually don't run them too hard on a  Thursday before a meet," Strametz said, "but I did today."  </P> <P> Northridge will send an 11-man and eight-woman contingent to Fresno as Strametz  attempts to pick the seven runners from each squad who will run in next week's  Aztec Invitational in San Diego.  </P> <P> "Based on workouts, there are seven or eight guys who could be our top man  right now," Strametz said. "It seems like every day in workouts, somebody  different stands out."  </P> <P> Juniors Jorge Castro, an NCAA Division II All-American in 1987, and Derik Vett  are the veterans on a young team that has no seniors competing for the top  position.  </P> <P> Sasha Vujic, the school freshman record-holder in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters,  and Jeff Gilkey are the leading sophomores, and Erick McBride and Jorge  Rodriguez are highly regarded freshmen. Gerardo Vaca, a redshirt freshman, has  shown promise.  </P> <P> Darcy Arreola is Northridge's top women's runner, but the NCAA Division II  All-American will not race until the Riverside Invitational in two weeks.  </P> <P> Sophomores Kelly Tremmell and Megan Warner and freshman Laura Doering are  expected to compete for the Lady Matadors' top position in Arreola's absence.  </P> <P> Senior Gena Jauregui, who placed sixth in the Division II 1,500 meter  championships last spring, has been ill much of the week and is questionable  for today's meet.  </P> <P> The men's 10,000-meter race will start at 9 a.m. and the women's 5,000 will  begin at 10.  </P></p>

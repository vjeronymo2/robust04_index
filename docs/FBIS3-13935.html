			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Peace Through Deeds," the  newspaper TISHRIN writes: Time should not be wasted now that  Shim'on Peres has stated that Israel is interested in activating  the talks with Syria as a means of achieving a comprehensive  settlement with the Arabs, and now that Yitzhaq Rabin has stated  that it is time to hold serious negotiations and make painful  decisions.    TISHRIN adds: The questions insistently posed by observers  is: Has Israel learned any lessons from the terrible Hebron  massacre? Has Israel actually abandoned the policy of trickery  and procrastination, which it has pursued since the Madrid  conference, in order to join serious negotiations in search of a  lasting and firm peace?    TISHRIN continues: So far, there has been nothing tangible  to suggest a real change in the Israeli position on the peace  process with Syria and other Arab parties. Israeli officials  were content to give hints, which are shrouded in ambiguity and  obscurity, at a time when Syria is talking clearly about full  peace.    The paper stresses that full [Israeli] withdrawal is a basic  condition for promoting the peace process and achieving a  substantive breakthrough. The whole world knows that Syria  cannot sell out a single inch of the Golan and that full Israeli  withdrawal from these Syrian territories cannot be bargained  over.    TISHRIN cautions that further Israeli trickery at the  Washington talks will only waste both time and a rare  opportunity to achieve a just, comprehensive, and firm peace in  the region. The paper emphasizes that when Syria talks about  the Golan it looks forward to achieving full Israeli withdrawal  from all occupied territories. The paper urges the international  community to assume its responsibility, confront Israel's  aggressive character, and champion the international principles  and charters.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: It is deeds, and not words, that  count. Statements by Israeli officials are not significant  unless they are translated to realities on the ground; that is,  full Israeli withdrawal, recognition of Arab rights, compliance  with the UN Security Council resolutions, and commitment to the  principle of returning the territories.</p>

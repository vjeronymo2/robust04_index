			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Chinese company threatens counterclaim over Lehman's practices China National Metals &amp; Minerals Import and Export Corporation (Minmetals), one of the three Chinese trading companies being sued by US investment bank Lehman Brothers over alleged unpaid debts, is threatening to sue the bank over alleged improper and unfair business practices. Mr Cao Yongfang, president of company subsidiary Minmetals International Non-Ferrous Metals Trading, said: 'We have instructed our attorneys to investigate all aspects of Lehman's dealings with our companies in order to pursue counterclaims based upon what we believe were Lehman Brothers' improper and unfair marketing, trading and investment advisory services.' Lehman last month launched a suit in New York against Minmetals, China United Petroleum Chemicals (Unipec) and China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export (CNM) for allegedly failing to pay nearly Dollars 100m (Pounds 61m) in debts arising from foreign exchange and swaps trading. Minmetals' counterclaims could top by 'tens of millions' of dollars the Dollars 52.5m, plus interest, which Lehman claims the company owes it, according to Minmetals' lawyers. Lehman yesterday dismissed the allegations as 'absolutely ridiculous and untrue. Just how ridiculous will become clear as the lawsuit unfolds.' Turning the tables on a case which some bankers saw as a hardening of attitude by western financiers over unpaid Chinese debts, Minmetals' lawyers claim Lehman 'lured a young and inexperienced employee' into making trades which he was not authorised to conduct. Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, the US-based law firm acting for Minmetals, claims this single employee  - who was 31 when he first started conducting foreign exchange trades through an offshore bank account set up at Lehman Brothers  - was granted a higher trading limit than that accorded to the Bank of China. In spite of his youth and inexperience, however, Minmetals Non-Ferrous entrusted the employee concerned with sole responsibility for conducting authorised physical and futures trades of various metals out of London on its behalf. Mr Franklin Chu, the partner in charge of Kaye Scholer's Asia practice based in Hong Kong, compared Lehman's business practices unfavourably with those of Bankers Trust, the US bank facing two lawsuits over derivatives sold to Gibson Greetings, a US greetings card company, and Procter &amp; Gamble multinational consumer goods company. Minmetals Non-Ferrous foreign exchange trades, Kaye, Scholer say, were conducted over two years. Permission to carry out such trades had already been refused by Minmetals Non-Ferrous's president but, Mr Chu says, the first trade was designed to overcome this obstacle. As time went on, the lawyers allege, Lehman 'lured this young employee with progressively more inappropriate trades'. A Lehman executive yesterday claimed senior executives at Minmetals were fully aware of the trading that was going on. Last year, the executive added, the same trader had made a profit of Dollars 29m from the same strategy.</p>

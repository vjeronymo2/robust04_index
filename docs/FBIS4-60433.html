			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "'Ali Nasir Rejects the New </F> State in the South and Urges Cancellation of the Secession and  Resumption of Dialogue"]    [Excerpts] Damascus -- 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former south  Yemeni president, has confirmed the statement made by 'Abdallah  Ahmad Ghanim, the Yemeni justice minister in the Sanaa  government, to the effect that 'Ali Salim al-Bid had telephoned  'Ali Nasir Muhammad, who lives in Damascus, and offered him the  post of vice president in the Democratic Republic of Yemen which  was declared three days ago, on the basis that al-Bid would  resign six months later and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad would become  head of state.    President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that he  rejected the offer which he saw as tantamount to partition of  Yemen which would be "a crime against unity." He added: "They  tried to persuade me by all means in three contacts. I told  them that I could not accept." He said that "'Ali Salim al-Bid  offered to send today -- that is immediately -- a special plane  to take me to him in Hadramaut. I refused and told him that I  was prepared to return on certain conditions. The first was  restoration of unity. And I said that I would be willing to  work for a cease-fire and a return to dialogue and prevent the  country's destruction. I asked him to postpone everything for  48 hours, not to make any decisions, and revoke south Yemen's  secession decision and return to dialogue and a cease-fire, and  said that I would be willing to hold contacts with Sanaa and  Aden to promote dialogue and understanding."    'Ali Nasir Muhammad added: "I rejected al-Bid's offer  because I care about Yemen's unity and because I still maintain  my principled position stated before and after these events,  namely that I am opposed to infighting and secession. I  emphasized in all their contacts with me and my contacts with  them that the Yemeni solution must be within the framework of  the unity state not outside it, that whatever the problems and  mistakes encountered throughout the unity march, they did not  justify secession at all, and that a distinction should be made  between disagreement with the Yemeni president and the cause of  Yemen's unity. Individuals disappear but unity and the people  live on." [passage omitted]    Asked what he thought were the chances of survival for south  Yemen's secession, he said "I can confirm that the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] played a significant part, along with the  other political groups and the General People's Congress [GPC],  in achieving unity, that the YSP derived its strength from its  support for unity, and that abandoning unity now would mean  suicide and would mean the end of the party." [passage omitted]    President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said that he did not know if  the Gulf states or any state had any intention of recognizing  the new south Yemeni state. He said they would have to think  hard before taking such a step.    Commenting on (north) Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's  position on what has happened, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said: "In a  telephone conversation I had with President Salih yesterday, he  assured me that he would never accept the secession which is  considered as high national treason, that there would be no  going back on unity, that he would not accept the secession of  the south as a fait accompli, and that he was prepared to hold a  dialogue with the YSP or with the unionist forces within the YSP  to rescue Yemen and its unity. I, in turn, stressed to him the  need for a dialogue with the unionist forces in the YSP and  asked him to keep the door open for dialogue despite the wounds."    The former Yemeni president also said: "I am now  endeavoring and trying, along with some of the people who  support unity and who are loyal to the Yemeni people, to promote  such a dialogue between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the  YSP. That is what I am working for in my current contacts."    Asked if Arab mediation has been suspended, he said: "There  is no Arab mediation. There is Arab League mediation. Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has, in a  telephone conversation, assured me that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has  left the door open for dialogue with the Arab League and the  Arab states."    On the reports claiming that a number of his supporters  including the newly appointed Defense Minister 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi  Mansur, Social Security Minister Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Batani,  and Colonel al-Khadr al-'Aqil, were killed in a car accident,  giving rise to widespread speculations, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad  said: "That is not true. I contacted them a short while ago  and spoke to them personally and reassured myself about their  health. What was published about them having been killed is not  true. They are alive and well."    The former Yemeni president showed annoyance at the  appointment of Sulayman Nasir Mas'ud, formerly one of his  supporters, as a member of the southern Presidential Council.  He said: "I have nothing to do with that appointment or with  him. I was not consulted. As a matter of principle I reject  the secession and I naturally reject his appointment. It is not  just a question of rejecting the appointment. I reject the  whole idea. He does not represent me and I have nothing to do  with him." [passage omitted]</p>

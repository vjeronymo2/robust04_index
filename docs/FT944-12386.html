			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / MMM shares 'suspended' by Mavrodi: Finance company chief hopes poll victory will ensure immunity from prosecution Mr Sergei Mavrodi, head of the MMM finance company and newly-elected deputy to the Russian state duma (lower house) yesterday moved quickly to escape his obligations to thousands of shareholders who had bought shares in his pyramid selling operation earlier this year - apparently banking on the immunity from prosecution which a deputy's status confers. An announcement from MMM said that the shares issued earlier this year were 'temporarily suspended' from November 1 until January 1. This was interpeted by the crowd of some 3,000 massed outside the company's offices as a declaration of their worthlessness. The announcement said the decision had been taken 'because of the concentration of the shares in the hands of middlemen and speculators'. The MMM chief won his duma seat in a by-election on Sunday for the Moscow suburb of Mytishchi. He did so in part by promising to spend Dollars 10m of his own money on improvements to the town, in part by presenting himself as a victim of government repression at a time when the public view of the authorities is very low. He has also begun to issue new shares with a face value of Rbs1,000, promising that they will reach the level of Rbs125,000 held by the old shares before they crashed in the summer. The collapse followed government statements that MMM was shaky and the arrest of Mr Mavrodi on charges of tax evasion. Though Mr Mavrodi and his entourage have trumpeted his immunity since the results of the election became known on Monday, the authorities are refusing to drop the case which concerns alleged tax evasion by his Invest-Consulting company. Mr Alexander Borisov, a spokesman for the Moscow tax police, said last night that the case concerned an alleged non-payment of Rbs70bn in taxes and that it would be continued. Mr Mavrodi had been supported in the campaign by the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who personally toured the voting stations on Sunday to ensure that the election was fair. In an interview yesterday, Mr Konstantin Borovoi, leader of the Economic Freedom party who came third in the race, said the result showed that 'a new and dangerous factor has appeared in politics - the LDP plus money'. The victory of Mr Mavrodi 'is a sign that some businessmen have begun to help the LDP with their money'. This, he said, was because they had ceased to trust the government and were now looking for an alternative source of power. Mr Borovoi said that he would protest against the result of the by-election on a range of irregularities.</p>

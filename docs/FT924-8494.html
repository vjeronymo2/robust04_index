			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Reformers in Russia stand firm THE Russian government is determined to fight to revive its programme of radical economic reform - and believes it has the full support of President Boris Yeltsin. This would mean a showdown between Mr Yeltsin and the increasingly powerful anti-government forces before the Congress of People's Deputies opens on December 1. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, is working on a short-term crisis programme for the economy, designed to safeguard the faltering reform programme. It is intended to fulfil his promise made last month to tighten monetary policy - in opposition to the interventionist programme being urged on Mr Yeltsin by Civic Union, the powerful centrist bloc. Civic Union's programme, presented to Mr Yeltsin last week together with demands for substantial cabinet changes, calls for price controls - including a freeze on the prices of energy and some basic consumer goods as well as many raw materials - and control of wages and pensions. Mr Yeltsin was said yesterday by cabinet insiders to have rejected making substantial concessions to Civic Union, and had decided instead to support the government's efforts to get the failing economic programme back on track. Any deals with the International Monetary Fund on a standby agreement or with the Paris Club of western banks on a rescheduling of Russia's Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn debt are likely to fall victim to the power struggle. Substantive discussions with the IMF on a standby agreement are not expected to start until next year - though ministers hope to have a standby agreement by April 1993. The government and its policies remain vulnerable, especially to hyperinflation. Internal figures show inflation running at 25 per cent a month and rising. Production continues to fall, and there is as yet no effective control of the extension of credits from the Central Bank. However, pressure from Civic Union and the extreme left and right organised in the National Salvation Front has united cabinet ministers and presidential advisers into an increasingly determined group.</p>

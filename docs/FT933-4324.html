			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Prudential It is a measure of the stock market's distrust of the life insurance sector that yesterday's 10 per cent increase in Prudential's interim dividend barely drew a response. While the immediate prospects for dividend growth turn on cash profits from old business now maturing, the government's demand for full disclosure of commissions threatens to undermine new business prospects. Until the impact of reform is clear, that uncertainty outweighs the promise of a rising dividend. Still, Prudential looks better equipped than most to deal with both disclosure and increased competition from banks and building societies. Disclosure should favour companies with low costs and efficient distribution. The Pru's continuing drive to reorganise its sales force - with the prospect of cost savings of Pounds 100m a year - is thus encouraging. Recent links built with independent financial advisers through sales of the Prudence Bond contribute to a useful diversity of distribution. Prudential also has sufficient scale to look elsewhere if its traditional market remains clouded. The prospects in Asia are exciting, but only for the long term. In the US, Jackson National's annuity products are less attractive in an era of low interest rates, so diversification into other areas makes sense. There is equally a chance that consolidation in UK life insurance will bring opportunities to buy market share. While the high level of gearing remains an obstacle, Mr Mick Newmarch has built sufficient support among investors not to let it pen him in.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The aggression against the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, an internationally recognized country and UN  member, has been going on for as long as 21 months. The  aggression was planned and is being carried out by Serbia and  Montenegro. Their fascists have so far managed to produce  evidence that civil war is now at issue here, a letter sent by  Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Hamdija Hadzihasanovic to the defense  ministers of NATO member-countries said.    All that the international community is doing is delivering  humanitarian aid, which helps us survive--until we are killed by  the aggressor's shells and snipers, though. The belief that the  war can be contained within the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina is  wrong.    We shall never give up. We are numerous enough and we are  determinted to fight to the end. Death is not painful.  Humiliation is painful. To us the word life implies freedom and  justice, the Bosnia-Herzegovina defense minister writes in his  letter.    Milosevic can only be stopped by force. Europe and the world  have this kind of force, Hadzihasanovic writes in his letter to  the the Defense Ministers 16 NATO member-countries, demanding  their help in lifting the embargo on importing arms to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

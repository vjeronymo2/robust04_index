			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for </F> the Civic Renewal Party and the National Renewal Movement, at  ceremony proclaiming his candidacy in Panama City on 16 January]    [Text]  <H5>  1. State and National Governments </H5>   On 8 May 1994, for the first time in more than 25 years,  Panamanians will have the opportunity to vote in elections that  will be free of military leadership or other denigrating  practices.    The future of our nation will be determined, to a great  extent, by the results of those elections. That is why  everyone's participation is so important, and the ceremony that  gathers us here today corroborates this. Our country wants a  change. Our country demands a responsible government that will  make decisions; a government capable of resolving the problems  we are currently facing and capable of seeking solutions that  will make it possible for the Panamanian people to establish  modern and dynamic public institutions in order to strengthen  democracy, create jobs, fight corruption, and eradicate poverty.    The government and people must advance with wisdom, taking  advantage of the historical moment Panama and all of mankind are  currently facing, eradicating indifference, corruption,  skepticism, and the lack of faith in national goals. We must  avoid having to pay the high cost hanging negatively over civic  and moral values, which is absolutely necessary to build a solid  future for Panamanian society. At present there is a dangerous  imbalance in our social life which must be eliminated in order  to timely prevent internal commotions that would only broaden  and deepen the problems that cause them. This means reducing  economic inequality and poverty and at the same time restricting  sinecures, special concessions, and privileges to certain  groups. It also means joining efforts, developing our ideas,  and multiplying our activities to fight unemployment.    As we approach the 21st century, Panama must make very  serious decisions that will lead the country toward the overall  development of its entire potential in order to find once and  for all the path leading to an effective solution of the current  social, economic, and political problems.  <H5>  2. Reaffirmation of Democracy </H5>   Panamanians will not be able to make our democratic  convictions a reality unless we express our firm desire and  determination to establish and offer a good government organized  with order and in accordance with the best techniques and  practices of an efficient public administration. We must leave  behind the selfish practice of distributing political positions  and instead seek the participation and incorporation of the most  capable men and women, youths and adults.    We need a state in which, with everyone's participation, the  government is really and scientifically at the service of the  nation. We need an efficient government that will use state  properties and resources to the country's benefit. It should  adopt firm and timely decisions that should always be  implemented technically and honestly, placing national interests  above any personal or partisan interests.    We need a government that can achieve greater and more  defined cooperation among the government branches, where public  expenditures are made in a more dynamic way, making the best use  of funds and producing enough savings for the public projects  and investments required both in the cities and in rural areas  to create new jobs and to fight poverty.    We need a serious, credible government in which the  Panamanian people can participate and place their confidence  with the certainty they will receive the replies they demand and  need: work, adequate income, education, health, housing,  transportation, security, justice, total freedom, and equal  opportunities regardless of sex. That requires fiscal discipline  and balanced budgets, which are the basis for financial  stability.    Indian groups will have full participation and will be given  priority in government actions, with respect for their  traditions, language, and customs. The implementation and  respect for international agreements and accords signed and  ratified by Panama on the subject of human rights will be a rule  of conduct for the government and its officials.  <H5>  3. Progress and Economic Development </H5>   World changes and technological advance, the globalization  of  economy, and the progress of nations demand that power be  exercised with responsibility and honesty, not only in the  public sector, but in the private sector as well. It is  necessary to promote and encourage -- seriously and based on  reality -- the investment of national and foreign capital, as  well as the consolidation of an informal economy that will  encourage and promote medium, small, and micro enterprises,  which can generate new activities and jobs.    Productivity, efficiency, and producing at maximum capacity  in the various economic sectors are essential factors to support  the country's economic growth and development. The comparative  advantages of our country's geographic position, as well as its  interoceanic region with all the existing infrastructure and the  already or next to be reverted properties demand a capable,  vigorous, strong, honest, and modern government that will take  upon itself the urgent national task of productively,  immediately, intelligently, and thoroughly exploiting all our  advantages to the benefit of Panama and the Panamanians so that  unemployment will no longer be the ghost that lingers over the  homes of hundreds of thousands of compatriots.    A well-sketched plan and permanent actions to reduce  unemployment must be implemented immediately so that the  benefits and economic activities will really reach all national  sectors, giving Panamanians opportunities for a better life.    Each and every one of the economic resources must be used  for  the country and its people's overall development. Therefore, we  believe in the urgent need to break the two Panamas scheme that  the concentration of economic activity in the interoceanic  region has promoted. This is a determining factor in efforts  being conducted to reduce unemployment and the levels of poverty  and will contribute to finding solutions for the other social  problems that also demand attention for the primary sector of  the economy, with emphasis on agriculture and livestock,  ecology, reforestation, and agro-industries. Those sectors must  receive adequate and reasonable protection when justified and  when it can contribute to increasing exports.    The recognition of the enormous foreign public debt the  Panamanian State inherited from previous governments cannot be  evaded. Its payment, however, must be subordinated to the  country's economic and financial conditions so that the service  charges for that debt will not affect Panama's development or  the attention of the Panamanian people's urgent, basic, and  permanent needs. No Panamanian should feel that his social  rights are affected by the payment of the debt.  <H5>  4. Education for Change </H5>   The future of Panama depends more and more on our capacity  to  accept that we are confronting a world that -- without  neglecting the cultural aspect -- is becoming more technical and  scientific. We must emphasize these aspects and update our  science and technology.    Strengthening the education of our children and our youth  with that criteria is the only solid base for creating citizens  that are useful to themselves, their family, their country, and  the world. Our best efforts should be committed to attaining  national education that will offer both students and teachers  all the appropriate instruments that are indispensable for  permanent improvement in the technical, professional,  scientific, and cultural fields.    Actions in the education field should also have the goal of  recovering ethical and moral values, national traditions,  improving the culture of the Panamanian people, and in teaching  new careers, professions, and techniques. The educational  reform should take into consideration the recommendations and  proposals presented by the teachers themselves in a detailed  study they have presented in this respect. Our university  system is becoming increasingly distant from the technological  and scientific realities of today's world, as well as from the  job markets of the present and future. Thus, this all demands a  thorough reorganization of its research, scientific, and  academic work so that it can comply with its true mission and  offer society well-trained personnel, as well as qualified and  capable technicians and scientists that will fully join national  development.    Eradicating illiteracy should go hand in hand with a  permanent educational, technical, and professional improvement  of the entire population. No Panamanian should be deprived of  the right to an education. Public entities such as the IFARHU  [Human Resources Education and Training Institute], Inaforp  [National Institute for Professional Training], and IPHE  [Panamanian Special Rehabilitation Institute] should be  strengthened, expanded, and modernized, offering them and  promoting the effective use of the resources and facilities  necessary for their activities at a national level.    Improvements should be made to the existing educational  centers for training workers, farmers, and technicians, such as  the INA [National Institute of Agriculture] and other  professional training schools such as the Professional and  Technical Institute. The educational efforts set forth by  private enterprise and the church should also be worthy of  permanent recognition and support.  <H5>  5. Women, Children, and Family </H5>   In their eagerness to find jobs, Panamanian families have  gradually separated and children have left school and jeopardize  their lives in search of an income to survive.    Responsible fatherhood can only be achieved through the  individual's full education as a primary cell of the family,  which is the main nucleus of society. Such an education can  only be accomplished where there is an educational system for  that fundamental purpose.    The role of women, as well as their full participation in  all  public and private tasks and duties, should not be  underestimated at any level of government activity. National  codes and laws will be duly corrected so that every form of  discrimination against women will cease. In the area of labor,  particularly, job creation plans must be developed to guarantee  womens' rights and the principle of equal salary for equal labor.    However, what we do for men and women to promote their full  development as citizens will be worth nothing if we fail to  understand that the Panamanians of the future are our children.  It is to them that we will direct our top priorities, ensuring  their education and teaching them through examples and values  what it is to be good citizens who love their country and  universal peace.  <H5>  6. Opening Ourselves to the World for Our Benefit </H5>   Panama should play its role in worldwide society without  neglecting to obtain benefits for the Panamanian people and  meeting their needs and realities. Thus, we must consolidate  and expand our international relations, establish a modern and  pluralist foreign policy and work on improving our services  abroad by, among other things, increasing commercial activities  that will generate jobs in and from the Colon Free Zone in a  serious, orderly, and responsible manner. Panama must also  develop the international oil business and expand port  activities and the transshipment and handling of containers and  products en route to international markets from Panamanian ports  and airports, while supporting the national aeronautical  industry as well as promoting tourism and ecological tourism.    The national government's central and foremost motivation  under my leadership will be the creation of mechanisms that will  foster the permanent creation of new jobs, permanent  contributions from the international economy's upward trend to  the strengthening and broadening of Panama's banking and  financial center, as well as the protection and promotion of  Panamanian stock companies and international merchant marine,  and the creation, among other things, of an international  maritime center.  <H5>  7. A Stable Panama With an Efficient Canal </H5>   Panama must have a properly organized government through  which to play a predominant role in the new international order  that has emerged and is in a permanent process of  transformation, while guaranteeing the administration,  operation, and effective and stable maintenance of the Canal by  Panamanians.    Thus, it is essential for the state's economic and legal  structures to have stable and modern foundations and to be  flexible enough to enter into the accelerated process of  innovation and privatization which from day to day affects every  area of human endeavor and offers new prospects for the creation  of jobs.    Within this context, the new government must be prepared to  redefine Panama's economic and commercial relations with the  United States of America, including among its duties as a  sovereign country the leasing for fixed periods of facilities or  bases in our country, so that we can ensure preferential  treatment for Panamanian products and services in U.S. markets  and thereby increase employment opportunities for Panama's  youths.    The promotion in our country of agricultural, cattle  breeding, maritime, commercial, craft, and industrial activities  as well as the possession of other types of properties,  securities, and wealth, are closely tied to the reconfirmation  and maintenance of our monetary system and our total freedom of  exchange and foreign currency. Therefore, financial and  monetary stability is essential to the economy's development, as  is Panama's inclusion in NAFTA in a way that will guarantee  improved living conditions and jobs for our people and  improvements in the worldwide services offered by Panama and its  interoceanic canal.  <H5>  8. Security and Authority </H5>   The task of eradicating violence, social crime, and all  types  of national or international organized crime -- including drug  trafficking and its addiction -- should rest on a system of  equal administration of justice for all, which will act in  defense of rights and democratic liberties, and which will not  allow any impunity.    The principle of authority within the framework of an  effective modernization of our legislation will be the guarantee  that all citizens will become guards of democracy.    We must solve the problems of coexistence while increasing  improvement of society. We then need to have a better and more  effective cooperation among the branches of public power, as  well as a thorough reorganization and modernization of our  judiciary, police, prison, and fiscal systems so that the  citizen will be a subject and not an object of the same.    The Attorney General's Office, specifically, should be  purged  and reorganized as soon as possible so that it will comply with  its tasks in defense of the citizens. We need officials who  will comply with the law very strictly and who are efficient in  their administrative duties.    The administration of justice, based on equality before the  law, without detriment to public liberties, and based on the  guarantees of due process and inalienable human rights, must not  be tolerant of crime or criminals, and it must eradicate the  practice of criminal impunity.    The Public Force must agree to accept reorganization with  truly civilian goals. All of its personnel must have a civilian  mentality, inspired and guided in an authentic vocation at the  service of society, whose protection and security are its main  purposes.    In an effort to improve the services of security and public  order, it is indispensable to approve a National Police  organizational law and reorganize the Police Academy with a  scientific and civilian mentality, both for the law enforcing  units and the police officers, as well as for the training of  PTJ [Judicial Technical Police] officers, the customs officials,  and other specialized entities.  <H5>  9. A State at the Service of the Citizens </H5>   The Panamanian people are hoping for substantial changes and  every day demand a solution to their main needs. That is why  the government must assume a clear direction so that public  services be truly beneficial for the user, so that we will have  such services as electricity, communications, potable water, and  efficient health and social security services that are reliable,  sufficient, constant, and inexpensive.    Transportation services must be guaranteed in an effective  manner, so that comfort, timeliness, security, and cost will be  the permanent rule. Community services, garbage collection,  streets, highways, sports fields, recreation areas for children  and adults should be basic priorities of the government's work.    A rapid and adequate decentralization of state services that  is accompanied by a strengthening of municipal tasks will  contribute to guaranteeing the citizens' participation in  solving local community problems where the creation of jobs,  education, security, health, public hygiene, sports activities,  environmental protection, reforestation, the protection of the  ecology and renewable resources will also be a task for all.  <H5>  10. Updating the Future </H5>   All Panamanians must actively participate in the  reorganization of state structures and governmental tasks. The  transformations and changes that all Panamanians are hoping for  cannot be delayed any longer, and this obligates all of us to  acquire the commitment of initiating and developing the actions  of a national nature that, within the economic, social,  political, and ethical field will become everyday events that  will allow us to turn the present into a solid base for the  future we want.    The definite eradication of the bad practices and  corruption that have contributed to the disappointment and  frustration of the people, is a task that cannot be delayed any  longer nor does it allow us to remain mere spectators of  international and national events. The hope for change must be  transformed into an instrument of action so that we Panamanians  attain our democratic goals of justice and freedom.    We define the state to be an institution of services and the  government as the entity that renders these services to the  community. In the commitment that we have acquired to offer  Panamanians an opportunity to a better life, we will give  priority to the adequate delivery of the services the state  offers the people. This is not an issue of availability of  funds. This is a problem of complying with the functions and  responsibilities assigned to each entity and government office,  and within them to each and every one of the public servants.    -- If each one does his duty and public services are  rendered  in an efficient, reliable, trustworthy, and prompt manner, we  will begin to alleviate some of the factors that influence  poverty,...    -- If children learn in schools...    -- If the sick are taken care of and healed at the  hospitals,...    -- If transportation improves,...    -- If electricity, water, and telephone services are cheaper  and more efficient,...    -- If the ports and airports work better,...    -- If the entities of culture and sports offer better  services,...    -- If garbage is collected and the streets are cleaned,...    -- If public security is effective,...    -- If the judges enforce the law,...    -- If customs inspectors restrict contraband,...    -- If the PTJ units fight drugs,...    -- If employees receive adequate protection under the labor  law and investors are stimulated to take on risks and thus  create new job opportunities for the youth,...    -- If, in summary, the government fulfills its obligation to  render services, it will be because there is a president who  makes decisions.    This is what I am offering you and what I am planning to be:  A president who will make decisions for the benefit of the  people. We must do that in the first 100 days of the government.    Once the country has surpassed this initial phase of  establishing a government that fulfills its functions and makes  decision, we will have taken firm steps down the paths of  economic growth and social justice. If a government cannot  render the basic services that the people need and for which it  assigns the necessary resources and for which it has the  necessary infrastructure, then this government cannot even try  or engage in more complicated tasks.    This will be a government that knows how to provide the  necessary guidance so that all Panamanians will work hard for  the change we want and for making Panama the fatherland of all,  a government that will achieve the participation of the  community, which is not only necessary but vital for success.    In view of all the various problems we have mentioned, it is  clear that Panama can no longer continue as is. The Panamanian  of today demands a true and urgent change, a profound change in  the structures of the state, in the distribution of wealth, in  the role of public services, in the responsibility of the  politicians, in the allotment of the rights and obligations of  all citizens. It demands participation. The answer to this  uproar cannot wait any longer and it has a name: It is  everyone's plan.    Let us begin this path toward progress, doing first the  simple things, the others will follow immediately. I invite you  all to join efforts and take off so we will reach the superior  states of well-being and progress.</p>

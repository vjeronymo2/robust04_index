			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 28, BNS -- The International Monetary  Fund is concerned about the increasing rate of inflation in  Lithuania, which resulted from the monetary policy carried out  by the Lithuanian central bank, Adalbert Knoebl, head of the  IMF's Baltic Department, said at a press conference in Vilnius  Thursday [27 January].    He said active development of the Lithuanian economy is  unlikely if inflation is not stopped. The fund will try to  persuade the Lithuanian central bank to carry out a tighter  monetary policy, he said.    Knoebl criticized the bank for buying too much hard currency  and exceeding the permissible limit of cash in circulation.  According to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, the  amount of cash in circulation must not rise above 1,100 million  lits by March 31, but 1,266 million are in circulation already.    Knoebl said the fund began consultation with the Lithuanian  Government and the central bank on ways of continuing Lithuanian  economic reforms. Both sides are now working on a long-term  economic policy memorandum for Lithuania. The new memorandum  would cover a period of three years and would come into effect  at the end of this year, he said.    Knoebl said the memorandum should include strict  requirements  that would accelerate Lithuania's transition to a market  economy. The IMF official said Lithuania's primary tasks are to  carry out a number of structural rearrangements, to speed up  privatization, to reform enterprises and to reorganize the  financial sector.    Knoebl said it is extremely important to stabilize the  economy even more, because, in his opinion, the economy started  to recover. The official statistics does not properly reflect  private businesses, he said.    In March, the IMF Board intends to discuss Lithuania's  adherence to the economic policy memorandum. The fund's  mission, led by Knoebl, came to Lithuania to collect information  for a report that will be presented to the IMF Board.</p>

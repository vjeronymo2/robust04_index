			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- With the Central Military  Commission's [CMC] approval, the People's Liberation Army's  [PLA] General Staff, Political, and Logistics Departments  [GSPLD] decided that beginning in 1994, all military units  should launch campaigns to promote advanced companies and  soldiers through competition; that they should facilitate a  lively situation whereby the broad masses of grass-roots units  will emulate, learn from, catch up with, and be helped by the  advanced units so as to forge ahead; and that they should  enhance grass-roots units' development in an effort to  comprehensively raise the army's fighting power.    Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on army  building in a new era and in accordance with CMC Chairman Jiang  Zemin's proposed general requirements that all army units must  be qualified politically and competent militarily, and that they  must have a fine work style, maintain strict discipline and be  assured of adequate logistical support, at the end of 1993, the  GSPLD again amended the "Program of Developing Military  Grass-Roots Units [jun dui ji ceng jian she gang yao 6511 7130  1015 1461 1696 6080 4854 6008]." With CMC approval, the  "program" has been publicized and promulgated in all military  units on a trial basis. The "program" urged the whole army: to  activate the enthusiasm and creativity of officers and men in  grass-roots units and to launch campaigns to promote advanced  companies and soldiers through competition. The activities  should improve and advance the grass-roots units' inspirational  mechanisms and should serve as an important measure for  enhancing grass-roots units' development.    The GSPLD urged: While carrying out the activities, military  units should aim at development, maintain consistency, pay  attention to attaining realistic results, and stress  expeditiously accomplishing tasks and enhancing development in  an all-around manner. The evaluation of advanced companies and  soldiers should be combined with the assessment of their overall  work performance at year-end. When choosing an advanced  company, grass-roots units should conduct self-assessment in  accordance with the requirements on grass-roots units'  development and submit and register their assessments with a  unit at higher level. To be chosen as an outstanding soldier,  service members should aim to become soldiers who have ideals,  moral integrity, good educational backgrounds, and discipline  and should emulate Lei Feng. The outstanding soldier  requirements include: maintain high political and ideological  standards, have outstanding military skills, assert a strict  work style and discipline, and have a good record of  well-accomplished missions. The approving unit will present an  advanced company with a meritorious certificate that has been  uniformly designed by the General Political Department. For an  outstanding soldier, the approving unit will send to his family  a happy-tidings bulletin also uniformly designed by the General  Political Department, and will record the event in his personal  file. The approving unit will publish a circular to commend an  advanced company and will award an outstanding soldier according  to the "Discipline Stipulations [ji lu tiao ling 4764 1774 2742  0109]." When electing squad leaders and special task force  members, promoting soldiers to be cadres, and allotting  candidates for admission examinations to academies and colleges,  military units should consider outstanding soldiers.    The GSPLD urged: The broad masses of officers and men at  grass-roots units should join in the "campaigns that promote  advanced companies and soldiers through competition" so as to  advance the grass-roots units' development to a higher level.</p>

The decision applies to areas where dangerous, ramshackle  houses and crowded old-style alleys account for more than 50  percent of residential space.    Investors will enjoy preferential prices for the lease of  land use rights and the limit for the lease of land use rights  will be 70 years, according to the decision.    Under the decision, an investor may acquire land use rights  after turning over to the government a sum of money. Investors  will have to shoulder relocation fees and other expenses.    The foreign-funded commercial housing will be targeted at  Chinese individuals, enterprises or institutions, the decision  noted.    Investors will have to re-sign the contracts for the lease  of  land use rights if they want to sell the houses abroad, the  decision pointed out.</p>

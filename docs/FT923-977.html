			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Berry pledges fight to clear his name: Inspectors' report into Blue Arrow is published; Judge will be asked to bar former chairman as a company director THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday said that it is to apply to the High Court to have Mr Tony Berry, the former chairman of the Blue Arrow employment services group, disqualified as a company director. Investigators appointed to probe Mr Berry's stewardship of Blue Arrow submitted their report to the DTI in June last year. The report was published yesterday, and says he failed in his fiduciary duty to Blue Arrow and paid insufficient regard to his statutory obligations as a director. The investigation was launched after disclosure of a loan approved by Mr Berry to a company controlled by Mr Peter de Savary, the entrepreneur, involving a property project on Canvey Island, Essex. The circumstances of the loan were not disclosed to Blue Arrow's board or to its shareholders or the Stock Exchange, and only came to light after a question was asked about the deal at an annual general meeting. The investigation covered Mr Berry's stewardship of Blue Arrow with particular reference to the Canvey Island deal. Mr Berry yesterday rejected the conclusions of the DTI report and pledged, if given the opportunity, to clear his name 'for ever' in the courts. He said yesterday: 'I've had 3 1/2 years of hell, and now I have the opportunity to talk, I shall . . . It's been a strain. The only relief is that the DTI report has come out although I didn't expect to have to go on with further aggravation and further expense.' Mr Berry said the report, particularly the criticisms that on a number of occasions he 'deliberately misled' the board of Blue Arrow, was unsupported by evidence. He said: 'I find the whole thing quite extraordinary. There is no finding of fraud, improper action, or financial gain, so why should I have a motive for misleading the board . . . I reject their findings . . . they are going to have a hell of a job to make this stick.' He said the DTI had been forced to make a scapegoat of him under pressure of 'innuendos leaked to the press' and 'people thinking there must be some great scandal'. He said that if there were errors in the way he had conducted his affairs, they were 'small in the context of a whole massive organisation'. The report exonerates Blue Arrow's non-executive directors including Lord Tebbit, the former cabinet minister. 'He at all times acted both responsibly and honourably,' it says. The report also finds that the controversial property deal, which concerned a company headed by Mr Peter de Savary, was 'a genuine commercial transaction' that was offered in good faith to Blue Arrow. Mr Berry said he earned Pounds 400,000 a year as chief executive of Blue Arrow and had received a pay-off of Pounds 1m. He said legal fees involved had cost him Pounds 600,000 so far, and he had put his house in Florida on the market.</p>

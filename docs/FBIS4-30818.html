			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoran Glisovic from Kragujevac] </F>   [Text] In reply to the question they were asked by the  host of today's "Hallmark of Time" program on Kragujevac Radio,  leaders of several parliamentary opposition parties  categorically said that the unification of opposition parties is  out of the question.    Vojislav Seselj said that such a thing is impossible as the  Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] and the Serbian Radical Party  [SRS] have a different approach to the solutions to the national  issue. According to Seselj, [SPO leader] Vuk Draskovic and he  have only met in order to agree on a joint approach against [FRY  Assembly Citizens Chamber Chairman] Radoman Bozovic. In this  connection, Seselj expressed the hope that Slobodan Milosevic  will make a step forward and replace Bozovic and threatened that  if he does not do so, Milosevic himself may be [words  indistinct]. Immediately afterwards, Seselj said that the  Radicals do not like violence, but that they also do not like to  be harassed by others. Considering what he claimed to be a  parliamentary impasse, Seselj said that there is a possibility  of holding elections at the federal level by the end of the year.    The SPO's Milan Komnenic was most direct in his reply to the  question on unification, saying that the SPO and the SRS are not  so much as getting closer to one another and having any joint  approaches, let alone anything else. He added that what was  involved was the SPO proffering protection to a parliamentary  party, in this case the SRS, which was denied a democratic  expression. The fact that the leaders of these parties, until  yesterday fierce opponents, have met, does not have to mean love.    The Democratic Party, as Zoran Djindjic said, does not  support any unification among opposition parties as they all  have different programs. We, for instance, are critical of the  U.S. policy toward Yugoslavia, he pointed out, and some others  flirt with it. As regards the walking out of or boycotting  assembly sessions, the Democratic Party does not accept that  because, Djindjic pointed out, we have not been elected not to  attend assembly debates, but, on the contrary, to fight for our  stands and for changing things to the better.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aldo Ajello has categorically denied allegations  that the government has withdrawn from the CCF [Cease-Fire  Commission]. In its edition yesterday under the title "Is Peace  Already Burning?" IMPARCIAL, widely regarded as a mirror of  Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] positions, reported:  "The government yesterday indefinitely suspended, without any  explanation, its participation in the CCF, in the most serious  incident between the former warring factions since the General  Peace Accord was signed."    "It is a lie," Ajello said, when we contacted him yesterday  morning to learn whether the government had effectively  withdrawn from the CCF. "What happened was this: The government  has requested for the suspension of the meetings of all  commissions scheduled for this week, due to meetings Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front] is holding at present. Nothing  else."    Ajello says that the government's request was made through  Ambassador Francisco Madeira, diplomatic adviser to President  Chissano.    In a telephone interview, Madeira confirmed these reports to  MEDIAFAX. "We only requested the postponement of planned  meetings. We needed time to consider all issues so that we may  hold productive meetings. We shall meet again on 10 June."    The UN special representative confirmed that "the  postponement is not for the whole week, just until the evening  of 9 June. On 10 June there will be a tripartite meeting of the  CCF which will be followed by the regular meeting on 13 June.  The CSC [Supervision and Control Commission] will meet on 14  June."    Ajello commented: "At present nothing is happening that  should be described as alarming."    We asked Francisco Madeira whether there was a serious  obstacle within the government affecting the process of the  demobilization of soldiers.    "Not at all. We are still committed to this process. Ajello  himself has already confirmed the list of 5,000 soldiers which  we have confined, and within a few days the government will once  again present the list of soldiers to be demobilized."    Regarding the differences between the government and CCF  Chairman Colonel Pier Segala, Ajello reiterated what he had  already said: "The government has withdrawn the charges against  Colonel Segala."    In yesterday's edition of NOTICIAS, Lieutenant Colonel  Osorio  Mateus denied Ajello's allegations, saying the government  maintained the charges against Segala. "Deputy Minister Tomas  Salomao, the government's representative in the CSC, has twice  agreed with my proposal for the government to withdraw the  charges."    "And it was on 17 May, not on 27 May," Ajello added,  referring to the relevant date mentioned by Osorio Mateus.    Madeira told MEDIAFAX that, "there has been a  misunderstanding over the whole of this issue."    "Within a few days everything will be clarified."</p>

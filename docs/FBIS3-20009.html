Meanwhile,  most of the credits given to those republics to facilitate their  exports have been used. General Director of Eximbank Ahmet  Ertugrul has disclosed that Turkey agreed to give a total of  $985 million in credit to the eight Turkic republics. Of that  amount, $388.8 million was earmarked for export and $596.2  million for projects. An advance approval was given for the  release of $752.460 million. Letters of credit were opened for  $515.150 million. In short, the Turkic republics have already  used $517 million of the overall credit of $985 million.    Ahmet Ertugrul has said the Turkic republics have used $321  million to facilitate their imports from Turkey and $196 million  to finance their projects.    Contrary to the credits Turkey has given to the Turkic  republics in Turkish lira in the past, the new credits were in  U.S. dollars. Ertugrul has said the Turkish Eximbank had no  difficulty in making funds available for the credits. He also  said the bank acquired $600 million asset with the $200 million  credit the Japanese Eximbank has extended to it and with the  credits it received from the international bond markets some  time ago. He noted that Eximbank has no difficulty in financing  the projects.    Ertugrul also disclosed that Eximbank will use the $200  million credit it has acquired from the Japanese Eximbank to  cofinance the construction of an iron and steel plant in  Kazakahstan. The factory will cost $600 million. Stressing  that a Turkish firm has won a $50 million construction contract,  Ertugrul asserted that Eximbank will finance 80 percent of that  amount ($40 million). He described that as Eximbank's largest  undertaking in cofinancing operations in its history. The  factory will be constructed by a consortium of firms from Japan,  Austria, and Turkey.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Technology: Consultant's Critique - Software at Work Malcolm Newman, the driver behind the project, must be an amazing negotiator  -many people have paid more for a feasibility study than he paid in consultancy charges for his custom system. Unisys still retains the rights to the software and is no doubt looking forward to more sales. This will still benefit Sheffield City Council as it will receive royalties. These sort of deals are becoming increasingly common as software houses recognise the value of getting clients involved in design. Too often, computer systems have been designed by programmers who have no idea of business needs. They implement systems which are elegant in programming terms but offer no value to an end-user. Persuading a real client to co-operate in building the first version of a system is invaluable. It is then relatively easy to implement the system in a way that allows it to be re-used for other customers. One of the paradoxes of computer systems is that things which are relatively easy with manual systems can be difficult for computers. Take the problem of matching a map's edges. Anyone who has used an atlas knows the irritation when the road goes over a page boundary. But the eye can make the join relatively easily. Not so with computer digitisation. If a road goes off the edge of one map that has shrunk, on to one that has stretched, there are many difficulties. Not only does the program have to identify where the join should be, it has to adjust the lines on either side of the join. For a computer system this involves complex mathematics. Overall, I thought this was an exciting case study. The system will produce real benefits for Sheffield residents. It uses some elegant software and shows how the public and private sectors can work together for mutual advantage. I was impressed with Newman. He has a personal touch reminiscent of a successful entrepreneur. He also drives a hard bargain - ask Unisys. The author is a consultant at Software Design and Construction, of Milton Keynes</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Business pays more for lawyers in UK THE UK's top commercial lawyers are the most expensive in the world, charging Dollars 235 an hour more than their counterparts in the US, according to an annual survey of international law firms in the International Financial Law Review 1000. Figures show that the average hourly rate for legal advice from a partner in a top City of London law firm rose 20 per cent over the past 12 months to Dollars 585 an hour. The top rate for a partner in the most expensive Wall Street firms is Dollars 350 an hour and average hourly rates for partners in US firms are Dollars 230. After the UK, Germany has the most expensive law firms, with top commercial lawyers charging Dollars 510 an hour, followed by Switzerland (Dollars 445), Austria (Dollars 385), Japan (Dollars 350) and Hong Kong (Dollars 325). The figures were dismissed yesterday by City lawyers as misleading. Mr Adam Quarry of City-based solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines said the survey was 'not comparing like with like' and was 'a gross oversimplification' of billing practices. Rates quoted were partner rates whereas the true cost to a client of using the firm's services would be a blended average of the hourly rates of the different grades of lawyers who worked on it, he said.</p>

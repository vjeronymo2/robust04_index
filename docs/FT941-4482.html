			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Britain will send 900 extra troops to Bosnia Britain sent the first contingent of an extra 900 soldiers to Bosnia yesterday as part of an international deal that could increase the United Nations peacekeeping force by 7,185. The deal, arranged by Britain in a series of diplomatic meetings in New York, falls short of the 10,000 extra troops requested by General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, to police ceasefires in Sarajevo and central Bosnia. UN troops in Bosnia currently total 13,000. However, British officials said there were 'encouraging signs' that diplomatic efforts led by Sir David Hannay, the British ambassador to the UN, would prompt further offers. In particular, the US is under strong pressure to send ground troops to Macedonia, allowing a Nordic battalion serving there to be transferred to Bosnia. A first group of 90 British soldiers arrived at Split airport in Croatia yesterday on their way to Bosnia. Aides to Mr John Major, prime minister, said the UN had received firm offers of 3,435 extra soldiers from eight countries, including the UK. Several of the deployments are temporary. France will delay the withdrawal of a battalion already serving in Bosnia, and Britain said it would review the deployment of the additional troops after four months. A further 2,430 soldiers are to be redeployed from other parts of former Yugoslavia, increasing the number of extra peacekeeping troops in Bosnia by 5,865. In addition, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, is considering an offer of 1,000 troops from Turkey, a former colonial powers in the region. British officials said Bosnian Moslems and Croats had approved the deployment of Turkish troops, who could play 'a valuable role' if they were stationed 'well away from the Serbs'. Mr Boutros Ghali was believed to be waiting for confirmation from the Swedish and Argentine governments of a further 320 additional troops. The deal will increase the number of British troops in Bosnia to 3,350, the second largest national contribution after France. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, told the Commons that the deployment of further British troops 'would help to make the difference between success and failure for the ceasefires.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Britain was unwilling 'to get involved year after year, but at the moment it is quite clear that extra is needed to implement the ceasefire'. However, the decision was approved against a background of deep divisions among Conservative MPs about what amounts to a reversal of British policy.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Hindu leaders face mosque charges INDIA'S Central Bureau of Investigation yesterday filed charges against leaders of the Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), accusing them of instigating the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya last December. The charges against Mr Lal Krishna Advani, BJP leader, and nearly 40 others were filed in a special magistrate's court at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is located. They come just weeks before regional elections are held in four Indian states. The elected BJP governments of these states - Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh - were dismissed in the aftermath of the Ayodhya incident, when nearly 2,000 people lost their lives in religious riots across the country. The bureau said yesterday the Hindu party leaders had been charged with offences including criminal conspiracy, intentional destruction and defiling of a place of worship, criminal trespass, and intimidation of public servants. The defendants 'participated in this conspiracy, or were instrumental. . .in this conspiracy which resulted in the demolition of the disputed structure'. The BJP said the charges were 'a desperate move by a desperate government to stall the BJP's growing popularity'.</p>

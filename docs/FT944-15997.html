			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / International Company News: Surge at Texas Instruments Strong growth in semiconductor sales helped US electronics group Texas Instruments to a 27 per cent rise in net income in the third quarter, to Dollars 186m. Sales were up 19 per cent to Dollars 2.57bn. TI attributed a 27 per cent sales rise and strong profits growth in its components division to improved results in semiconductors and strength in electrical controls. However, sales and profits in defence electronics were flat. It expects defence profits in the fourth quarter to be lower than last year. Earnings per share were up 26 per cent at Dollars 1.54. The dividend was raised 39 per cent to Dollars 0.25. The shares rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 67 3/4 before the close. AST Research, the world's fifth biggest personal computer manufacturer, has issued its second profits warning in just over a month. It said sales in its first quarter would be down 4 per cent, rather than flat as previously estimated, and forecast a net loss of between Dollars 39m and Dollars 40m for the quarter. It said it would shed 10 per cent of its 6,900 workforce and close its factory in Fountain Valley, California.

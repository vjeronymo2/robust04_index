			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Channel 4 attacks complaint ruling Channel 4 last night issued a strong attack on the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. According to Broadcast magazine the commission has ruled that A Tale Of Two Cities, a programme by Mr Duncan Campbell's production company IPTV, was in some respects unfair to Mr Derek Donaldson and that there was unwarranted invasion of his privacy during filming. Mr Campbell had tried to interview Mr Donaldson about claims over his role in the theft of documents from an Edinburgh police station relating to the 'Fettesdgate affair' involving alleged offences by gay lawyers. Channel 4 said last night that Mr Donaldson had beaten up Mr Campbell in a successful attempt to prevent the original transmission of the programme and as a result had been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. It added: 'By treating Donaldson like any other complainant, the BCC has devalued its own procedures.' Mr Donaldson's complaint should not have been heard, it said.</p>

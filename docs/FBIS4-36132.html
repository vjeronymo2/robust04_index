			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with 'Arafat's adviser Dr. Ahmad </F> al-Tibi by Smadar Peri in al-Tibi's home "earlier this week"]    [Text] We should fall from our chairs in astonishment if  in another two years, on the eve of the next Knesset elections,  a new-old name appears in the lists of candidates: Dr. Ahmad  al-Tibi -- an Israeli Arab, a gynecologist, and PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat's Israeli adviser ("sometimes I speak on the phone with  the honorable chairman two or three times a day").    "An interesting place, the Knesset," he wittily said earlier  this week in a bid to mask his plans. "The heads of several  Arab local councils in the Negev and the north called on me and  urged me to found up a new movement."    [Peri] And what did you tell them?    [Al-Tibi] I did not say either yes or no. As far as I am  concerned, you can write "he did not slam the door on them."    [Peri] And what if your friend Hayim Ramon were to run in a  separate list in the Knesset elections and propose you join him?    [Al-Tibi] I appreciate Hayim Ramon very much and he is my  friend, but such a move is not on the agenda. I do not see him  running in a separate list. However, I would definitely like to  be the Hayim Ramon of the Arab sector.    [Peri] Will you run for the Knesset alone?    [Al-Tibi] That is a weighty question which must be given  proper consideration.    I listen to suggestions and hear rumors. Although there is a  serious vacuum in the Arab leadership in Israel, I am presently  busy with other issues. This is a gray and decadent leadership,  an old generation which must be replaced. Some Arab Knesset  members [MK] do not deserve the people's confidence. They have  contributed nothing toward promoting the Arab sector, except for  making minor headlines in local newspapers.    I foresee a change in the next Knesset elections. The Arab  sector wants people with a track record and with influence.  They want young leaders to replace these outdated men. [end  al-Tibi]    In the meantime, he tries very hard to extinguish 'Arafat's  fires. The hot cassette from Johannesburg begat two scandals,  and al-Tibi reacted swiftly. Earlier this week he summoned a  news conference in Haifa to explain to the Israeli people what  the Quraish tribe and the Hudaybah Treaty were all about, and to  emphasize that 'Arafat is not secretly conspiring to violate the  agreement with Israel.    A busy week. When 'Arafat forces the Israeli people to learn  chapters in the history of Islam, his Israeli adviser has to run  back and forth between the newsreels on Qol Yisra'el and IDF  Radio, talk shows on television, and a joint appearance with  Yosi Beilin in the campus of Beersheba University.    Dozens of journalists phone him and get an answering machine  on the other end. 'Arafat's adviser recognizes the voices and  decides when to pick up the phone.    [Peri] How did the idea of appointing you as an adviser come  about?    [Al-Tibi] Nine months ago, me and my wife May (a dentist  from Tulkarm) were invited to Tunis. I was sitting in on an  extended session of the PLO Executive Committee on the eve of  the signing ceremony in Washington. 'Arafat took everybody by  surprise when he announced: Out of appreciation for his  contribution to the Palestinian people, I decided to appoint  Ahmad as a special adviser on all matters pertaining to the  Israeli issue.    [Peri] What does being 'Arafat's adviser mean?    [Al-Tibi] It means not sleeping regular hours, being busy  all day with overt and covert contacts in Israel and abroad,  preparing 'Arafat's meetings with Peres and Rabin, getting a  phone call from 'Arafat at 0620 on the morning of the massacre  in Hebron and hearing him yell: Tell Rabin and Peres that a  horrible massacre is under way in the mosque.    It means that I have to sit in my office and listen to the  grievances and problems of people, although this is not in my  brief. People even come to me with problems such as family feuds  and neighbor disputes.    As far as I am concerned, the main target audience of the  Palestinian leadership are the people in Judaea and Samaria, and  the Israeli public immediately afterward. Let me emphasize: We  must be more understanding of the feelings of the Israeli people.    [Peri] What is the salary of 'Arafat's adviser?    [Al-Tibi] I have not received a cent since the appointment;  neither a salary, nor reimbursement for phone calls and plane  tickets. However, I do not complain. Others have not received  anything either. I have a gynecological practice in East  Jerusalem four-five times a week, and my wife earns a living for  the two of us. According to my calculations, to date I have  spent $52,000. How to put it? 'Arafat owes me.    [Peri] Do you believe you will ever get your money back?    [Al-Tibi] Two months ago I complained to 'Arafat that the  bill was getting bigger and he smiled at me. "Go to Abu-Ahmad,"  he suggested. I smiled back at him.    [Peri] Who is Abu-Ahmad?    [Al-Tibi] He is my father, and he really helps me here and  there. Now that there is an agreement, he is finally pleased  about what I do. [end al-Tibi]    Al-Tibi is not everybody's pet. In Orient House, for  example, he is known as "Ahmad Tizi." Our government ministries  use other nicknames, most of them aimed at 'Arafat. Israeli  Arabs are also quite critical of him, but four times already he  was elected the most popular figure in public opinion polls in  the Arab sector.    He is 36 years old, talented and smart as a whip,  hard-working, sharp, and articulate in two languages. He is  telegenic and relishes a good fight with our extreme right wing.  His relationship with his old friend, MK Dedi Zucker, recently  soured.    On the morning of the signing of the agreement on mutual  recognition between Israel and the PLO in Washington, al-Tibi  snuck into the Mayflower Hotel to the floor in which Rabin and  Peres were staying.    At the last minute, an argument emerged over the  identification of the signatories. Rabin demanded "the  Palestinian delegation." Al-Tibi, speaking for 'Arafat,  announced that if the agreement does not bear the word "PLO"  'Arafat would stay in his hotel and there would be no signing.  Al-Tibi made three shuttle trips between the hotels of the  Israeli and the PLO delegations. When the bargaining was over,  'Arafat had won.    Al-Tibi says that to be 'Arafat's adviser on Israeli affairs  means to be attentive to feelings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and  the settlements; to update 'Arafat about the results of the  Histadrut labor federation elections and their repercussions on  our political map. At the same time, he has the impossible  mission of improving 'Arafat's dismal image in Israel.    [Al-Tibi] I believe 'Arafat must take Israel's  sensitivities toward him into account. After such a bloody  conflict, 'Arafat should have considered Israel's sensitivities,  just as Rabin and other Israelis should be attentive to our side.    [Peri] Do you think 'Arafat's talk about a jihad was right?    [Al-Tibi] Let me put it this way: 'Arafat should have known  that the word jihad has belligerent connotations to the Jewish  ear. We could have done without this sentence.    [Peri] You have not been very successful in improving  'Arafat's image in Israel. Quite the contrary, his image is  deteriorating by the day.    [Al-Tibi] I get the impression that politicians are trying  to thrash 'Arafat left, right, and center in order to score  points with the Israeli public. It is really an Israeli  national sport.    [Peri] Tell us the secret: How did 'Arafat react to Rabin's  and Peres' remarks that they cannot stand the contact of his  hand?    [Al-Tibi] I do not want to say how he reacted, but he  definitely did not jump for joy. [end al-Tibi]    All sorts of patients come to Dr. al-Tibi's clinic on  Salah-al-Din Street in East Jerusalem: Palestinian women,  members of the diplomatic and UN corps, Israeli women from  Jerusalem's Rehavya and Pisgat Ze'ev and even from the  settlements who first met al-Tibi when he worked at Hadassah  Hospital and lived in the Neve Ya'aqov neighborhood. ("I ran  away from there after one year because I could not afford to  replace dozens of slashed tires, and I got fed up of hearing  that I was a dirty Arab.")    Perhaps, the epitome of normalization is taking place in the  gynecological field: young women whose families are identified  with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are being referred  through "discreet channels" to Israeli gynecologists in Tel Aviv  and Petah Tiqva for hymen reconstruction surgery. It seems the  young women only trust Israeli gynecologists to be discreet,  keep their privacy, and see to it that they can marry  respectably.    On the walls of the living room of his rented apartment in  Bayt Hanina hang framed photographs of al-Tibi with 'Arafat,  Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], Faruq Qaddumi, Hakam Bal'awi, and  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. There is also a historic photograph of  'Arafat, al-Tibi, and Nayif Hawatimah, leader of the  rejectionist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.  It was al-Tibi who managed to bring Hawatimah and 'Arafat  together two years ago. They have not met since then, and  Hawatimah keeps firing verbal barbs at 'Arafat.    However, what al-Tibi considers the jewel in his crown, the  real cherry on the cake, is closing a circle of at least 10  years between Weizman ("the president of my state") and 'Arafat  ("the president of my people").    [Al-Tibi] It was a dream that came true after 10 years. I  am personally attached to both men. Weizman attended my wedding  in Ramla, 'Arafat invited me and my wife to Tunis after our  daughter Yara was born.    Weizman is the most prominent Israeli politician who was  ahead of his time. When he talked about what everybody is doing  today he took quite a lot of criticism. I, too, feel that I was  ahead of my time and took quite a few blows. Who else in the  Arab sector can pride himself of sharing a true friendship with  Weizman, Sarid, Yosi Beilin, Hayim Ramon, and Eli Dayan? [end  al-Tibi]    A specific phone call al-Tibi made six years ago from Tunis  to Weizman's home in Caesarea almost led to the expulsion of  Weizman, then a minister without portfolio, from the government.  This week, al-Tibi discloses the full story behind that famous  phone call.    [Al-Tibi] Six years ago, when Secretary of State Baker  presented his five-point plan and the PLO responded with a  categorical "no," I went to Tunis to try and soften the PLO's  No. 2 man, Abu-Iyad [Salah Khalaf].    I met Abu-Iyad and 'Arafat in Hakam Bal'awi's office. A  stormy four-hour argument ensued, during which I insisted that  instead of saying "no" they should say "yes, but." In the end,  together with Sa'id Kamal, the PLO ambassador in Egypt, I  managed to persuade them.    I proposed to fly back to Israel at once and relay the  message to the Labor Party, but Abu-Iyad insisted: "Call  Weizman from here and inform him."    I phoned Caesarea and said what I said. Weizman called Peres  on the other line, and we had a conference call. Abu-Iyad and  'Arafat were sitting and listening, but did not interfere in the  conversation. When then-Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir learned  about it, he hit the ceiling because the PLO's positive answer  pushed him into a political corner. Shamir would have preferred  that the PLO's reply had been negative. To punish me, he banned  me from traveling abroad for two years, while Weizman was  reprimanded by the head of the Shin Bet. [end al-Tibi]    The meeting between Weizman and 'Arafat in Johannesburg,  after the drama 'Arafat caused in Cairo when he refused to sign  the agreement, was rather cold.    [Al-Tibi] I felt good with the two of them, but I had been  expecting a warmer meeting. After all, they knew each other  well and had exchanged political and personal messages.    [Peri] The first meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat was also  very tough.    [Al-Tibi] It is very hard to reach out to Rabin. With Peres  it is easier.    [Peri] What did you want Rabin to think of 'Arafat, after  being informed that 'Arafat was behaving like a man possessed,  stamping his feet, screaming, and throwing a fit?    [Al-Tibi] Those publications left 'Arafat very bitter and  helped him to get acquainted with the intricacies of Israeli  politics and the incumbent officials in the Prime Minister's  Office and the Foreign Ministry. And, believe you me, 'Arafat  does not forget. The fact that he smiles to people does not  mean anything.    [Peri] You probably rushed to inform 'Arafat what Rabin said  two days ago about Netzarim, that "if this is a settlement, I am  a monkey's uncle."    [Al-Tibi] Everything possible must be done to make the life  of the settlers in the Gaza Strip unbearable through nonviolent  means and to cause them to leave of their own free will.    [Peri] What do you mean by "nonviolent means?"    [Al-Tibi] I do not have to elaborate. [end al-Tibi]    Behind his back, people in Orient House say that he will  soon  find himself outside the picture, that 'Arafat will be done  using him and will dump him.    [Al-Tibi] 'Arafat definitely crowns and dethrones people,  but I will know when to step down before they get tired of me.  Although I was offered, I do not see myself as part of the  Palestinian Authority in the territories. I was offered a  Palestinian passport, and I responded with a big smile. I see  my future in al-Tayyibah. Contrary to others, I have a place to  go.    [Peri] Will you retire quietly and dedicate yourself to your  gynecological practice?    [Al-Tibi] I do not know. I have never forsaken Israel's  Arabs, and all I have done to date has been designed to meet the  avowed expectations of Israel's Arab population. At the same  time, I will act in any way I can for the establishment of a  Palestinian state.    [Peri] Do you envision yourself in the Knesset cafeteria in  two years from now?    [Al-Tibi] I have been to the Knesset cafeteria more than  once. The question is whether I will then be a guest or I will  be inviting you as my guest.</p>

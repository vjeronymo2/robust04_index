			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INDICTMENT IN LETTER FORGERY PLEASES FLOYD AND HIS MOTHER  </P> <P> On the eve of the Nov. 4, 1986, general election, Democratic Assemblyman  Richard E. Floyd accompanied his mother, Viola, to her Lawndale post office  box.  </P> <P> To their surprise, she, along with thousands of other voters in his 53rd  District, received a letter purportedly from then-President Reagan, accusing  her son of "caving in to the powerful underworld drug industry."  </P> <P> On Monday -- 27 months later -- the Sacramento County Grand Jury indicted  Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) on one felony count of forgery for his  role in mailing out thousands of the letters.  </P> <P> Floyd, never one to mince words, declared that other Republican assemblymen  should also be indicted.  </P> <P> "The sons of bitches ought to go away for life without possibility of parole,"  Floyd said in an interview Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It was more than a forged letter," the Carson Democrat said. "It was a  first-class mailing the day before the election, full of lies on White House  stationery, with a forgery of the President's signature."  </P> <P> Floyd immediately denounced the letter and called on law enforcement officials  to investigate it and similar but milder "Reagan" letters attacking five other  Democrats. All six were on White House stationery and "signed" by Reagan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Was Embarrassed  </P> <P> Floyd said this week that he pursued the issue partly because his family,  especially his mother, was distressed and embarrassed by the letter.  </P> <P> Viola Floyd, who celebrated her 85th birthday on Election Day 1986, recalled  Wednesday that the letter shocked her.  </P> <P> "I was mad. I knew right well there was something wrong," she said. "I knew  Dick never did such a thing, and I knew the President would never stoop that  low."  </P> <P> After an internal investigation, the White House said the letters were  authorized by neither the President nor any of his aides.  </P> <P> Despite the letter, which arrived at the end of a bruising campaign against  Republican challenger Roger E. Fiola, Floyd was reelected by a margin of 6,189  votes.  </P> <P> A Republican legislative source who asked not to be identified speculated that  one of the reasons Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat, pursued the  investigation was because of public pressure from Floyd, one of the Assembly's  most outspoken and partisan members. If the mailer had targeted a less vocal  Democrat, the source suggested, the controversy might have died down.  </P> <P> Alan Ashby, a Van de Kamp spokesman, denied that assertion, saying the decision  to prosecute Lewis "was based on our review of the evidence. It was not based  on pressure from any public official." But Van de Kamp's announcement of the  indictment acknowledged that "targets of the mailers requested that the  attorney general's office investigate the matter."  </P> <P> Lewis said Tuesday that he will eventually be exonerated and he denounced the  indictment. "Van de Kamp has a long history of winking at Democrat  indiscretions" but "has doggedly pursued this opportunity to go after  Republicans," Lewis said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> GOP lawmakers cited cases in which they claimed Van de Kamp had failed to act  against Democrats, including one in which Floyd was allegedly involved. In a  letter last April, Assemblyman Phillip Wyman (R-Tehachapi) told Van de Kamp  that he had been "the target of unauthorized endorsement letters during the  1984 general election." One of the endorsements was accompanied by a letter  from Floyd criticizing Wyman on a veterans issue.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp referred the issue to Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels. On  Wednesday, Jagels said his office had declined to prosecute because the  three-year statute of limitations had run out.  </P> <P> Floyd denied Wednesday that he did anything improper in the campaign against  Wyman, pointing out that he signed his own letter. "It was from me. I didn't go  around the side door," Floyd said.  </P> <P> During the controversy over the phony Reagan letters, Floyd has kept the issue  alive by reminding voters and lawmakers that he was the target of the strongest  letter purportedly signed by Reagan. In his reelection campaign last fall, he  distributed printed copies of news stories about the letters and warned voters  that Assemblyman Pat Nolan, then Assembly GOP leader, was again trying to oust  him from office.  </P> <P> Floyd said the Reagan letters issue became so highly charged because the  allegations were untrue and because they were deeply felt by his family.  </P> <P> "It was my momma's 85th birthday and it was pretty hard for her to read," he  said. "Then, I had to get in contact with my daughters who live in the  district" and explain the situation to them, he said.  </P> <P> For Viola Floyd, Monday's action by the grand jury marked the end of a bitter  chapter.  </P> <P> "I feel real happy," she said.  </P></p>

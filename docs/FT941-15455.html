			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Costa Rica returns after break of 13 years Costa Rica returns to the international bond market next week after an absence of 13 years. The state telephone and electricity monopoly ICE has scheduled an issue of Dollars 50m of three-year Eurobonds through Banco Santander. The bonds, carrying a semi-annual coupon, are to be issued at a spread of 385 to 410 basis points over US Treasury note rates. They have no explicit state guarantee. ICE is the second central American issuer to tap the Eurobond market since Mexico led the return of Latin American borrowers to the market after the 1980s debt crisis. Last August, the Guatemalan coffee institute Anacafe brought a Dollars 60m 11 per cent issue with a four-year average life to market. ICE - whose assets at the end of September stood at Dollars 2.1bn - will use the funds to refinance foreign currency debt and for investment. Further borrowings by ICE are possible in the next 12 months. The other possible borrower - the government, which hands over power in May following elections on February 6 - has no current plans to tap the market. The issue is expected to benefit from current investor appetite for more exotic issuers carrying generous interest rates. Growth has been strong, and inflation fell last year below 10 per cent, but public foreign debt remains high. The Guatemalan government has begun preliminary discussions over a possible Eurobond borrowing in its own name this year.</p>

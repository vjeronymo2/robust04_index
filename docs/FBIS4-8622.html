			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Borislav Lalic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 15 (TANJUG) -- A U.S. journalist  recently advised President Bill Clinton that, if he is uncertain  about the effects on the United States of the bombing of  Gorazde, he should meet with the Vietnam veterans or, better  still, with the American soldiers who recently returned from  Somalia after the failure of operation Provide Hope.    It is highly unlikely that Clinton will take this advise  although the developments in the war-ravaged ex-Yugoslav  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have reached a critical point.    Everything happening there in the past few weeks is linked  to  the United States. In Bosnia an "American peace" is being  negotiated, U.S. bombs are being dropped and the American war  diplomacy has claimed its first victims.    In Bosnia Washington has become lost in the maze of its own  Balkan policy which it is trying to implement in keeping with  the principles of its own new international order.    Over the past couple of years the Americans changed their  stands on the Yugoslav crisis so many times that now it is hard  to say exactly what they want in Bosnia and how they envisage  the "new Balkans."    Clinton's operation for imposing a peace in Bosnia which is  being separately carried out with the Moslems and Croats, faces  a total defeat. The Gorazde bombs have not only failed to  return the Serbs to the negotiating table, but have rendered  this almost impossible.    Everyone is now asking only one question: What will be  Washington's next move. The answer will depend on whether and  to what extent Clinton is aware that the U.S. involvement in the  Bosnian war could well cause its escalation from the Balkans.  The U.S. President could also apply the already present views  in Washington that the several bombs dropped on Gorazde were  insufficient and that new air strikes are required.    The Europeans hope that the U.S. leaders will finally become  aware that they have been licked in Bosnia and that the  situation there is so serious and complex that it cannot be  resolved by a few bombs, even on condition that they hit the  designated targets and are not duds.    A positive sign that such a more realistic policy could  prevail is the sudden appearence in Bosnia of the co-chairmen of  the international conference on ex-Yugoslavia, Lord David Owen  and Thorwald Stoltenberg.    This could mean that Washington has come to the conclusion  that it will have to ask its European allies to help it pull the  chesnuts out of the Bosnian fire.    The Europeans have much experience in this because they have  also been too hasty and were defeated in Bosnia. In 1993 they  finally concluded that there is only one solution: to divide the  three warring sides in Bosnia in the same way as the  disintegration of their former country -- Yugoslavia.</p>

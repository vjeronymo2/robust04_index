			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN ASKS SOVIET HELP TO BATTLE 'DEVILISH' WEST  </P> <P> The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's leader, said Sunday he wants strong  ties with Moscow to help fight the "devilish" West, and Iranian lawmakers  reportedly agreed to consider breaking ties with Britain.  </P> <P> Khomeini's overtures to the Soviet Union, which he previously condemned for its  atheist ideology, came during a 1 1/2-hour meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> Iran's news agency said it was believed to be the first private meeting between  Iran's 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch and a foreign minister.  </P> <P> In an indication of warming relations, the semiofficial newspaper Tehran Times  quoted an "unidentified source" as saying that "current discussions are under  way on significant arms dealing" between Moscow and Tehran. The newspaper added  that an Iranian military delegation visited Moscow last December as part of a  "joint economic commission" set up in 1988.  </P> <P> Neither Khomeini nor Shevardnadze mentioned arms negotiations in their public  comments.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union had been a major arms supplier to Iraq, Iran's foe in the  eight-year Persian Gulf War.  </P> <P> Khomeini stressed to Shevardnadze the importance of "the expansion of strong  ties in various dimensions in confronting the devilish acts of the West,"  Tehran Radio reported.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze later met with Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi, and the two agreed  to set up mechanisms for "regulating political contacts" between Moscow and  Tehran, Tehran Radio said.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said that Nikolai Konarev, chairman of the Iran-Soviet joint  economic commission, will visit Iran shortly "with significant proposals,"  Iran's news agency reported.  </P> <P> "We hope significant changes will take place in bilateral cooperation in the  political and economic fields as a result of the current atmosphere," he told  Moussavi.  </P> <P> Khomeini used the meeting with Shevardnadze to deliver a short sermon intended  for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, according to the Iranian news  service, the official Islamic Republic News Agency.  </P> <P> Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini expressed dissatisfaction at  Gorbachev's treatment of the spiritual aspects of a message he sent him Jan. 4.  Khomeini called for the Kremlin leader to study Islam and consider it as a  solution to social problems.  </P> <P> "I wanted to open for Mr. Gorbachev a window to a great world -- that is the  world after death, which is the eternal one. That was the main thrust of my  message, and I hope he will try again in this respect," the radio quoted  Khomeini as saying.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze quoted Gorbachev as saying all Soviet leaders have studied  Khomeini's message, which was "full of many ideas."  </P> <P> "Undoubtedly we agree with many major points, but there are points with which  we disagree too," he said.  </P> <P> Tehran Radio quoted Shevardnadze as telling Khomeini: "Our conviction is that  conditions are ripe for relations between our two countries to enter a  qualitatively new stage of cooperation in all fields."  </P> <P> The ayatollah replied: "Of course we want relations to develop, too."  </P> <P> The radio broadcast 22 minutes of the meeting at Khomeini's home in north  Tehran in which Shevardnadze, speaking through an interpreter, relayed a  message from Gorbachev to Khomeini.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Past 'Gross Errors'  </P> <P> Shevardnadze quoted Gorbachev as saying Moscow respects freedom of choice for  nations and, while backing Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, defended the Soviet  system as the right choice for its own people despite "gross errors" in the  past.  </P> <P> Iran's news agency said Shevardnadze did not ask Khomeini to withdraw his order  for Muslim zealots to assassinate British author Salman Rushdie because of his  book "The Satanic Verses." Britain reportedly asked Shevardnadze to press  Khomeini to give a reprieve to Rushdie, whose book has been denounced as  insulting to Islam.  </P> <P> "There was no mention of the affair in Shevardnadze's speech," IRNA said.  </P> <P> The meeting with Shevardnadze came two days after Khomeini declared Iran does  not need relations with the West. This issue has divided the Tehran hierarchy  between so-called pragmatists, who favor more relations with the rest of the  world, and hard-liners, who favor continued isolation.  </P> <P> However, Iran's Cabinet declared Sunday that it is united behind Khomeini,  reported Tehran Television, which also was monitored in Nicosia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Enemies of Islam'  </P> <P> "Your children are united as a single hand against the enemies of Islam," it  quoted a Cabinet statement as saying of the international furor over Rushdie.  </P></p>

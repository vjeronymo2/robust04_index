			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Siemens to buy unit from Texas Instruments SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, is to acquire the industrial controls subsidiary of Texas Instruments, the US computer software company. The German group said the takeover would enhance its automation technology activities, in which it claimed to be one of the world's leaders. Siemens added that the intended purchase would increase its presence in the field of computerised controls in both the US and other world markets. Texas Instruments explained the proposed deal by citing its desire to focus more on computer equipment, software and services. Siemens said the size of the world market for industrial controls was around DM7bn (Dollars 4bn), concentrated mainly in western Europe, the US and Japan. The German company has around 20 per cent of this market, equivalent to a turnover of around DM1.5bn. Among its competitors are Allen-Bradley of the US, Fanuc of Japan and Germany's AEG. The Texas Instruments subsidiary employs 900 people in the US at its Johnson City, Tennessee, plant and 300 elsewhere in the US and abroad. No turnover figure was given, but analysts said revenues of the unit were around Dollars 120m. After the transaction, Siemens will continue to sell both companies' products in parallel. Texas said it is also considering the sale of its process automation business. Neither side would give a price for the deal with Siemens, but Texas said the financial effect would be positive for the US company. Texas Instruments also said that it is evaluating the possible disposal of its Process Automations Systems business which is based in Hunt Valley, Maryland. It said its Custom Manufacturing unit was not part of the sale to Siemens. Siemens' current US operations employ nearly 35,000 people at 60 manufacturing or assembly plants.</p>

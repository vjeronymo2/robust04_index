			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Management: Why actions really do speak louder than words - Christopher Lorenz challenges a new business thesis THE WORLDS of religion and politics are littered with living examples of the dictum that there is nothing more powerful - nor, sometimes, more dangerous  -than the dogma of a convert. In management, the same phenomenon makes far too many executives chase in zig-zag fashion after such either-or dogmas as organisational decentralisation or centralisation, diversity or focus, and employee involvement or control. The self-delusion - and corporate risk-taking - practised by such managerial fashion followers is the target of an ambitious new book, Beyond the Hype*, which has caused quite a stir in the US, especially around its three authors' home base of the Harvard Business School. Its central message is undoubtedly sensible: that persuasive language (or 'rhetoric') plays an under-valued part in management. But the book's impact is diminished by its own degree of dogmatism. That, in turn, flows from the fact that its two main authors, Robert Eccles and Nitin Nohria, are themselves fresh converts from the hype which they now criticise. Two years ago, when most business academics were waxing lyrical about the need for 'new managerial practices for an age of new organisations', Eccles and Nohria wrote a working paper called 'the post-structuralist organisation' on life after bureaucracy. But within five months they began to doubt their case. This was partly because they found less new actual organisational practice than they had expected and partly because they became smitten by rhetorical theory. They concluded that, though the rhetoric of management has changed sharply in recent decades, its actual principles and practice have stayed very much the same. 'Leading-edge companies are not doing anything very different,' they claim. Among today's 'new' management concepts which turn out to have been quite common throughout this century, Eccles and Nohria cite cross-functional collaboration plus the production of quality products and the provision of responsive customer service. 'Who could argue with such advice?' asks the duo. 'When did managers think - let alone say - they were doing otherwise?' Think about the last question for a moment, and you will see Eccles and Nohria sliding off the rails - gently in their assault on the oldness of 'new' principles, but painfully in their suggestion that there is nothing new in 'new' practices. Their assertion that there are few new management concepts may shock ill-informed executives who have gleaned their ideas from airport bookstalls and the more superficial type of business school courses. But well-read managers, gurus and academics will be entirely unsurprised. One of the chief butts of their criticism, Tom Peters, the guru, has always been the first to credit the early progenitors of many of the concepts to which he and others today attach jazzy new names. What Peters and the best of his fellow pundits have done is not just to re-name and regurgitate old concepts, as Eccles and Nohria suggest. Instead, they have made some of them comprehensible to lay people and re-worked others to adapt them to today's context. Thus the concept of corporate 'core competences', popularised in the last couple of years to great effect by C. K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel, may well have been developed from the ideas of more than 30 years ago. But their new formulation has an added twist to it: the notion that a company's competence, however strong, is of little value unless it is so distinctive as to be virtually unique. So much for rhetoric. When it comes to real action the Eccles-Nohria case quite jumps the rails. It is plain wrong to claim that companies have always been as concerned as they are now with quality and customer-responsiveness, let alone with performance-related rewards and social responsibility. Small, leading-edge enterprises, perhaps, plus a few highly-adaptive large ones, such as 3M. But if this were really true for a broad swathe of US companies, they would never have alienated millions of customers by producing so many ill-designed, poor quality cars, air-conditioners and other products in the 1960s and 1970s, leaving a yawning door for the Japanese to push open. Just because ideas similar to today's have been expressed intermittently throughout the century does not mean that they have been practised widely - far from it. The same goes for all the 'human resources' (people) aspects of today's organisational principles and practices. Just because delegation and cross-functional communication - two principles of 'empowered' and 'horizontal' organisations - have been bandied about since the 1920s, it does not mean they have been thick on the ground in reality. What has altered the way executives do their jobs has been the changing practical context within which such principles are now propagated. Terms such as 'delegation' meant one thing to managers within the sort of steeply-hierarchical bureaucracy typical of the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. They mean quite another (and much more) within today's shallow, delayered hierarchies, where instead of having only five people reporting to them, many managers now have 25 or more. In such circumstances, delegated authority and decentralised responsibility really do mean what they say. Which leaves one with the thought that the Eccles-Nohria argument should sometimes be stood on its head. Rather than rhetoric being forever changed to reflect the unaltered 'essence of management', as they put it, language often changes more slowly than the managerial behaviour which it describes.

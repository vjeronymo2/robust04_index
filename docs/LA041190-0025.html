			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COURT MAY RELEASE FUNDS TO FRAUD SUSPECT;  </P> <P> INQUIRY: OLEN B. PHILLIPS SEEKS ACCESS TO ABOUT $1,500 IN SEIZED FUNDS TO MAKE  HIS HOUSE PAYMENT AND TO PAY OTHER BILLS.  </P> <P> A small portion of funds frozen last month when the state took over the assets  of Olen B. Phillips is expected to be released this week so that the embattled  Thousand Oaks real estate financier can pay the mortgage on his home and other  personal expenses.  </P> <P> According to his attorneys, Phillips, a suspect in the largest alleged fraud  scheme in Ventura County history, barely has enough money to buy groceries.  </P> <P> Richard Weissman, a court-appointed attorney who has been placed in charge of  Phillips' holdings, said he will give the businessman access to a bank account  containing about $1,500 in personal funds.  </P> <P> Weissman said he will also meet with Phillips' attorneys to discuss the release  of other assets -- including $20,000 in United Airlines stock -- which  attorneys say belongs to Phillips and not investors, as claimed by the state.  </P> <P> A tentative date to discuss the issue has been set Thursday in Los Angeles  County Superior Court, but the dispute could be resolved out of court today,  Weissman said.  </P> <P> Before Weissman releases the stocks, he said attorneys must prove that the  stocks were purchased with money from Phillips' salary as a pilot for United  Airlines, and not with investors' money.  </P> <P> Attorney Richard Hoefflin, representing Phillips, said the state was  overzealous when it seized the holdings -- estimated in the millions -- and now  the businessman is struggling. He said the state lacks the evidence necessary  to take over the funds and has violated his client's constitutional rights.  </P> <P> "He has the absolute right to get whatever we're going to get him," Hoefflin  said. "It's absurd that we have to be put through this exercise to release  funds."  </P> <P> On March 28, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski granted a  temporary restraining order allowing Phillips' assets -- including 11  businesses and 48 limited partnerships and investment groups -- to be seized  and placed under the scrutiny of Weissman. Hoefflin said he will request in  court April 27 that the restraining order be removed.  </P> <P> "The state went in and threw a pile of documents at the judge, and he issued  the court order based on invalid information," Hoefflin said.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the state Department of Corporations requested the restraining  order because they said innocent investors were in danger of losing money that  they had entrusted to Phillips, who had built a multimillion-dollar real estate  empire in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Phillips has not been charged with any crime; investigations are continuing at  the state, county and federal levels.  </P> <P> According to Alan Weinger, an attorney with the Department of Corporations,  investigators are trying to find what happened to $40 million in missing funds  from 2,000 investors.  </P> <P> He said Phillips is suspected of defrauding investors in real estate holdings  he controlled, particularly those who purchased trust deeds or gave the  50-year-old pilot cash loans in exchange for claims on property.  </P> <P> Phillips is also under investigation by the FBI in connection with a massive  phony loan scheme at Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan, which went out of business in  1988. Phillips was a stockholder and a director of the now-defunct United  Community Bank of Thousand Oaks, the parent company of Westlake Thrift.  </P> <P> The thrift's former president, Steven Smith of Thousand Oaks, pleaded guilty in  federal court in Los Angeles to charges of conspiracy, fraud and misapplication  of bank funds in connection with the case. According to investigators, the  thrift was apparently making millions of dollars in bogus loans -- some of them  written to people who never existed -- as part of a scheme to build the largest  video store chain in the nation. Smith is expected to be sentenced in U.S.  District Court in Los Angeles on Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Japanese Economic Package: Long-term effectiveness of government action remains to be seen WHILE official announcements, press leaks and rumours about the government's economic measures during the past two weeks have changed Tokyo stock-market sentiment radically, the long-term effectiveness of the government's direct measures to shore up share prices remains to be seen. The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Japan Securities Dealers' Association welcomed the measures, but some analysts were sceptical on whether pumping new money into stock investments would succeed. The short-term measures aim to increase demand while suppressing extra supply. On the demand side, the amount of public funds, such as postal savings and postal insurance funds, that can be invested in the stock market will be raised, with abolition of investment ceilings. An additional Y1,120bn will be provided under the government's Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, thus increasing the amount of public funds that could flow into the stock market to an estimated Y2,820bn this fiscal year. However, until now, fund management for Post Office savings and postal insurance has been among the most conservative in Japan. The funds are largely made up of household savings, and managed in such a way as to avoid losses at all costs. Thus, although a potentially large buyer of stocks is being created, it is questionable how much investment will actually be forthcoming. The government also aims to raise demand by allowing loan trusts, savings vehicles offered by trust banks, to invest in the stock market. The government will also allow trust banks to offer new money trusts, a product which will offer dividend payments directly reflecting investment performance. The investment trust industry has been strongly lobbying against such products, which will be in direct competition with investment trust funds. However, trust banks may not be so eager to turn to the stock market to invest their funds from loan trusts. 'Trust banks already face heavy losses on securities holdings and may not want to increase their exposure to the stock market,' said Mr Jason James, strategist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo. On the supply side, a temporary halt has already been laid down by the government on financial institutions realising gains on shareholdings. The government also postponed its sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, JR East, a railway operation of the former state-owned Japan National Railway, and Japan Tobacco. For share prices, the size of the economic package has positive implications. However, given that the Nikkei index of leading 225 shares has risen over 25 per cent in the past eight days, and that the market is trading over 46 times its earnings, it may be unrealistic to anticipate a further surge in share prices.</p>

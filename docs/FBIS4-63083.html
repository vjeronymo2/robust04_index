			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border has been  deteriorating over the past seven days, Chief of the Collective  Peacekeeping Forces' Staff Colonel-General Grigoriy Bessmertniy  told INTERFAX in an exclusive interview on Thursday [19 May].    He said that due to general warming the high-mountain passes  have become easily accessible to the opposition militants and  that Tajik opposition military formations daily shell border  posts from the rear and from Afghanistan. Attempts to cross the  border have also become more frequent, he said.    He announced that on Thursday morning, footprints of about  40  people who had penetrated into Tajikistan had been discovered in  the section controlled by the Khorog border-guard detachment.  "The trespassers have not be found yet," he said.    Bessmertniy believes that preparations for the Muslim  sacrifice festival, marked on 20 May, is containing a  large-scale offensive by Tajik militants.    He also noted that the situation was particularly serious in  the section running along the Ishkashim, Khorog, and Kalaikhum  regions of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. The  peacekeeping forces are not strong enough to block the mountain  passes and roads linking Afghanistan and Tajikistan.    Although Kazakhstan signed the agreement on participation in  the peacekeeping forces twice -- on September 24, 1993 and on  April 15, 1994 -- it has not yet sent in its contingent, said  Bessmertniy.    He announced that according to border guards, the armed  opposition is concentrating forces in the Ishkashim direction.  These forces are extremely mobile, well-prepared for warfare in  the mountains, are equipped with the most up-to-date  radio-communication equipment, know the terrain very well and  have guides.    He said that no attempts had been made lately to start talks  with the armed opposition, as was done last winter. He also  said that the peacekeeping forces were ready to participate in  the inter-Tajik talks, which, he said, would only benefit the  parties concerned.    He said that the armed opposition was accumulating forces  and  armaments. "Only Allah knows what will happen in this region in  the near future. Judging by all accounts, the situation on the  Tajik-Afghan border will deteriorate," said Bessmertniy.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Adult titles on CD-Rom At the recent Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas, Michael Spindler, Apple Computer's chief executive, displayed a CD-Rom-based shopping catalogue which allows customers to change the colour of clothes on a model. At the same time, a new breed of companies was showing off CD-Rom titles that allow users to remove a model's clothes altogether. These companies attracted crowds as they demonstrated adult-orientated multimedia titles. Until now, most CD-Rom titles have been aimed at educational markets. 'There is a lot of activity in adult-theme titles,' says Doug Millison, editor-in-chief of Morph's Outpost, a leading publication for multimedia developers. 'Some people are saying that they could be the 'killer application' that drives the CD-Rom market.' One company, New Machine Publishing, demonstrated a pre-release version of its 'Dream Machine' title at Comdex. The Dream Machine is an interactive adventure in which the user navigates his way through a building. Behind various doors there are opportunities to interact with video images of actresses and experience different fantasies. 'CD-Rom sales have taken off in the past year, and most of the buyers are men. We predict big demand for our titles and they will drive the market just like adult movies did for the VCR,' says Larry Miller, marketing executive at New Machine Publishing. However, publishers of adult CD-Rom titles are finding it difficult to find distributors or to advertise their products. 'I'm fed up with the censorship in this industry. We have first amendment rights in (the US) yet I constantly have to deal with editors who pull out my ads after they've accepted them,' says Bill Kelly, president of PC CompoNet which publishes adult CD-Rom titles. Kelly adds that he cannot find companies in the US to manufacture his CD-Roms and that he has had to go to Denmark. Adult CD-Rom publishers say they will also develop titles for women. They argue that their products provide a safe sexual outlet, a safe 'virtual sex' experience during a time of concern over Aids.</p>

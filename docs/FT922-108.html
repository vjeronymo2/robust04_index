			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls again as volume drops to 150m shares JAPANESE share prices were dragged down by small-lot selling yesterday as market volume dropped to only 150m shares, the smallest since June 9, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 71.46 to 15,741.27, its lowest close since May 20, 1986. The index fluctuated between 15,881.77 and 15,641.61. The market rose on bargain hunting and short-covering before falling on small-lot arbitrage-related selling. Volume declined from Friday's 247m shares. Falls led rises by 641 to 278, with 171 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 6.34 to 1,225.11. In London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.20 to 966.26. Traders said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's economic stimulus package, revealed broadly during the weekend, failed to generate activity. 'The market is absolutely inert,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. He added that by the time the details of the government's supplementary budget are announced, they will have been discounted by the market, and will not provide any incentive for investors. Even foreigners, who have been leading buyers of the market, were reported as net sellers for the second week in succession. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said foreign investors sold a net Y63.5bn in the week ended June 19. Domestic institutions were net buyers for the fourth straight week. Traders, however, pointed out that Japanese institutional investors were 'passive accumulators', placing orders at lower levels, rather than being 'aggressive buyers'. Property-related issues were weaker. Misawa Homes, the house builder, which plunged last week on fears of financial problems at Misawa's resort development subsidiaries, receded a further Y7 to Y864. Daikyo, which has also faltered on concern about its financial stability, picked up Y2 to Y707. However, traders said the improvement was technical, and investors remained suspicious about the company's soundness. High-technology blue chips were higher on small-lot bargain hunting. Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, gained Y10 to Y641 and Fujitsu advanced Y13 to Y598. Banks were easier, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y10 to Y1,450 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y1,230. Traders said investors and dealers sold short, pessimistic about prospects for the sector. Speculative theme stocks ran into profit-taking. Meiji Milk Products retreated Y19 to Y891 and Okamoto Y30 to Y1,110. However, Nippon Formula Feed, a feedstuff maker which has been popular on reports of its plans to breed blue-fin tuna, appreciated Y5 to Y658. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 142.11 to 18,595.42 in volume of 6m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets started the week on a mixed note. MANILA surged, triggered by the Dollars 2 1/8 advance to Dollars 39 3/8 of PLDT on the American Stock Exchange on Friday. The composite index climbed 30.49 to 1,555.81 in turnover of 521m pesos, after Friday's 196m. Volume was boosted by the listing of 15.5m shares of Union Bank of the Philippines (UBP) on the local exchanges. PLDT rose 50 pesos to 1,080 pesos while UBP gained 5.50 pesos to 27 pesos. The market is closed today for the proclamation of the new president. HONG KONG dropped solidly in moderately active trading, snapping a five-day, record-setting rally. The Hang Seng index slid 55.20 to 6,057.90, after surging 325 points last week. Turnover contracted to HKDollars 3.76bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.72bn. NEW ZEALAND closed lower in cautious trading ahead of the government's annual budget statement, to be issued today. The NZSE-40 index drifted easier throughout the session to end 8.43 down at 1,519.99. Turnover was steady at NZDollars 21.8m. Telecom Corp relinquished 5 cents to NZDollars 2.05, overshadowed by a report issued by New Zealand's anti-trust regulator last week contending that existing laws are not sufficient to encourage competition against Telecom. TAIWAN lost ground for the sixth consecutive day, on disappointing inflation data. The weighted index declined 28.94 to 4,467.50 in unchanged turnover of TDollars 21.1bn. AUSTRALIA drifted to finish little changed in the penultimate trading day of the fiscal year ending June 30. The All Ordinaries index settled 0.6 off at 1,642.3 in turnover of ADollars 242m, sharply down from Friday's ADollars 433m. SINGAPORE closed weaker after light trading, with the Straits Times Industrial index down 11.03 at 1,481.66. KUALA LUMPUR was unsettled by the continuing slide in Japanese equities. The composite index closed 5.41 lower at 591.14.</p>

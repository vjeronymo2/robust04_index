			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chancellor Kohl: "The Structural Problems </F> Require a Major Stocktaking by the Economy and Society"]    [Text] In the course of this outgoing year we have laid a  solid foundation for the work to be done next year and for  preserving and improving our country's future opportunities. In  the fourth year since regaining unity, Germany is faced with  great challenges. It is these challenges to which I want to  dedicate all my power. Our central task for the coming year  will be to secure existing jobs and to create new ones. For  this reason, we must do everything we can to overcome the  present recession and to change outdated structures -- wherever  this is necessary.    Later than most other countries, we felt the full impact of  worldwide recession in 1993. At the end of the year, however,  economic figures are encouraging again. In the second and third  quarters, GNP in the old laender increased slightly. The  Bundesbank has voiced expectations that "the bottom of recession  seems to have been reached, if not passed." Experience shows  that even after an upswing has started, it will take some time  for its positive effects to be felt in the labor market.    And what is more, like many other countries, we are not just  faced with "normal" recession. Structural problems have been  building up in the economy and in society for some time. A  major stocktaking is required of the economy and society if we  want to maintain our favorable position in the international  competition for business locations. High growth rates and more  than 3 million new jobs created over the last few years may have  induced many sectors not to make the necessary adjustments to  changing competition structures. This has brought about a need  to act, which is now increasingly being felt. This means:  Waiting for an economic upswing is not enough.    In early September, the Federal Government, therefore,  passed  its report on how to secure Germany as a business location. It  pointed out the priorities and areas where there is a concrete  need for action. We need new approaches in matters of wage  costs, working hours, education, research, and technology.  Public reaction to the report has been encouraging. Industry  and society will have to rethink. It has become very clear that  this is necessary. Now we need to follow up the correct  diagnosis by a suitable therapy. All groups of society will  have to contribute their share in this.    The framework conditions for employment are mainly created  by  the wage agreement partners. They have the power to give  employment and jobs priority over everything else. By  introducing flexible working hours, machine operating times can  be extended and more part-time jobs can be created. Like other  industrial countries, we must finally manage to increase the  number of part-time jobs offered. Opinion polls indicate that  the demand for part-time jobs is much higher than the supply.  All over Germany, almost 2.5 million full-time employees would  prefer to work part-time. By establishing new and flexible  employment models, an enormous potential of additional jobs  could be opened up.    It is the Federal Government's central task to secure the  basis for growth and employment by continuing its consolidation  policy. Next year, by enforcing cuts amounting to double-digit  billion German mark [DM] figures, we will be 5 percent below the  estimated budget. These are excellent preconditions for a  further decrease in interest rates, a stable currency, and an  uninterrupted flow of foreign capital into our country. As far  as the inflation rate goes, we are back to a three before the  decimal point.    The Federal Government also took action in several other  important areas. Let me just mention two examples: The new law  on work times, which has been presented to the Bundestag for  debate, enables wage round parties and their partners to have  new, more flexible working hours and longer machine-operating  hours. The law on securing Germany as a business location cuts  taxes on companies' profits and thus encourages industry to make  investments in order to create new jobs. With these measures we  have now achieved the lowest such taxes since the FRG was  established.    These markedly improved framework conditions will now have  to  be made use of quickly by authorities and industry, employers  and trade unions, with the aim of creating additional jobs. We  will intensify the necessary talks with the relevant groups,  establishing what each of them can and must do to secure  existing jobs and create new jobs in order to cut unemployment.    Beside securing existing jobs and creating new ones, the  completion of Germany's internal unity will be our central task.  The year 1993 saw great progress in this respect. According to  the Bundesbank, there is an increasing upward trend being felt  in eastern Germany. It increasingly includes east German  industry, which is going through a particularly difficult  process of adjustments.    In spite of recession in the west, the dynamics of  investment  in the east continues. Public per capita investment in eastern  Germany was 137 percent of the west German rate in 1993,  corporate investments were at 109 percent. This shows clearly  that the catching-up process in the new laender has gained  momentum. We are also making good progress in housing. At some  75,000, the number of building permits granted in 1993 was more  than double the 1992 figure.    What is particularly pleasing is that job cuts seem to have  largely come to a halt in 1993. Meanwhile, the number of new  jobs being created equals the number of old, unprofitable ones  being cut in other areas. Thus, unemployment in eastern Germany  went down in November, while it increased in western Germany for  seasonal and economic reasons.    In our active labor policy, we have spent well over DM100  billion since 1991 on social adjustments for the people in  eastern Germany. Last year, we could thus help 1.7 million  people who would otherwise have lost their jobs.    We increased pensions in the new laender quite fast. In  mid-1990, pensions in eastern Germany were between DM470 and  DM602. From 1 January 1994, a citizen who worked for 45 years  and had an average income will get more than DM1,400 in pension  payments. Thus, pensions have increased from one-third to some  75 percent of West German standards. In 1993, we were once  again able to offer a sufficient education and training program  for the young generation in the new laender. Our training  initiative provided more than 10,000 training facilities other  than in companies.    These are a number of successes, but we have no reason to  lean back complacently because of these successes. In the  coming year we will have to do everything we can to make new  investors and their capital and markets find their way to the  new laender. In 1994, public budgets, led by the federal  budget, will continue to support the catching-up process of the  new laender, with transfers amounting to triple-digit billion  mark sums.    Our economy very much depends on exports -- and this  includes  jobs all over Germany. That is why we have consistently  supplemented structural reforms in our own country by our  efforts to help liberalize world trade and advance European  integration.    The GATT agreement signed in mid-December is the most  comprehensive liberalization package of the past decades. This  great success will particularly stimulate the German economy and  employment.    The political unification of Europe will determine our  future  in peace and liberty. As the country with the highest number of  neighbors in Europe, we Germans have a vital interest in  preventing a relapse into the power rivalries of former times,  into the selfishness of national states, and into changing  coalitions. The political keynote created by Konrad Adenauer,  who said that German unity and European unification are two  sides of the same coin, is still valid.    At the beginning of November, the Maastricht Treaty came  into  force. Frankfurt am Main will become the headquarters of the  European Monetary Institute, and of the European Central Bank at  a later date. This is a convincing sign of confidence in our  policy of stability, and it encourages us to continue our course  with determination.    In the second half of 1994, Germany will take on the  presidency of the European Union. We will use this period to  speed up the process of European unification. I can see four  areas where we will have to concentrate our efforts in this  process:    1. Joint steps toward securing Europe as a business location  and to ensure growth and employment in the Union, as was already  emphasized by the European Council in December;    2. The application of the principle of subsidiarity, which  will be a regular topic at European Council meetings in future,  thanks to my efforts;    3. The implementation of the first plan of action to  increase cooperation in internal and legal policy, in particular  the establishing of the European police authority Europol;    4. The expansion of a joint foreign and security policy.    During the next few years we will be faced with the great  tasks of completing German unity, advancing European  integration, and of preparing the reunited Germany for a future  in a world that has changed profoundly. I have no doubt that we  will successfully tackle these problems.</p>

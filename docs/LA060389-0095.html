			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN HAD ESCAPED FROM CANADA;  </P> <P> KILLER SENTENCED OVER HANDGUN THEFTS  </P> <P> A confessed killer who escaped from a mental hospital in Canada was sentenced  Friday to two years in state prison for stealing handguns, ammunition and  knives from a North Hollywood outdoor supply store.  </P> <P> But authorities said they will ask U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service  agents to deport Giovanni Fasciano, 27, before he begins his prison term.  Fasciano has repeatedly admitted that in 1980 he killed his mother with an ax,  according to court documents.  </P> <P> Fasciano was arrested by Los Angeles police Sept. 27 while attempting to steal  more than 20 handguns, hunting knives and ammunition from Western Surplus at  5209 Lankershim Blvd. Police said Fasciano triggered the burglar alarm when he  broke through the building's roof. He was found inside the store, with the  weapons stashed in duffel bags.  </P> <P> Fasciano pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and theft in San Fernando  Superior Court last month.  </P> <P> After his arrest, authorities learned that Fasciano had escaped from a Montreal  hospital for the criminally insane in May, 1988. Fasciano was committed to the  hospital by Canadian authorities in 1980, after he killed his mother and  chopped up her body, according to court documents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Living in North Hollywood  </P> <P> He told authorities that he had been living in a North Hollywood apartment  since his escape.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop and Deputy Public Defender Tim Murphy,  Fasciano's attorney, said they believe that Fasciano should be returned to the  Canadian mental hospital to receive medical attention. They said local  taxpayers should not have to pay for his incarceration here.  </P> <P> Murphy said that Fasciano is eager to return to the hospital and that he left  only to take a vacation.  </P> <P> Canadian authorities are unwilling to pay to extradite Fasciano, which means  that U.S. officials will have to escort him to Canada, Judge John P. Farrell  said.  </P> <P> Farrell said he could not arrange for Fasciano's deportation, so instead he  sentenced him to two years in prison without the possibility of probation or  parole. However, he said he hoped that INS agents will deport Fasciano  immediately or upon completion of his prison term.  </P></p>

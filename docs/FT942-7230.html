			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Countryside Properties finds strengthening demand Countryside Properties, one of south-east England's biggest housebuilders, has strengthened its balance sheet substantially with the sale for Pounds 60m cash of its commercial property investment portfolio to BriTel Fund Trustees, the British Telecommunications pension scheme. The sale, announced yesterday, emphasises the continuing strong institutional demand for commercial property as this market continues to recover. Countryside intends to use the proceeds initially to reduce borrowings to Pounds 22.5m, equivalent to gearing of 29 per cent, compared with 103 per cent at the end of March. A number of inquiries were received about the portfolio from property companies and institutions, but BriTel made the most attractive offer, said Mr Alan Cherry, Countryside's chairman. The book value of the investment properties was Pounds 56.7m at end-September. Mr Cherry said that pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 had risen by 43 per cent from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.72m. Turnover increased by 62 per cent from Pounds 41.9m to Pounds 67.8m. The company is paying a maintained interim dividend of 1.41p on an enlarged share capital following last year's Pounds 16.8m rights issue. Earnings per share for the latest six months were also maintained, at 4.1p. Mr Cherry said that the number of private homes sold had risen from 161 to 224. Economic conditions continued to ease in spite of last month's tax increases, which had failed to dent the gradual recovery in the housing market. The number of homes completed for housing associations had fallen from 494 to 148, due to the timing of handovers. Work for housing associations measured by on-going contracts had actually increased from Pounds 85m to Pounds 115m since the end of the last financial year. Overall housing turnover had risen by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 55.5m (Pounds 36.7m) while profits had increased by 26 per cent to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.1m). Mr Cherry said the group would continue to build commercial properties for sale. This division increased profits from Pounds 88,000 to Pounds 457,000 in the first half and recently has negotiated forward sales of developments in Bishop's Stortford, Brentwood and Nottingham. The property investment portfolio incurred a Pounds 600,000 loss in the first half, the same as last time.</p>

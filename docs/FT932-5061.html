			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead BAA, the airport operator, has enjoyed upgraded forecasts in recent weeks ahead of its full-year results on Monday. Traffic growth has meant more revenues from landing fees and retail trade. Pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 300m against Pounds 192m. A Pounds 30m gain on the sale of its electrical distribution network will be offset by provisions on property. Northern Foods is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the full year a shade above Pounds 150m, up from Pounds 126.2m a year earlier. The forecast increase reflects a strong performance by short shelf-life foods, notably the convenience meals supplied to Marks &amp; Spencer, and continued gains from post-acquisition rationalisation of the Express milk operations. However, biscuits and other grocery products are expected to show the impact of recession, while high beef and pork prices have offset the benefits of efficiency improvements in the processed meat businesses. Unigate, the food and distribution group, is expected on Tuesday to announce profits almost unchanged at Pounds 93m for the year to March 31. Analysts will be watching to see whether the company has recovered from a disappointing first half, and also at Unigate's gearing levels. Pilkington, the glass group which announces results on Thursday, is expected to announce a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 77m to Pounds 37m for the year to March 31. But attention is likely to focus on Pilkington's cash flow and the dividend, which the company maintained by raiding reserves at the interim stage. Vodafone, the cellular telephone network spun off from Racal, has benefited from a sharp increase in new subscribers. Pre-tax profits for the year to March, to be announced on Tuesday, are forecast at about Pounds 320m against Pounds 272m a year earlier. PowerGen, the smaller of the two main electricity generators, has seen a small erosion of its market share during the year but cost cutting will have helped it life pre-tax profits to about Pounds 415m from Pounds 359m. Christian Salvesen, the distribution group, is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to March of around Pounds 75m.</p>

The manner in which the prime minister got rid of our  president, the defense minister [Janez Jansa], is such that even  discussion is no longer possible. What next? Regarding certain  issues, we have been in opposition so far. Now we will, of  course, pursue these things even more consistently. The  opposition parties do not have much scope and the same applies  to us. We will shift the focus of our activity outside the  parliament, in strengthening the organization, attracting new  members, and forming new local organizations, and thus,  preparing ourselves for the local elections that will take place  at the end of this year.

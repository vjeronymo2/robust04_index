			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE EXPIRY of both the March futures contract and the March index options was the main feature in an active derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. Early selling caused initial weakness in both the March and June contracts on the FT-SE which opened at 2,880 and 2,897 respectively. However, the selling soon dried up leaving both contracts to move into positive territory ahead of the expiry of March. This occured between 10.10am and 10.30 with March finishing at 2,895.5 on turnover of 6,066 lots. Strong buying of June saw it reach 2,930 ahead of the opening on Wall Street before it succumbed to a bout of profit-taking. The contract closed at 2,910, two points above its fair value premium to cash of about 9 points. Volume was 11,490 contracts. Traded options saw the expiry of the March index options. Total volume was 30,608 of which 7,221 lots were in the FT-SE 100. United Biscuits was the most active stock option with 3,846 trades.</p>

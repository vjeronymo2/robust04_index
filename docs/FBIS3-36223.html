He said that over the past three weeks the Finance Ministry  had been trying hard to cut down spending and find new sources  of income. The Central Bank's and Finance Ministry's common  task is to make use of available resources and capital through  economic levers.    Although the Central Bank's emission mechanism helps cover  expenses, it has an inflationary effect and so will therefore be  used as little as possible, said Gerashchenko.    Speaking about the government's pledge to repay the debt of  4  Tn rubles to the defense industry, agricultural complex, and  state-run enterprises in the first quarter of 1994, Gerashchenko  said that these payments must be made over a longer period.  Right now the most essential payments should be made, he  continued. The repayment of those debts which are not so urgent  should be delayed to avoid an outburst of cash in the first  quarter of 1994.    Gerashchenko described Acting Finance Minister Sergey  Dubinin  as someone who realistically approaches difficult problems.

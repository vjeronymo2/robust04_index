Pienaar] </F>   [Text] Durban March 13 SAPA -- The Executive Council of the  Conservative Party [CP] in Natal on Sunday [13 March] pledged  its support to Freedom Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen in  order to contest the April election. The council's decision  follows the resignation last week of CP Natal leader Carl Werth,  who also pledged his support to Gen Viljoen's Party. In a  statement the council said it had decided at a meeting on Sunday  to support the FF. The council is one of the CP's highest  policy making bodies in Natal.    "Of the ten members of the Executive Council, only one had  decided against contesting the election," the statement said.  Seven of the members supporting Gen Viljoen are: CP Natal  Deputy Chairman Duncan du Bois; Gunther Gathmann, Magriet  Torlage, Braam Joubert, Gordon MacGregor, CP Natal Chief  Information Officer Roger Whiteley and Neels Fourie.    Mr du Bois told SAPA on Sunday night that while the council  members have not yet resigned officially from the CP, their  membership would lapse. He said the CP has "undoubtedly but  regrettably" been given a blow by the council's decision. The  CP preoccupation with establishing a volkstaat [Afrikaner  homeland] and nothing else had precipitated the defection as  such a volkstaat had limited appeal in Natal, Mr du Bois said.  "The fact that the CP of late has seen fit to follow the  Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] direction  of a volkstaat and nothing else did not give us a choice."    He was reluctant to state that the CP in Natal had become  disillusioned with the party's national leadership, only saying  the AVF "had distorted the policy of the CP as laid down in the  party's constitution of 1991." He added: "We have not deviated  from CP policy."    Mr du Bois said he was confident that most CP supporters in  Natal would follow the council's lead and vote for the Freedom  Front. "Generally, as far as Natalians are concerned, we wanted  to vote for an anti-National Party, anti-African National  Congress front. The Freedom Front affords them the vehicle to  do just that." He admitted that "there may be a few  disenchanted people going to stick with the Volksfront".</p>

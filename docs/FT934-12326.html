			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Hostilities at prospect of Ryan's Dollars 2m MR TONY RYAN's compensation could total Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) for loss of office from GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company being rescued from bankruptcy by GE Capital, of the US. The proposed pay-off so outraged some GPA shareholders that they threatened to veto the deal. In response Mr Ryan agreed the payment should go to arbitration by a Queen's Counsel. He is leaving the Shannon-based company he founded in 1975 to become chairman of the GE Capital subsidiary, GE Capital Aviation Services, which will manage GPA's assets. His contract as chairman and chief executive of GPA, which runs until the July 1996, provides for an annual salary of not less than IPounds 250,000 (Pounds 240,380). Pension contributions and compensation for loss of office are understood to take the total package to Dollars 2m. However, some shareholders, threatened to withhold their support from the GE agreement unless Mr Ryan's compensation was settled by a third party. GPA, saddled with debts of Dollars 5.8bn, has seen the value of its shares collapse from a high of Dollars 32 to less than Dollars 1. The pension fund of the teachers of the state of Pennsylvania - the Public School Employees' Retirement system (Psers) - which two years ago subscribed to a preference share with a conversion price of Dollars 36, was particularly incensed. Mr John Lane, Psers' chief investment officer, yesterday said 'it remains to be seen' whether Mr Ryan would get his Dollars 2m. However, many of the group's banks are resigned to Mr Ryan receiving the whole amount. One banker said: 'The question of Mr Ryan's compensation caused a lot of unease among shareholders but his contract clearly stipulates that he is owed Dollars 2m.' A GPA spokesman said: 'The matter is still being decided by arbitration.' Two other GPA directors, Mr Colm Barrington and Mr James King, are transferring to equivalent jobs at GECAS, but will not receive compensation. Mr Ryan's pay-off is no longer threatening the GE deal, which GPA hopes will be signed by the end of the month.</p>

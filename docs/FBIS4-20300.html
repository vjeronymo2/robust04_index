			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mei Xing (2734 5887): "Several Issues Concerning </F> the Construction of Socialism -- Thoughts Inspired by The  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping: Volume 3"]    [Text] The publication and organized studies of The  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3, are a major  event in China's political life today. When the masses of  cadres, especially the high-ranking party and government leading  cadres, acquire a thorough knowledge of the theories in this  work, it will indeed ensure unity in thinking; reinforce our  conviction; and facilitate active, comprehensive, and correct  implementation of the Party's basic line.    Comrade Jiang Zemin spoke at the study report meeting and  gave an incisive exposition of the theme of The Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping: "Only socialism can save China;  only socialism can develop China. The socialism we uphold is a  socialism with Chinese characteristics." The quintessence of  this theory is its liberated ideas and its practical and  realistic approach which are inherently unifying in nature.  Through extensive practice and in the course of probing,  studying, formulating, and perfecting this theory, we should  discard some principles and some bookish, dogmatic ways we  understand Marxism as well as some unscientific and even  distorted interpretation of Marxism, and we should abandon  incorrect ideas that are beyond the early stage of socialism. On  the other hand, we must firmly oppose those erroneous viewpoints  that basically reject socialism but insist on using a dialectic  materialist and historical materialist world-outlook and  methodology to analyze and solve problems. Comrade Jiang Zemin's  exposition no doubt will play an important role in guiding our  study of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.    When we study The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, of  course we must first study the original and understand its gist,  but we must also link it to reality, including today's reality  and the practices of the past decade or so, for only then can we  learn and apply what we have learned and actively,  comprehensively, and correctly implement the party's basic line  and accomplish various socialist modernization tasks and in turn  forge a closer relationship among the party, the government, and  the masses and acquire high esteem to lead the masses to  struggle for our new cause.    While studying The Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, Volume 3, I thought about some of the basic  knowledge we have accumulated in practice over the past several  decades and the work we have done in the last 10 years or so in  the course of constructing a socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Here, I want to discuss some of my own crude  and simplistic viewpoints, and I welcome criticisms and comments  from the readers.    The first matter that requires proper handling is the  relationship between politics and economics. Economics is the  base, and politics is the centralized manifestation of  economics. Politics is built on, but also counteracts on, the  economic base, and under certain conditions, politics can even  decide a nation's economic rise or fall. In his later years,  Engels once wrote a letter in which he talked about the  counteraction of politics (state power) on economic development.  He said politics could make the economy develop faster, but it  could also cause the economy to collapse (see Selected  Works of Marx and Engels, vol 4 pp 483 and 486.) In  practice, we often have trouble handling the relationship  between politics and economics, and we often have disagreements  and arguments. In essence, the focus of contention over the way  the Eighth National Party Congress worded the country's major  contradictions at that time and questioned whether the party's  central task should be shifted was also on the relationship  between politics and economics. The opinion that the party's  central task should be gradually shifted to concentrate our  energy on developing the productive forces was a correct one at  that time. But in 1957, the year after the Eighth National Party  Congress ratified the decision, the anti-rightist struggle  expanded: In early 1958, the so called "criticism of people who  stood against rash advances" became a political issue. Later,  serious mistakes were made in the Great Leap Forward and in the  commune system when we attempted to speed up the development of  the productive forces and change the productive relationships.  That was followed by the Lushan Conference during which Comrade  Peng Dehuai's correct ideas were criticized as rightist  opportunism and anti-socialist thinking. A massive  counter-rightist movement ensued. These approaches not only did  not protect or develop the productive forces but actually ruined  them, just like Engels had said; it brought the economy to the  brink of collapse. In 1963, when we just began to overcome our  economic difficulties, just when agricultural and industrial  productions were recovering and were going to move forward  again, we were interrupted by the "Four Clean-Up" movement  [clean up politics, ideology, organization, and the economy.] By  the time of the "Cultural Revolution," the two  counterrevolutionary groups under Lin Biao and Jiang Qing used  politics as an excuse to greatly exaggerate the class struggle.  They also tried in vain to ruin the economy and cause the social  productive forces to stall and move backwards and widen the gap  between us and the Western capitalist nations. One of the root  causes of China's erroneous "leftist" guiding ideologies in  those 20 years was the mixed-up relationship between politics  and economics. Practices that only stressed politics and  alienated economics, or we should say the method of using  politics that violated the laws of economics to direct the  economy, seriously jeopardized the development of the social  productive forces. It was a very profound lesson.    History has already drawn for us the following simple  conclusion: Politics that do not follow the laws of economics,  and politics that do not serve the economy do not facilitate and  can even jeopardize the development of the social productive  forces and in turn obstruct the reinforcement of the socialist  system. After the proletariat obtains political power and  stabilizes the political situation, it should stand firm and  concentrate its strength on developing society's productive  forces. But history has also provided us with experience of  another kind: If economic development deviates from the correct  political leadership, it can lose its way and embark on the  wrong road, a winding road, or a crooked road, producing many  social problems which can turn around to cause political harm  and hurt the leadership.    The greatest victory of the Third Plenary Session of the  11th  Party Central Committee was its firm decision to shift the focus  of the party's tasks and the attention of the nation's people to  the socialist modernization process. In a little more than a  decade, China's socialist modernization has obtained glorious  results and has displayed its own characteristics. This is an  integral part of correct political leadership. The two basic  points determined by the party's basic line, namely, the four  basic principles and reform and opening up, give expression to  unity of politics and economics and to their ability to promote  each other and restrain each other, and the party is correct on  this. But we must also point out that because of weakened  political ideology education, and because of the abuse of power  for personal gains and other improper behavior among party and  government cadres and among workers in various trades and  industries, extreme individualism, money worship, hedonism,  money-before-everything mentality, and other improper ideas have  sprung up within the party and in society. Bourgeois liberalism  ran amuck on several occasions, economic development surged and  plummeted, the industrial structure deteriorated, and profit  fell and so on, and all these have an adverse effect on the  comprehensive and correct implementation of the party's basic  line. It is clear that the basic problem lies in the  inconsistent handling of the relationship between politics and  economics. Before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party  Central Committee, everything had been politically-oriented to  the point of ignoring the economy, but in the last decade or so,  the economy has taken precedence and politics has been slighted  or even ignored. In opposing the one-sided approach of letting  politics determine the economy, some comrades go to the other  extreme to produce another kind of one-sidedness, which is to  overlook the active counteraction of politics on the economy and  to deny that under certain conditions, politics can play a  leadership role or even commanding role in the economy. The  substantive manifestation of this role is the party's unified  and correct leadership, and the concrete work it performs is  strong and effective education in political ideologies. After  the "4 June" disturbance, Comrade Deng Xiaoping hit the nail on  the head when he pointed out that, "If a mistake has been made,  it would be our lack of consistency in upholding the four basic  principles and our failure to make that our basic thinking in  educating the people, the students, and the entire body of  cadres and communist members. The nature of that incident was a  contention between bourgeois liberalization and the four  upholds." (see The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  Vol 3 p 305.)    An extension of the relationship between politics and  economics is the question of how to correctly handle the  relationship between material civilization and spiritual  civilization when constructing socialism. Upon obtaining  political power, it has been the theme of the Communist Party  members to develop the social productive forces and construct a  material civilization at a rate faster than that of the  capitalist nations. A nation without economic power will have no  place in this world and eventually will be subjugated by those  who subscribe to hegemonism. But to develop the productive  forces at high speed, we need two things: First, the party and  the state must have a correct construction line and a set of  general and specific policies. Second, the masses of cadres and  the people must be willing to engage in arduous struggle for the  sake of socialist modernization. To attain the second condition,  we must focus on the construction of the spiritual civilization.  Of the great economic powers in the world today, some nations,  such as the United States, rely mainly on their superior natural  conditions, the rich endowment left by their ancestors, and  their control and exploitation of the third world nations.  Others, such as Germany and Japan, who were defeated in the war,  rely mainly on their own people's arduous struggle and advanced  science and technology and management methods. China's natural  conditions are fairly good, and we have a fine national  tradition of arduous struggle and self-reliance. So long as we  have the above two conditions, and if we truly unite, overcome  hardship and learn, and do some hard and solid work for a few  decades, we will be able to catch up with the economic powers.  Of course, they too are developing, and to catch up with or even  surpass them, we must work many times harder.    With respect to the idea of focusing on the two  civilizations  at the same time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has already talked about  it at a meeting with the central delegation from India's  Communist Party (Marxist Party) back in April of 1983. His  famous words are, "To construct a socialist spiritual  civilization, it is fundamental that the masses of people share  the communist ideal and have morals, culture, and discipline"  (The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping Vol 3 p 28.) To  let the readers understand why the Party Central Committee put  so much emphasis on strengthening spiritual civilization back  then, we should cite a passage from a written speech delivered  by Comrade Chen Yun in June 1985: "When constructing the  socialist material civilization, if we do not construct a  socialist spiritual civilization at the same time, our material  civilization may deviate from the right direction. If a unit or  a leading comrade forgets or relaxes his grip on the  construction of the socialist spiritual civilization, we will  not succeed in constructing the material civilization. Even more  serious is that we may deviate from the socialist and communist  ideals. That can be very dangerous." (The Selected Works  of Chen Yun (1956-1985) p 301.)    We were forewarned, and with sincere words and earnest  wishes  too, but the facts were, back then bourgeois liberalism was  beginning to run rampant and was getting a certain amount of  support from the party general secretary, Comrade Hu Yaobang,  who continuously diminished the construction of spiritual  civilization and curtailed political ideology education. To  those elements who were dissatisfied with the socialist system  at that time, compared to the dazzling world and pleasures of  Western capitalism, socialist and communist ideals were but  illusions of the primitive men. They found no redeeming value in  the then flourishing Chinese socialist modernization, and they  believed that everything the Western world had to offer was  perfect, and as a result, talks of all-out Westernization began  to appear and words demanding the abolition of the communist  leadership also spread; opinions that encouraged eating,  drinking, and the pursuit of happiness and even the pursuit of  money also appeared in the newspapers. In fact they were  abandoning the spiritual civilization whose goal was to pursue  communist ideals, morals, and discipline. This kind of bourgeois  liberalism which rejected the ideologies of the four basic  principles and wholeheartedly yearned for capitalism indeed  poisoned the minds of the party members and cadres and the  masses in a broad and profound way. In particular, when Zhao  Ziyang was general secretary, he blatantly supported and  indulged this kind of thinking and surrounded himself with many  mainstay elements. The most striking evil consequence was the  political upheaval and counterrevolutionary disturbance that  erupted in the capital in 1989.    Ideology may seem abstract, but it, like the political  system, is the superstructure built on the economic base; its  counteraction on the economy is strong, and it also plays an  important role in guiding the political direction. To the  communists and revolutionaries, the communist ideology we often  speak of is the supreme value outlook; it is also the  outstanding feature that separates them from other people.  Communist party members must discipline themselves, propagate  this most noble of ideologies among the people, conduct  effective political ideology education, and get rid of some of  society's unhealthy ideologies and workstyle and traditional  practices. We still have a long way to go before achieving  communism, but we must not abandon that ideal, for if we do, our  nation will be like a body without a soul; it will quickly decay  and will be rendered beyond help, and eventually we will be  trampled by those who believe in hegemonism and will become the  laughing stalk of the world.    The above is the second issue, that is, we must emphasize  material civilization and spiritual civilization at the same  time, and if more problems should emerge in our spiritual  civilization, we must make a even greater effort to strengthen  that area.    The third matter below has to do with the relationship  between the productive forces and productive relations.    The productive relations must adapt to the development of  the  productive forces. As the productive forces develop, the  original productive relations must change; otherwise, they will  obstruct the development of the productive forces. In the course  of our socialist construction, we have inadvertently produced  two erroneous tendencies: First, we believed that by  continuously changing the productive relations, the productive  forces would develop at high speed. The successful completion of  the three transformations of socialism led people to have  unrealistic ideas, and very soon after the start of the "Great  Leap Forward," the nation began to install the commune system,  believing that it would greatly improve the productive relations  and speed up the development of the productive forces. The  result was total disaster. But for a long period thereafter,  there was another kind of erroneous tendency: We ignored any  improvement in the productive relations and stuck to old  conventions, and as a result, China's economy stalled. The  general policy of reform and opening up proposed after the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee in essence  wanted China's productive relations to adjust to the development  of the productive forces and promote a high rate of economic  growth. Facts show that this decision by the Party Central  Committee was entirely correct; the results have been  outstanding.    China proceeded with step-by-step reform and opening up,  first in the rural areas, and upon gaining some experience,  shifted the focus to the urban areas, slowly paving the road to  a socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics. We still  have a long way to go, but we have a lot of experience which we  must continuously review and sum up. The Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3, discussed this in detail and gave  it a highly theoretical summation.    Changing the productive relations is a very complicated  matter. It involves the administration of political power and  the workings of the economic system and often can trigger sudden  changes in the overall situation. That is why on this matter we  must oppose conservative tendencies that reject changes and  encourage complacency, but we must also oppose rash moves and  impatient approaches. The laws of development of all things  require deep probing, repeated tests, and extensive practices,  and only then can we understand the laws of their internal  relationship. Many important people in the world have discovered  the objective laws of natural science and social sciences. They  have all struggled long and hard and have experienced many  failures before succeeding. Whether our reform will succeed or  fail is not determined by our subjective will; we must go  through the test of actual practice, and we must go through  repeated tests before drawing conclusions. This means we must  constantly review our experiences, acquire more knowledge, and  let knowledge set us free and not just think that things are  inevitable. In other words, we must comply with the gist of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of constructing a socialism with  Chinese characteristics and unify liberated thinkings with  practicality and reality, and only in that way can we succeed in  restructuring various systems and avoid mistakes.    The fourth matter we want to discuss here is about upholding  the public ownership system as the primary system among the  socialist market economic mechanisms we set up in the early  stage of socialism. In simple terms, the capitalist market  economic mechanisms are built on the foundation of the private  ownership system. It utilizes the law of value to regulate  supply and demand and market prices. The socialist market  economic mechanisms are built on the foundation of the public  ownership system. In essence, we should use both planning and  the market as means of regulation to guide the economy along the  socialist path.    For many years, the capitalist nations have been utilizing  indirect planning and regulation, economic measures, and  administrative interventions to supplement the market economy  and ease the conflict between socialized production and private  ownership of means of production, and in terms of organization,  they have used enterprise groups and economic integration and  other ways to concentrate their economic strength and in turn  reduce the crisis elements in the market economy. This is  progress in the way the capitalist nations control the way their  economic system works. Ours is a socialist nation. From the  beginning, we have implemented a highly centralized planned  economic system, and back then, that system indeed played an  effective role in promoting the rapid development of the  productive forces. The First 5-Year Plan successfully  centralized the financial and human resources to lay a tentative  foundation for our socialist industrialization. That success was  an integral part of the highly centralized planned economic  system. But even back then, our party had already realized that  over-centralization was not good for the economy, and it  prompted them to suggest putting large projects under planning  while giving small undertakings a free hand. Comrade Chen Yun  spoke at the Eighth National Party Congress held in 1956 and  proposed relaxing market control. He subsequently was  responsible for drafting the provisions on improving the  industrial, commercial, and financial management systems. They  were never carried out because of the Great Leap Forward  Movement. In 1979, Comrade Chen Yun spoke in no uncertain terms  on the idea of using market regulations to supplement economic  planning. That in fact marked the beginning of the restructuring  of China's single-track planned management system. Of course, in  the several years after reform and opening up began, we first  combined economic planning and market regulations and then we  decided to implement the socialist market economic system. It  has been a gradual, step-by-step process. But it should also be  pointed out that making a decision in principle with respect to  a system and the actual practice of that system are two  different matters. It takes time for the cadres to grasp the  principles and apply them, and in practice, there are many  things we must probe, experiment with, understand better, and  continue to improve. In short, today's popular idea of getting  rid of planned regulations completely is not right and can even  be harmful, because if we did that, wouldn't we be returning to  the early form of capitalist economic management? Shoudn't we  give the confusion in our economic life caused by the relaxation  of macro regulation and control in the last two years some  serious thoughts?    On this matter, there is another important thing we want to  point out, and that is, today, some people are directly or  indirectly advocating replacing the public-ownership system as  the main system in the socialist market economy and minimizing  the share of the state-owned economy. A handful of economists  even believe that the public-ownership system is but a means  while developing the productive forces is the true goal, which  can be achieved by any other means. According to such theory, we  do not need any kind of ownership system with respect to the  means of production, because it matters not who owns them. To  put it plainly, they want to abandon socialism to set up a  market system for the early-to-intermediate stage of capitalism.  As we said earlier, even the capitalist nations are utilizing  indirect planning as means to regulate the economy. On this  matter, neither The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  nor the party Central Committee's resolution has ever abandoned  the principle that the public ownership system must be the main  system during reform and opening up. If the public-ownership  system is not the primary system, and without the state-owned  enterprises serving as mainstay in particular, what will be left  of socialism? Where will reform and opening up be heading?    Some people want to diminish and even disband the large  state-owned enterprises, saying that they are inefficient, that  they lose money, and that they are a heavy burden and should be  discarded. We have many large state-owned enterprises. We began  setting them up under the First Five-Year Plan; it has been more  than 30 years, and during this long period, has anyone bothered  to figure out how much money they have made for the state and  how much they have contributed? Old workers who went through  fire and water from the early days of the founding of the nation  to just before the Cultural Revolution and who toiled night and  day to lay the foundation for today's socialist economy have  given their lives to the state and to the people. Shouldn't the  state take care of them now? Today, there are some so called  communist party members and state cadres who call themselves  revolutionaries who won't find ways to curb the problem of  people wining and dining on billion yuan's worth of public funds  a year; they don't worry about how to stop the draining of state  funds to the tune of 100 million yuan a day. Instead they want  to get rid of the millions of old retired workers who have  worked all their lives but who are getting a very small pension  today. They don't think about the 80 million peasants and  herdsmen in the poverty-stricken areas who don't have enough to  eat or to keep them warm. They even boast that "state-run  businesses are not as good as collectives, and collectives are  not as good as privately-own businesses, and private businesses  are not as good as wholly foreign-owned or joint venture  businesses." Isn't it clear what these people want? Is it  realistic to ask them to serve the people with all their hearts  and minds?    People who want to diminish or remove the primary role of  the  public-ownership system and attempt to change the nature of the  state-owned enterprises, regardless of how they feel  subjectively, are in fact trying to topple socialism. Practice  is the only criterion in testing the truth. What kind of  conclusion will history draw about these people? Everything will  become clear in practice.    Here we must say something about centralization and  decentralization of power. In the past, power was  over-concentrated in the hands of the central government, and  all human and material resources were controlled by the relevant  government departments. These defects have been in existence all  along. In recent years in particular, abuse of power for private  gains and the trading of power and money and other ill winds  have swept the country, and many cadres, including a few leading  cadres, who have a lot of power are making a lot of money and  those with a little power are making a little money, and even  those without power are taking advantage of the situation. Thus,  handing down power to the localities and enterprises may be a  necessity, but the question is how, how much, and whether the  devolution of power will truly mobilize the proper kind of  enthusiasm among the cadres and the masses. Here, we must put  "proper" before "enthusiasm," because the lesson from the Great  Leap Forward is that without proper leadership and strict  control, enthusiasm can become recklessness. If this kind of  recklessness should run amuck in the country, if the capital  construction projects are jeopardized, if we pursue an realistic  rate of growth, if we set up development zones regardless of  conditions, and if we do what we want to draw up our own  policies and rules and regulations, it will lead to chaos and  jeopardize the central government's unified leadership. China is  a vast country; unification is hard to come by, but localism and  decentralism can spread quickly. If the decentralization of  power is allowed to develop without restraint, it will be very  dangerous. If we are not careful, everybody will set up  blockades and engage in separatism, and then not only will we  fail to create a market economy but there can be unimaginable  political consequences.    In summing up our war experience, Comrade Mao Zedong said,  "If what should be centralized is not centralized, then those in  high places must be derelict of duty and their subordinates are  usurping their authority. This is not permissible in any kind of  relationship between a superior and his subordinates, especially  in military matters. If what should be decentralized is not  decentralized, then those in high places must be hoarding power  and their subordinates are without initiative. This too is not  permissible in any kind of relationship between a superior and  his subordinates, especially in a relationship of command in  guerrilla warfare." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong,  2nd Edition, Volume 2, pp 436-437) Comrade Mao Zedong's correct  viewpoint on centralization and decentralization which puts  strategies under central command while making the subordinates  responsible for actual deployment in battle can also be used to  guide our economic construction. What makes a modern economy  different from a natural economy is that the former is more  centralized and facilitates centralized command, which means we  must emphasize macro regulation and control. Of course this kind  of centralized command or macro regulation and control must be  coordinated with the socialist market economic mechanisms, that  is, we must work on public finance and taxation, banking and  credit, interest rates and prices, the scope of capital  constructions and key construction projects,  industrial-agricultural and urban-rural relationships, regional  distributions, the balance between the public and private  economies, and the allocation of national income and so on.    If things are very lively at the micro level, control must  be  tightened at the macro level. This may seem contradictory on the  surface, but in fact, this is dialectics. If we tighten control  at the top and bottom, we will stifle the economy; if both are  let loose, it will lead to chaos. There are many lessons of this  kind. Some cadres have trouble accepting macro regulation and  control. The root cause of that is their inability to consider  the whole situation. They do not take the whole economic  situation into consideration and worry only about their own  struggle for power and profit. This means the Party and the  state must always take the whole situation into consideration  and get rid of the improper, localized interferences and focus  their attention on solving problems that affect the overall  situation.    Finally, I want to mention one more thing. Comrade Mao  Zedong's famous saying, "Strategically we should ignore our  enemies, but tactically we must focus attention on the enemies,"  not only can be applied to politics and to past struggles in the  world but can also be applied to the economy and to today's  tasks, because this is a fundamental principle. To retreat in  the face of problems is not the proper attitude of a Communist  Party member, but to ignore problems and charge ahead recklessly  will not bring success either.    I have only begun to study The Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, Volume 3. Here I am only offering some crude and  superficial opinions based on my own past practical experiences.  I welcome criticisms. Where there are disagreements, there can  be discussions, because contention and debate broaden people's  minds, and of course, ultimately who is right or wrong can only  be determined through practice.</p>

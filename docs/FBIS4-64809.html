			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the meeting between Greek Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias and his Albanian counterpart Alfred  Serreqi in Zurich last Tuesday [3 May], the Albanian side  continues to maintain a hard and often provocative stance. At  the same time, it says it is ready and willing to normalize  bilateral relations.    The official Albanian Foreign Ministry statement issued  after  Serreqi's return from Zurich maintains the entire offensive  stance toward Athens with detailed reportage on the issues that  the Albanian side raised with Papoulias.    Albanian President Sali Berisha, in an interview yesterday  evening, blamed the Greek Government for the bloody incident at  Episkopi, and again unsuccessfully attempted to internationalize  the issue by claiming that Greece has territorial designs  against Albania!    The Greek Government, which continues to maintain a soft  tone, was forced yesterday through a government spokesman to  reject many points in the Albanian statement, which elevated  reference to issues by the Albanian side to the level of a  "discussion" between the two foreign ministers.    Thus, the government spokesman denied that there was a  discussion on the issue of Tsamidhes, which the Albanian side  had indeed mentioned. The spokesman also said that the Greek  Government cannot address Tirana's demand to suspend the  operations of radio stations in Corfou and Konitsa, which  address the Greek minority in Albania.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: "The  government has its policy. Greek society has its views, which  are free, as long as they respect the Constitution and the laws  of the state, and the Albanian side should become familiar with  the regulations of a democratic and constitutionally based  state...."    However, the intentional inaccuracies of the official  Albanian statement on the Papoulias-Serreqi meeting clearly  prove that Tirana does not plan at the moment, perhaps even for  domestic reasons, to proceed quickly with the normalization of  Greek-Albanian relations. In the same statement, Tirana insists  that "the hold put on implementing the decision to reduce the  Greek Embassy's staff does not mean that the decision will not  be implemented...." and again mentions "a logical time frame"  for reduction of the personnel.    According to the same post-dated statement on the meeting  between the two ministers, the Albanian Government also orally  rejects the Greek initiative and plan for recognition of  Albanian seasonal workers in Greece. In its statement, the  Albanian side notes that the "draft agreement does not solve the  issue of legalizing the current economic migration of Albanians  to Greece."    In the same statement, Tirana also raises the issue of the  "border status," claiming that the two ministers also discussed  the issue of "the presence of proto-Albanians (Arvanites)"!!! in  Greece. In a television interview on Antenna Television  yesterday, Albanian President Berisha appeared equally  provocative.    On the one hand, Berisha says he is optimistic about the  bilateral problems which he hopes will be solved, but on the  other hand he directly accuses Greece of having "territorial  designs against Albania."    Berisha said: "In order to convince not only me but also the  international community that the Greeks do not have territorial  designs, I want them to sign the Florence Protocol... As long  as they do not sign the Protocol and say that in their strategy  they include the so-called North Epirus, Albania will have no  relations with Greece and Cyprus. No country would believe that  they have a friendly policy and do not have designs in Albania  with such a policy..."    Berisha again directly blames the Greek Government for the  incident in Episkopi, and by invoking the UN Charter (!!) he  charges that "any country that allows its territory to be used  by commandos or terrorist groups is accountable...."</p>

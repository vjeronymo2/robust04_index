			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Management: Multimedia comes to the business school - Interactive teaching methods are about to revolutionise executive education, says George Bickerstaffe Like everything else, management teaching is about to be invaded by the information superhighway, multimedia and CD-Rom. Many business schools, including Harvard, are now working on the application of these technologies to case studies and business simulations. The 'case method' - using narratives of real situations to teach academic principles - dates back to Harvard Law School (using summaries of court cases, hence the name) in 1870. Harvard Business School picked up the idea in the 1920s. Since then it has become probably the most widely used method of management teaching. It has also remained pretty static. Generations of business school students have ploughed through pages of text, tables and graphs to 'prepare' a case for the following day's class discussion. Multimedia and interactive cases could well change all that. Among the most advanced business schools in this area is Insead, based at Fontainebleau, near Paris. It developed its first multimedia cases in 1992 and now uses several, including cases on Minitel and Swatch. According to Albert Angehrn, professor of information systems at Insead and the moving force behind the school's involvement in multimedia, the benefits of technology are significant. He reckons that CD-Rom drives linked to colour PCs (Insead's favoured delivery system) can provide several hours of video and animation, thousands of photographs, pages of text and graphics and charts. And, he says: 'It is not as difficult to produce the cases as people think. Given the basic information on a company we can produce an interactive case within two weeks. And it is not enormously expensive.' Insead based its first multimedia cases on the idea of an 'electronic book' that allowed students to browse, mark, annotate and search for specific topics or people in the text. They also allowed direct access to related images and videos - the real difference that multimedia brings. For example, the Swatch case allows students to compare North American and European advertising approaches by watching video clips, which appear in a small 'window' on the computer screen. Students can also watch the steps involved in product development and see a short interview with the product manager. Newer cases have become increasingly sophisticated and less structured. Angehrn argues that the editing implicit in writing down a case is being removed. Students are now able to look at a company unbiased and with as much information as they want. They can access real financial data on a company via spreadsheets and carry out 'what-if' analyses. In one marketing case they can evaluate advertisements and overall campaigns by changing the style. The computer will suggest likely results. In other words, they approach the case like real-life managers. Angehrn and colleagues at Insead believe there is much further to go. They have developed a pedagogical model, called Business Navigator, to put the future of this type of highly interactive learning on a firmer basis. In what they call a 'virtual interactive business environment', they see students being able to 'navigate' around a company's physical environment and through its organisational network (people) and informational network (documents, files and so on). Angehrn believes that as the technology develops and improves it will have a fundamental effect. The implications of virtual reality in learning situations, for example, are only beginning to become clear. 'There are really no limits to what we can do,' says Angehrn. He has already designed cases and simulations where participants are prompted by on-screen 'stimulus agents', who suggest they attend meetings, take action or who provide information. Angehrn claims that students find interactive cases a participative way of learning and one that promotes retention. 'They get to know the companies and the issues much better - a video interview is far more alive than a printed quote,' he says. 'And because it is interactive and they can 'move' around the case they get a real experience of what people inside the company actually do.' There are, however, plenty of implications for business schools and management academics that may not be positive or easy to accept. Angehrn says they will have to think about how to combine three sets of learning - traditional face-to-face sessions in the classroom, self-learning, perhaps via by a computer, and group work or networking via computers. 'We have been very good at designing classroom sessions,' he says. 'Now we have to think about designing other educational forums where people are learning together but not in the same place or even at the same time.'</p>

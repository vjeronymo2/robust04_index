			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Estate agents pay price of boom years: The background to Nationwide's sale of branches at three a penny Few ventures illustrate more starkly the excesses of the late 1980s than the ill-fated purchases of estate agencies by banks, building societies and insurance companies. Nationwide, Britain's second biggest building society, announced on Tuesday it was selling for just Pounds 1 a total of 304 estate agency branches acquired since 1987 for Pounds 120m. Nationwide had made cumulative losses of Pounds 80m at the branches taking the society's total loss to Pounds 200m. Abbey National bank and Prudential Corporation made combined losses totalling more than Pounds 500m when they sold their estate agency businesses in 1993 and 1991. A quarter of UK estate agency branches are estimated to have closed since 1988. Yet the logic of wedding the financial services revolution to the housing boom seemed faultless in the late 1980s when estate agencies were among the busiest businesses in the high street; house sales were running at more than 2m a year and house prices were rising sharply. People who bought houses also needed mortgages and insurance, argued building societies and banks. What better way to market the growing range of financial services than to sell them all from the same shop? There was also a fear that if they did not buy estate agencies, other financial institutions would, cutting them off from potential mortgage sales outlets. The rush to buy agencies prompted a feeding frenzy. The price of businesses soared as institutions measured success by how many branches they had. Nationwide paid an average of almost Pounds 400,000 for each of the 300 outlets it is now selling at three a penny. In 1988 there were estimated to be 16,000 estate agency branches owned by about 11,000 companies. This is estimated to have fallen to about 12,000 offices owned by about 6,500 companies. Half of all housing transactions are handled by about 25 national concerns mostly owned by financial institutions. None of these appear to have anticipated the severity of the housing recession which saw house sales in England and Wales fall from a peak of 2.1m in 1988 to 1.1m in 1992 and which are only expected to reach 1.2m this year. UK house prices have declined on average by 10 per cent since the third quarter of 1989 according to Halifax, Britain's biggest building society and owner of 530 estate agency branches. The fall has been disastrous for agents who are paid only on completed sales and earn fees from commission based on a small percentage of the sale price. Incomes became insufficient to pay rents and rates on expensive high street properties and to meet salaries. In a bid to curtail costs, smaller agencies reduced mailing shots and in some cases started to bill sellers for advertising. Some refused to market properties they felt were unrealistically priced. Heavy pressure was put on sellers to reduce asking prices in a bid to make sales. Mr Harry Hill, managing director of Hambro Countrywide, which is acquiring the Nationwide chain, said his company had been successful because it had concentrated on selling houses rather than financial services. He added: 'In the past there was a temptation by building societies to see a move into this business as an opportunity for more mortgage lending. Arguably this has been an expensive mistake.' Building societies which were generating a large slice of their loan portfolio from estate agencies may have found it more difficult to cut costs and close loss-making branches than smaller independents selling a single product. Nationwide says it won Pounds 2.5bn - representing 7.2 per cent of its mortgage business - over the counters of its estate agencies in seven years. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's chief executive, said the disposal would allow it 'to concentrate more effectively on our core financial services business.' Hambro will offer Nationwide mortgages under a marketing agreement. Halifax, however, intends to retain its 530 estate agency branches which it says generated a tenth of its mortgage business in the first half of this year even though the estate agency division itself made a Pounds 2m loss. 'We are strongly committed to the estate agency business which will improve as house sales increase,' it said. The housing market, however, remains sluggish. A walk down most high streets suggests that there still may be too many agents chasing too few sales in an industry where the cost of entry for the smallest independent may be little more than the rent on a shop, a car and a good photocopier.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Economists urge US farm policy overhaul Important aspects of US farm policy need a substantial overhaul if the US is to preserve its competitive position in world agricultural trade, say Mr Alan Barkema and Mr Mark Drabenstott, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. In a paper prepared for the bank's quarterly journal, Economic Review, the authors note that US farm export programmes are heavily skewed toward bulk commodities, where global trade is declining, and ignore fast-growing trade in processed foods. Furthermore, entrenched export subsidy and credit programmes underserve countries with the fastest-growing demand for farm products. After an intelligent discussion of changing trends in the global trade in farm exports, the authors set out four rather surprising suggestions for US policy reform. They say the time for discussion of these alternatives is now, as policymakers plan farm legislation for the next five years, as part of the 1995 US Farm Bill. Their paper suggests that rather than continue to devote substantial energy to wrestling down worldwide subsidies, the US should focus on stimulating demand in emerging markets for farm goods. 'US agriculture has much to gain from economic and trade policies that boost economic growth in regions like Asia and Latin America,' it says. The authors argue that US domestic farm programmes depress world bulk grain prices while reducing US farmers' competitiveness in world markets. 'Eliminating commodity programmes may encourage US farmers to shift to products with higher profit margins and brighter market prospects,' they say. On a closely related issue, the article concludes that programmes that encourage US farmers to set aside acreage, and thus lower production, throttles the highly-competitive US grain handling system and put the US at a worldwide trading disadvantage. Finally, the authors question whether the Dollars 5bn spent on US export credits in recent years has been flowing to the markets with the best long-term trading possibilities. The credits, they say, are often directed toward political, rather than trade, alliances.

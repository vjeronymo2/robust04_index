			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Economic Science Prokopiy Drachev, </F> first vice president of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and  Lessees: "Russian Small Business and Western Big Capital"]    [Text] The creation and development of a network of  small and medium-size enterprises in different sectors of the  national economy in the conditions of crisis in the Russian  economy is a number one priority in order to saturate the  consumer market with goods and services, create new jobs, and  bring into production unused production and material resources.  Such enterprises will help develop competition, overcome  sectoral and territorial monopolism, improve the economy and the  financial sphere, and expand export potential.  <H5>  While They Were Being Set Up, the Money Melted Away </H5>   At first glance, small business is constantly at the center  of attention. It has been said many times what exactly  entrepreneurs need in order to get on their feet, flourish, and  even expand abroad. In reality, however, the state's attitude  toward small business has not changed at all. The standards  applied to them--tax, credit, and leasing--were the same as  those applied to large businesses.    The president of Russia's decree on the development of small  and medium-size business proved unfocused, declarative,  consisting of generalized statements and exhortations for the  ministries to support entrepreneurship economically.    In May 1993 the president and the government did finally  issue a decree on priority measures in small business  development. It contained the main point: the decision to  allocate money for their development and instructions to the new  Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of  Competition to distribute it. According to economists'  calculations, however, 100 billion rubles [R] is needed to  revive the small business sphere rather than the R25 billion  that has been allocated--and even that only on paper. By the end  of the year only R5 billion was left at the fund's disposal.  Members of our union (who presented relevant programs) also  counted on some share of that money. Unfortunately, the  procedure for distributing the money turned out to be very  complex, and the fund has never really managed to get a grip on  it. For more than half a year it was busy setting itself up and  developing a concept of monetary distribution, while the money  melted away under the onslaught of inflation.    With this arrangement, small business will not see  fundamental changes in the foreseeable future. According to  preliminary data, in the future the Fund for Support of  Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition intends to use  the long-awaited money as credit that will be provided to small  businesses on the same terms as the Central Bank's prime  rate--210 percent annually. In order to utilize such credit  successfully, the amount has to be turned over four times a  year. This means that it can be used only for trading, not  production. Entrepreneurship in the production sphere, the one  capable of saturating the market with goods and services, needs  preferential credit support and taxation regime, exemption of  reinvested profit from taxation, and a tax break of two to four  years depending on the nature of the production.    Alas, Russia has practically already chosen a very  unfavorable road for the development of entrepreneurship. Its  fate was determined by the government, which made changes to tax  legislation that left entrepreneurs in a state of shock. Tax  rates and indirect taxes were increased, new taxes and duties  introduced. As a result, an entrepreneur will have to give up  for public needs 35-43 percent of profits, and the combined tax  on payroll reaches almost 40 percent. The only real benefit  small businesses got is exemption from paying estimated tax on  profit. It is also very good that profit reinvested in capital  assets and put into R&amp;D and design work (NIOKR) will not be  taxable. However, in the current conditions few small  enterprises can afford such expenditures without additional  credits.  <H5>  Security--in 149th Place </H5>   In this situation small business could get help from foreign  investment, but the terms of obtaining it and the insignificant  volume do not meet the current needs and cannot satisfy Russian  entrepreneurs. The main reason, in the opinion of international  financial organizations, is that the investment climate in  Russia over the past five to six years has changed for the  worse. For instance, the financial magazine YEVROPEYSKIYE DENGI  ("European Money") in March 1993 placed Russia in 149th place  (among 169 countries) in terms of investment security. In  addition to difficulties built into the code of law, foreign  investors also encounter many organizational and informational  problems. This precipitates their reluctance to increase  investment in Russia.    Privatization with the participation of foreign investment  can and should play an important role in the development of  small and medium-size business. It opens the opportunity for the  free import into Russia of managerial experience and know-how.  Another advantage of such privatization is that enterprises  undergoing privatization will be appraised at their real value.  A private investor will invest his money only if he is certain  that the enterprise he is acquiring will flourish and bring in  profit. So far he is encountering only difficulties, the main  among which remains the haphazardness of economic legislation.  For instance, certain types of activities are permitted only by  license; quite often far from the best facilities--take it or  leave it--are offered for privatization; there are numerous  restrictions regarding auctions and competitive bids, while  almost all such deals must be licensed. For the foreign business  world the Law on Foreign Investment in Russia, which contains  the most general provisions with a considerable set of  restrictive conditions, so far has not become a document for  practical action. Serious modifications to it are urgently  needed, as well as developing as soon as possible a set of  accompanying documents that will specify in concrete terms the  norms of participation and preferences for foreign investors.    Until recently, however, Russian state bodies did not treat  seriously the problem of attracting foreign investment. The  Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees petitioned the former  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet on these issues many times but  never received a reply. However, the issues raised a year ago  have not lost their urgency. The main among them, in the union's  opinion, is the question of ownership rights. It still has not  been defined clearly who and at what level makes the decisions  on granting which kind of ownership. From the standpoint of  international standards, we have not defined ownership rights at  all, and therefore a foreign investor does not know what he can  count on when he acquires a Russian enterprise. In order to  create a favorable investment climate it is also necessary not  only to make corrections to the legislation but also to  guarantee observance of already existing statutes.    Structures qualified to work competently with foreign  investors of capital in Russia so far are not sufficiently  developed. Potential foreign investors are reluctant to come  into the Russian market among other reasons because they do not  find local structures professionally trained to interact with  them.  <H5>  International Investment Center Will Select a Company </H5>   Against the background of such unfavorable trends, the  Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, in partnership with  the international consortium Newform International (Paris), in  August 1993 created the International Investment Center, whose  task is to facilitate attracting foreign investment into the  Russian economy.    The center was founded in order to bring together and  utilize  the experience of specialized consulting and engineering firms,  whose sphere of activities encompasses the main spheres of  applied knowledge. All projects are carried out by independent  international experts. The center will transfer to the customer  the technologies and ensure the participation of local partners  in the project.    Through its international contacts, the center will select  for each project a company responsible for its implementation,  based on its experience and reputation, as well as the knowledge  of local conditions. The company to which the project  implementation will be commissioned uses as needed the  capabilities of all members of the Newform International  consortium. Well-integrated into the world economy with  international contacts, the center's flexible structure and its  multiprofile orientation allow it to develop and realize  technically and economically most complex projects and pick the  management for them.    The International Investment Center has already begun to  implement a number of projects. Among them, first and foremost  we should mention the project to develop a timber raw material  base in one of the rayons in Tomsk Oblast utilizing waste-free  wood processing technology and the development of a social  infrastructure, and the project on the construction of an  international airport in Ufa.    In addition, the International Investment Center has begun  to  actively promote abroad the products of members of the Russian  Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, using advertising and  promotional materials supplied by customers, and assist in  signing the contracts. On the other hand, it is using the  capabilities of Newform International to identify potential  buyers for their products.    The Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees has  established working contacts with Russian ministries and  agencies dealing with investment programs in order to identify  Russian projects financed by foreign and Russian state  institutions and funds, and determine how the International  Investment Center may join in their implementation.    The regional unions of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs  and  Lessees were advised to cooperate more closely with local  administrations in developing and implementing investment  projects and programs, and select concrete projects and designs  for which the International Investment Center could provide, on  a commercial and contract basis, international evaluation and  find foreign investor companies.    The center closely cooperates with such recognized  international specialized companies [as published] as the World  Bank (Washington), the African Development Bank (Abidjan), the  UN Development Program (New York), the UN Food and Agriculture  Organization (Rome), the Asian Development Bank (Manila), and  the Inter-American Development Bank (Washington).  <H5>  Policy Must Be Registration-Based </H5>   How do we stimulate and boost investment? I think that in  order to achieve this it is necessary, in legislative order, to  completely exempt from taxation domestic and foreign investment  in the Russian economy (first and foremost in the development of  small and medium-size business in priority sectors), as well as  give up for a certain period of time taxing profits received.  Incentives must be provided for capital to flow into those  sectors and spheres of activities of small and medium-size  business where the problems of life support and structural  restructuring of the economy are concentrated: food production  and processing, basic necessity goods production, etc. For this,  however, our investment policy regarding potential investors  must finally become based simply on registration. This may be  perhaps one of the most cardinal problems of reforming the  Russian economy today and in the future.    Implementation of the set of priority tasks in the area of  developing small and medium-size business in Russia must not  only ensure the achievement of goals associated with economic  stabilization but also form a positive attitude toward  entrepreneurial activities and the emerging entrepreneurial  class.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S MEMORIES;  </P> <P> AN ODD TROVE OF GIFTS AT THE PRESIDENT'S ALMA MATER PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE  LIGHTER SIDE OF A LEGACY  </P> <P> They are all here. The footballs autographed "for the Gipper," cowboy boots  bearing the presidential seal, T-shirts emblazoned with "Daffy Kadaffy" and  "Hugs Not Drugs," books on topics as obscure as chiropractic ethics and  baseball caps from the Hoboken Democrats.  </P> <P> These are among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of gifts that Ronald and Nancy  Reagan have received during two presidential terms. Now that they are moving  across the country after eight years in the White House, there are a lot of  possessions to sort out with care. Because these items were presented to the  President and his First Lady, in one way or another they bear the stamp of  history.  </P> <P> "A lot of items have been given to the President in eight years. I've never  known of any to be thrown away," White House spokesman Mark Weinberg said.  "Every item is of importance to the Reagans. These gifts are part of the Reagan  presidency. The Reagans don't view (them) as personal gifts but as gifts to the  American people."  </P> <P> Reagan has selected his alma mater, Eureka College, as a repository for what  might be called the light side of his legacy. It was of the picturesque college  here in the heart of Illinois corn country that Reagan, class of '32, said:  "Everything I am started in Eureka." A "C" student known as Dutch, Reagan was  active in theater and student government, lettered in football and was  cheerleader for the basketball team. All the while he worked in the cafeteria  to help pay tuition fees.  </P> <P> Since 1975, Reagan has directed more than 1,000 items from his broadcasting,  film and political careers to the small liberal arts college here, which had  hoped to receive his personal papers. Those papers, however, will be housed at  the future Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif.  </P> <P> The college has packed more than 160 shelves with commemorative plaques Reagan  received from the likes of the U.S. Forest Service and the Touchdown Club of  Washington. The college boasts of hundreds of keys to cities as diverse as  Cleveland, Vallejo, Calif., and Roanoke, Va., and possesses Reagan's lifetime  membership cards to the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn., the Iowa  Sportscasters Assn. and the U.S. Polo Team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Autographed Books  </P> <P> College administrators are now sorting through the contents of about two dozen  cardboard boxes they will add to the Ronald W. Reagan Presidential Memorabilia  Collection that have been shipped from the White House in the last few months.  Among the hundreds of items are books -- some signed by notables such as  Ferdinand Marcos, Jimmy Carter, actress Jane Seymour, Henry Kissinger and Jeane  Kirkpatrick.  </P> <P> Now that amounts to a lot of stuff -- or artifacts -- for the American people  and for Eureka. And, to the untrained eye, some of it may appear less than  historically significant.  </P> <P> Not true, said Ray Browne, a popular culture specialist at Ohio's Bowling Green  University. "This kind of stuff is significant because it reveals a level and  an area of things that social historians 100 years from now will be  tremendously interested in," Browne said. "All of these things are extremely  important, not so much in themselves perhaps but in the total picture."  </P> <P> "I am most interested in the books," Eureka College President George A. Hearne  said of the collection."  </P> <P> Former President Richard M. Nixon's book "Leaders" bears a simple inscription:  "To President Reagan. Another Great Leader." A volume from Sen. Edward M.  Kennedy (D-Mass) about the role of Irish politicians is dated St. Patrick's  Day, 1981, and reads: "For our Irish President from his fellow Irishman."  </P> <P> Beside the gifts the Reagans have received, they have given the college samples  of the gifts the two have bestowed on friends and supporters. Almost all are in  blue boxes with a gold presidential seal and signature. Among them, a tiny  piece of the cork floor removed from the Oval Office in 1969 and preserved in  Lucite, a presidential golf ball, a jar of jelly beans and a yo-yo.  </P> <P> A brass belt buckle that depicts a bronco-busting Reagan on the White House  lawn bears the words "The buckaroo stops here" and represents the "close  connection" Reagan felt with the Southwest, said Lynn Beer, a Eureka College  administrator. Beer, like Hearne, stressed the "special relationship Reagan has  maintained with Eureka College" since his college days that began six decades  ago.  </P> <P> Although they have yet to arrive, Eureka College president Hearne said he  "already can see a set of large black-and-white photographs of Reagan on the  walls of the (campus center) the college has yet to build." The center will,  among other things, house the permanent display the college is planning about  its most famous graduate.  </P> <P> Eureka already possesses a collection of black-and-white stills, many curling  from age, from Reagan's movie days. A photograph from the 1940 film "Knute  Rockne -- All American" in which Reagan played Notre Dame footballer George  Gipp appears not only in the memorabilia collection but in a college  promotional brochure. An assortment of footballs recently shipped from the  White House includes a pigskin signed "One for the Gipper" by a host of Heisman  Trophy winners.  </P> <P> For James Combs, a political scientist at Indiana's Valparaiso University who  studies the role of popular culture in politics, the artifacts to be displayed  at Eureka College are valuable as symbols of popular culture "which Reagan more  than any other President has understood and used."  </P> <P> "I think a lot of people are sorry to see Reagan go because he reminded them of  an idyllic America in which there were no problems, no troubles (and) in which  we had a bright rosy future. Queen Elizabeth once said that the royal family  was in the happiness business. The Reagans have been our popular royalty."  </P></p>

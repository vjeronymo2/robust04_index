			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Pension schemes urged to help former members Occupational pension schemes are being encouraged to re-admit people who followed poor advice to opt out of a scheme and take a personal pension, in a move which would help some victims of pension mis-selling. The call from the National Association of Pension Funds comes less than a week before a report from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, on how to compensate those who have lost out from taking poor advice. These guidelines, expected to be published on Tuesday, will set out what redress should be offered by life insurance companies and independent advisers that mis-sold personal pensions to people opting out of an employer's scheme or transferring a lump sum from a former employer's scheme. While the NAPF statement - which underlines a message in a letter to members in June - should help those who wrongly opted out of a scheme, it is unlikely to assist those who followed bad advice to buy a pension transfer with a lump sum. Most occupational schemes are expected not to reinstate former members in these circumstances. The NAPF is also trying to ease the vast administrative task of trying to compensate for mis-selling, which life companies are routinely describing as a 'nightmare'. One element of reviewing cases is that life companies will have to ask occupational schemes for further information about the benefits they provide. A standard set of fees for occupational schemes to charge life companies, on a non-profit basis, is likely to be agreed shortly between the NAPF and the Association of British Insurers. The two organisations are also near final agreement on standardised forms for providing information, in an effort to make the process run more smoothly. 'Cases to be reviewed will cover individuals who have suffered loss as a result of being mis-sold a personal pension,' Mr Ron Amy, NAPF chairman, said yesterday. 'We have asked our members to respond to any enquiries which will help to remedy these situations.' His statement comes against a background of increasing complaints from life companies about the role of occupational schemes in the sale of pension transfers. Some life companies have been emphasising the duties of schemes' trustees and consulting actuaries to provide proper information that helps people decide whether to transfer out of an occupational scheme.</p>

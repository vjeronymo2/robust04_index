			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Microsoft in Dollars 1.5bn purchase of Intuit Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has agreed to acquire Intuit, publisher of a widely-used personal financial planning program for personal computers, for about Dollars 1.5bn in stock. California-based Intuit is a developer of personal finance, small business accounting and tax preparation software. Intuit's Quicken software enables users to manage their personal and small business finances. The companies said that the deal had been agreed by their respective boards. Under the terms of the agreement, each Intuit share will be exchanged for 1.336 Microsoft shares, with an adjustment designed to ensure a value to Intuit shareholders of at least Dollars 71 per Intuit share. Microsoft said it expected to issue a total of about 27m common shares to pay for the deal. This represents just under 5 per cent of its outstanding shares. 'We believe that as part of Microsoft we will more quickly advance toward our goal of improving people's financial lives and helping financial institutions use the information highway for closer, richer relationships with their customers,' said Mr Scott Cook, Intuit chairman. Mr Cook will become responsible for Microsoft's business in the personal finance sector. 'Scott and I share a vision of how technology can enable people to execute financial transactions and make informed decisions more quickly,' added Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. Personal finance is one of the few segments of the PC software market in which Microsoft is not a market leader. Microsoft's Money program, which competes with Quicken, has not been a big seller, in spite of collaborative agreements with several large banks that link the program to their personal-computer home banking services. To avoid potential anti-trust problems, Microsoft has agreed to divest its existing personal finance product, called Money. It will be sold to Novell, although the terms have not been disclosed. The Microsoft-Intuit agreement was announced after the close of trading yesterday. Shares of Intuit had gained Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 50 1/4 yesterday before trading was halted. Microsoft closed at Dollars 57 1/4, up Dollars 1.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Showdown in Austria on issue of foreigners THE ROW in Austria over the government's policy towards immigrants and refugees will come to a head tomorrow when the radical Freedom Party, led by the charismatic Mr Jorg Haider, proposes the formation of a parliamentary committee to study the controversial foreigner issue. Mr Haider has said he will postpone until the end of the year his threat to launch a national petition to toughen immigration policy if the commission is formed. But Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor and leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, said he would only agree to the committee being formed if the FPO cancelled its threatened petition campaign. On Sunday, Mr Vranitzky led hundreds of people in mounting a ceremonial guard at a Jewish cemetery in Eisenstadt where vandals sprayed anti-Semitic slogans on gravestones. 'This country is the home of all who were born in it and the home of all those born elsewhere, but who live here,' Mr Vranitzky said. 'Whoever desecrates a cemetery, shames both the dead and the living." Mr Haider has outlined 12 demands, including that the government halt all immigration, expel illegal immigrants and limit the proportion of foreigners in any school class to 30 per cent. The issue has been brought to the fore by the arrival of large numbers of refugees from former Yugoslavia.</p>

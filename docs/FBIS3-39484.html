The run-offs were held  in the bewildering absence of the old party symbols, abandoned  by virtually all candidates to avoid association with such  scandal-tainted parties as the Christian Democratic and  Socialist parties, former powerhouses on the island.    In the only provincial vote yesterday, among the 14 mayoral  run-offs on the island, 39.47 percent of the voters in the  Catania province picked Nello Musumeci, the candidate for  assembly president for the neofascist MSI [Italian Social  Movement], over moderate Pact for Italy hopeful Stelio  Mangiameli. Out of the turnout, which compared to 60.59 percent  in the first round of balloting, 66.35 percent of the valid  votes went to Musumeci, 38, who becomes province's 54th  president.    Also captured by the right were the mayors' offices in  Acireale and Acate with one, in Santa Teresa Riva, near Messina,  taken by a moderate.    On the left, a mayoral candidate on a Democratic Party of  the  Left slate scored victory in Ribera to lead the way for the nine  other left candidates awarded the keys to the offices in their  municipalities. One, Vincenzo Lota', vied successfully in the  town of Menfi against Guido Lo Porto, a member of the Rome Lower  House for the neofascist MSI.    In Santa Lucia del Mela, moderate mayoral candidate  Francesco  La Camera dropped out of the race after the first round of  voting when he received an unspecified Mafia threat, a move  which prompted his fair-minded adversary, Santo Marcaione, to  urge the townspeople to abandon the polling places. The voters  here largely heeded the call and the turnout of 24.67 percent  nullified the run-off because it fell far short of the 50  percent turnout required by law.    Santa Lucia del Mela will try again in 90 days time, after  the March 27 general elections for a new Rome parliament.</p>

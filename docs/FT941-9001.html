			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Hong Kong cargo forecast to treble Cargo handled by Hong Kong's port, which has been ensnared in a Sino-British political row, is set to increase threefold by the year 2011, underlining the urgent need for new capacity, the Port Development Board said yesterday, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The board forecast container handling demand would be nearly 32m 20-foot (6-metre) equivalent units - the standard measure of container traffic - from 9m last year. Forecast growth rates for all cargo were similar. 'The massive increase in cargo throughput. . . underlines Hong Kong's urgent need for a new port,' it said in a statement. Hong Kong's container port, the busiest in the world, is enjoying a boom because of rapid industrialisation in neighbouring south China. But it has also become entangled in the dispute about Governor Chris Patten's drive to widen democracy in the colony before it reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The Hong Kong government awarded the right to build and operate a ninth container terminal to three consortia as long ago as November 1992, but work has not yet started because China has refused to endorse the project. Ironically, China would be the main beneficiary as most cargo passing through the port is composed of raw materials heading for south China factories or finished products en route to export markets in the west. To cope with the increase, up to 25 new container berths would be needed at a planned 10th container terminal on Lantau island, near the site where Hong Kong is building a new airport, the board said. The airport is another infrastructure project caught up in the political row. The board forecast there will be a need for the first berth of the Lantau port to begin operation in mid-1997 when the Tsing Ma suspension bridge opens. The bridge will link Hong Kong's urban areas to the new port and the new Chek Lap Kok airport.</p>

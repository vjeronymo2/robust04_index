			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chae-ho] </F>   [Text] It has been confirmed that North Korea is  experimenting with privatizing cultivation rights for farmland  in limited areas.    Relevant government authorities in charge of North Korean  economic affairs on 5 March said: Since the second half of  1993, North Korea has been instituting, on a trial basis, a  system for privatizing land cultivation rights for farmers in  certain areas by which the North Korean authorities take a  certain proportion of the harvested farm produce as a fee for  the land and the farmers privately own the remainder of the farm  produce.    The government official in charge of North Korean economic  affairs said the government authorities have recently learned  that North Korea has been secretly instituting this experimental  reform measure in areas such as Hoeryong in North Hamgyong  Province, where the residents are mostly political prisoners.  North Korea is instituting this measure secretively on a family  basis and is thoroughly cutting off the areas from the outside.  The government official said: "North Korea seems to be  experimenting on capitalist market economy principles by partly  permitting cultivation rights and maintaining the present North  Korean system to solve its serious food shortage problem." The  official added, "North Korea selected the areas where political  prisoners live for the experiment in order to closely study the  possible effect of the change on the maintenance of the present  North Korean system through the people most critical of the  present North Korean system."    Another expert on North Korean affairs commented: "This is a  significant change as it represents signs of a North Korean  experiment on new land reform for the first time in 36 years  since private ownership and land cultivation rights disappeared  in North Korea in 1958."</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: Scotland shows landlords how Sir, I read with interest the article by Vanessa Houlder on the property page ('Landlords' common front', February 21) dealing with the fears of English landlords in the face of proposals to repeal legislation that allows recovery of unpaid rent from former tenants. Perhaps I could spread some calm by pointing out that in Scotland it has never been the case that a tenant who assigns is required to remain liable for these conditions in the case of default by the assignee. The system works satisfactorily and in itself has no effect on capital values. Obviously in the alienation clause of the lease, Scottish landlords ensure there are stiff conditions imposed in their favour for approval of assignations, particularly with regard to financial strength. The route of sub-letting of the space is always open where of course the original tenant does indeed remain liable for his sub-tenants' performance. If English solicitors consult their Scottish counterparts they should find well established solid rules that can be adopted to nullify the politicians' excesses.

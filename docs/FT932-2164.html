			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Vintage Osborne - Theatre THE Royal National Theatre is absolutely right to have revived John Osborne's Inadmissible Evidence. In some ways it looks an even better play today than when it was first performed at the Royal Court nearly 30 years ago. What may once have seemed mildly shocking now looks like a mature commentary on the social scene of the early 1960s. The divorce law was a painful charade; lawyers and clients had to resort to casuistry, if not worse, to get it to work at all. Osborne's dilemma of never being sure of whether he prefers the past to the present comes out just as clearly in Inadmissible Evidence as it does in his earlier Look Back in Anger. Does he like the seediness that at least allows divorce to take place, or does he condemn it? Is he hurt because too much has changed, or too little? Is he a reformer or a reactionary? The fact that it's hard to answer shows what a good playwright he can be. The opening scene of Inadmissible Evidence suggests a deep suspicion of Harold Wilson with his promises (threats?) of the technological revolution and the triumph of science. That was in 1964 when Wilson's reputation as a potential reformer was at its height, so Osborne may have been prescient in expressing doubts. On the other hand, what now seems far and away the best scene in the play concerns a mild-mannered, married homosexual who has been caught by the police. The portrait of the man is entirely sympathetic. It is one of the most moving scenes that Osborne has written. Here is Osborne in the unexpected role of thoughtful, liberal reformer, slightly ahead of his time. In Di Trevis's production at the Lyttelton, the homosexual scene is central to the play. It comes after Bill Maitland, the lecherous, heavy-drinking, pill-taking solicitor has heard one woman's petition after another for divorce. All those women are played, as Osborne always planned, by the same actress - here, Lynn Farleigh. Maitland takes them through their complaints while reflecting on his own infidelities. The frisson comes when he finds that a male client can tell a similar, seedy tale about homosexual affairs. The stroke of brilliance is that the man is played by the same actor who earlier appeared as a junior clerk in the solicitors' office and was much despised by Maitland. Again this is not a new gloss by Ms Trevis; it was what Osborne always specified. Still, it takes acute direction to bring it off. Ms Trevis succeeds magnificently, as does Jason Watkins in the dual role of Jones the clerk and Maples the client. Incidentally, the references to local place names, like Gunnersbury, in the Maples story may help to explain why John Betjeman so admired the play. Ideally Inadmissible Evidence would end shortly after that. The piece, however, contains some of the worst as well as the best of Osborne, the worst being his inability to stop while the going is good. Thus in the last 30 minutes of a 3 1/4 hour show the structure collapses, and it is a spurious, undeveloped part of the plot that the Law Society should be after Maitland for cutting corners. The man has already fallen apart. One other peculiarity. Trevor Eve's Maitland makes an implausible recovery from vomiting and drunkenness in the office early in the morning to more or less normal behaviour without even a shave or a shower. Surely someone must have noticed the stubble. Nicol Williamson in the Royal Court production made the role more convincingly dissolute and physically neurotic. Eve has to cope with the bigger space at the Lyttelton, which is not wholly to his advantage. He does not dominate, but you could say that this makes the first 2 1/2 hours a better play.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Leonid Kravchuk by unidentified </F> reporter from "Without Protocol" program; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] Our concept  stipulates that Ukraine should have combat-ready Armed Forces  capable of defending its sovereignty and independence at any  point. That is why we are conducting a strategic command staff  exercise. These are not military maneuvers and no technical  equipment is being used, although we have already been accused  of the opposite. There have been attempts to say that because  Ukraine has no possibility to conduct such undertakings  [military maneuvers]; it is holding a staff exercise. I want to  point out to these gentlemen that if necessity arises, Ukraine  will find strategic reserves and a possibility to use the  equipment available in the Armed Forces. However, we have set no  such task -- the task was absolutely different; but when people  do not know what they want, or they see their strategic goals in  spreading lies about Ukraine, we treat this with understanding.  [words indistinct]    [Reporter] As the commander in chief, can you say whether  Ukraine is capable of defending itself?    [Kravchuk] Resolving the problem of reforming the Armed  Forces is not the same as resolving the problem of defense  capability. I mean that we have arrived at the conclusions  about the current state of our Armed Forces and all other  structures and how ready we are in case of necessity. We will  do everything to prevent such necessities, but troops exist and  their normal task is to train. I believe that we can tell our  people that the Ukrainian Armed Forces along with other  ministries and departments involved in this [sphere], are  capable of cooperating and performing their functions regarding  the protection of Ukraine's interests, its national border, the  people, and their peaceful labor.    There are problems in supplies of say, lubricants and  appropriate resources; there are personnel, discipline, and  responsibility problems -- all this was demonstrated very  vividly during the exercise and we saw that this [exercise]  should have been conducted earlier. We were preoccupied with  things like transforming a corps into a division or a division  into a corps... or reducing military districts and expanding  them. [words indistinct] Today, we have set a strategic goal --  that of Ukraine's defense, the readiness of both the Armed  Forces and others for this sacred task of state defense. This  is a qualitatively new task. This has been the first exercise  and thus, I cannot give a precise and full answer about it. I  believe that when we meet again at future exercises, we will be  able to speak about their significance. However, even today we  should say that it was needed and has brought considerable  benefits.</p>

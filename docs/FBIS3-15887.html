Around 60  people crossed the border today from the direction of  Afghanistan. At 0800 local time the border detail went into  battle, together with a Tajikistan national security detachment.  The majority of the group were destroyed.    It is possible that at 2200 we will receive a report from  the  scene. We hope so.</p>

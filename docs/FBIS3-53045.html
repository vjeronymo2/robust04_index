Since Japan maintains a  wide-ranging relationship with Iran, Deputy Foreign Minister  Yosi Beilin briefed the guest on the MIA's issue. The Japanese  vice minister also met with Shim'on Sheves, the director general  of the Prime Minister's Office, and with Foreign Ministry  Director General Uri Savir, both of whom raised the importance  of closer economic relations between the two countries and the  issue of El Al's landing privileges in Japan. Shim'on Sheves  told the visiting vice minister that the situation in which  Israel buys $1 billion worth of Japanese goods, while Japan  avoids investing in Israel, is unacceptable.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Lebanese leaders review troop deployment LEBANON'S leaders began top-level talks in Damascus yesterday after Syria had voiced concern over the Beirut government's plans to deploy troops in the south of the country, recently subjected to a week-long bombardment by Israel. The announcement of the troop deployment had been welcomed by Israel and the US. Both countries saw the move as an attempt by the Lebanese government to control the activities of the Iranian-backed Hizbollah guerrillas. It was the attacks by Hizbollah on Israeli troops occupying the southern strip of Lebanon which sparked the furious Israeli response, forcing more than 300,000 people from their homes and leaving at least 120 dead. In the past two years the Lebanese army has collected most of the heavy weapons of the militia forces, except those of Hizbollah, which is deemed to be fighting a war of national liberation. The initial announcement from Beirut that it was sending troops to the south was seen as an attempt to extend its authority over a wider area of Lebanon. However, in the face of Syrian opposition, only 300 troops have been sent south and no further deployment is expected. Syria, which maintains more than 30,000 of its own troops in Lebanon, appears to have been alarmed that the movement of Lebanese forces would be viewed as a diplomatic victory for Israel. In a long interview with a Beirut newspaper, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria stressed that it was his duty and that of the Beirut government to strengthen the resistance and if necessary to protect it. 'Maybe at times we need to guide it, but only to increase its effectiveness,' he said. The seriousness of Syrian concern was underlined by the presence in Damascus yesterday of the top three members of the Lebanese leadership, President Elias Hrawi, Mr Rafik al-Hariri, the prime minister, and Mr Nabih Berri, the speaker of the national assembly. It is believed in Beirut that the Lebanese leaders, anxious to provide security for villagers returning to the south, announced the deployment of the army without consulting Syria, or perhaps taking fully into consideration the wider interests of Damascus. Syria has been accused by some Israeli and US leaders of using Hizbollah to increase its leverage at the Middle East peace negotiations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 23 Dec (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a report  meeting series organized by the CPC Central Committee's  Propaganda Department and other units on implementation of the  "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, Yao Zhenyan, vice minister in charge of the State  Planning Commission, reported on the objectives and progress of  China's ongoing investment and financial restructuring.    Yao Zhenyan said: With gradual delegation of powers in fixed  assets investments and the introduction of market mechanisms  since China embarked on its reform and opening up programs 15  years ago, a new structure is being developed. Investment  units, which in the past depended heavily on state  appropriations for investment funds, have shifted to raise their  own funds through such means as bank loans, financial  allocations, and utilization of foreign funds. The role of main  investor -- primarily played by the central government in the  past -- has been taken over by local governments in cooperation  with the central government, by state-owned enterprises, by  collective enterprises, by individuals, and by foreign firms.  The format of investment has been shifted from near exclusive  government investment in the past to joint investment between  the central and the local governments, between local  governments, between governments and enterprises, and between  enterprises; as well as to Sino-foreign joint ventures and  cooperation. The format for expanding reproduction has changed;  rather than relying heavily on new projects and items as in the  past, equal emphasis is being laid simultaneously on technical  transformation of existing enterprises to broaden their internal  reproduction. Administrative assignment of constructing  investment projects has given way to tender and bidding.    In meeting the requirements of the 14th CPC National  Congress  on the establishment of a socialist market economic system, Yao  Zhenyan maintained that, obviously, the current investment and  financial system is still rather incompatible for facilitating  markets to truly play the fundamental role in disposing of  resources under state macroeconomic control. Judging from the  actual situation prevailing in the current investment field,  problems do exist prominently in the following three aspects.  First, the scale of investment is overextended, as reflected  mainly in excessive investments. Second, the structure of  investment is irrational; and a large amount of funds are being  diverted to low-level, low- efficiency overlapping construction  or blind development of real estates or development zones,  leaving little for bottleneck departments and key construction  projects. Third, low investment efficiency, huge amounts of  waste, unregulated fund-raising, and indiscriminate borrowing  have worsened the irrational disposal of resources, raised  investment costs, and lowered the macro efficiency of investment.    To fundamentally resolve problems existing in the investment  and financial field, we must start with reform and establish an  investment and financial system compatible with a socialist  market economy. The overall objective of restructuring is to  reform the investment and financial format by fully bringing out  the market's regulatory role in investment and financial  activities; to establish a mechanism aimed at reducing the  investment risks of enterprises who, as main investors, have to  make their own decisions and face risks; to perfect the indirect  regulatory system on aggregate investments and structure  compatible with a socialist market economic system so that  timely and effective regulation and control can be effected; and  to establish an investment-related service system and essential  factors markets to ensure fair competition under relevant laws  and regulations.    Yao Zhenyao said: In the near future, reforms covering the  following six aspects will be carried out actively but prudently  and will gradually be implemented:    -- On the basis of efficiency, market demands, and the  nature  of investment and financial activities, construction projects  will be classified into competitive, infrastructure, and public  welfare project investments. A new financing format will be  formulated, under which enterprises will become main players in  competitive project investment with the market as their main  source of financing; infrastructure project investment will be  invested and financed by the central government, with increased  participation from local governments and enterprises; and  governments will be primarily responsible for investment in  public welfare projects.    -- We will establish mechanisms aimed at reducing  investment risks, and change the methods for deciding on and the  procedures for examining and approving projects. A legal person  is essential before a project is decided upon. In order to  expand the decisionmaking powers of legal persons, they may  conduct feasibility studies and work out tentative plans for  competitive investment projects meeting the requirements of the  state industrial policy.    -- As far as macro regulation and control over investments  are concerned, the central government will work out unified  regulatory and control policies and objectives to be carried out  by both the central and provincial governments. Provincial  investment companies will be the main source of investment for  local infrastructure projects.    -- In reforming methods for planning management, the total  volume of investments will no longer be controlled by a set  planned target but through the source of funds, using economic  means for indirect regulation and control. There will be no  targets for individual investments at the provincial, municipal,  and autonomous levels, while the supervision of collective  investments by local authorities will be intensified according  to the state industrial policy and actual local conditions.    -- Policy lending must be separated from commercial loans.  While projects in line with state industrial policy may get  loans from commercial banks, it is up to the project operators  and the banks concerned to mutually select each other and take  their own risks; government departments can only provide  guidance.    -- We will formulate a central policy on investment and  financial system and organize the establishment of a state  development bank.</p>

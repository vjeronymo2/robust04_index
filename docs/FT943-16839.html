			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Gatt still at odds over entry for China Developing countries yest-erday stepped up demands for China's early entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But the US and European Union insisted Beijing must make substantial concessions before it can join. The divergent approaches emerged after four days of talks in Geneva, at which China reaffirmed its desire to be a founding member of the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed Gatt early next year. The strength of developing countries' calls for China's early admission surprised some delegates. However, the US and EU said they would not agree to China's entry on terms which diluted the impact of last year's Uruguay Round trade deal. Further progress in the talks would depend on how quickly Beijing proposed acceptable arrangements. 'The Chinese have got to deal and compromise, and there has been no sign yet that they are ready to,' said one delegate from an industrialised country. The US is adamant Beijing must fully meet Gatt obligations on entry. The EU is prepared to allow China a transition period after it joins, though it suggested yesterday it might seek provisions to re-open negotiations on Beijing's accession agreement after it becomes a member. Though this week's talks produced no breakthroughs, Gatt members appear to be edging towards agreement on a draft protocol for China's accession, based on a paper by Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the Swiss economy minister who is chairing the talks. Gatt members have until July 13 to submit amendments. A revised version will be put to a meeting of the China membership working party on July 29. Substantive negotiations with China are not expected before September.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / What They Say in Europe: War and peace NEW CRISES create new reputations, yet old images take time to fade. The Berliner Zeitung was thinking along these lines in looking at the ramifications of the Bosnian crisis. 'The cliche of the ugly German is widespread among other peoples. It has, unfortunately, been formed by the experience our neighbours have had of us. But one sits up and listens when, almost overnight, the leaders of opinion in the US - where mistrust runs deep because of the holocaust - point to Germany as the example to follow. One rejoices all the more because the metamorphosis of the German image is linked to a humanitarian question, the Bosnian refugee tragedy.' The BZ had no great hopes that the new image would prove durable. On the other hand the Serbs will have problems in overcoming their new reputation. People like myself who had worked in Serbia before the present horrors usually found the natives a cheery bunch with whom one could enjoy a few laughs and more than a few drinks. Today they are known as the originators of 'ethnic cleansing.' This ghastly euphemism translates into every known language and has helped ensure that no cartoonist can attempt a picture of a Serb without making him a wild-eyed fanatic. As a result history is being revised; references to Sarajevo naturally recall that that was where the First World War started; today the implication is that the Serbs started it - but then Serbia never had much of an image anyway. Reputations have become fantastically volatile. Until recently in much of Europe, the average Spaniard was seen as a feckless poseur, either attempting to entertain the foreign ladies who aestivate on local shores or a well-born layabout who can hardly afford a shirt but always sports a flashy cloak. Today, after the Olympics, Spaniards, or do I mean Catalans, are seen in a different light - purveyors of efficiency with a human face. The Italians have revised their opinion: in Corriere della Sera, Cesare Fiumi unwittingly reworked the traditional Spanish toast - health, money and love] - 'Pesetas, practice, preparations. Spain in three words.' The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, exclaimed, 'The city of Barcelona is the great victor of these Games.' The French sports paper, L'Equipe was more cautious: 'It may well be that one of the great victors of these Games is called Spain.' The previous week France-Soir had paid the ultimate compliment - the record haul of French medals could be attributed to the hosts and was a contrast with French failures at Seoul. 'Now, near to their base, in a familiar country, the family at hand, the frontier nearby, with no time change, their minds not elsewhere - the French competitors can concentrate on their objectives and refine their preparations. On the evidence, the Barcelona Games inspire them. The food there is abundant and appetising, there is a cheerful organisation supplying just enough of those snags one needs to feel in a human environment. In fact the French hate being taken for foreigners. They need their comforts to feel at home.' So, by the time it was all over the Spaniards knew they had won. The headline in El Pais was: 'Barcelona ends the 'best games in history' with 22 Spanish medals.' James Morgan is the diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

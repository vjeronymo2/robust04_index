			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Philippines opens door to foreign banks More foreign banks are to be allowed into the Philippines under a measure signed yesterday by President Fidel Ramos. The move ends a 45-year ban on the entry of foreign banks and is part of reforms improving global access to the country's economy. It also meets one of the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for new credits of about Dollars 650m to support a three-year growth programme. Tax measures to bolster the national government revenues and narrow its chronic budget deficits have already been introduced. Mr Ramos said the new law represented 'one clear signal. . . . that we are deeply serious in our aim to put an end to protectionist tendencies that have coddled many of our industries into inefficiency and non-competitiveness'. The local banking industry has often been criticised for its inefficiency in mobilising domestic savings. Costs have remained high and real interest rates on savings have consistently been below the annual inflation rate. There are 32 commercial banks currently operating in the Philippines of which only four - Citibank, Bank of America, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Standard Chartered - are branches of foreign banks. The new banking law allows the entry of up to 10 foreign banks in the next five years, after which the sector will again be restricted to Filipino-owned new entries. The foreign banks may come in either as owners (of up to 60 per cent) of new or existing banks, or as full-service branches. The new banks will be allowed up to six branches each, with a capital requirement of not less than 210m pesos (Pounds 5.2m) for the first three and 35m pesos for the others. The minimum capital requirement is among the highest in south-east Asia, according to banking analysts. The law also requires that, despite the entry of foreign banks, at least 70 per cent of the banking system's total resources must be owned by Philippine entities. The four foreign banks now operating had combined resources of 75.5bn pesos at end of 1993, or 8.9 per cent of the total assets of the whole banking system, according to industry records. Sources in the banking community say Bank of Tokyo, Deutsche Bank and Bangkok Bank are among the interested foreign institutions. The new law welcomes only those among the top 150 banks in the world, and the top five in their country of origin. The four foreign banks currently operating in the Philippines were actually in operation when the law restricting the industry to locally owned banks was enacted in 1948.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Lloyd's reporting change delayed Lloyd's of London has postponed plans for ending its three-year accounting system after discovering that the change requires European Union rules to be modified. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said the setback was 'frustrating'. For new corporate members, allowed to invest in the insurance market for the first time this year, the move means 1994 profits are likely to published in 1997, not 1996 as expected. Lloyd's regards the three-year accounting system as outdated, with the insurance market becoming more dependent on investment from companies rather than Names - individual's whose assets have traditionally supported it. It hoped to move to a two-year accounting period next year when it was planning to report results for both 1992 and 1993. That would have meant expected losses in 1992 being reported with figures showing the market returning to profitability in 1993. Lloyd's said yesterday that when the plans were unveiled in September legal opinion was divided over whether references to the market in the EU insurance accounts directive would require modification. It said: 'It is now clear that the text will have to be changed and the Department of Trade and Industry has advised that this may take up to two years or possibly longer.'</p>

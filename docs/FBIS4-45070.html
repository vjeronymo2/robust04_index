			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ury Nir: "The Reminder of Normandy"] </F>   [Text] Washington -- A wave of heroic nostalgia is sweeping  America these days on the eve of the celebrations of the  anniversary of the landing of the Allied forces at Normandy.  Memorial ceremonies and lectures in the schools, films about  World War II on television stations, and special supplements in  the daily and weekly press. But these celebrations, especially  the share of the administering of them, are full of irony. For  if the invasion of Normandy, the beginning of the end of World  War II, symbolized the beginning of 50 years of active American  intervention overseas, the Clinton administration constitutes  the end of that era, and the allies of the United States again  yearn for determined American leadership.    In recent weeks, the Clinton administration has lost yet  another large measure of prestige and strength overseas. From  Korea to Haiti, from China to Bosnia, the foes of the U.S.A. are  learning that it is possible, and sometimes even worthwhile, to  oppose it. Its friends are learning that it is difficult to rely  on it. As the days of the Clinton administration go by, it  becomes clearer that what appeared to his predecessor, George  Bush, as a mission, appears to Clinton as a nuisance.    On his way to the White House, Clinton thought, justifiably,  that the American public held the strength of the president in  the internal sphere to be more important than his power  overseas. Now it is becoming clear to him that the slogan "It's  the economy, stupid" was a good election slogan that blew the  right wind in the sails of his campaign, but in the White House  it is turning into a squall that is liable even to throw its  passengers overboard. The public opinion polls prove that  Clinton's weakness in the foreign sphere is not overlooked by  the public and impairs his popularity.    The American people are indeed more interested in internal  matters than foreign affairs, but it wants to see a strong,  determined, and proud president. Clinton's weak hesitation in  the sphere of foreign relations, therefore, harms not only the  image of the U.S.A. in the world, but also his own image.    When the subject is humanitarian failures of the  administration, which was supposed to stress this aspect in its  foreign policy, so be it. President Clinton did not make even  one harsh denunciation of the insane genocide raging in Rwanda.  As far as intervention, it is understood that there is nothing  to talk about.    When the President disavows his promises to exert heavy  pressure on China in the area of human rights, so be it. When  the military junta in Haiti mocks loudly the promises of the  American President to return Jean Bertrand Aristide to the  presidency, so be it. Clinton's image can be forgiven. To a  certain extent, America's image, as well. But when things get to  the point of a threat to world peace, the negligence of the  world's only superpower is criminal negligence.    The reference is to the North Korean crisis--the events  around the efforts for nuclear armament of Pyongyang have become  complicated, and the dynamic of the events is too complicated  for the American press to give them proper coverage. It may be  assumed that the majority of the American public is not  completely aware that an isolated state, with an unstable  regime, about developments in which there is scanty intelligence  information, is developing nuclear weapons under the nose of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and is threatening  explicitly to use them against one of the main allies of  America, South Korea.    The present crisis is going on in a region of the highest  strategic importance to the United States. Again and again, the  North Koreans are going against the U.S.A. and the entire world,  either by selling ballistic missiles to countries like Iran and  Syria, or by their nuclear tricks.    Washington's policy of appeasement has failed. "For every  step that we take in order to slow (the North Koreans' nuclear  race) they take two steps in order to speed the process," said  the American expert on nuclear affairs Leonard Spector, in an  interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES. Even after the  director-general of the IAEA, Hans Blix, announced last Friday  that its inspection delegation cannot carry out its mission  properly because the North Koreans are deliberately speeding up  the pace of the refueling of the reactor at the Yongbyon site,  Washington responded slowly and moderately. The Security Council  was only convened three days later, and the announcement that it  issued was a call to North Korea to slow the process, and not a  warning that contained a threat.    Clearly, there is no quick and easy solution to the problem  of North Korea. The way to handle Pyongyang's nuclear refusal  must be many-sided, and it must rely on cooperation of the  countries of the region, especially of Japan and China. The main  deficiency of the Clinton administration in the foreign sphere  is its weakness in creating international coalitions. This  weakness reflects the entire range of problems of the  administration in the foreign sphere. For the building of a  coalition requires trust and credibility between Washington and  each of the potential members of the coalition, and such  credibility is built up by a strong and stable foreign policy,  by determination and perseverance, by radiating leadership.  These characteristics are lacking in the relations of the U.S.A.  both with its friends and with its rivals.    China celebrated recently the victory of its strong stand  against the hesitant American pressures in the sphere of human  rights, when Clinton ended the connection between the trade  relations with Beijing and the human rights situation there. The  U.S.A.'s European allies "reached the conclusion that they  cannot work constructively with this administration," in the  words of the commentator Jim Hoagland in the newspaper THE  WASHINGTON POST, "and they are simply trying to suffer it in  silence."    The place to rehabilitate the credibility of the United  States is not the blood-soaked shores of Normandy, but the  Korean peninsula.</p>

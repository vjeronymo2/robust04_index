			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Letter: Presidential election no inhibitor of Uruguay Round progress Sir, You quote (World Trade News, February 5) EC vice-president Franz Andriessen as saying that if the Uruguay Round of the Gatt is not concluded by around Easter, nothing more can happen in 1992 because of the US presidential election and 'its heavy stress on isolationism and economic nationalism will thereafter close that window for the remainder of 1992'. Mr Andriessen, being the gentleman that he is, conveniently uses the US elections as an inhibitor. Perhaps he should look at election uncertainties closer to home as a cause of the lack of real progress in the Uruguay Round. Last week, the French Socialists lost six important by-elections; this might inhibit President Mitterrand from relaxing his position on agricultural subsidy reform. The Italian election is set for April 5, and your report is that the parties in power are pretty shaky. Of course, there is the approaching election in Britain where the polls see-saw virtually daily. Ireland's prime minister just fell. Chancellor Kohl's party seems to be having some problems. And so forth in the EC. Beyond the EC, Canada's prime minister's standing is low in the polls. Australia's prime minister has changed, and there are rumours circulating concerning a possible shortened term for the Japanese prime minister. And so forth around the world. Hence, laying a possible delay wholly on US elections (and, incidentally, the congressional elections should be more of a concern than the presidential election) may be convenient for EC commissioners, but such inaccurate finger pointing is not all that helpful in dealing with the real problems of the Uruguay Round. From an American viewpoint, more leadership from the EC and Japan would be welcome. Harry L Freeman, The Freeman Company, 1101 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Suite 510, Washington DC, US</p>

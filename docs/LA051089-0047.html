			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL IS SUED OVER ALLEGED RAPE OF GIRL  </P> <P> The family of a comatose 11-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by a nurse's  aide at a San Diego convalescent hospital has filed suit against the facility  for negligence and fraud.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in San Diego Superior Court on April 28, alleges that LEIR  Institutes Inc. and Alvarado Convalescent and Rehabilitation Hospital did not  adequately staff the facility, or properly supervise their employees, thereby  setting the stage for the attack.  </P> <P> Last December, the girl was admitted as a patient at the Lake Erie Institute of  Rehabilitation, a "state-of-the-art" long-term care facility for people with  traumatic head injuries, which occupies a wing of the hospital on Alvarado  Road. She had been in a semi-coma since being thrown from a car during an  accident two months earlier.  </P> <P> The girl was allegedly raped on Christmas Eve, and a 22-year-old nursing  assistant, Noel A. Sanchez, was later arrested and charged with the crime.  Sanchez, a Clairemont resident, is currently being held in County Jail awaiting  trial June 9 on charges of forcible rape and child molestation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus of Suit  </P> <P> Though Sanchez is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, the focus of the suit is  primarily against the hospital, said attorney John J. McAvoy. "Whether or not  Mr. Sanchez is guilty, . . . it was the atmosphere at (the hospital) that  allowed it to happen," McAvoy said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that hospital employees noticed the girl was bleeding early  Christmas morning but did not report it to a doctor until Dec. 29. An  examination showed the girl had a four-inch tear in her vagina and had lost  about one-seventh of her blood, according to the suit.  </P> <P> The lawsuit further maintains that the hospital knew that the LEIR unit was  understaffed and poorly supervised, but that it was more concerned with turning  a profit than ensuring patients' safety.  </P> <P> Attorney Richard Barton, who represents LEIR, said he had not yet seen the  lawsuit and declined comment on the allegations.  </P> <P> The girl is now living with her mother in Riverside County. Her condition has  improved since December, but she is still not fully conscious, McAvoy said. "We  are not making any suggestion that her (coma) is a result of this rape, but the  fact that she had this subsequent life-threatening trauma hasn't helped her  any," McAvoy said. "I have had doctors tell me that the environment in which  you place a semi-comatose child like this has a great deal to do with if she  ever makes a full recovery."  </P> <P> In January, Alvarado Convalescent Hospital was cited for a safety violation and  fined $30,000 by the the state Health Services Department for failure to  adequately diagnose the girl's injury, treat the wound or notify a doctor. The  fine was reduced to $15,000 because the hospital did not contest the citation  and promptly paid the state fine.  </P> <P> Hillhaven West Inc., the operator of Alvarado Convalescent Hospital, was cited  three times in 1988 for dangerous and/or unsafe nursing care. However, no  action has been taken to revoke or suspend the hospital's license, state Health  Service Department spokesman Ernie Trujillo said Tuesday.  </P></p>

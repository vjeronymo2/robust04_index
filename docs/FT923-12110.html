			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Israeli hopes rise over Dollars 10bn loan pledges ISRAEL is optimistic it will receive Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in US loan guarantees which have been blocked by Washington for more than a year in protest at continued Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories. Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, said yesterday he expected that 'the sums will be at our disposal' by the end of this year or the beginning of next. Diplomatic and economic processes were 'carrying us into a new period, with a changed set of priorities', he said. A US official travelling with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said: 'We are hopeful we are going to be able to resolve this but we have not finalised it.' Last night Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Shochat formally resubmitted the request for loan guarantees to Mr Baker. The request was made in February 1991 by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former prime minister. The Labour government believes its willingness to curb settlements will persuade Washington to grant the guarantees. These were intended to aid absorption of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. Israeli and Palestinian leaders said progress had been made towards revitalising Middle East peace negotiations - due to resume in Rome in September - in a day of talks in Jerusalem with Mr Baker. Mr Rabin travels to Cairo today to meet President Hosni Mubarak for the first Israeli-Egyptian summit since 1986. The meeting will rejuvenate the peace process after Mr Rabin's victory last month over Mr Shamir's hardline Likud government. Cairo summit, Page 4</p>

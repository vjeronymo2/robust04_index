			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / McDonough to take over as NY Fed president MR WILLIAM McDonough was appointed yesterday as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, one of the key jobs in central banking. Mr McDonough, 59, whose appointment takes effect on Monday, will take over from Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed since 1985. As president of the most important of the US's 12 reserve banks, he will play a central role in protecting the health of the US financial system. The choice of Mr McDonough, who had effectively been Mr Corrigan's number two at the bank, had been widely expected. Mr McDonough was a vice-chairman of First Chicago, one of the biggest US commercial banks, until he retired six years ago. Over a 22-year career, he had built up a reputation as a pragmatic, careful banker with a good command of detail. As head of the Fed's financial markets group for the past 18 months, Mr McDonough has held the most influential position in determining the day-to-day progress of monetary conditions in the US He has also been responsible for the handling of the Fed's foreign exchange policy at a time when the dollar has risen sharply against other currencies. Although Mr McDonough's appointment is likely to bring a change of style to the leadership of the Fed after the forceful Mr Corrigan, it was not expected yesterday to make a significant difference to the conduct of monetary policy in the US. The Fed president will also become vice-chairman of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC will next meet on August 17 when Mr McDonough will cast his first vote on monetary policy matters. Mr McDonough's succession gives no clues as to when the Fed may next begin to tighten interest rate policy, said Mr Stephen Slifer, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. A father of six, Mr McDonough's close connections with his home town of Chicago include numerous directorships of local bodies, including the Chicago Historical Society.</p>

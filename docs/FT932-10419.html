			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Watchdog to probe mortgage valuations ONE OF the more irritating costs incurred by homebuyers wanting a mortgage is paying a valuation fee to the lender, even if they have commissioned their own structural survey of the property. This practice was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Thursday by the Office of Fair Trading, after complaints that borrowers are being overcharged. The inquiry will be directed at 'the agreements and practices in the making or procuring of mortgage valuations, and the making of charges for such valuations,' according to the OFT. Most lenders offer borrowers a choice of valuation services - the most basic is more for the lender's benefit than the borrower's. 'The Building Societies Act requires that the lender takes adequate steps to ensure that a property is good security on which to lend,' said a spokesman for Halifax building society, the largest lender. 'That is why we require a valuation report.' The fee for this report is paid by the borrower and is usually a brief statement of the price the valuer puts on the property. The borrower can opt for more detailed reports, including a full structural survey. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said he was referring the matter to the MMC because he was concerned that lenders have little incentive to keep down the cost of the service, as it is passed on to the homebuyer. He was also concerned that borrowers lacked choice in the amount they have to pay because they had little opportunity to 'shop around' to cut the cost. He said house buyers pay more than Pounds 100m a year for mortgage valuations. John Cox, group chief surveyor at Abbey National, the second largest lender, said he was 'rather surprised' at the decision. 'I am confident that our policy is fully justified and that it is in the best interests of the homebuyer.' Abbey National charges Pounds 175 for a valuation on a home purchase price of Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 335 for a more detailed report on the property. The Halifax charges Pounds 165 and Pounds 330. The OFT also said there had been 'a great many complaints' from bodies representing valuers and surveyors that some mortgage lenders are restricting the ability of some surveyors to compete. It said borrowers had been complaining about fee increases. There were also complaints from valuers and surveyors that some lenders choose valuers on the basis of the number of other borrowers they can refer to the lender. The OFT was also concerned about complaints that many lenders seemed increasingly unwilling to accept, for mortgage valuation purposes, house surveys already carried out for a potential borrower. John Cox said that there was no reason that a surveyor employed by a borrower to carry out a structural survey would be qualified to make a valuation. 'Structure is one thing. You need local knowledge to value a property.' The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents the big lenders, said that it was confident that the OFT investigation would find that lenders' practices are both 'prudent and reasonable.' It said that when a borrower wants a structural survey, the lender is able to combine this with the mortgage valuation at a cost lower than if the two services had been supplied separately. The MMC has until February 5 to complete its investigation.</p>

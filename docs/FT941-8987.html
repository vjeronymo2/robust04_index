			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Loyalists issue a call to arms: Michael Cassell on the motives behind the violent campaign against nationalists in Ulster This week's Valentine's day chocolate-box bomb attacks on Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic community have heightened fears in the security forces that the province faces a rising wave of loyalist paramilitary violence. With IRA terrorist activity at a lower level during the lengthening republican debate on the Downing Street declaration, loyalist attacks have been at the forefront of violence in Ulster and have triggered arguments over motives behind the escalating campaign. The recent attacks, which have left three people dead and several badly injured, have also provoked a fresh row among Ulster's political parties. Some nationalists say unionist attempts to explain the upsurge in loyalist extremism are fanning the flames of hatred. The Royal Ulster Constabulary is once again the target of allegations of suspected collusion between officers and loyalist paramilitaries. Loyalists who have traditionally claimed their attacks are in direct response to IRA violence and would stop if the IRA laid down its arms, now insist they are fighting to halt what they see as the political assault on the province's position within the Union. The struggle to stop a looming 'sell-out' to Sinn Fein has, apparently, joined hatred of the IRA and impatience with the security forces' efforts as a legitimate motive for their activities. The loyalist onslaught has involved attacks with guns, bombs and mortars. Sinn Fein headquarters and nationalist politicians have been targets and attacks on Catholics have occurred. Most of the incidents have been claimed by the Ulster Freedom Fighters, an arm of the Ulster Defence Association, the province's largest paramilitary group. Dr Philip McGarry, chairman of the centre Alliance party, says the UFF campaign means 'any Catholic is now a target of the loyalists'. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, believes the paramilitaries are now intent upon killing his party members. Some Ulster politicians believe the loyalists' latest explanation for their activities is no more than a smokescreen for continuing sectarian warfare. But a UDA statement after the weekend murder attempt on a leading SDLP member said it was part of its 'on-going proactive campaign against those directly involved in exercising the nationalist veto on democratic progress within Northern Ireland'. Unionists have been criticised for talking about a 'pan-nationalist' front embracing all Catholics and intent upon creating a united Ireland. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, is under attack for suggesting it was 'probably logical that people in the loyalist community have seen that terrorism has worked for the IRA and feel that they can make it work for themselves'. Neither have the police escaped criticism. Mr Alex Attwood, a Belfast SDLP councillor, said he believed officers at 'lower levels' in the RUC were 'turning a blind eye' to potential attacks in Catholic areas. The RUC denies this. The RUC is in no doubt that, if the IRA again steps up its campaign, the loyalist paramilitaries will do the same. The security forces believe that, while loyalist extremists may not be so well organised, the numbers of highly motivated, active volunteers are on a par with those of the IRA and their weaponry has been improving. Recent disclosures of a 'doomsday' plan by the UDA involving the creation of an 'ethnically pure' Protestant homeland in the event of a republican 'victory' and British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, were treated with scepticism by politicians. But they raised the spectre of loyalist paramilitaries replacing the IRA as the prime architects of violence in the event of a political settlement in the north.</p>

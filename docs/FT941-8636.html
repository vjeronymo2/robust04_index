			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Goldsborough valued at Pounds 74.5m in float Goldsborough Healthcare was given a market value of Pounds 74.5m yesterday when its flotation was priced at 170p a share. The shares are on a pro forma historic p/e for the year to October 3 of 18.6, and the indicated notional yield for the current year is 2.4 per cent. The float will enable Kunick, the leisure group, to sell its entire holding of 12.6m shares in Goldsborough, and have loans repaid, giving it gross proceeds of Pounds 24.8m and an exceptional profit on the sale of Pounds 2.2m. NatWest Ventures, which took a stake in Goldsborough in October 1992, will sell 5.8m shares, cutting its stake to 9.9 per cent. Management is increasing its stake to 2.4 per cent with Mr Graham Smith, chief executive, investing Pounds 249,000 to take his stake to 1.6 per cent. On the flotation Mr Smith will have a new three-year, fixed-service contract at Pounds 130,000 a year. Goldsborough, which operates nursing and residential homes, acute hospitals and homecare services, will also raise Pounds 29m through the issue of 18.2m new shares. This will cut net debt to Pounds 7.8m, 15.4 per cent of pro forma shareholders' funds. A total of 36.6m shares are being sold, 83.6 per cent of the company. Of these 65 per cent - 23.8m shares - have been placed firm and the balance is being offered to the public. Goldsborough said the current year had started well with 95 per cent occupancy in the homes and a 29 per cent rise in care hours provided by the homecare division. Profits would benefit from acquisitions last year. Mr Smith said he expected growth to be both organic and through acquisition. Gearing could rise to more than 50 per cent in two to three years but would not exceed 100 per cent. Applications close on February 24, with dealings due to start on March 4. COMMENT This float smacks a little too much of a desire by Kunick to sell. Rumblings over the placing suggest the pricing is perhaps a few pence too greedy. While most other nursing home groups have come to market with net cash, allowing a fair period before a rights issue is required, Goldsborough is coming with net debt. It can point to its diversity of activities as a strength, although three quarters of profits still come from the care homes division where it is a long way short of market leadership. On a forecast of pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 4.3m) the prospective p/e is 14.8, which may be just enough of a discount to get the issue away.</p>

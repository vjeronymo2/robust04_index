			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Polish minister seeks IMF backing for budget MR Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's finance minister, flew to Washington yesterday to seek support from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the US government for his tough budget policies. Mr Olechowski will seek IMF assurances that the budget, which foresees a Zl 65,500bn deficit amounting to 5 per cent of GDP, would form a basis on which to renegotiate the terms of Poland's Dollars 1.6bn three-year extended facility. That was suspended last autumn when Poland's previous government failed to meet the Fund's performance criteria on its budget deficit and expansion of domestic credit. Mr Olechowski will also be looking to the World Bank to ease the conditions under which Dollars 1bn of credit committed to Poland and due this year can be drawn. Mr Olechowski needs international support when he returns on Wednesday to present the draft budget to a centre-right cabinet aghast at the prospect of major cuts in spending plans. A more demanding test awaits the finance minister next month when he will present the budget to parliament.</p>

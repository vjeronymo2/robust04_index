This was announced by Viktor Yerin, head of the  Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, at a scheduled news  briefing there yesterday. According to the minister, this  program has been elaborated on Boris Yeltsin's personal  instructions with all Russian ministries and agencies taking  part in putting it together. In Mr. Yerin's words, it has a  fundamentally new nature, and it is not going to end up in  mid-air, as has happened more than once. The program is to be  financed mainly by ministries and agencies (with virtually all  taking part in it), each taking care of its own sphere. All in  all nearly 2 trillion rubles at current prices would be required  to implement it.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave Dairy Crest at Pounds 3m Exceptional items totalling Pounds 35.5m almost wiped out profits at Dairy Crest, the milk processing and dairy products arm of the Milk Marketing Board which earlier this month announced the loss of 600 jobs. The group, which is to be spun off in the changes planned for the milk market, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.8m, against Pounds 28.2m, struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 19m. Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said that operating profits from continuing operations, before allowing an Pounds 8m provision for the recently announced restructuring, had risen 7 per cent, from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 41.4m. However, he warned of 'extremely tough' market conditions which would be reflected in the interim results. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.16bn to Pounds 997.7m, including Pounds 167.1m (Pounds 336.4m) from discontinued operations, resulting in sales from continuing operations being flat at Pounds 830.6m (Pounds 819.4m). On the same basis operating margins were slightly higher at 5 per cent. 'Dairy Crest continues to make sound progress and is well positioned for the free market in milk,' he said. He did not rule out floating part of Dairy Crest before November 1, when the new milk marketing plans take effect. However, details were not likely for some weeks. Exceptional items included losses of Pounds 20.8m on disposals, mainly reflecting goodwill written back on the sale of five bottling dairies. A 12 per cent in the decline of doorstep milk deliveries led to a provision of Pounds 9.8m against the book value of the group's diary in Chadwell Heath, Essex. The fall in doorstep sales was the main reason for the decline in operating profits at the food services division from Pounds 23.4m on sales of Pounds 544.2m to Pounds 21.3m on sales of Pounds 505.9m. Operating profits in consumer foods, which includes liquid milk sales to supermarkets, rose from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 20.1m on sales of Pounds 324.7m (Pounds 275.2m). The disposals helped the group to end the year with net cash of Pounds 23m compared with net borrowings of Pounds 69.5m previously. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 1.5m.</p>

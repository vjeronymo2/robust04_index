As the press center of the Cabinet of Ministers informs, the  talks will focus on a general agreement on the withdrawal of  troops, the conditions for the future operation and dismantling  of the Skrunda radar station, the problems of social security of  Russian military personnel, and questions connected with the  activity of representatives of both states in the vicinity of  the border between Latvia and Russia.    Based on the political will of Latvia and Russia and on the  work accomplished during the previous talks, all the agreements  included in the agreement package on the withdrawal of the  Russian troops could be coordinated during this round of talks.  This was predicted today at the airport by Sergey Zotov, head  of the Russian delegation, upon his arrival in Riga. Zotov  added that there were grounds for hope also for a ratification  of these documents at the Russian parliament. These agreements  were being drawn up and concluded taking into account the  interests of both Latvia and Russia.    It is anticipated that at tomorrow's sitting of the Cabinet  of Ministers, the Latvian delegation will be given the authority  to agree with the last proposal recommended by Russia of  maintaining the operation of the Skrunda radar station for four  years, and after that, dismantling it in the course of 18 months.    The talks will continue until 16 February.</p>

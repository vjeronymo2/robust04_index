			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Taiwan hints at end to curbs Taiwan yesterday called on China to recognise the 'temporary reality' of two separate governments on either side of the Taiwan Strait and urged Beijing to renounce the threat of force against the island, Laura Tyson reports from Taipei. Officials also hinted that curbs on cross-strait economic ties would be eased and re-establishment of direct transport links hastened, although observers said nothing substantively new was offered.</p>

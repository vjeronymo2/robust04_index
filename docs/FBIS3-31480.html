The former Premier Nano is accused for the crime of  the peculation of the state property in large proportions, in  the role of person in help, in the sum of 9.4 milliard [billion]  lireta or 73,780,000 leks as well as for the crime of the  falsification of the official documents, a penal case foreseen  in the Articles 62 and 110 of the Penal Code.    The accuse against Mr. Fatos Nano is connected with the aid  of 23 milliard lireta rendered Albania by the people and the  Italian Government in the period February 1991 until June 1991,  the time when the defendant was in the high-ranking function of  the premier of the country. According to the report of the  Tirana Attorney's Office, the Premier Nano is responsible for  the appointment of the firm Levante Co of Bari with executive  director, Giuseppe Perniola, for the promotion of the Italian  aid in contrary to the procedures fixed by the Italian law.    He has avoided with direct actions the institutions and the  specialized organs as the Ministry of the Foreign Trade and has  appointed the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs to deal with the  aid, executing the requests of Mr. Giuseppe Perniola, which were  sent to Albania through faxes delivered by the defendants Ramiz  and Arben Aliaj, as his partners. In contrary to the statute of  that time of the presidency of the parliament, full aware of  what he was doing, Nano has avoided the initiative of the state  to reach bilateral agreements and its lack gave Mr. Nano the  possibility to appoint Levante Co for the promotion of the  Italian aid.    He has appointed Mr. Hajdin Sejdia, who was his personal  adviser for the economical and financial problems in the role of  dispatcher in Albania.    According to the dictation of the Italian side through the  Italian ambassador in Albania, Mr. Torquatto Cardili, has  ordered the change of the structure of the food and  pharmaceutical articles which were indispensable with goods  which didn't response to the emergency of that aid. Mr. Nano is  responsible for the non- promulgation of a law on the way of  taking to delivering goods of aid considering the fact that it  was the first time that articles of aid were coming to Albania.  Such a decision was approved from the Council of Ministers on  March 12, 1991, entitled "For the organization and the  delivering of aid," which created real possibilities for the  covering of the differences.    All these as well as the mechanisms of achieving illegal  great profits by Levanto Co were denounced by certain witnesses,  who held state governing functions. They testified about the  following:    -- Dishonesty of Levanto Co.    -- The non-accomplishing of certain actions by the organs in  the Ministry of Foreign Trade.    -- The prices of the articles supplied were some times  higher  than the prices of the same articles sold in the Italian market.    -- The changing of the structure of the articles from  emergency articles to unnecessary articles.    -- The spending in naval transport were very much inflated  and the payments for their transportation were not accomplished.    -- Nano, acting in the function of an assistance, ignored  all  these written notifications and ordered its subordinates to  pursue their way. He didn't undertake any official step to  prevent the illegal embezzlement of his collaborators.    -- Also the defendant approved two decisions of the Council  of Ministers without their previous consideration in the  relevant meetings with the participation of all the government  members, this action is considered as a falsification. The  defendant Fatos Nano has accomplished this penal act to create  privileges and facilities for himself in the form of a reward  for the role he played as a dispatcher of the aids promoted by  Levante Co and Hajdin Sejdia.    Three other defendants, Mr. Sokrat Plaka, Rober Gjini and  Hasan Allko are accused for the crime of the abuse of duty  causing the state an economical state [as received] of  73,780,000 leks, 399,390 leks and 144,821 leks. Based on the  Article 105 of the Penal Code, the materials of the investigated  case in charge of the defendants will be sent for judgment in  the judge's office of Tirana.</p>

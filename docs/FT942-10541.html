			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pausing for breath at B&amp;J Shareholders in Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the lossmaking Poundstretcher chain of discount stores, will have several weeks to weigh rival offers for the group, which yesterday revealed a further recent deterioration in sales. An extraordinary general meeting called to approve a capital injection by the Weisfelds, the millionaire couple who created the What Everyone Wants discount clothing chain, was yesterday unanimously adjourned so that shareholders could also receive details of the latest rescue proposal, from Pepkor, South Africa's biggest retail group. The Weisfelds had offered to inject an initial Pounds 6m, in return for a 19 per cent stake and two seats on the board. If their investment had reached its maximum of about Pounds 28m, their stake would have reached 42 per cent. Pepkor has proposed injecting an initial Pounds 20m, but will receive a 63 per cent stake if it puts in the full Pounds 56.2m proposed. Mr John Jackson, B&amp;J's chairman, said yesterday's meeting was being held in 'slightly unusual circumstances', in that the board had initially recommended the Weisfeld scheme, but had then switched its support to the Pepkor offer, which was only agreed late on Friday. Mr Gerald Weisfeld said: 'What this company needs is not just cash, but expertise and individual experience in this sector.' Mr Weisfeld also said that B&amp;J had not given satisfactory assurances that Mr Philip Green had not and would not become involved with the Pepkor offer. Mr Green was chairman of Amber Day Holdings when it bought WEW from the Weisfelds in 1990, but the couple resigned the following year after policy disagreements. Mr Jackson said he had received categorical assurances from Pepkor that neither Mr Green, not any other third party, was involved in the South Africans' proposal. Yesterday's egm was adjourned until May 31, when the Weisfeld offer seems likely to be voted down. Another egm to consider the Pepkor offer will be called three weeks after a circular detailing the South African offer is posted, which is likely this week. B&amp;J said that its current financial difficulties had led to some creditors delaying supplies and in the last four weeks like-for-like sales were 10 per cent below last year's level.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid and Milan buck weaker continental trend MADRID joined Milan as the continent's risers, while northern bourses were generally weaker, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID extended the rally which took off late last week on lower-than-expected inflation figures and the removal of restrictions on the government holding in Tabacalera, one of Spain's privatisation candidates. The general index rose 2.96 to 206.77. Companies featuring in the current results season showed up, with Repsol rising Pta160 to Pta2,645. However, Mr Stephen Hughes at Nikko Europe said its figures were no better than expected. Iberdrola I, which did produce a pleasant surprise, put on Pta21 to Pta648 but Banesto lost Pta20 to Pta2,070 against a rising bank sector on loan loss provisions and the restructuring of the company's board. MILAN rose further on continued demand for privatisation stocks, taking the Comit index through its chart resistance point at 480. The Comit index rose 8.92 to 481.30 in continued heavy turnover of around L400bn after Monday's L394.4bn. Dealers said that they were waiting to see what the foreigners would do, since they had not participated greatly in the recent rally, fuelled mainly by domestic buying. Mediobanca rose L90 or 7.9 per cent to L14,890 before slipping back to L14,550 after hours. Sme continued to be suspended as the market waited for details of the government's plans to sell off part of the group. ZURICH fell through 1,900 on the SMI index, which lost another 23.9 to 1,889.5 in thin trading. Dealers again blamed weekend polls which showed that the Swiss electorate would reject European Economic Area membership at the December 6 referendum. However, Mr Jonathan Spink at Williams de Broe said that this week's fall coincided, more importantly, with a decline in the Swiss franc against the D-Mark towards a point (90 centimes to the D-Mark) at which the authorities would protect the rate. Swiss interest rates have risen accordingly, and banks showed the strain as CS Holding lost SFr45 to SFr1,915. PARIS continued to fall in thin trading, and some sell orders from the UK were reported. The CAC 40 index dropped 8.29 to 1,764.44 in modest turnover of FFr1.7bn. Schneider fell FFr37 or 6.5 per cent to FFr537 after its US subsidiary, Square D, set a Dollars 233.5m bond convertible into Schneider shares. Euro Disney fell another FFr2.25 or 3 per cent to FFr72.15 in a continued reaction to a sell note from Paribas and on fears that tomorrow the theme park will announce heavy losses for the year ended September 30. Michelin lost another FFr4.10 to FFr182.40 but Peugeot gained FFr16 to FFr514. Rumours that a US house was about to publish a negative report on Elf and Total took those shares down by FFr10.40 and FFr4.30 to FFr351.30 and FFr231.70 respectively. FRANKFURT traders tried to push equities up ahead of today's holiday, but buying orders did not materialise and the DAX index reversed a 14-point gain to close 1.90 lower at 1,545.05. Turnover rose from DM4.8bn to DM5.1bn. The US dollar's rise above DM1.60 lifted some cyclicals, most carmakers, Veba and Siemens. Volkswagen was also boosted by a short-term trading buy recommendation from a domestic broker, closing DM4.50 higher at DM286.50. Lufthansa's news that its nine-month loss was only slightly worse than in 1991 left the shares DM4 lower at DM100. STOCKHOLM ran into heavy profit-taking after two days of advances, as the market took the view that Sweden would not abandon its fixed exchange rate policy. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 2.2 to 723.6 in turnover of SKr708m after SKr430m. AMSTERDAM was depressed by London and news that the government was planning to lower its estimate for 1993 economic growth from the current 1 per cent. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.7 to 104.5. DSM continued its downward trend as it lost another Fl 2.60 to Fl 70.50.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- November 17                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1058.02    1058.14    1058.08    1059.32 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1111.13    1111.75    1112.42    1111.51  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1057.02    1055.56    1055.40    1056.32 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1111.98    1110.58    1109.21    1109.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Nov 16    Nov 13    Nov 12      Nov 11   Nov 10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1058.27   1059.26   1059.91   1045.16**  1054.50 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1110.19   1114.93   1120.89   1108.98**  1117.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1059.32; 200 - 1113.20 Low/day: 100 - 1054.21 200 - 1106.93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **Partial  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

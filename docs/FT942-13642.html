			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: The Palumbos - a family at war - Trust expert Caroline Garnham explains the background to an extraordinary court case The Palumbo family wrangle is interesting for the points of law which are likely to emerge concerning the difficult but important role of a director/trustee. In this case, Lord Palumbo, Thomas Tharby and John Underwood all are directors of Rugarth and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, as well as being trustees of the Family Settlement. There is nothing wrong with being a director as well as a trustee. In fact, in some cases, judges have encouraged trustees actively to use their powers as shareholders to put their man on the board. But the role of a director who is a trustee as well is to protect the trust assets for all the beneficiaries and is, therefore, significantly more onerous than that of a director alone. A company director is under an obligation to his company as determined by company law - but only indirectly to the shareholders of that company who have the power to remove him. On the other hand, a trustee of a family trust must, under trust law, take 'such care as an ordinary, prudent man would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom he felt morally bound to provide.' Furthermore, where a trust owns the majority of shares in a private company  -such as the Palumbo Family Settlement and Rugarth - the law expects the trustees to use their position of control to make sure that the company does not start any project which is imprudent, hazardous, or wholly unsuitable for a trust. This does not mean that a trustee/director cannot make mistakes. Not all investments go up in value; some inevitably go down. So it is not enough for the plaintiffs to show that the Palumbo assets have fallen in value. To succeed, the plaintiffs will have to prove that the trustees did not pay due consideration to the protection of the trust assets; did not ask themselves if the business policy of the company was appropriate for the trust; or did not know enough to make the necessary decisions. The fact that trustees asked themselves the right questions and sought proper advice - but then, for whatever reason (which need not be disclosed to the beneficiaries) made, in hindsight, the wrong decision - is immaterial. Another aspect of the claim for the Palumbo trustees is that they benefited personally from their position. It is a basic legal rule that trustees cannot use their position for personal benefit, regardless of how onerous or time-consuming their duties may be. Any financial benefits they obtain through exercising their powers as a trustee must be returned to the trust fund. There are, of course, exceptions to what otherwise would be a very harsh rule. The first is that trustees can keep any benefits they receive from a company if they obtained their position with it because of having a shareholding of their own, or for other reasons that were not connected with being a trustee. A second is if they apply to court for an order stipulating that they can keep their director's fees, remuneration or other benefits. In some cases, the court will permit the director/trustee some benefit - provided that it is not excessive. The third area of trust law upon which the Palumbo case touches is the rule that trustees exercising powers given to them in the trust deed must do so with due consideration to all the facts of a case and the needs and requirements of all the beneficiaries. In this case, the trustees added the three children of Palumbo's second marriage as beneficiaries to the Family Settlement. But such an action is possible only if the deed contains a power for the trustees to do this. If not, they will have breached trust and the court will act to rectify the position. But if the trustees do have the power, the court's only interest is whether it has been exercised properly. Trustees must not let themselves be bullied by a beneficiary - or anyone else - against their better judgment, even if that beneficiary is also a trustee. If trustees sign everything put in front of them without considering if this is a proper exercise of their powers, then a court can ignore the trust's paperwork, such as appointing new beneficiaries. To date, however, the courts have not interfered in the decisions of trustees except in extreme or exceptional circumstances. Given the onerous obligations imposed on them, the restrictions on trustee/directors, and the possible adverse publicity of a High Court action if all goes wrong, some may wonder why anyone in their right mind would create a family trust in the first place. In many cases, the main reason is to preserve wealth in a tax-efficient way for future generations. It must be remembered that, because of the Family Settlement, the Palumbo family has preserved great wealth - and that the assets in the Settlement escaped tax completely when Rudolph Palumbo died.

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Private View: When philosophy is kids' stuff Socrates was condemned to death for corrupting the youth of Athens. What sentence, then, would be appropriate for people caught teaching philosophy to five-year-olds? Karin Murris, a Dutch philosopher, thinks metaphysics could be the saving of English education. She was born (where else?) in the Spinoza Clinic, Spinoza Street, Amsterdam, and studied at the famous University of Leyden. She says that unless children are taught to think, they cannot learn. Unless they are taught to scrutinise everything thrown at them by parents, pedagogues, politicians and the press, they cannot develop into good citizens. Her diagnosis could strike a chord in a country constantly bemoaning the failure of its state education - perhaps, too, with a prime minister whose slogan is 'back to basics'. But, I asked her, do we really want to raise a generation of little sceptics? Philosophy means freedom, she replied. 'It gives you choice: not being stuck with what is, but learning to formulate what could be. It is questioning. When you feel satisfied, you make up your mind - temporarily - but keep an open-minded attitude. I don't believe that is a bad thing for children.' Even in moral matters? Many teachers, she agreed, consider it their first duty to tell children what is right and wrong, what good and bad. 'But it's not as simple as that. Children are constantly being taught moral values, anyway. It's only an assumption that they cannot probe further. If you teach answers, and teach dogmatically, they won't have the concepts to heart. If they haven't thought it through for themselves, do you think they will obey?' Questioning should start from an early age because beliefs can petrify into prejudice and prejudice can lead to violence. 'For instance, religion has been used - I am not saying it is inherent in religion - to justify violence.' Karin Murris does not look like a poisoner of tiny minds. She has a gentle voice, easy manner and mischievous eyes. She lives with her English husband in a smart big bungalow in Berkshire, from where she runs her Centre for Philosophy with Children. And she has children of her own: a son and daughter, both at a local state school, and a baby on the way. 'With my own children, I am always clear about the values I think important,' she said. 'There are a lot of rules you need to make living as a family possible.' Children should challenge authority - not the law, the police or their teachers, but epistemological authority: where do our beliefs come from? How do I justify them? 'You can be very sceptical about the origin of belief and the possibility of true knowledge without . . .' She paused. Becoming an anarchist? 'Exactly.' There is no count of British schools that have tried teaching children philosophy but the idea is not new. It began 20 years ago in the US when Matthew Lipman, a university philosophy professor and guru of the movement, had a bright idea for engaging the minds of no-hopers from city ghettoes. It is now taught in 5,000 schools there and has spread to 35 other countries. It seems to be particularly popular in eastern Europe, Russia and South America. Lipman and his disciples use philosophical novels of the professor's own composition (the first, punningly titled Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery, was on logic) to provoke disciplined debate between children on a topic of their own choosing. Murris follows Lipman's method but uses different material. Being herself mainly a product of the continental tradition of philosophy, she is unhappy with some of the Lipmanite doctrines. I asked her if there was an age below which children were incapable of philosophising. 'I don't think so. As soon as they can talk, they come up with the most amazing questions. Infants are very open and sparkling and very creative in their thinking. The older they get, the more closed down the answers become. If you don't start young, you have missed most people.' She recalled conducting a class of middle-class 10-year-olds: 'They were as good as gold, honestly. But they couldn't formulate questions. They just didn't want to explore ideas.' Do boys and girls think differently? 'I haven't noticed it.' How many women philosophers have there been? There was a reproving silence. 'That's a rhetorical question, not an open-ended question.' Then she decided I was joking and laughed merrily. 'There've been so many: you're just not aware of them] But it's the same as in history, sciences, everything. Why did the Dutch produce so many good philosophers and painters?' It is often said that men are better at sequential thinking, women at intuitive, lateral thinking. 'I don't know. This left-brain, right-brain thing assumes a mechanistic view of the mind, anyway. Philosophy deals with both. You think with your guts, too. Scientists working on projects for 10 or 20 years feel in their guts that something is there. Philosophy is very much a passionate affair. It's a passion for thinking. You are constantly in motion. That's why you can never 'be wise'.' Are there forbidden topics? None, she said, unless schools ban discussion of sex without parental permission. Children had fewer taboos than adults. They needed to talk about death, for example, and could spot the difference between 'suicide' and 'killing yourself'. Sometimes, racism crops up. 'It's wonderful when it comes up in philosophy because then you neutralise the whole thing: 'Why did you say that?' You have to justify. As soon as prejudices come to the surface ,they can be dealt with - by the children.' Don't you get complaints from the parents? 'It's funny, but I haven't had a single one. Children seem to know when they can or can't say certain things. They're very clever.' Murris said philosophy does not subvert the rest of the curriculum but complements it. Do you mean, I said, that it is the sub-structure? 'Absolutely. That's a lovely way of putting it: it is the sub-structure. Philosophy is the fourth R - reasoning - that underlies the three Rs.' Why hasn't it been taught in schools before, then? She replied by referring to historical fashion and to wrong assumptions about children's powers of reason. Thinking of the present backlash against so-called child-centred education in Britain, I asked her if she was 'progressive'. 'Oh, I hate labels] No, I'm a philosopher. I think all philosophers are progressive, anyway.' Are you just putting forward in a more systematic way the ideals of child-centred education which - so it appears - teachers have shown themselves unable to deliver? 'Well, of course it's child-centred because you believe they can think for themselves. But I don't think one excludes the other. 'You can't say you want a society where citizens are assumed to think for themselves, to vote, formulate opinions, digest all the information, and then teach them not to do so.' Philosophy should be part of every teacher's education. Studies in the US have given some support to the movement's claim that philosophy accelerates children's reading ability and mental age. Lipman points to successes with drop-out teenagers in New Jersey. Murris is careful not to make large claims for it, but has seen its beneficial effect on truants and disruptive children. Giving them permission to express their own opinions raises their self-esteem - and low self-esteem is cited often these days as a cause of addiction to drugs and violence. 'The older I get, the more I realise how limited our thinking is and what we can grasp with it,' Murris said, finally. 'Philosophy gives you another perspective on life, and the more perspectives you have, the richer a person you are. The aim of education is not just to teach this or that subject. It is all about choices, ideas. What sort of life do you want to live? What sort of person do you want to become? 'We always assume we remain the same person, that we have to have some coherent life story. But is there such a thing? We are constantly becoming the person we want to be. So, there is no harm at all in teaching children they are not stuck. 'You can only hope they take out what you value. But, at the end of the day, it's their decision. In a society that is rapidly changing, we haven't got a clue what our children will need in 10 or 20 years' time, do we - what knowledge, what sort of skills? 'But thinking soundly about these things is, I think, the best thing you can give them: about what they hear, what they see on television, what they read in the newspapers.' She smiled wickedly. 'Including the Financial Times.' A glass of champagne, not hemlock, I think, for Karin Murris. But how many teachers wrestling to instil the three Rs will be capable of delivering the fourth?</p>

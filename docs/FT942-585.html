			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Newspapers up The Telegraph rebounded as it fought to minimise the effect of the recent price cut which last week poured fuel on the smouldering newspaper price war. Chairman Mr Conrad Black was reported to be considering taking the newspaper back into private hands if the shares fell further. More controversially, he claimed that the drop in profits from the price reduction would be limited to no more than Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m a year. Elsewhere, there was widespread relief that middle market newspapers Daily Mail and Daily Express had resisted the pressure to cut their cover prices and had taken the less expensive promotional path. Daily Mail Trust 'A' shares bounced 23 to 893p and Express parent United Newspapers recovered 13 to 498p.</p>

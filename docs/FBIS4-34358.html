[Begin Cordero recording] I met with the Charge d'Affaires  Georges Barberousse this morning. He told me that he has  learned that merchandise is being shipped by sea. I told him I  would immediately order an investigation. I contacted Port  Authority Director Jerry Salazar, to whom I expressed my  concern. He told me that he would implement all possible  measures to ensure compliance with the embargo. [end recording]    Cordero said that the possible penalties range from fines to  suspending the operational licenses of the sea cargo agencies.    Cordero reiterated that effective 26 June commercial flights  from Panama to Haiti and vice versa will be suspended. COPA is  the only airline operating on this route.</p>

In recent years, especially since the beginning of 1993, all  areas and departments throughout the nation have done a great  deal of work to turn deficits into profits and have achieved  definite results. In the first half of 1993, budgetary  industrial enterprises throughout the nation continued to  maintain a declining trend of deficits after reducing the range  of loss by 4.2 percentage points and the amount of loss by 3.6  percent in 1992. By the end of June, 1993, the range of loss was  reduced by 0.9 percentage points and the amount of loss, 2.605  billion yuan or 16.5 percent. But, in the second half of 1993,  the range and amount of loss increased as a whole due to the  occurrence of some new situations in the movement of the  national economy, especially the price increase of energy,  transportation, and raw materials, the rise of interest rates,  the sliding of market, and poor management of some enterprises.  As of the end of October, the range of loss increased 7.3  percent and the amount of loss, 14.9 percent.    The State Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of  Finance pointed out that judged from the current situation, the  deficit situation of China's state-owned enterprises is fairly  serious. But because measures adopted by different regions and  departments are different, progress has been uneven. As of the  end of October, the range of deficit of 12 areas, including  Beijing, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan,  and Guizhou, was higher than the national average whereas  Fujian, Xiamen, Guangdong, Guangxi, and some central departments  successfully reduced deficits. Industries such as coal,  petroleum, and tobacco, reduced deficits by 5.2 percent, 26.8  percent, and 66.4 percent respectively as compared to that in  the corresponding period of 1992.    To ensure that new progress is made in the work of turning  deficits into profits in 1994, the State Economic and Trade  Commission and the Ministry of Finance set forth five measures,  urging all areas and departments to do a down-to-earth job.    Strengthen the responsibility of turning deficits into  profits and do a good job in classified guidance. All areas and  departments should strengthen leadership in the work of turning  deficits into profits, establish the target-oriented  responsibility system, delegate the targets of turning deficits  into profits to each and every level of departments and  enterprises, and ensure that objectives are clear, targets are  assigned to every position, and responsibilities are delegated  to individuals. Enterprise supervising departments should make a  list of major money-losing units, investigate and study each and  every such unit, and adopt measures to solve their problems.  They should ensure that each plant has its own measure for  reducing and turning deficits into profits within a limited time  period. All money-losing enterprises must establish a  loss-bearing mechanism, adopt a measure to link employees'  interest to the amount of deficits reduced or transformed in  their enterprise, and give out awards or penalties in strict  accordance with the measure. Economic and trade commissions,  financial, auditing, and enterprise supervising departments at  all levels should carry out supervision and inspection on a  regular basis.    Strengthen enterprise management and tap internal potential.  Currently, we should stress the basic management, cost  management, and team building of enterprises. In accordance with  advanced domestic and foreign standard of enterprise management,  we should establish and perfect various quota control, rules and  regulations, and standards, and carry out strict evaluation.  Pursuant to "General Rules for Enterprise Financial Affairs" and  "Enterprise Accounting Standards," we should improve the  internal economic accounting of enterprises, strengthen  financial budget control and financial discipline, and reduce  cost and expenses.    Extend proper support to money-losing enterprises which are  expected to turn deficits into profits. Where conditions permit,  areas and industry supervising departments should continue to  raise and utilize existing deficit-transformation funds, use  such funds mostly for inexpensive technological transformation  projects and other "short, even, and fast" projects which can be  completed and put into operation within a year, and support  money-losing enterprises in developing new products and their  needs for working funds. When allocating funds for various  technological transformations, economic and trade commissions  (economic commissions and planning and economic relation  commissions) and financial and banking departments at all levels  should set aside some funds to be used to support money-losing  enterprises to turn deficits into profits. After assisting  money-losing enterprises in property inventory and investment  verification, we should help them get rid of their bad credit  history in a planned manner. After exercising the asset-to-debt  ratio control over loans, banks should adopt a transitional  method to help promising enterprises carry out production  operations and stress support for money-losing enterprises to  speed up the readjustment of product mix.    Speed up the tempo of changing enterprise management  mechanism. Those enterprises, which have complied with state  industrial policies, are expected to turn deficits into profits,  and have bright market prospects, should be leased, transferred,  or merged. Those enterprises which have been losing money for a  long period of time, are not expected to turn deficits into  profits, have more debts than assets, should be firmly bankrupt.  This is a fundamental solution for the mechanism issue of  money-losing enterprises.    Vigorously promote the technological progress of  enterprises,  do a better job in quality work and the activity of "double  increases, and double festivals."</p>

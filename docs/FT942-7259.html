			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Positive achievements of Dr Banda should also be recognised Sir, It is all too easy for Michael Holman and Nick Young to brand Dr Banda of Malawi as an oppressive dictator accountable only to himself ('Malawi slips at last from iron grip of Banda,' May 21). Not much is said about his positive achievements. I was his minister of finance during Nyasaland's transition to independence in 1964 and when at that point I left the country it is not unfair to say that, due to a paucity of resources, it was an impoverished colonial backwater. Dr Banda's first task was to mobilise funds from elsewhere in the western world. This enabled him to finance a formidable programme of social and economic development. The importance he attaches to education manifested itself in the establishment of primary schools for all, secondary schools in every district and a university of which he is chancellor. The need to open up the country resulted in major road construction, a railway extension, more frequent air services and vastly improved telecommunications. And he sought to encourage industrial investment by a liberal regime for private enterprise. Even more important, his personal intervention in agricultural production and marketing ensured self-sufficiency in their basic foodstuff. Very occasionally, the failure of the rains might have made it necessary to import maize, but this danger did not divert him from admitting a million hungry refugees from the civil war in neighbouring Mozambique, a signal act of humanity. Since I left Malawi and, until recently, I have been a regular visitor as a director of the National Bank of Malawi, and I have travelled the length and breadth of the country. Compared with my colonial memories I can say without hesitation that the quality of life of its peoples has vastly improved as a result of Dr Banda's policies. Adults and children alike are by African standards well clad, well nourished, industrious and happy. We may detest autocratic rule, but strict discipline is often necessary to overcome backwardness. In Malawi, many individuals have suffered in the process; and the emotional reporting of such incidents has unsurprisingly engendered a worldwide sense of outrage which tends to overshadow any resultant common good. Dr Banda, even at his great age and in supreme command, has bowed to world opinion (while reminding us that not so long ago we imprisoned him without trial]) He set in train reforms necessary to safeguard human rights and to introduce political pluralism; and he has graciously acknowledged defeat by a successor to whom he has pledged full support.

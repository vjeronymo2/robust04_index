			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures still bearish STERLING futures again performed very bearishly yesterday as the market continued to assume that a cut in UK base rates was a distant prospect. The September short sterling contract closed at 89.63, its lowest finish since base rates were cut to 10 per cent three months ago. After opening at 89.64, it had bottomed out earlier in the day at 89.60. The December contract was also badly hit by the bearish mood, closing at 89.74, ten basis points down from its previous close. The closing price for the December contract assumes that 3-month money at the year's end will still be at 10 1/4 per cent. The impression that there will be no cut in the all-important German Lombard rate this year was clearly given by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President on Thursday. Sterling's poor performance yesterday did not help matters: the currency slid one pfennig in early trading to a low of DM2.8353. Rates in the sterling cash market were firmer, although this was again put down to the month's end, when commercial banks and discount houses need to keep a minimum amount of paper assets on their books to comply with Bank of England requirements. Dealers also felt that they must keep bills in reserve for next week: there is speculation that the Bank will hold another gilts auction, creating big shortages in the discount market. As a result, bills were only gradually offered to the Bank, on a day when a shortage of Pounds 1.25bn was forecast in the morning. One week money was dearer by  1/4 per cent on the offered side, closing at 10 1/4 per cent. One month money was  1/16 per cent higher at 10 1/4 per cent offered, while 3-month money closed unchanged at 10 3/8 per cent offered. The Bank operated at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo). In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 200m in the repo, revising the forecast to Pounds 1.3bn. The Bank then bought Pounds 6m in Band 1 treasury bills, Pounds 10m in Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 34m in the repo. In the afternoon, the Bank revised the shortage up to Pounds 1.4bn, bought Pounds 615m in the repo, Pounds 5m in Band 1 treasury bills, Pounds 158m in Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 102m in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 350m in the repo. Late assistance was Pounds 405m.</p>

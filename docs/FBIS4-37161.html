			<p>BFN     [Text] After his visit to Switzerland, Foreign Minister  Velayati attended a discussion with Bonn's representative of the  Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, where he spoke  about the duties of the World Forum and its significance.  Velayati said: During the past few years, this forum has held  annual sessions in Crans Montana in Switzerland and has gained  great significance in the world. The objective of this forum is  to develop political-economic possibilities and to create the  grounds and facilities for exchanges of views among  personalities from all the countries of the world.    Referring to the significant and strategic regional role of  the Islamic Republic of Iran in relation to important issues  such as the Central Asian countries and the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Velayati said: By clarifying the Islamic  Republic's stances on the situation in the northern republics  and the steps that Iran has taken to help preserve their  independence, to mitigate and to overcome ethnic clashes, and to  increase cooperation with these countries within the framework  of ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] and the Organization  of the Caspian Sea Littoral countries, we have played a pivotal  and major role in past sessions. Thus, this year--thanks to  efforts that have been made--explaining the economic-political  position of the Islamic Republic of Iran at home and in the  region became one of the most important and major programs of  the World Forum and the first day of this year's session was  devoted to Iran.    Continuing, Velayati referred to the comprehensive program  prepared for the day devoted to the Islamic Republic of Iran at  the forum and said: In this program, President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani participated in a direct satellite link at  the request of the organizers of the session--unprecedented at  World Forum sessions--and answered questions put to him by  participants in the forum.    In conclusion, Velayati referred to the participation of our  country's commercial, economic, and banking officials at the  session and the briefing of about 600 political and economic  personalities from more than 40 countries of the world about  Iran's economic, commercial, and industrial plans, and expressed  hopes that the grounds for the growth and the further expansion  of economic, commercial, and industrial cooperation between Iran  and the other countries of the world will be paved.</p>

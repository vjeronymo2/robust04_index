			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Feb 28 (AFP) -- The first attempt by the  European Union to take in new members since 1986 was heading for  a Monday midnight [28 February] make-or-break deadline with  Norway and Austria still balking at EU entry terms.    Sweden and Finland appeared ready for compromise on a range  of issues involving the price of the entry ticket and EU  concessions on aid for less-developed regions and Arctic farmers.    But Norway remained at loggerheads with the EU over its  refusal to give countries of the Union increased access to its  fish-rich waters, or to accept limits on its fish exports.    And Austria refused to relax restrictions on polluting truck  traffic across the Austrian Alps. The EU wants them lifted by  the end of the century, but Austria has insisted that they  remain in place until 2004.    EU ministers were preparing final compromise offers on  membership terms to put to the four candidates later Monday,  with Germany, Denmark and Britain urging the Union to compromise.    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned that enlargement  was necessary for Europe's economic and political stability.  "It would strengthen the EU as an anchor of stability for  Europe," he said.    German diplomats have often stressed the EU's failure to  absorb the four relatively wealthy applicants would be a poor  signal to poorer countries next in line for membership, such as  Poland and Hungary.    The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers,  Theodoros Pangalos, denied that the applicants were being  confronted Monday by "take-it-or-leave-it" offers.    But he warned that candidates which failed to accept  membership terms by midnight, or at the latest by dawn (0630  GMT) on Tuesday, would not be able to enter the EU on the target  date of January 1, 1995.    The four applicants are among the richest countries in  Europe. They all have economies bigger than the EU average.    By EU rules, this means they would normally get a  proportionately smaller share of the Union's agricultural  support hand-outs, while at the same time paying more than the  average into the EU budget.    The EU has offered to bend its rules to give special support  for the fragile Alpine and Arctic agriculture, but the applicant  countries want the Union to go further.    But diplomatic activity was concentrated on trying to keep  Norway and Austria in the talks despite their hard line on fish  and Alpine pollution. "Our goal is to complete the negotiations  with the other applicants," Norwegian Trade Minister Greta  Knudsen told a press conference.    But Norwegian Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen made it  clear Norway was betting on an EU climb-down over fish.    He said Norway was not prepared to increase catch quotas for  foreign fishing boats, but added: "We are ready to continue the  negotiations."    The EU itself was divided over the issue, with Spain,  Portugal and Ireland pressing for the right to fish in Norwegian  waters and other countries less willing to let the issue  sabotage the negotiations.    Norway's last attempt to enter the EU, in 1972, foundered  over the fisheries issue. Kinkel said: "This should not be  allowed to happen again."    There was also little movement on the Alpine trucking issue,  although the negotiators were said to be searching for a  face-saving formula which might satisfy the Austrian public that  anti-pollution standards would not be cut.    And the EU was divided over concerns that the applicants  would tilt the Union's balance of power towards its richer  countries, and also give the smaller members relatively more  weight at the expense of the larger ones.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS HEARINGS AND CRANSTON  </P> <P> Sen. Inouye says the Keating Five were just trying to help their constituents.  Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) had a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes  from this statement.  </P> <P> That's not bad; what's bad is the people who lost all their money will have  nothing but lumps this Christmas season. The tears were a nice touch.  </P> <P> But if you want to shed a tear, shed them for the thousands who lost their life  savings and for the citizens who will have to pay the tab.  </P> <P> IRA J. HOEN, Culver City  </P></p>

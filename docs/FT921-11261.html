			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Good news drives the market down - Wall Street THE US president is not used to being upstaged, least of all in the week when he delivers his most important speech of the year. Yet it happened to George Bush. Not on Tuesday, when he presented the State of the Union address to Congress, but the following day when the stock market had its first opportunity to respond to the budget for 1993 and the President's election-year cocktail of defence and tax cuts. And who upstaged Bush? None other than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and ironically, the man with whom the President's chances of re-election most probably lie. On Wednesday morning, while the market was trying to digest the implications of the State of the Union address, Greenspan blew Bush offstage with his own State of the Economy speech to the Senate Banking Committee. Greenspan told the Senate hearing he expected a rebound in economic activity in the second quarter. He indicated that monetary policy was now sufficiently accommodating to allow the economy to enjoy a solid, if unspectacular, recovery, and warned that another big cut in interest rates might revive inflation fears and possibly push long-term rates higher. The effect on market sentiment was instantaneous. Within an hour the long bond had fallen a full point, and within three hours the Dow Jones Industrial Average had sunk almost 50 points, recording its biggest one-day fall in more than two months. The logic behind the decline in bonds was clear. A growing economy and stable, possibly even tighter, monetary policy is bad news for bond investors, who appear convinced that the country is pulling out of recession. Even a bit of careful hedging by Greenspan - he told the committee that the Fed was ready to cut rates again if economic conditions warranted it - failed to stem the rush out of bonds. Why stocks should fall was more of a mystery. One reason was that the modest measures outlined in Bush's speech (an order to employers to reduce the amount of tax they withhold from staff paychecks; a boost to personal tax exemptions for parents; aid to first-time home buyers; and cuts in the capital gains tax, all paid for with reductions in defence spending) gave the markets no reason not to sell. Before Bush's address, expectations among investors that the president would unveil a range of aggressive short-term economic stimuli had been running high. So high, in fact, that they drove the Dow to a record close of 3,272.14 on Tuesday. After the speech, however, disappointment set in. The conditions were ripe for a sell-off if something nasty and unexpected happened. That something nasty and unexpected proved to be Greenspan's testimony. At first glance it seems odd that the equity market nosedives when the man in charge of monetary policy says further easing is not necessary because economic recovery is around the corner. An improved economic outlook should be good for share prices, right? Not in this market. Stocks staged a stunning 30-day rally between mid-December and mid-January because the big cut in interest rates at the end of last year buoyed hopes that the economy would be back on a growth track by mid-1992. As of this week, therefore, the recovery had been fully discounted in prices, and thus there were no benefits left to be gained from another forecast of a mid-year turnaround. The other main plank supporting investor sentiment was lower interest rates. Hopes for further easing in the early part of this year had sustained demand at the latter stage of the rally. With Greenspan suddenly pouring cold water on such hopes, investors were left with little incentive to keep the rally going. Oddly enough, amid all the State of the Union/Greenspan/budget palaver, Corporate America was enjoying its best reporting week for more than a year. A host of blue-chip companies - Disney, American Express, Procter &amp; Gamble, Boeing, Merck, Coca-Cola, Merrill Lynch - posted strong fourth quarter earnings. Even news of fresh cuts in US defence spending carried a silver lining. Uncle Sam is standing down some of his defences because the former Soviet foe is rapidly disarming. Enter International Disarmament Corporation, a new company formed by three big US defence contractors, Lockheed, Olin, and Babcock &amp; Wilcox, which will specialise in dismantling Soviet nuclear weapons systems. The profits, no doubt, will be used by US arms contractors to make more weapons. A case not so much of turning swords into ploughshares, but of turning swords into new swords.  -------------------------------- Monday      3240.61  +    7.83  -------------------------------- Tuesday     3272.14  +   31.53  -------------------------------- Wednesday   3224.96 -    47.18  -------------------------------- Thursday    3244.86  +   19.90  -------------------------------- Friday      3223.39 -    21.47  --------------------------------</p>

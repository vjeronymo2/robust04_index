			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Settlement hopes grow for BCCI creditors A settlement for creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International moved a significant step closer yesterday when dissident creditors welcomed a new agreement put forward by the liquidators. The BCCI Depositors Protection Association (DPA) said it would sign a new agreement based on a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.14bn) contribution from the government of Abu Dhabi. The DPA helped block an earlier agreement offering a range of compensation from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 2.2bn. BCCI was shut down in 1991 with liabilities of up to Dollars 10bn following the discovery of the world's biggest banking fraud. The bank's assets may total up to Dollars 4bn. Estimates of the number of creditors range from 140,000 to 500,000. The liquidators, accountants Touche Ross, said the new agreement had been considered by BCCI creditors' committees in London, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and was 'unanimously approved by those who voted'. The depositors' association said that it wished to end the delays caused by court appeals. It pointed out that the new agreement, unlike the original, allowed creditors to pursue claims against the government of Abu Dhabi. Before an agreement can be completed it must be passed by courts in three jurisdictions. The liquidators said yesterday that the case would be heard in London on December 13, in Luxembourg on November 30 and December 1, and in the Cayman Islands on January 11 and 12. Under the new agreement the Abu Dhabi government, the principal shareholder of BCCI, will pay Dollars 1.55bn after the successful completion of the court hearings, Dollars 150m 24 months later, and Dollars 100m 36 months after completion. The DPA said: 'The DPA believes that the new agreement represents a significant improvement on the old agreement and vindicates its opposition to the old agreement.' Referring to claims against the Abu Dhabi government, the DPA said: 'The DPA hopes that such actions will be pursued and is investigating the formulation of such a claim.' Representatives of the DPA, which has 200 members, fought the original agreement in the courts in both London and Luxembourg. The agreement was blocked on appeal in Luxembourg in October 1993. The DPA said yesterday: 'The liquidators must now commit themselves to payment of an initial dividend of no less than 20 per cent (20p in the pound) by July 5 1995.' Estimates of the final dividend payable have usually ranged between 30p and 40p in the pound. In a statement published yesterday the liquidators said an interim dividend depended on the courts and the calculation of the total number of creditors and assets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Reinaldo Montefilpo Carvallo: "The Political </F> Romance With General Oviedo"]    [Text] The sarcastic [Ramon] Menendez Pidal [1869-1968,  Spanish humanist] once told a hostile journalist who stinted on  praise of the former's philological achievements: "A willful  lack of memory coupled with the personal interest in refusing to  acknowledge the truth are largely responsible...." This "willful  lack of memory" brings to mind President [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy's  comments that General [Lino Cesar] Oviedo has nothing to do with  the ANR [National Republic Association-Colorado Party]. He  uttered these remarks in the wake of a pronouncement by ANR  precincts about meddling by this military officer. After a  matter of a few short weeks, the president--feigning total  ignorance--has no idea what ties the wily old general has with  his own party. It is a cardinal error to believe public opinion  is blind and deaf.    Interference by Gen. Oviedo in partisan politics in support  of one ANR faction is conspicuously evident. This is nothing  new. He has participated in meetings for months--and while  refraining from disclosing the true objectives of his medium-  and long-term plan--he has intentionally encouraged his friends  and followers. He takes pride in exhibiting his allegiance to  the Colorado Party and his adamant intention of keeping it in  power for ever. The Colorado Party members who are secretly in  love with him still believe it is irrelevant to display  democratic behavior or consolidate the electoral majority. They  favor the one who has the power that weapons confer on him in  order to assure their political preeminence and de facto  command. From an elementary civic standpoint, the stance of many  Colorado Party members--the most retardative ones--vindicates  our fateful past in the style of [General Alfredo] Stroessner  and a new takeover of the ANR by a military clique.    The opposition, which understandably fears the ambitious  general, will try to investigate and punish--if need be--his  meddling in politics. This may be a useless charge rather than  an appropriate and sensible action. Beside being a somewhat  dangerous adventure, confronting a general in our country is  just an obdurate waste of breath.    While it is true that Oviedo is gaining popularity among  many  Colorado Party members, many believe it is illogical to continue  a false alliance with him. Yet there are those who feel at ease  under the protection of this ubiquitous military officer and  encourage the romance in spite of all obstacles. After all, one  cannot deny he is putting on a good show.</p>

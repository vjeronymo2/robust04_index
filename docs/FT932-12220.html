			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Book Review: Blessings of a world held in balance MANAGING THE PEACE: THE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES, 1759 TO THE PRESENT By Eugene V Rostow Yale University Press; Dollars 35; 401pp The education of President Bill Clinton on matters military is approaching a critical point. This week, or certainly very soon, Mr Clinton must decide whether to bomb the Serbs, arm the Bosnian Moslems, or swallow his campaign rhetoric and stick with United Nations sanctions. Mr Clinton cannot count on support from his European allies; nor can he be sure that the American public (and The New York Times op-ed page) will stay the course, should he choose intervention. The question he faces is the one confronting all Americans at the end of the cold war: what are the national security interests of the US - the interests most worth fighting for? Eugene Rostow writes that the chorus of voices urging American isolation from the troubles of the world is stronger than at any time since the 1930s. This may be overstated, but not by much. The Democratic party has still to recover from the Vietnam war. The collapse of the communist threat has led to the retreat of the internationalist wing of the Republican party and the rise of the 'Come Home America' crowd led by Mr Pat Buchanan, the TV commentator who challenged George Bush for the presidential nomination last year. Mr Rostow is well-placed to offer an antidote to isolationism. He was present at the creation of the new engaged US foreign policy in the Truman administration; he served as deputy secretary of state in the Johnson administration; and he ended his days as a leading nuclear arms control negotiator in the Reagan administration, where his hawkish views ultimately cost him his job. His book is a powerful plea for an active foreign policy in which the US remains charged with a leading world role, at least for the foreseeable future. It contains none of the recent 'new world order' rhetoric which hid Bush's desire for a cosy US-Soviet partnership operating through the UN. Nor does the author fall into the trap of glorifying the US as the sole superpower. The approach is more hard-headed. His core argument is that the supreme national security interests of the US lie in the effective functioning of the state system - that is, the community of nation-states whose relations are governed by diplomatic convention and international law. Although the US has traditionally been wary of alliances, it has always been part of this system, despite fond beliefs to the contrary in the early days of the republic and during the isolationist 1930s. Mr Rostow is not seeking a world order of Utopian perfection. He is content with a world in which the phenomenon of war is kept within tolerable limits. His model is the so-called 'concert of Europe' which existed between 1815 and 1914. This period was the most tranquil that international society has known since the Roman empire; but as the author acknowledges, it depended, crucially, on a balance of power, enforced by the leading nation-states of the time, or at least a decisive number of them. The trouble is that Americans have never felt comfortable with balance-of-power politics, mainly because of its amoral connotations. Look at their distaste for Chinese human rights abuses; their outcry over revelations that the US and its western allies shored up Mr Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war; or their ambivalence towards Henry Kissinger, the chief exponent of the balance of power. Mr Rostow counter-attacks by showing that US presidents, from Washington to Wilson and Bush, have recognised that the true goal of US foreign policy should be the pursuit of a balance of power, not a universal crusade for democracy and human rights. So Thomas Jefferson, the framer of the Declaration of Independence, was happy to endorse the survival of monarchies in Europe under threat from Napoleon. 'Surely none of us wish to see Bonaparte conquer Russia, and lay thus at his feet the whole continent of Europe. This done, England would be but a breakfast. . . . No, it cannot be to our interest that Europe should be reduced to a single monarchy.' The next step in Mr Rostow's argument is more controversial. His search for a new concert of powers to manage the peace leads him to the UN, and the five permanent members of the Security Council. But as he acknowledges, the Security Council remains hamstrung by the veto provisions of the UN charter which remain indispensable at this stage in history. Mr Rostow claims he has an answer: Article 51 of the UN Charter, which declares that 'nothing shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence until the Security Council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security'. Article 51 offered the legal rationale for the Korean and Gulf Wars, and it could serve as a tool for managing the peace. Turning to the former Yugoslavia, Mr Rostow argues that the US made a costly mistake in 1991 when the secessionist crisis erupted. Anxious to stay out of a conflict which promised to be more intractable than the Gulf war, the US left the issue to the European Community and then the Security Council, instead of pressing the matter in Nato. 'The strong preference of the US should have been to use Nato as the forum for devising a peaceful solution of the crisis because of its over-riding interest in preserving alliance solidarity and the peace of Europe,' he argues. The conclusion that Nato should be the political and military manager in Europe will upset plenty of west Europeans. Some eastern Europeans, anxious about their own security, are less choosy. If not Nato, what other credible instrument is available?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It is quite probable that in the near future the  Defense Ministry of Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] will embark on the  formation of another subunit forming part of the CIS peacemaking  forces. As an RIA correspondent has been informed, it is  envisaged that Kirghiz servicemen will defend the interests of  the Commonwealth on the mobile [podvizhnaya] border between  Georgia and Abkhazia. This was occasioned by the agreement  between Russia and Georgia on introduction of Russian  peacemaking forces.</p>

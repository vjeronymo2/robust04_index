			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Gonzalez attempts to force the pace on pay policy: Spain's PM has thrown off post-election lethargy and is aiming for an agreement this month THE END of the August holiday is stressful for Spaniards. They go quiet, sleep badly and snap at their friends. The meeting today in Madrid between the government, unions and employers, to try to negotiate an incomes policy, promises to be trying. This is not least because, having done little about Spain's recession since winning a fourth term in the June 6 general election, Mr Felipe Gonzalez wants a three-year 'social pact' agreed by September 20, when the draft of the 1994 budget first gets to parliament. Agreement on wage moderation has become the centre-piece of his efforts to pull Spain out of recession and it may also affect his own political survival. Hasty deals are the stuff of Spanish politics, though, and the pact the government is looking for - a near freeze on wages and dividends next year and small rises in 1995 and 1996 - could easily be settled on time. Mr Gonzalez needs the deal in place quickly in order to make next year's deficit-curbing budget look plausible. He has developed a grudging respect for the market forces which battered the peseta into three devaluations in the past year and now appreciates the need to match his reputation for pragmatic policy-making with policies that are actually carried out. Spain has strayed well beyond its budgeted deficits ever since it joined the European Community in 1986. Luckily, the government has had a relatively happy summer. Despite record 21.2 per cent unemployment and the recession, the Madrid stock market has recovered to levels not seen since before the Gulf war and foreign investors have been flocking to auctions of government bonds. The peseta has shown great strength against the D-Mark, despite the loosening of its float. But this is all based on hopes that Spanish interest rates will fall, and that will only begin to happen (if the Bank of Spain has its way) if wage growth slows and the budget holds the public deficit in check. Neither the unions nor employers have been complimentary about an incomes policy but, as talks begin, it is going to be hard for either to be spoilers without being obvious. The government will make concrete proposals: wage freezes next year in the civil service and public companies and a ceiling of around 2.5 per cent in the private sector. Companies would be asked to limit dividends. Officials insist the government, purged of expansive left-wingers, is going to be tough. 'We have to stabilise this economy,' says an aide to the new finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes. 'If we have deficits, they should be the deficits we budget for.' By July the public deficit (central government plus social security) was 65 per cent bigger than last year's, worth nearly 6 per cent of gross domestic product as the recession hit tax revenues and boosted unemployment benefits. To finance its borrowings, Spain will spend nearly 5 per cent of its GDP this year just paying interest. Overall, public debt is worth 45 per cent of GDP now, say officials, and if nothing is done to slow it, that figure would rise to 60 per cent in just two years. The main problem is pensions. After a general strike on December 14 1988, Mr Gonzalez accepted union demands to raise pensions and to widen the jobless benefit net. State pensions, which accounted for 9 per cent of GDP in 1988, will account for 11 per cent this year. The state paid Pta2,000bn (Pounds 9.85bn) in pensions in 1982. This year it will pay Pta7,500bn. The 1994 budget, officials say, will try to hold this year's deficit constant, but just to stand still the government is being forced to consider changing the way it calculates pensions and to cut spending on infrastructure. The pension debate will be the most bitter. Madrid wants to base state pension payments on forecast inflation for the year and not, as now, on the inflation outcome the year before. Madrid's inflation forecasts are routinely lower than the actual outcome. Under the control of Mr Solbes, who is not a member of Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party, the Finance Ministry is anxious to sweep away the impression left by the former incumbent, Mr Carlos Solchaga, that budget targets are merely broad guidelines. Mr Solbes wants to hold the public deficit to 4.5 per cent of GDP next year (it will end 1993 at around 5.9 per cent) and to cut it to 3.5 per cent by 1996. The ministry is also warning that if wage moderation is not agreed voluntarily, it will be enforced before the budget debate begins on September 30. But does Mr Gonzalez have the stomach for a fight? He now runs a minority government and is surrounded by smiling allies with long knives up their sleeves. The sharpest belongs to Mr Jordi Pujol, premier of Catalonia and leader of the Catalan CiU, without whose support the Socialists could not survive in parliament in Madrid. He is highly critical of Madrid in general but has recently been concerned to extract confirmation from the government that it would honour its promised to cede to Catalonia the right to spend 15 per cent of the income taxes the central government raises in the region. Confirmation was quickly given, probably assuring the budget safe passage. In choosing how hard to fight to hold down wages, Mr Gonzalez also has to decide how far to push a series of labour market changes the government has said it wants in place by next January. These would make it easier and cheaper for employers to fire workers. Fortunately for Mr Gonzalez most of his enemies in Spain will once again be taking his near total silence for weakness, dithering and doubt. This is potentially a big mistake except that this time the government has established a clear and measurable short-term recovery programme which, should it falter even a little, could invite quick retribution from the markets.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Central bankers' broadside THE BANK'S generally negative view about prospects for economic and monetary union yesterday drew fire from some central bank governors. The comments about Emu were contained in sections of the BIS's annual report - which was drafted under the supervision of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, BIS general manager, and Mr Horst Bockelmann, economic adviser. The report's caustic views on Emu - coming at a delicate period when the entire project is uncertain due to the Danish referendum result - were seen by some governors as unhelpful in terms of adding to public scepticism about the scheme. Mr Wim Duisenberg (above, left), governor of the Dutch central bank, said: 'I don't agree with this part of the report.' He remained hopeful that the difficulties over Emu could be overcome and the project would go ahead as planned. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer (above, right), Danish governor and chairman of the committee of EC central bank governors, said he found the negative views of the BIS officials 'surprising'. Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian central bank, said he 'did not want to minimise the problems' over Emu but was confident of the project's success.</p>

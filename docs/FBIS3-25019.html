[passage  omitted]    On his way to Abidjan, the vice president stopped over at  Nairobi airport, where he talked to the press. Answering a  question, Dr. Kisekka said African (?strife) originates from the  politics of hatred, which he attributed mainly to ignorance. He  stressed the need for vigorous sensitization of our people to  stop this. He said it is important to cultivate a culture of  self-reliance to overcome indebtedness and other developmental  problems.    On the revival of the East African Community, he said Uganda  welcomes the move, realizing the need for a collective economic  force in the region. Regretting the collapse of the East  African Community in 1977, he pointed out Uganda's historic  brotherly ties with Kenya, which witnessed many Kenyans studying  in Uganda's educational institutions and cooperation in other  fields.    On instability characterizing some countries in Africa, he  said Uganda had made contributions to the resolution of  conflicts and to date it has dispatched more than 700 troops to  Liberia on a peacekeeping mission.    On the situation at home, he outlined the government's  programs which have facilitated a lot of change in the chaos  before. He said the country is now preparing for Constituent  Assembly elections which will result in the making of a new  constitution to form the basis of governance. He said that the  government is deliberately encouraging leadership by example,  which has resulted in considerable success in some areas.</p>

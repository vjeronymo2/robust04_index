			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: No wrong doing by Agusta on helicopter contract Sir, The article by David Gardner and Andrew Hill, 'EC fears link to Italian scandal' (April 1), spoke of a possible involvement of Agusta in the payment of kickbacks for the acquisition of a contract for the procurement of helicopters for the Belgian Ministry of Defence. Agusta declares itself to be completely unconnected with any financial dealings directly or indirectly aimed at illegal purposes. The contract for the procurement of 46 A109CM helicopters for the Belgian army was awarded to Agusta in December 1988 by the Belgian government after preliminary assessments and positive evaluation by the appointed parliamentary commission, and following an international competition held with the participation of the major helicopter manufacturers. The total value of the contract amounts to BFr6.6bn (1988 economic conditions). Assembly and delivery of the helicopters is carried out by SABCA in Belgium according to the contractual commitments set out in the industrial compensation agreement which was the major factor in deciding the selection of the Agusta helicopters by the Belgian government. As of today, 18 helicopters have been delivered with the remainder to be supplied by the end of 1993. Amedeo Caporaletti, managing director, Agusta, Milan</p>

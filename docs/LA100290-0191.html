			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RYAN TAKING NO CHANCES ON LOSING SOUVENIR BALL  </P> <P> Nolan Ryan isn't taking any chances.  </P> <P> Ryan wants to keep the ball used in his final career strikeout. So he arranged  to have 11 balls thrown out of his last start last Sunday, just in case the  Rangers don't sign him for next year.  </P> <P> Ryan announced last month that he plans to return to pitch for the Texas  Rangers next year. But the Rangers, who hold a $3.3-million option on his  contract for 1991, haven't spoken to him since to indicate that they want him  back.  </P> <P> Ryan said he arranged with plate umpire Ted Hendry to have the final ball from  each Ryan strikeout removed from play.  </P> <P> "In case I don't come back, I wanted to make sure I had the ball from Sunday.  You never know what's going to happen. I can't predict the future."  </P> <P> General Manager Tom Grieve told the Dallas Morning News that exercising the  option was "a mere formality." He said he expects the club to make it official  before the deadline of 15 days after the season ends.  </P></p>

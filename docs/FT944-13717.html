			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japanese sell-off flop prompts rail sale review Japan's latest privatisation flop yesterday forced the government to review plans for the flotation next February of a state-controlled regional railway. Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said he would decide next month whether to proceed with the privatisation of West Japan Railway (JR West), one of the six rail groups that were created by the 1987 break-up of Japanese National Railways. He said the decisive factor would be the price performance of Japan Tobacco, the cigarette making monopoly, whose listing tomorrow has been marred by the fact that many private investors decided not to take up their rights to buy shares. The finance ministry managed to sell just under 60 per cent of the shares in Japan Tobacco, after private investors baulked at the offer price of Y1.438m a share, which was set through a pre-offer auction to institutions and rich individuals. It now plans to sell the unwanted shares in the new fiscal year, though Mr Kamei said yesterday that he still hopes to float JR West in the current fiscal year, ending in March. The Japan Tobacco flop has attracted widespread criticism of the method of pricing new issues via an auction to the richest minority of investors. This has prompted Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, to launch a review of the method of pricing flotations. New Oji Paper, Japan's largest paper and pulp manufacturer, yesterday said parent recurring profits for the six months to September 30 rose 32 per cent to Y6.58bn (Dollars 68m) from Y5bn in the corresponding period last year. Sales were 25 per cent higher at Y270.34bn.</p>

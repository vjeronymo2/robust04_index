			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Vyacheslav Dashichev, Russian Academy </F> of Sciences Institute of Economic and Political Studies: "The  Twists and Turns of Russian Foreign Policy Thinking"]    [Text] A certain member of the Presidential Council came  out in favor of creating a new Russian foreign policy concept in  a very ambitious and direct manner: "In a number of articles in  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA I first formulated the central idea that has  subsequently become crucial to the perception of Russia's role  in the post-Soviet space by all of Russia's leading politicians  from the president down to minister of foreign affairs Kozyrev.  The gist of it is that the entire geopolitical space of the  former Soviet Union falls within Russia's sphere of vital  interests. So that no one would have any doubt as to what was  meant by vital interests, I drew a parallel with the Monroe  Doctrine. To a certain extent an effort was made by me to  formulate a Russian 'Monroe Doctrine' that would be applicable  to the situation that has existed since the collapse of the  Soviet Union."    As you are aware, the Monroe Doctrine, which proclaimed the  principle of "America for Americans," has often been used to  justify flagrant U.S. intervention in the affairs of the other  countries in the Americas and the imposition of dictates from  Washington. Figuratively speaking, the doctrine could be termed  an American version of the "Brezhnev Doctrine."    A. Migranyan is incorrect in his presumption that he was the  first to put forward the idea of applying the Monroe Doctrine to  other circumstances, in this case Russia's. This was done by  fascist Germany to justify its struggle for dominance over  Europe. On 1 March 1940 Ribbentrop, speaking with Welles, the  American president's personal representative, said: "Germany  does not wish to have anything more in Europe than the United  States has achieved in the Western Hemisphere with the aid of  the Monroe Doctrine" (see: S. Welles, "A Time for Decision," New  York, 1944, p 95). Hitler made a similar statement on 9 June  1940 in an interview intended for the American press.  ("Monatshefte fuer auswaertige Politik," Berlin, 1944, p. 533).  Thus a German "Monroe Doctrine" emerged at the height of Nazi  Germany's struggle for the European continent.    Now a Russian "Monroe Doctrine" is being imposed on us, but  with the slight difference that its "applicability" is  restricted to the scale of the former Soviet Union's  geopolitical space. Of course, writers of newspaper articles and  even presidential advisors are not making policy yet. It is a  long way from an idea to its realization. But neither President  B. Yeltsin nor minister of foreign affairs A. Kozyrev have  distanced themselves from the aforementioned statement by A.  Migranyan. Moreover, the Russian minister of foreign affairs  himself supports the creation of a sphere of Russian vital  interests in the geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union  and maintenance of a Russian military presence there. Naturally  that prompts some suspicion about whether today's Russia might  not be heir to great power expansionism.    It seems that first we created difficulties for ourselves by  "destroying" the Soviet Union "to its very foundations" without  any need to do so, and now we are beginning to overcome those  difficulties, which have become a disaster, by reestablishing at  the very least a "sphere of special interests" including Russia  and the former Soviet -- and now sovereign --republics. Now it  has become clear even to the uninformed how much more painless,  simpler and more reasonable it would be to continue the gradual  process of turning the country into a modern democratic  community of states that was begun at Novo-Ogarevo. But thirst  for power has dimmed the reason of politicians, and the worst  has happened: a catastrophic collapse of the country, with the  most severe consequences for its citizens.    Now Zhirinovskiy and his ilk, demagogically playing on  Russians' wounded sense of national pride, are threatening to  restore the Soviet empire by force of arms. Attempts are even  being made to provide a theoretical justification for the  manifest destiny of Russian imperial policy. In the article  "Imperial Russia Will Live Yet," Viktor Gushchin put it  approximately like this: "Those who favored the dismantling of  the Union, since they could not comprehend it before, are now  compelled to admit that following the collapse of the USSR they  will inevitably have in Russia an imperial "sovereign" in place  of the "elder brother," with all the consequences that involves.  Because Russia simply has no other means of self-determination  in the current world structure. Its great power interests  already extend too far (by virtue of objective reasons), and too  many of its sources of life support (by virtue of the same  reasons) now lie beyond Russia's national borders. In short,  either imperial Russia or Russia's self-destruction"  (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA , 17 September 1993).    We should recall that Hitler convinced the Germans that a  "people without space" and without possession of external  sources of life support was doomed to perish. Under the slogan  of winning that space for a "Greater Germany" he unleashed a  world war and plunged the Germans into a national catastrophe.  What actually happened was that the FRG, with only about  one-half of Nazi Germany's territory and lacking its own natural  resources to support it, became the leading industrial power in  the world and gain a very high standard of living within four  decades after the end of the war, thanks to an efficient  economic system and a rational economic policy. Russia has  incomparably greater opportunities to do so than Germany does.  So why is it once again being prodded onto the fateful path of  empire?    It seems to me that the reason behind the resurrection of  great power ways of a dubious nature lies not only with  Russians' fractured national pride. A major role in this regard  has been played by the collapse of Russia's economy and state  structure, the corrupted morals of the political elite and  society as a whole, the upsurge in crime and mafia penetration  of every nook and cranny of the social organism, mafia  plundering of the people's property, the transfusion of Russia's  national wealth abroad and -- most important -- the  impoverishment and profound disillusionment of the broad masses  of the public with post-August reforms by the Yeltsin-Gaydar  government. The country's difficult situation and misery are  increasingly, and rightly so, associated in Russians' minds with  that course and with the American advisors that are behind it.  This has resulted in an increase in anti-Western, particularly  anti-American, sentiments. The seeds of suspicion have been sown  in people's minds: have American advisors intentionally been so  persistent in imposing monetarist theory on the Russian  Government as a basis for reform of the Russian economy, a  theory which the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank officially rejected  over a year ago as unfounded? Is this not a secret plot by the  United States to destroy Russia's economic and  scientific-technical potential, reduce it to the rank of a  third-rate power and turn it into a vassal of American policy?  The way post-August economic reforms have been carried out looks  very irrational and not at all in line with Russian conditions.    Of course, one could debate the motives behind official and  unofficial Russia policy in the United States. This issue  requires a very thorough treatment so that we will not, God  forbid, go to extremes and subordinate our foreign policy to the  wrong guidelines, as was the case in the past. Be that as it  may, the fact remains: a new social and psychological atmosphere  has emerged in this country as a result of the failures of the  post-August course.    Nationalistic great-power extremism from the left and the  right has begun to feed parasitically -- and successfully -- on  this new political and psychological situation. This turnabout  in the country's political sentiments gave birth to the  monstrous Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. Under pressure from the  "great power" crowd, who have been making political hay off of  anti-government discontent, Yeltsin's inner circle has been  forced to restructure its policy, sharply increasing the  nationalistic emphases therein and demonstrating with great  diligence, appropriately and inappropriately, its enthusiasm for  the traditional "special" national interests of Russia as a  great power in the Eurasian space.    Another important task facing the president's council is to  dispel the impression of it, widely held by the Russian public,  as blindly obedient to Western foreign policy, particularly  American foreign policy, on many international issues. It is  clear that even Washington has realized that the White House's  focus exclusively on ordering Yeltsin around could turn against  it if opinions such as these continue to win proponents in  Russia and cause a further decline in the Russian president's  approval rating and threaten his hold on power. In this regard  money will not help. Intentional creation of friction in  Russian-American relations and a slight reduction in their level  would seem to be a more effective approach. Both sides'  interests coincide on this point, and some reciprocal efforts  have been observed. The NATO decision on the shelling of  Sarajevo, which in and of itself looked like political and  military insanity, since it would drag the West into a pointless  war in Yugoslavia, was countered by Yeltsin's categorical: "We  will not permit it!" Then came the sensational Ames case  (involving the arrest of Russian spies in the United States),  the arrest of an American spy in Russia, mutual expulsions of  intelligence officers from Moscow and Washington, and finally  Yeltsin's rude refusal to meet with ex-U.S. President Nixon.    It remains a mystery what is the correlation in this shift  by  the president's inner circle toward great power politics between  domestic power struggle considerations, on the one hand, and  inherited great power aspirations, on the other. In any event,  continuation and intensification of this practice will  inevitably result in the vector of Russian foreign policy  deviating substantially from the normal course that would be in  keeping with its national interests, and the country will once  again be held hostage by the destructive dynamics of imperial  policy. That historical lesson is an especially timely one for  us at this juncture, considering the situation that now exists  in Russia favorable to such a return to the past, as well as the  confrontational nature of our president's personality and the  clumsiness with which he and the new nomenklatura are striding  across the slippery parquet floor of politics.    The time of empires, creation of spheres of influence and  filling of political and military vacuums has disappeared  irretrievably into the past. They have been replaced by  regionally integrating communities of sovereign states. Those  communities are not bound together either by the dominance and  the authority of a strong individual or by bureaucratic  centralism, but rather by processes of economic convergence and  mutual penetration. That is the trend around the world. And it  is one that cannot be avoided.    The Soviet Union achieved a high level of internal  integration, and not just in the economy, though that  integration did rest on state-sponsored monopolistic measures by  the center, was artificial in nature and therefore folded up  like a house of cards in December 1991 as a result of an  arbitrary decision by the "troika" to dissolve the USSR. But  Russia still has vital interests in the former Soviet republics,  just as those republics still have vital interests in Russia.  Therefore unilateral proclamation of the near abroad as a sphere  of special Russian interests is fundamentally wrong and could  have great destructive potential. The only way the issue should  be framed is as a concept of interdependence as a basis for  development of the CIS. Russia's national interest lies in  helping establish an integrating community within the CIS space  that will be founded on a socially-oriented market economy and  democratic values and will be similar in type to the European  Community. This alone can make the CIS viable. A "Monroe  Doctrine" will doom it. No one will tolerate Russian dominance  and dictates. The joint statement by Kravchuk and Nazarbayev  sharply condemning Kozyrev's proclamation of the near abroad as  a sphere of Russian vital interests clearly demonstrates that.  The initiative by Kazakhstan's president to create a Eurasian  Union fits in very well with the concept of interdependence.    The Russian "Monroe Doctrine" is nothing more nor less than  a  resurrection of the "policy of making enemies" not only in the  near abroad but also in the countries of Eastern and Western  Europe. The current "Drang nach Westen" by the Eastern European  countries and their efforts to be admitted to NATO can be  attributed to their fear of a revival of traditional Soviet and  Russian hegemonism and expansionism. That is a fairly typical  perception of Russian policy among countries in the region.    So what is our policy doing? Instead of dispelling these  fears, the president's inner circle is constantly heightening  them. How can those countries have confidence in the policy of  the Yeltsin administration when, in addition to the Monroe  Doctrine, it has also armed itself with a Russian version of  Dulles' "massive retaliation doctrine," which envisions Russian  first use of nuclear weapons in the event of an attack on its  territory or that of its allies, i.e. the states within the  Russian sphere of interests, as follows from an assertion by the  president in "Fundamental Principles of Russian Federation  Military Doctrine"?    When declaring Russia the successor state to the USSR,  Russia's leaders did not even deem it necessary to state that  there would be no succession with regard to the Soviet regime's  expansionist policy, or to express their sincere apologies to  the peoples of Eastern Europe who were the victims of that  policy. It is clear that in more than two years' time Russian  policy has not succeeded in establishing relations of confidence  with the countries of the near abroad and Eastern Europe. Those  relations are greatly burdened by the old perceptions of  political circles in those countries regarding Russia's imperial  aspirations. Those perceptions have been reinforced by the use  of outdated means of economic and military pressure against  those countries and by a lack of tact and political finesse in  relations with them.    According to the laws of action and reaction, the response  to  growing Russian neo-imperialist tendencies has been symptoms of  a Western return to the old "containment policy." The difference  from the past is that this containment does not begin along the  perimeter of the former USSR's sphere of influence, but rather  along the current borders between Russia and the CIS countries,  and under circumstances of economic ruin and political  instability in Russia, i.e on very unfavorable terms for Russia.  Have the proponents of a Russian "Monroe Doctrine" stopped to  consider this?    The current situation with regard to the shaping of Russian  foreign policy is in some ways reminiscent of early 1946, at  which time the overall orientation of the Soviet Union's postwar  foreign policy strategy was determined. It was then that at  Stalin's request the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of World  Economics and World Policy developed a concept which suggested  that all efforts be focused on reinforcing the country  domestically and that the country refrain from expanding the  Soviet sphere of influence in Europe and also avoid a  confrontation with the West, which the Soviet Union could not  sustain. When Stalin read this concept he ordered the institute  dissolved and its director, Academician Varga, arrested, along  with a number of his colleagues who helped develop the ideas.  But in the end it was Varga who was proved correct, not Stalin.    Today it would be a disaster for Russia to slip once again  into a state of "cold war" or even lower-level confrontation  with the West as a result of returning to an imperialist policy.  In that case the United States and its allies would attempt to  create a cordon sanitaire against Russia in the near  abroad. There have been plenty of calls for that already.    Russia's national interests do not require that it pit  itself  against the West, particularly with an imperialist policy, a  Russian "Monroe Doctrine," appeals to countries to remain  outside the "Partnership for Peace" or other such twists and  turns of Russian foreign policy thinking. What they do require  is the country's further progress along the path of political,  economic and cultural integration in the family of civilized  states from which it was isolated by more the more than 70 years  of totalitarian communist domination. Only on that path can  Russia achieve true greatness and prosperity.</p>

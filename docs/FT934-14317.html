			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Cable phones challenge BT, survey finds AROUND HALF of all telephone users would change their telephone company if they were offered free local calls, according to a Gallup survey carried out for the big cable television companies. The offer of free local calls was so strong a motivation that among the respondents 48 per cent of cable TV subscribers, 50 per cent of a national sample without cable and even 40 per cent of those who already have a cable telephone said they would move to get such a concession. The survey found that three quarters of subscribers to cable telephone services - more than 200,000 homes now use cable telephony, mostly through Mercury Communications - gave cost as their main reason for choosing cable. Cable operators claim discounts of about 15 per cent on telephone bills, although at least part of the difference comes from the fact that telephone bills charge for time actually used while British Telecom charges in units. There was also a widespread belief that BT's service had improved, with more than 40 per cent saying it had improved 'considerably' or 'a fair amount'. Cable television subscribers who have retained BT as their telephone company say they have done so because the company is 'efficient', because they are 'used to it', because it is a 'large, reliable company' and because of 'consistency of service'. The Gallup survey was based on interviews with more than 500 cable television subscribers and more than 1,000 non-subscribers.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (5): No anxiety over competition from Paris - The city's stock exchange is the largest currency options market in the world It may be the oldest equities trading forum in the US, dating all the way back to 1790, but the Philadelphia Stock Exchange today is better known for its thriving currency options business than it is for the trading of stocks, a business now thoroughly dominated in the US by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq screen-based market. That is not to say that the PHLX has abandoned equities trading. It currently lists 2,200 stocks, and volume last year totalled 1.3bn shares, averaging about 5m shares a day. These totals, however, are dwarfed by the big exchanges. The NYSE traded 66.9bn shares last year, at an average of 264m a day. The PHLX's share of all equities trading in the US hovers around 3 per cent, behind not just the NYSE and the Nasdaq, but also the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco and the Midwest Stock Exchange in Chicago. Philadelphia does have a bigger share of the equities options market, where it comes in behind the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock Exchange in New York. The PHLX is noted for its index options. Its next product will be an option on a Big Cap index, a basket of 50 large-capitalisation US stocks, nicknamed the 'nifty fifty', which the PHLX hopes will grab the attention of investors. Yet, if you mention the exchange's name to anyone in the financial markets in the US and overseas, they will almost always think first of currency options. Having pioneered the product in the early 1980s, the PHLX is now the largest exchange-traded currency options market in the world. Last year, a record 13.1m currency option contracts were traded on the exchange, keeping it well ahead of its main rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In 1992, the PHLX handled the world's largest single currency options trade, which consisted of 180,800 French franc options with an underlying value of Dollars 8.1bn. The PHLX opened its currency options business in 1982 with a sterling option contract. Since then, it has added options on the Deutsche Mark, the yen, the French and Swiss francs, the Canadian and Australian dollars, and European currency units (Ecus). It also trades options on three cross-rates: D-Mark/yen, sterling/D-Mark, and sterling/yen. The PHLX has become popular because it's products appear to fit the needs of corporate risk managers who wish to hedge their foreign exchange risks, because its market is liquid, and because the floor is open for most of the day. In fact, the PHLX trades currency options for all but three and a half hours of each working day. Currency options contracts are most useful during periods of volatility on the foreign exchange markets, and so the turmoil among European currencies since 1992 has been a godsend for the PHLX. Companies and financial institutions, seeking to hedge their currency risk in the increasingly unpredictable forex markets, especially those facing exposure to the French franc, have been using the PHLX's currency options contracts. Its business from European customers has grown so much that last year the exchange moved its annual September symposium from Philadelphia to Paris. It is from Paris, however, that the PHLX faces a potential threat to its dominance of the currency options market. Later this month, the Paris futures market (Matif), will launch two dollar options contracts on the French franc and the D-Mark. The Matif hopes the contracts will win European, and particularly French, business back from Philadelphia. If the first two contracts are popular, the Paris exchange will consider launching 20 others. The PHLX, however, is untroubled by the prospect of another exchange trying to break into one of its biggest markets. Nicholas Giordano, PHLX chairman, says: 'No, we're not worried. We have been able to maintain a leadership position because we understand this market very well. We refine our products as they need refining. We respond to our customers. We provide liquidity, and we continue to educate. And the customers appreciate that, so I see no reason why anything will change.' But surely when the Matif's currency options start trading, European institutions will choose to use the exchange on their doorstep, rather than one in the US? 'First of all, I'm not sure what it is that is going to be on their doorstep,' replies Mr Giordano. 'There needs to be liquidity, there needs to be service, and an understanding by the people providing the service. Customers know they can get it here.' He is not even worried that the time difference between Paris and Philadelphia will give the Matif a big natural advantage. 'We're open in their time zone, at 1.30am. And it gets very active here at 3.30am, which is 9.30am Paris time. We've done that to facilitate our customers in Europe, and I think they appreciate that. I see no reason at all why (the business) should shift. I don't know what added value is being brought to the table. I haven't seen it.' Industry experts agree that it will difficult for Paris to wrest business away from Philadelphia, because the PHLX has such a head start over the Matif in the currency options business. Hal Hansen, president of Cargill Investor Services in Chicago, says: 'The Philadelphia Stock Exchange has for years developed and created a viable product and a very popular contract. I can understand why the Matif is aiming to compete for that business, but experience shows that it's very difficult to unseat an exchange, and take a product away, when it's been very well established over time. There are loyalties, and confidence in market mechanisms, and established levels of liquidity, that customers are comfortable with, and have come to depend on. That is not to say that the Matif can't develop the same product, but it won't be an easy task, and at the very least it will take lot of time. Ultimately, of course, the customer will decide, based on where they're getting the best pricing and the best quality of liquidity.' The Matif is not the only cloud in the PHLX's sky. As a small, successful, exchange, the PHLX is regularly discussed as a candidate for a merger with any one of its many rivals. This is based on the assumption that there are too many options exchanges in the US, and that consolidation is required if the industry is to prosper into the 20th century. Since the late 1980s, the PHLX has received several merger offers, and rejected them all, most recently in December when it turned down a proposed Dollars 68m merger with the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Mr Giordano believes the PHLX is better off independent, and many of the exchange's members - who know that a merger would leave a large number of them out of a job - agree. The PHLX chairman says: 'It has proven to be very difficult to merge two exchanges. If you look around, you'll be hard-pressed to find that two viable exchanges have ever merged.' The latest offer from the CBOE was declined, says Mr Giordano, 'because the membership wanted to stay independent, and they felt that price offered was nowhere near value of the exchange. But I'm not sure there is a right price.' Ultimately, he believes that it is in the best interests of the industry's customers that the US exchanges remain independent, because competition between them has led to a better quality product and better service.</p>

It was decided at the meeting that the compilation of the  market-opening package would be carried out in two stages: 1)  to work out by the end of March as many firm measures as  possible; and 2) to work out by June details in areas expected  to require more discussion time, in time for the G-7 summit  meeting of major industrialized nations in Naples in July.    The government had planned to work out its complete, new,  market-opening package by the end of March. However, it has  become clear it cannot compile practical measures in such a  short time because many government ministries and agencies have  already implemented deregulation, among other measures, to the  greatest degree possible. As a result, the government changed  its plan. It decided to do its utmost to work out a  market-opening package by the end of March, but would compile it  in two stages, with June as the deadline for completion of the  unfinished portion.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura made a comment at  a news conference held the same evening. He said: "There may  be some areas where only basic guidelines can be determined by  the end of March. However, a complete package, to be worked out  by June, will include these areas."</p>

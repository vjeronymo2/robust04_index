			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of ``Qualified Individuals With Disabilities'' (&sect;9.103)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Eliminate Definition. Five commenters stated that the definition for ``qualified individuals with disabilities'' should be removed from the part 9 rule. One commenter stated that HUD concedes in the preamble to the proposed part 9 rule that housing programs do not require a definition of qualified individual with disabilities (56 FR 24606). The commenter stated that HUD included this definition so that the part 9 rule will cover all programs or activities conducted by HUD now and in the future, and so that HUD's regulation will be consistent with the DOJ's prototype regulation and the regulations of other Federal agencies (56 FR 24606). The commenter stated that HUD could achieve its purpose through other ways, such as explicitly describing the HUD programs or the kinds of HUD programs to which the definition applies, or explaining that this term does not apply to housing consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The term ``qualified individual with disabilities'' is taken directly from the language of section 504. The protection afforded by section 504 is restricted to ``qualified'' individuals with disabilities. As noted in the preamble to the part 9 proposed rule, HUD does not conduct programs under which a person is required to perform services or achieve a level of accomplishment as a part of his or her participation in a particular program or activity (e.g., educational programs) (56 FR 24606). Notwithstanding this fact, HUD determined, as also noted in the preamble to the part 9 proposed rule, that it is important to include a definition for this term so that HUD's regulation will cover all programs or activities conducted by HUD now and in the future, and so that its section 504 regulation for federally conducted programs will be consistent with DOJ's prototype regulation. However, the fact that section 504 applies only to ``qualified individuals with disabilities'' makes it important to include a definition for this term in HUD's section 504 regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose in defining the term ``qualified individuals with disabilities'' is to establish a uniform standard by which an individual with disabilities is determined to be ``qualified'' to participate in a federally assisted or federally conducted program. The standard, as established by DOJ on the basis of Federal case law concerning section 504, is whether, with appropriate modifications, an individual with disabilities is able to participate in, or achieve the purpose of a federally assisted or federally conducted program or activity. To be considered qualified, however, the modifications required for the individual with disabilities may not be those which would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  preamble to DOJ's coordination regulation for federally conducted programs codified at 28 CFR part 39, Editorial Note, 415&hyph;429 (1991) at 418; and preamble to proposed part 9 rule at 56 FR 24606.) HUD's definition of ``qualified individuals with disabilities'' incorporates this basic test established by DOJ and Federal case law and is consistent with the DOJ's definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' in its section 504 prototype regulation for federally conducted programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment: Eliminate Language Concerning Essential Eligibility Requirements  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five commenters objected to the language concerning ``essential eligibility requirements'' set forth in paragraph (b) of the definition. One commenter stated that the essential eligibility requirement language included ``implicit'' eligibility requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In defining ``qualified individual with disabilities,'' HUD adheres to DOJ's guidance on the meaning and interpretation of this term, which guidance is set forth in DOJ's preamble to the final rule implementing its section 504 prototype regulation for federally conducted programs, codified at 28 CFR part 39, Editorial Note, 415&hyph;429 (1991). In this preamble, DOJ advises that the concept of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' includes the notion of ``essential eligibility requirements''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 419). Under section 504, a qualified individual with disabilities must be able to meet the essential eligibility requirements of a federally assisted or federally conducted program, with the recognition that reasonable modification may need to be made to the program for the individual with disabilities to meet the essential eligibility requirements of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inclusion of the term ``implicit requirements'' in the definition is to clarify that the essential eligibility requirements do not include only stated program eligibility requirements, but also those requirements that are inherent in the nature of the program. However, in including implicit requirements in the definition, HUD does not intend a program's eligibility requirements to include requirements that are not intrinsic to the program or that are applied solely to individuals with disabilities_and not to other tenants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``All Obligations of Occupancy'' Are Not Essential. One commenter stated that the ``essential eligibility requirements'' include the requirement to comply with ``all obligations of occupancy.'' The commenter stated that all obligations of occupancy cannot possibly be essential. The commenter stated: ``Rather than clarifying the obligations of program operators under section 504, this definition will mislead operators into believing that they can exclude any individual with disabilities who cannot fully satisfy every term of the lease, however incidental or unimportant.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The phrase ``all obligations of occupancy,'' as with the phrase ``implicit eligibility requirements'' discussed above, is intended to refer only to those requirements or obligations that are imposed on all tenants or residents, regardless of whether the tenants or residents are individuals with disabilities. The Department believes that it is important to retain the phrase ``all obligations of occupancy'' within the definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' because it is embodied in the concept of ``essential eligibility requirements''. To be eligible to participate in a HUD housing program, an applicant must be able to comply with all obligations of occupancy. Typical occupancy obligations include those related to rent, security deposits, use of premises, subletting, and utility charges. It is inappropriate for the Department to list in a regulation which obligations constitute ``important'' obligations of occupancy, because of the difficulty in ensuring the comprehensiveness of such a list, and because certain multifamily housing projects as a result of their location or use may require the inclusion of obligations (or terms) that are not generally found in leases for other multifamily housing projects. For the foregoing reasons, the Department declines to state which obligations of occupancy are those with which an individual with disabilities must comply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Definition Fails to Note the Obligation of HUD to Provide Reasonable Accommodations. Two commenters stated that the definition fails to note the obligation of HUD to provide reasonable accommodation to individuals who would be able to satisfy essential program requirements with such assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD's definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' is consistent with the definition for this term found in DOJ's section 504 prototype regulation for federally conducted programs and in the section 504 regulations of other Federal agencies. The fact that the definition of qualified individual with disabilities does not explicitly refer to the ``reasonable modification'' requirement does not mean that the requirement is inapplicable to Federal programs covered by section 504. As noted earlier in this preamble, reasonable modification is required under section 504. The reasonable modification requirement, although not explicitly referred to in the definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities,'' is referred to in the definition of ``individual with disabilities'' and is implicitly referenced in the language of the definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' that provides that modifications in the program or activity, which result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program, are not required. Conversely, modifications to the program that would not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Japan to boost economy with Pounds 107bn tax cut: Coalition threatened as SDP says it will quit unless plan is modified A triumphant Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, early this morning announced an income tax cut worth Y18,000bn (Pounds 107.8bn) over the next three years in an attempt to lift the economy out of its worst recession since the second world war. The cost of the plan, however, has been heightened instability within the fragile seven-party coalition. Hours after the announcement, the Social Democratic party, the largest but least dependable member, said that it opposed the package and threatened to quit the government unless the plan is modified. The SDP, formerly called Socialists, campaigned in last July's general election on a promise not to increase sales tax - one of the planks of the package. Mr Hosokowa is now looking to support from the opposition Liberal Democratic party, with which he is co-operating on economic and trade policy, to enable him to outvote coalition rebels. This adds weight to the theory that a large centre-right coalition, including most of the present alliance plus pro-reformists from the LDP and socialists, is developing. The package had little initial impact on the stock market. The Nikkei 225 average was about 60 points below Wednesday's close of 20,250.03. The government plans a Y6,000bn overall tax cut this year, including Y5,300bn of income tax reductions plus Y700bn of cuts in corporation tax, car sales tax surcharge and inheritance tax. All, except the car sales tax, will be backdated to January 1 - but financed by a rise in consumption tax. The measures form the centrepiece of a package of tax cuts, government spending and low-cost loans, worth at least an estimated Y14,000bn, to be published later today. It will be Japan's largest ever pump-priming package, coming after three earlier stimulus plans in the past 14 months, together worth just over Y30,000bn. 'This will increase household incomes and stimulate the economy,' said Mr Hosokawa. The income tax cut will be partly financed by a 7 per cent 'people's welfare tax' which will replace the current 3 per cent sales levy - the equivalent of the European Union's value added tax - from April 1 1997. Mr Hosokawa admitted that members of his own Japan New party also had doubts about the sales tax rise. Last week's agreement between the government and the opposition over far-reaching plans for political reform cleared the way for the package, which had been held up by the reform debate. The tax announcement is a victory for Japan's powerful finance ministry, which had insisted that an income tax cut must come with a rise in sales tax. This is needed partly to avoid straining a state budget already suffering from a drop in tax revenues used by the recession. The government is also planning to raise liquor taxes for the first time in 10 years, officials said. The income tax cut is by far the largest in recent years, although it is line with what markets were expecting. It will be welcomed by Japan's anxious business community and is designed to deflect US pressure for numerically measured increases in market share for imports. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Mr W. Bowman Cutter, Washington's chief trade negotiator with Japan, in Tokyo yesterday completed an apparently fruitless day of negotiations for numerically targeted increases in imports.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Lesson in penal costs Sir, In 1975 I asked Dr SummerskilI, the then minister concerned, what was the cost of imprisonment or detention in England and Wales. The figures given were Pounds 165 a month or Pounds 1,979 a year for male prisoners and for female prisoners Pounds 231 a month or Pounds 2,773 a year. In Scotland the equivalent figures were Pounds 156.37 a month, or Pounds 1,876.43 a year. The equivalent figures for England and Wales in 1991-92 were Pounds 442 a week for male prisoners and Pounds 629 a week for female prisoners. In Scotland the equivalent figures for 1992-93 are Pounds 24,550 for a closed prison a year and Pounds 31,000 for an open prison or young offenders' institution, an increase of more than 15 times. In 1973-75 the cost of sending a child to a public school was greater than the cost of keeping a child in prison. Last year the cost of keeping an adult in prison was three times that of a residential public school. This would seem to be one unexplained example of why we have a deficit of Pounds 50bn and a borrowing requirement of Pounds 1bn a month. Perhaps the chancellor, home secretary and secretary of state for Scotland could explain how the cost of Eton is so much less than the cost of Wormwood Scrubs and the cost of Loretto so much less than Shotts Prison.

After Police Chief Fernando Caldera announced he would evict  hundreds of members of the transportation sector, who had  gathered on the Metro Centro highway, the busiest in Managua,  the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] asked Tomas  Borge, interior minister during the Sandinist government, to  mediate to avoid a conflict. Representatives of the CNT agreed  to avoid confrontation by removing the vehicles that were  obstructing traffic, while the authorities promised to remain at  a prudent distance.    Former Interior Minister Borge said the most important thing  is to reach a negotiated solution between the government and the  transportation sector. Meanwhile, the FSLN issued a communique  supporting the transportation sector demands, which include a  decrease in fuel prices and a law regulating the Nicaraguan  transportation system.    The police released two members of the transportation sector  who had been arrested, while a soldier, who had been kidnapped  by the strikers, was released. The police were about to  implement an operation to evict the strikers, which would have  led to a bloody confrontation, according to some media.    The CNT reiterated its call to the Violeta Chamorro  government to resume negotiations, because the strike is very  costly for the country.    The Transportation Ministry said there are no plans to  negotiate with the CNT because it has reached agreements with  four transportation organizations, which represent nearly 75  percent of the sector, that are not participating in the strike.    On the streets of Managua, thousands of people have had to  walk to work since the strike began or have had to pay high  prices for service provided by substitute drivers. It is  believed that 20 percent of the transportation sector in Managua  is not heeding the strike call.</p>

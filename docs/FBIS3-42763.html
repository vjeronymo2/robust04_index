			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Dolzhenko, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA </F> correspondent: "Talk Will Get You to Kiev, If It Is Talk of  Cooperation"]    [Text] Kiev--Without waiting for politicians to begin to  correct the aftereffects of the "divorce" of the republics of  the former Union, the managers of the ministries and departments  of machine-building of the CIS countries who assembled in Kiev  created an interstate council that is supposed to coordinate and  direct the cooperation of the separated enterprises.    It is operating on the principles of full voluntariness and  collegiality. Groups of experts of each of the countries are  preparing questions which will be submitted later for the  consideration of the members of the council that assembles each  time in one of the founder-countries. Four such meetings have  already been held--in Tashkent, Moscow, Minsk, and Kiev. At the  last one, the Kiev meeting, a resolution was passed on the  organization of a permanently operating secretariat of the  council.    Numerous urgent questions have piled up. The council members  were instructed to complete the development of lists of  organizations and joint-stock companies involved in the  conclusion of bilateral treaties. The development of  multilateral agreements is considered unsuitable. It was  proposed to continue the extension of credits of accounts for  mutual supplies, the exemption of machine-building enterprises  from customs duties, the allocation of quotas, and the issuance  of licenses. To reinforce mutual relations and simplify  settlements it was decided to begin joint conversion to  joint-stock companies of related enterprises and establish joint  enterprises and joint-stock companies, transnational  financial-industrial groups, and other types of joint economic  activity. Without putting the matter off indefinitely, Belarus  signed a treaty on bilateral cooperation with Georgia, Moldova,  Tajikistan, and Ukraine; Georgia--with Tajikistan and Ukraine;  and Ukraine--with Moldova, Russia, and Tajikistan.    The next important decision was the adoption of a long-term  program of joint investment and support of capacities in the  most important types of products. Joint investment will be  conducted by means of the creation of enterprises with shared or  joint forms of ownership. Such treaties between the Goskomprom  [State Committee for Industry] of Belarus and Roskommash  [Russian Federation Committee on Machine Building] were signed  for five installations: the Tver machine-building plant AO  [joint-stock company], the Altayvagonmash AO, the Demikhovo  machine-building plant AO, the Minsk engine plant, and the Minsk  tractor plant, and between the Ministry of Industry of  Kazakhstan and Roskommash for four installations, between the  Radioelektrontekhpribor concern of Uzbekistan and Roskommash for  the Vostoklift enterprise. Unfortunately, Ukraine has rejected  joint investments. It has no money. For the same reason, Ukraine  did not contribute resources to the charter fund of the  International Bank of Machine-Building Development MBM-Bank,  though fully supporting the idea of its creation. It will  significantly speed up the movement of payments and will promote  purposeful investment and credit extension. In a word, payments  to the charter fund were made only by Russia, Moldova, and  Tajikistan--30 million rubles [R] each. The others either do not  have the resources or the legislative basis is lagging.    It must be said that the last factor was a dissonance in the  activity of the council. For example, because of this there was  a delay of two months in the preparation of founding documents  and state registration of the transnational joint-stock company  on the basis of the UralAZ [Ural Automobile Plant] AO and the  Kustanayskiy diesel plant. An agreement was reached to prepare a  proposal in the governments of the states in the first half year  about making refinements and additions in them, taking into  account the convergence of legislative principles and the  formation of an integrated investment space.    The first months of work of the council once again confirmed  an old truth: It is always simpler to destroy than to create.  Revival of the market space and integration within the framework  of the CIS is proceeding slowly, at times painfully. This is  associated first and foremost with the fear of a return to the  former relations, and it is also associated among machine  builders with the work that has been started in the republics on  national programs for the structural restructuring of the  economy. However, V. Lyashchev, deputy minister of  machine-building of the VPK [military-industrial complex] and  conversion in Ukraine, noted that neither one nor the other  should be feared. Already today the council is viewed as a  former CEMA, in its similarity, and relations are being built  between the council's member states.    Much has been said about the creation of a machine builders'  newspaper of council member states. But why engender a new  publication, it was heard in debates, when there is a newspaper  that fits the profile and is published in all the CIS  countries--RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. It could put out supplements,  special issues, and enclosures for machine builders, would help  them join other related branches of industry, and this would be  cheaper, simpler, and with a high level of professionalism.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Francois Roche: "Dissatisfaction Spreading </F> Among Employers"]    [Text] Since last March, the government and the employers  have been living with a misunderstanding. Edouard Balladur came  to power planning to deregulate the economy and reduce the  burden of compulsory contributions, but he has had to bow to the  fact that the economic problems were more serious than expected.  He has not been able to avoid falling into a quarrel that has  been going on in France for more than 10 years: After granting  a number of cost reductions to enterprises, the government says  it expects a resumption in hiring. That has not happened.    Since last week, the misunderstanding has grown even worse,  relating both to conditions that could be imposed on the  reimbursement of VAT and the incentive regulation to create jobs  in a number of service activities. This policy, which is, to  say the least, voluntary, has the gift of annoying enterprise  chiefs. Of course, the CNPF [National Council of French  Employers] is taking care not to show its disappointment too  abruptly, but dissatisfaction is growing in the ranks.    What are the employers saying in private? First, that the  government seems to have run out of imagination in the sphere of  economic policy, without having obtained any notable result.  Domestic demand is still lifeless. And yet its recovery is the  vital precondition for a resumption in investment and  employment. "We cannot see any driving force likely to revive  the economic machinery rapidly," the CNPF economists say.    The second main criticism the employers are making of the  government is linked with the state's spending rate: It is  tending to increase. "The size of the noncommercial economy in  France is becoming untenable," the boss of a large private  industrial group said. Without a reduction in contributions,  there is no reduction in the cost of labor, and hence there is a  need to resort to job cuts to remain in world competition. This  is the scenario large French employers say they are  "experiencing."    "The economy is no longer in a position to tolerate social  security contributions, which continue to increase by 6 to 7  percent each year, whereas resources are increasing by 1 to 2  percent," the latest CNPF bulletin states.    There is, therefore, a risk of the government losing  credibility in employers' circles. The electoral consequences  of this would be nonexistent or almost nonexistent. However, 10  months after being carried to power by this country's economic  leaders, this is certainly not something Edouard Balladur  expected.</p>

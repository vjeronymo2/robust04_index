			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALK LIKE A MAN  </P> <P> We instructors in the aerobics profession have been trying very hard to entice  men into the aerobics room. It is a great workout for anyone, any age, any sex.  It is not a woman's domain. Men are already hesitant to try for fear of being  confronted by women like Littwin. I hope none of my class members read her  article, or I'll have to start back at square one! One more man in aerobics  equals one less couch potato!  </P> <P> JUNE SCHNEIDER  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

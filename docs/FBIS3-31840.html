			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Redzovic from Tesanj] </F>   [Text] The Serb aggressor's fierce attacks have been coming  in waves against the unified free territory under the control of  the 7th South Operative Group. The enemy has been launching  heavy attacks along the entire defense line. However, our men  are not giving in and they have inflicted heavy losses on the  enemy in the operational zones of all their six brigades.    This enemy offensive is by far the strongest in intensity  and  it is also the most extensive so far. The aggressor has  deployed eight brigades with over 15,000 men, six of which are  local and two from elsewhere, consisting of soldiers from Banja  Luka, Prnjavor, Mt. Romanija, Pale, Sokolac -- in other words,  from the Sarajevo front -- and from Serbia and Montenegro.  Every day the enemy is using over 100 artillery pieces of over  82-mm caliber, tanks, and armored personnel carriers.    These, the heaviest artillery pieces of the occupying  forces,  are being accompanied by unprecedented psychological propaganda  activities, particularly via local radio stations. [words  indistinct] propaganda during the first days of the offensive  that started on 17 January was aimed at the Croats, that is, at  the 110th Glorious HVO Usora Brigade, which was constantly being  urged to join the Serb aggressor. That failed, and then the  Chetniks launched fierce attacks on Croatian villages and the  entire defense line of the 110th Brigade. The attacks are  continuing.    There have been questions as to what will change here in  view  of the NATO ultimatum, but no one expects the Sarajevo model to  be applied in this region, even though Maglaj has been mentioned  as an option but only as a protected area.    The Serb aggressor now has four strategic aims: The conquest  of the free territory under the control of the 7th South  Operative Group, attacks in the direction of Posavina, the  linking of Banja Luka via Bihac with Knin and its railroad line,  and the linking of Chetnik territories via Olovo. Therefore the  target of the heaviest aggressor's attacks will still be the  operational zone of the 7th South Operative Group.    According to reliable assessments, these attacks will take  the following course: The enemy will again try to cut the  Doboj-Teslic route, and occupy the valley of the Usora River.  There it will launch a massive offensive on the (links) of the  110th Glorious HVO Usora Brigade and other units, with renewed  calls for Croatian betrayal. [Words indistinct] of besieging  Tesanj by capturing the dominant hills around it and gradually  destroying it. The aggressor's next step will be to cut off the  Maglaj-Tesanj route and thus close the circle around Maglaj,  which is at the moment under heavy attack. All this would  create the conditions for the complete occupation of the Tesanj  and Maglaj territories.    However, to judge by the military results achieved so far by  the army units from the 7th South Operative Group and their  outstandingly high morale, it is certain that the enemy  offensive will end in complete collapse, and -- according to  Mustafa Cerovac, commander of the 7th South Operative Group --  the siege of this area could even be lifted with the cooperation  of other army units.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Ricoh buys French distributor RICOH, the Japanese office equipment manufacturer, yesterday announced that it would acquire SMO Bureautique, a distribution subsidiary of Metrologie International, the French electrical equipment company. Ricoh's Fr202.5m (Dollars 49m) purchase follows that by Canon, another Japanese office supply maker, in establishing independent manufacturing and distribution operations in France. The move comes at a time when Japanese companies are refocusing their investments towards core domestic businesses. Overseas acquisitions by Japanese companies have declined sharply as the fall in the stock and real estate markets have squeezed companies' cash flow. Ricoh said the move was strategically important, as a quarter of its sales in Europe was generated in France. Its production line in Colmar, Alsace, has been manufacturing photocopiers, facsimile machines and other office equipment since 1987. Ricoh said there would be no drastic restructuring of operations at SMO Bureautique, which employs over 800 staff.</p>

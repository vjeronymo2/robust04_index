			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the two governments of the  ROK and the United States have shared opinions [chopkun] to  deploy the missile-intercepting Patriot missiles at U.S. forces  bases in the ROK in March in case of war [siljon]. A  high-ranking government official said today that even though  U.S. President Clinton has not yet made a final approval of the  deployment of the Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula, he  will approve their deployment soon. The official added that  because our government agrees in principle to deploying the  Patriot missile in the ROK in case of war, the Patriot missiles  will be deployed at U.S. forces bases in the ROK around March.  The official revealed that this time 36 Patriot missiles in all  will be deployed in order to protect the strategic fortified  zone of the U.S. forces in the ROK.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: John Laing climbs to Pounds 18.3m - Reduced operating costs and housing provisions behind 58% jump Pre-tax profits at John Laing, the construction group, rose by 58 per cent last year from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 18.3m, helped by a 9 per cent fall in operating costs and reduced provisions in the group's UK and US housing operations. Group turnover fell by just Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.26bn, while earnings per share by almost 60 per cent to 15p (9.4p). The group is paying a maintained final dividend of 6p making a same-again total for the year of 9p. Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said that construction profits in difficult markets in the UK had fallen from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 9.9m on turnover reduced from Pounds 1.08bn to Pounds 1.02bn, with the group 'declining to chase work at the expense of profitability.' Given low profits available on traditional UK contracts won in open tender - construction profits last year represented just 1.8 per cent of turnover (including interest earned on advance cash payments) - Laing intends to seek a greater proportion of its work abroad. This currently accounts for about ten per cent of the company's order book of about Pounds 900m, but could rise to a fifth over the next few years. The company also intends to increase its involvement in privately financed infrastructure projects. The company has already indicated that it will acquire small equity stakes and has made investments worth Pounds 27m at Birmingham Airport (Pounds 5m); the Severn road bridge (Pounds 3.5m); a hospital at Clydebank; two Spanish motorway companies (Pounds 2m) and Malaysian power stations (Pounds 12.2m). The company last year raised Pounds 38.9m through a placing and offer for sale of convertible preference shares to help fund private infrastructure initiatives. This has left the group with net cash of Pounds 45.8m at the end of December compared with Pounds 7.2m at the end of 1992. The UK housing division helped by an absence of provisions and with sales up from 2,175 to 2,430 homes moved from a Pounds 900,000 loss in 1992 to a Pounds 4.3m profit last year. US housing losses, in spite of a further Pounds 2.7m provision, were reduced from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.7m. COMMENT Laing is a class contractor carving out respectable margins where other construction companies might struggle. Its performance during the recession has been impressive. Its weakness is its housing operations which still hold a high proportion of more expensive land acquired during the late 1980s. Southern California, although improving, also, remains a difficult housing market. With housebuilding leading the industry out of recession and UK contracting margins likely to remain low, Laing's rating looks full on a prospective p/e in the mid twenties on pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m this year.</p>

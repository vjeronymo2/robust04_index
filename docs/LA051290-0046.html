			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRACHSEL BAFFLES CANYONS  </P> <P> A flag tap-dancing in the brisk breeze blowing out at College of the Canyons'  launching pad of a field Friday seemed to portend offensive pyrotechnics, but  Canyons' flagging offense fizzled altogether.  </P> <P> Canyons was blown away when Fullerton right-hander Steve Trachsel went low and  away with an effective mix of fastballs, split-finger fastballs and curves.  </P> <P> Trachsel held seventh-seeded Canyons scoreless for 8 2/3 innings, and Fullerton  defeated the Cougars, 4-2, in the opening game of the state baseball tournament  Southern California regional.  </P> <P> "I think Trachsel is pretty darn good," Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "He  matched up well with our offense. He could just own the outside of the plate  with that slider. . . . He's a guy you need to go the other way with, and we're  not very good at that."  </P> <P> Trachsel (9-3), a sophomore right-hander, did not allow an earned run and  walked two.  </P> <P> He extended the Cougars' scoreless streak to nearly 18 innings before Chris  Vasquez hit a two-out, two-strike, two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth.  Canyons (24-14) was blanked in its previous game after having scored in its  first 36 contests.  </P> <P> Vasquez's home run, his seventh, was a high, slicing fly to left with Mike  Kerber on base.  </P> <P> However, Canyons' bats had been so mute, Vasquez's home run was moot, and  Trachsel completed his six-hitter two batters later.  </P> <P> If Canyons' offense wasn't doing any damage, its defense certainly was. The  Cougars committed five errors, but atoned somewhat by erasing six Fullerton  baserunners.  </P> <P> In the third inning, Fullerton (25-13) scored its first run when a play  backfired.  </P> <P> Canyons third baseman Jon Beauchemin fielded a ground ball, faked a throw to  first and pivoted to catch the runner leaning off third. His throw to third  went awry, though, allowing Willy Speakman to dash home.  </P> <P> Benny Rodriguez, demoted from leadoff to ninth in the batting order, gave  Fullerton a 2-0 lead with a solo home run in the fifth. He reached base in each  of his four at-bats.  </P> <P> Fullerton put together three consecutive singles to score another run in the  sixth off starter Mike Teich.  </P> <P> Teich (6-3) took the loss after allowing three runs, two earned, and eight hits  in six innings.  </P> <P> "Teich did all right. He sort of did what we wanted him to do," said Mohney,  who added that limiting Fullerton to four runs on a blustery day should have  been sufficient for his usually potent offense.  </P> <P> Jeff Adams opened the seventh in relief of Teich and allowed only one run, a  ninth-inning home run by former Glendale College player David Weckerle.  </P> <P> Canyons led the Western State Conference with a .360 average in conference play  but its first five batters were a combined two for 20 and no starter had more  than one hit.  </P> <P> The teams will play the second game of the best-of-three series at 11 this  morning today at Canyons and a third game, if necessary, 30 minutes after the  completion of game two.  </P> <P> "Tomorrow morning becomes a bit of a gut check," Mohney said.  </P> <P> PLAYOFF ROUNDUP: C17  </P></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Zenith chief executive in surprise move to Digital MR Enrico Pesatori, formerly president and chief executive of Zenith Data Systems, is taking charge of the personal computer division of Digital Equipment Corporation. The move reflects an abrupt change of culture at the US minicomputer maker as it fights to return to profitable growth. He will be replaced at Zenith by Mr Jacques Noels, president of Nokia Consumer Electronics of Finland. Mr Pesatori, 52, has been at Zenith for the past two years, joining after its acquisition by Groupe Bull of France. An accomplished technologist, he is widely credited with having refocused Zenith's product line and creating partnership deals, including an agreement with IBM through which the US computer group is marketing Zenith's portable computers. His move to Digital comes as a surprise; it is understood he was made a tempting offer to become general manager of DEC's personal computer business unit. Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's newly-appointed chief executive, said Mr Pesatori would be responsible for establishing Digital as a 'growing and profitable force in the world PC market'. To date, Digital has been comparatively unsuccessful in PCs. It came into the market late with uncompetitive products and has only recently started to recover lost ground. Mr Palmer's appointment of an outsider to such an important position would have been unlikely under his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Olsen, and is an indication of a sea change at Digital. Last week, Mr Palmer appointed Mr John Klein, an IBM employee of 25 years' standing, to head Digital's consumer business unit.</p>

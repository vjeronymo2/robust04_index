			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Second-quarter profits slip 23% at Travelers TRAVELERS, the US composite insurer, revealed that second-quarter underlying profits had slipped 23.7 per cent to Dollars 74.8m from Dollars 98m in the same period of last year, writes Karen Zagor. An extraordinary gain in the 1992 quarter and a one-time charge a year earlier reduced the decline to 14.3 per cent, bringing reported net income to Dollars 77.7m, or 70 cents a share, against Dollars 90.7m, or 85 cents, last year. Results from Travelers' life and pensions businesses are still suffering from real estate difficulties, with a higher level of underperforming mortgage loans and lower interest rates reducing net investment income.</p>

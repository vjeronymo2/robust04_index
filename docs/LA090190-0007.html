			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAHONY'S LETTERS TO SHEINKMAN  </P> <P> I write in response to the John Dart/Bob Baker article ("Mahony's Religious  Suggestion to Jewish Unionist Stirs Anger," Religion, Aug. 25), and to express  my puzzlement and my dismay.  </P> <P> My exchange of correspondence with Jack Sheinkman (president of the Amalgamated  Clothing and Textile Workers Union in New York) began in February when I and  other Catholic leaders across the country wrote to all the members of the  Executive Council of the AFL-CIO urging them to take a neutral stance on the  abortion question. These letters had nothing to do with the past cemetery  workers dispute in the Los Angeles archdiocese.  </P> <P> I am puzzled why your reporters could not simply state these facts. Rather,  they attempt to create division between me and Sheinkman, a man whom I respect  greatly.  </P> <P> I was pleased that the result of these letters from many of us to the AFL-CIO  actually resulted in the union taking a neutral stance on the abortion matter.  </P> <P> What shocks me is the obvious attempt by your reporters to inject a  Jewish-Catholic rivalry in this entire matter. In Sheinkman's June 5 response  to my May 21 letter, he makes absolutely no mention of interpreting that letter  in the negative fashion described in the article. In two meetings with  Sheinkman's general counsel later in June, his chief attorney also made no such  inferences. In fact, it was only then in late June that I learned that  Sheinkman was Jewish.  </P> <P> Virtually all of my letters written during the Easter season (April 15 to June  3) end with similar Christian expressions of joy and blessing. For a religious  leader to extend blessings upon others does not reflect a disregard for their  own religious faith or practices.  </P> <P> But your reporters have inferred a religious rift and apparently concocted this  story to create a division between the Catholic and Jewish communities. I  reject their assertion out of hand, and I am offended by their lack of  knowledge concerning the outstanding relationship which has long existed, and  continues to exist, between the Catholic community and the Jewish community in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Your reporters cannot seem to state the facts clearly with respect to the past  dispute between the archdiocese and ACTWU. The second election among our  employees was held because they did not want anything to do with the union. The  one-year election agreement had expired. But the purpose of the election was to  give the employees their voice. And all evidence continues to show that our  cemetery employees have absolutely no interest in belonging to ACTWU or any  other union.  </P> <P> MOST REV. ROGER MAHONY  </P> <P> Archbishop of Los Angeles  </P></p>

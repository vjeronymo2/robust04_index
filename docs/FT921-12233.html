			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Acceptance of letter of credit completes oil rig transfer DAVY OFFSHORE LTD v EMERALD FIELD CONTRACTING LTD Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: January 21 1992 TITLE TO North Sea oil equipment transferred under a supply contract which provides for completion on payment by letter of credit, passes when the credit is drawn on the accepting bank on tender of contractually specified documents, irrespective of any time lapse between draw-down and actual delivery of cash. Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when giving judgment for the plaintiff supplier, Davy Offshore Ltd, on its claim against Emerald Field Contracting Ltd under a sub-contract for the supply of oil field equipment. HIS LORDSHIP said that Emerald was a contractor under agreements to supply equipment and services to licensees of the right to explore and extract oil from the Emerald Oil Field in the North Sea. In order to fulfil its contractual obligations it entered into a supply contract dated November 30 1988 with Davy Offshore. Davy agreed to supply Emerald with a floating production facility and single point mooring system (FPF). The overall structure of the contract provided for phases of the work and the provision of certificates. At the completion certificate stage the FPF would be towed to the field and handed over to Emerald. Originally completion was to be August 5 1990 but work was delayed and would not be finished until summer 1992. Clause 18.1(a) of the contract provided that title to the work and facilities should be transferred to Emerald 'immediately upon completion and payment of the amount due . . . at completion as referred to in clause 17.2'. By clause 18.1(b) Davy warranted that at time of transfer and vesting of title, the work and facilities would be free of all mortgages, liens or other encumbrances; and by 18.1(c) it agreed that at time of transfer it would deliver to Emerald a duly executed bill of sale in British form (statutory form 10A) in respect of the FPF, reflecting the warranty. The contract and the form therefore contemplated that by the time of transfer of title, consideration for transfer would have been paid, and all mortgages and other charges would have been paid off. Clause 17.2 provided that on completion Emerald should pay Davy 95 per cent of the contract price, the 5 per cent balance to be paid three months and five banking days after completion. Clause 17.5 of the contract provided that Emerald's obligation to pay under clause 17.2 might be satisfied by Davey drawing under a letter of credit. Accordingly, for the purposes of clauses 17.2 and 18.1, the moment of payment was when the bank accepted documents tendered. Under the letter of credit, Davy would not receive the money until five business days after the relevant documents had been received by the bank. Thus there was a time lapse between date of draw-down under the letter of credit and actual delivery of cash. The documents Davy was required to produce were the first qualifying certificate together with documents referred to in it. Others to be tendered at the same time corresponded to documents referred to in clause 36 of the contract. They included the completion certificate, a bill of sale in British form, the final stage certificate, and a 'section 10 certificate' from the secretary of state for trade and industry confirming that all conditions of the guarantee issued under section 10 of the Industry Act 1972 had been satisfied or waived. The scheme of clause 36.3.1 was clear. There had to be satisfactory completion or works and facilities. Davy had to produce to Emerald the various listed documents. Implicitly, Emerald had to be satisfied that they complied with the requirements of the contract. It then had to issue the completion certificate, countersign the final stage certificate and obtain a section 10 certificate. It would return all the documents to Davy, which would present them to the bank under the letter of credit. Davy submitted that title in the FPF did not pass until it had drawn on the letter of credit, because until it had done so payment under clause 17.2 of 'all that is due . . . at completion' would not have been made. Emerald said the amount due at completion did not include sums payable under the letter of credit, since they were only to be paid after completion - it only included cash payments to be made at time of completion. It said that under clause 36.3.1 completion occurred when the documents to be provided by Davy were received by Emerald, and at that time sums were not payable under the letter of credit. The significance of the arguments derived from the fact that if Davy did not receive the 95 per cent before parting with title of the FPF, it might well receive only part of what would be owing to it; and from the fact that Emerald was going to be in very real difficulties in procuring the section 10 certificate. The contractual intention as to the point at which title should pass was clear. The starting point was clause 18.1(a). That was an express clause dealing specifically with the passing of title. Title was not to pass until 'completion and payment of the amount due . . . at completion as referred to in clause 17.2'. Both conditions must be satisfied. Clause 17.2 required Emerald to pay Davy the 95 per cent on completion and contained an express cross-reference to clause 17.5. Clause 17.5 expressly provided that the obligation to pay the 95 per cent might 'be satisfied by the contractor drawing under' the letter of credit. It followed that until Davy had so drawn payment had not been made. Payment of the cash by the bank was to be postponed for five working days after presentation and acceptance of documents. Acceptance crystallised the bank's liability and rendered it unconditional. The bank's accrued obligation to pay under the letter of credit was clearly intended to satisfy Emerald's obligation to pay. It followed that it was Davy's drawing under the letter of credit that satisfied (in the present context) the second condition to the passing of title in clause 18.1(a). It also followed that performance by Emerald of those of its obligations necessary to enable Davy to draw under the letter of credit were indirectly conditions of the passing of title and that, failing putting Davy into a position where it could draw under the letter of credit, the only way Emerald could perform the second condition to the passing of title would be by making an actual cash payment. That conclusion was confirmed by clause 36.3. Prior to completion, Davy, besides finishing the relevant work, had to provide Emerald with the various documents listed in 36.3.1. If those documents complied with the contract, completion 'shall occur'. But that was not the end of it. Emerald had to perform the three stated obligations and 'return all such documents forthwith' to Davy. That showed the bill of sale and other documents were not given to Emerald without qualification, but simply for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy itself that they met contractual requirements and return them to Davy. The intention of the contract was clear, and was consistent with the natural meaning of the words used in clause 18.1(a). Emerald's arguments to the contrary were mistaken. The obligation to provide the section 10 certificate was an indirect condition of the passing of title. It was a condition that arose at completion. In June 1991, after the contract had run into difficulties, causing financial problems for the parties and their backers, a 'settlement agreement' was negotiated. Under clause 17 it was agreed '(a) subject to the provisions of sub-clause (b)' that repayment to Davy of sums outstanding at completion should be deferred. Sub-clause (b) provided that 'the provisions of sub-clause (a) above shall not apply to any letter of credit issued to Davy in relation to the prime contract'. That could only be sensibly construed as leaving intact Davy's right to be paid in so far as it involved payments under letters of credit. Judgment for Davy. For Davy: Lord Irvine QC, Edwin Glasgow QC, Richard Wilmot-Smith, and Stuart Catchpole (Ashurst Morris Crisp). For Emerald: John Dyson QC and Mark Templeman (Watson, Farley &amp; Williams).</p>

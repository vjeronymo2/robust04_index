			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) notified South Korea today that it has  accepted Seoul's proposal for a preparatory contact on June 28  for an inter-Korean summit, much to the welcome of the latter.    The DPRK, in a telephone message from Premier Kang Song-san  to his South Korean counterpart Yi Yong-tok said that a  seven-member delegation will go to the summit preparatory talks  at the truce village of Panmunjom.    "The tense political situation on the peninsula has now made  the opening of a summit more mandatory than at any other time,"  Kang said in the message.    He noted, this highest-level meeting of the two sides will  be  a historic event which will give the 70 million Korean people  "the joy of reconciliation and unity" and renew hopes for a  country of peace and unification.    A South Korean Government official welcomed the DPRK's  reply,  saying that "the message came within the quickest timeframe we  had thought of and it was in agreement with our proposal. This  suggests that they are sincere in approaching the summit."    After a visit to Pyongyang last week, former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter took a message to Seoul that the DPRK's President  Kim Il-song wants to hold a summit with South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam without delay.    Seoul immediately accepted and proposed a working-level  contact at Panmunjom on the morning of June 28.    Some sources said Deputy Prime Minister and the National  Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku is the likely  Seoul-side chief delegate to the contact meeting, while  Pyongyang may send over its Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister  Kim Yong-nam.</p>

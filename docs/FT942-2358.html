			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Books - big change to the worm's eye view Reading text on a computer screen may not have the same appeal as curling up on the couch with a good book, but 'electronic books', on CD-ROM discs, are rapidly gaining ground. Among the 'best sellers' in this new market are reference works that take advantage of the 'navigation' or searching capabilities of a personal computer to provide indexing far superior to printed texts. Microsoft's Encarta multimedia encyclopedia does not look as impressive on a bookshelf as a collection of leather bound volumes, but it provides a more useful source of information for those who are already familiar with computers. High school students, for example, may find the electronic 'hypertext' - which allows the reader to skip quickly to related topics - a more efficient and inviting method of researching an essay subject than poring over the pages of a conventional encyclopedia. Microsoft also publishes a collection of CD-ROM reference books, called Bookshelf, including the American Heritage Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, the World Almanac Book of Facts, Barlett's Familiar Quotations, an atlas and other works on a single disc. As well as the text of these books, Bookshelf includes sound to demonstrate the pronunciation of words, and animation and video clips to illustrate scientific concepts and historic events. The multimedia features of CD-ROM enhance the value of home reference books, such as the Mayo Clinic Family Health Book. For instance, if you are going to have knee surgery, the text provides a description of the knee joint, together with anatomical diagrams. Click on a symbol representing a camera and you can view a short video clip of what the surgeon will see inside your knee using an arthroscope. Text books, travel guides and do-it-yourself instruction books are also well suited to the CD-ROM format. Media Mosaic, an Oregon software company, plans to publish interactive multimedia 'how-to' guides for sports. Books That Work, a California venture, has teamed with the Hearst Corporation to expand its line of CD-ROM books on home improvement and repairs. The student of history will also find several CD-ROM publications of interest. Time Almanac of the 20th Century, published by Compact Publishing of Washington, DC, has been widely acclaimed for its combination of Time Magazine texts, graphics and video clips. Few would suggest that the CD-ROM will replace the paperback novel, but children's illustrated story books are being adapted. Young computer users can move through Broderbund's Living Books, such as Arthur's Teacher Troubles, at their own pace, listen to the story being read or click on words to explore their meanings through animated illustrations. For a generation reared on video images, CD-ROMs can make learning to read books good fun.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Higgs and Hill reveals Pounds 17m loss and cuts final to 3p RECESSION IN its core markets of construction, property and housing forced Higgs and Hill to make exceptional charges of Pounds 20.9m and report a pre-tax loss in the year to December 31. Announcing losses of Pounds 16.7m, against profits of Pounds 6.84m in 1990, Mr John Theakston, group chief executive, summed up: 'It's not been a lot of fun out there.' Higgs is recommending a cut in the final dividend to 3p (14p) to make a sharply reduced total of 9p (20p), which is uncovered. The company said the final payment, combined with an 'appropriate' interim, should be seen as the base for future dividends. Turnover fell sharply to Pounds 345.2m (Pounds 488m) due to volume declines in its main markets. Operating profits dropped to Pounds 6.97m (Pounds 18.6m). A reduced interest charge of Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 4.35m) could not prevent profits before exceptionals falling to Pounds 4.22m (Pounds 14.2m). Construction was worst affected and turnover fell more than 25 per cent to Pounds 309.4m (Pounds 422.3m). The fall was compounded by the closure of a specialist engineering business and reduced management contracting. Trading profits from property fell to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.48m) from turnover of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 32.8m). Although the UK remained depressed, the company's Spanish office developments performed well and three have been pre-sold. The housing division sold 235 units during the year, down from 280 in 1990, and average prices declined more than 10 per cent to Pounds 100,000. Provisions of Pounds 13.6m were made to cover falls in housing land values. Following the provisions, average carrying values are at 20 per cent of unit sale prices which should allow the company to maintain its gross margin. Other provisions of Pounds 7.34m covered commercial property, redundancy costs - staff numbers have been cut 35 per cent over the last 15 months, and a loss on a contract for the US bank JP Morgan. Extraordinary losses of Pounds 7.51m for closures and disposals took losses attributable to shareholders to Pounds 19.7m. Combined with the dividend charge, a Pounds 23.7m transfer from reserves was required. COMMENT Given the gloom from the construction leaders, Higgs and Hill's figures were hardly surprising. Indeed, the shares gained 8p to 88p, partly on relief the dividend was not cut further, and partly because the market appreciated the thorough levels of provisions. But while taking the full hit may be in vogue, predicting the company's recovery is more tricky. Its main construction division cannot expect to avoid a further downturn in line with the industry this year. Property also remains vulnerable in the UK and Higgs and Hill's problem is that only one of its three businesses, housing, is an early cycle recovery-play. Following the dividend cut, this year's pay-out should total about 4.5p, suggesting a yield of 6.4 per cent. With forecast profits of Pounds 2.5m this year, putting them on a multiple of 22, the shares look fairly valued, even on net assets of close to 200p.</p>

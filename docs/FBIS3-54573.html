Has this issue been settled?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] There are two choices -- to hold the meeting  either in Yemen or Amman. In all cases, we consider the accord  document a great achievement, and we insist on signing it, and  are ready to sign it. I would like to point out here that the  subcommittee has been meeting for some time. It is now planning  to discuss the security issue after reaching agreement on the  venue. When we talk about the security issue, we mean those  measures preceding the signing process, as well as the necessary  measures to implement this document after it is signed. These  measures include restoring cohesion to the Presidential Council,  the Council of Ministers, and all the other state institutions.    [Al-Qallab] We have learned that the committee has set 6  February as a date for signing the document?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, around this date. If the meeting is to  be held in Amman, then the date will be agreed upon in the light  of His Majesty King Husayn's schedule and his return from his  trip abroad, and also in the light of the time the Jordanian  authorities need to arrange for such a meeting.    [Al-Qallab] This means that the president and vice president  have accepted in principle the invitation that was extended to  them by His Majesty King Husayn's adviser?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, we have accepted the invitation with  gratitude and appreciation. [passage omitted]    [Al-Qallab] Egypt has more than once complained that Yemen  has turned into a base for the elements and sides which work  against it. Is there any coordination between you and Egypt on  these issues?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] We denounce all actions aimed against the  security of the brothers in Egypt and elsewhere. We contacted  the Egyptian brothers and told them that we are fully ready to  cooperate with them to check any action meant to harm fraternal  Egypt. We are against terrorism and we denounce it in part and  parcel anywhere in the world.    [Al-Qallab] Have you arrested any non-Yemeni elements?    ['Abd-al-Ghani] We have arrested a number of Arabs who  fought  in Afghanistan. We have the full list of the names of members  of this organization inside and outside Yemen. [passage omitted]</p>

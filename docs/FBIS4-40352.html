			<p>BFN     [Text] Kaliningrad, Russia, June 15, BNS -- The last  Russian navy combat ship will leave Estonia by the end of this  month along with all naval ammunition left in that Baltic  country by that time, the head of Russia's Baltic Sea Fleet,  Adm. Vladimir Yegorov, told BNS.    The admiral said Russia still had some 800 tons of naval  ammunitions in Estonia. All this will be taken out from the  country before the end of the month, if no what he called  "unpredictable obstacles" will emerge. Also in the former  Russian submarine crew training center in Paldiski is winding  up, but it will still take long to complete all the work there,  he said.    Remaining 52 staff at the naval base in Tallinn are active  shutting down the base. In addition to them, there are 303  families of Russian officers in Estonia for whom Moscow has been  unable to provide housing in Russia. An agreement concerning  such families has been signed with Latvia, but no respective  document exists for the families in Estonia, the admiral said.    Yegorov also mentioned that the Paldiski naval training  facility with its nuclear reactors was not his competence, but  stood under direct authority of the naval headquarters in  Moscow. The Baltic Sea Fleet is in charge of providing the  necessary technical assistance and facilities for their  dismantling, as well as taking away the gear. The head of the  Baltic Sea Fleet couldn't say what was the timetable for the  reactors' dismantling.</p>

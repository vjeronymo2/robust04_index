			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO. 1 PLAYER IN 16S RALLIES, OUSTS FRIEND  </P> <P> Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport took the court for her quarterfinal singles match  Thursday feeling a little too soft-hearted toward her opponent, and it nearly  cost her in the United States Tennis Assn. Girls' 16s National Championships.  </P> <P> Facing sixth-seeded Katie Schlukebir of Kalamazoo, Mich., Davenport dropped the  first set, 6-1, before she came back to overpower Schlukebir, 6-3, 6-1, and  advance to today's semifinals at Morley Field.  </P> <P> "She's a good friend of mine," said Davenport, who conceded she opened  tentatively because of that. "We've warmed up together all week. We warmed up  together today, even though we were playing each other."  </P> <P> But Davenport isn't about to let a little friendship stand in the way of a  possible national championship. Of the four players -- including La Jolla's  Ditta Huber -- who advanced to today's 11:30 a.m. semifinals, Davenport is the  hottest.  </P> <P> Within the past two months, she has won singles titles at the National Clay  Court championships and Seventeen Magazine invitational tourney. Davenport, who  turned 14 in June and stands 6-feet-2, won the girls' 16s singles draw at the  Ojai Invitational in April and claimed both singles and doubles titles in the  1989 USTA Girls' 14s National Championships.  </P> <P> Davenport will face fourth-seeded Lisa Pugliese of Boca Raton, Fla., today.  Pugliese defeated Kimberly Kozlowski of Sarasota, Fla., 6-2, 6-4. No. 8 Amy  Chiminello of Mecrose, Mass., a 6-4, 6-3 winner over Diana Spadea of Boca  Raton, Fla., will face the last of four San Diego-area players still alive,  third-seeded Huber.  </P> <P> Huber, like Davenport, considers herself a slow starter, but she has won five  straight-set matches since the tournament started Sunday, including Thursday's  6-4, 6-4 defeat of No. 5 Tiffany Gates of Grandville, Mich. The most crucial  victory for Huber was also her most lopsided, a 6-1, 6-1 blowout Wednesday of  14th-seeded Valerie Poulos of Boston. Poulos defeated Huber three weeks ago at  the clay court nationals, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> Huber had no trouble with Gates, only the large crowd at Morley Field's stadium  court.  </P> <P> "People were talking pretty loud, and it was hard not to hear some of the  conversations in the beginning," Huber said. "Everything just echoed."  </P> <P> While Huber and Davenport are both hoping to reach Saturday's 11:30 a.m.  singles final, where they would oppose each other, they will play together in  today's 2:30 p.m. doubles semifinals. Huber and Davenport, seeded first, will  face unseeded Cindy Kuragami of Buena Park and Heidi Steiber of Bakersfield.  </P></p>

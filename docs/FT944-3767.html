			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Visa card issuer sparks OFT probe Aggressive marketing by a consumer credit arm of the Ford motor group has exposed a grey area in Britain's consumer protection legislation. The Office of Fair Trading is examining a decision by The Associates, a Windsor-based credit company controlled by Ford's US parent, to issue unsolicited Visa credit cards. The issue involves the rights to thousands of in-house store cards acquired by The Associates earlier this year. Following the acquisition, The Associates, which specialises in consumer loans, mortgages and hire purchase, issued fully fledged Visa credit cards to the store cardholders without their explicit consent. The Associates said the 'upgrading' was covered by the initial terms of the retailers' in-house cards. The OFT became involved after many cardholders complained to local trading standards authorities that they had received 'unsolicited' cards. According to the OFT it is an offence under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act to send a credit card to a consumer unless the card has been previously requested in writing. Mr Dermod Hill of the OFT said: 'A question has arisen. We are examining it and we must now determine whether it does or does not contravene the law.' No one from The Associates was available for comment. It is run by Associates Capital Corporation of Dallas.</p>

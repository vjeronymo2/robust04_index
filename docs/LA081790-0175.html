			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NEW KIDS A HIGHWAY SENSATION  </P> <P> State and local law officers enlisted the aid of truck drivers to keep a swarm  of motoring fans away from buses carrying the popular rock group New Kids on  the Block.  </P> <P> The truckers, called in on their citizens' band radios, formed a slow moving  blockade on I-40 behind buses carrying the singers from a Thursday-night  concert in Nashville to an appearance tonight in Knoxville.  </P> <P> Police said that as many as 85 cars carrying fans had begun following the  buses, often pulling their vehicles perilously close.  </P> <P> "The bus drivers were having a little trouble with fans darting in and out in  front of them trying to get a look inside the buses," said Roane County  Sheriff's Deputy Dowell Isham.  </P> <P> "They weren't trying to wreck the buses or anything. They were just trying to  get a glimpse inside."  </P></p>

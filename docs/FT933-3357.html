			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Production merger boosts Blockbuster BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the largest US home video rental company, strengthened its interests in Hollywood as the two production companies in which it owned an interest agreed a merger. The deal brings together Spelling Entertainment, of which Blockbuster currently owns 63.5 per cent, and Republic Entertainment, of which it owns 37 per cent. Blockbuster is providing Dollars 100m to help finance Spelling's takeover of Republic in a transaction that will leave it with 70.5 per cent of the combined entity. Blockbuster owns the City-vision video rental company in the UK. The deal brings together the former programme library of NBC, which was acquired by Spelling, with that of ABC, owned by Republic. The move to combine the businesses would strengthen its interest in film production, said Blockbuster. 'We are the biggest single purchaser of Hollywood's products in the world. This integrates us and gets us closer to the suppliers of those products.' Under the terms of the agreement, Spelling will pay Dollars 13 in cash for each Republic share. Options and warrants to buy Republic shares will be acquired at the rate of 1.65 Spelling share for each Republic share. To finance the deal, Blockbuster has agreed to buy 13.4m new Spelling shares for Dollars 100m either in cash or Blockbuster shares. Mr Russell Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive of Republic, is to become president and chief executive of Spelling.</p>

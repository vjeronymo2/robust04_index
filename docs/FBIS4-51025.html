			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui said  Monday [23 May] that he wants to establish a sound  constitutional system in Taiwan as soon as possible.    He made the remarks at a National Assembly session in an  apparent effort to calm the hot discussion stemming from remarks  he made in Costa Rica that he has a dream "to transfer power to  somebody else peacefully before my death".    "The constitutional system is my dream and I would like to  hand over political power to the next president after he is  elected," Li told the assembly.    On whether he will seek re-election, President Li said that  he would not answer the question since the National Assembly has  not begun its discussion of the proposed change in the method of  presidential elections.    The National Assembly began its three-month special session  in Yangmingshan on May 2 to consider proposed amemdments to the  constitution and nominations by President Li of the grand  justices and the head of the judicial yuan.    In their respective proposals on constitutional change, both  the ruling Kuomintang and opposition Democratic Progressive  Party have in common only one point: that the election of the  president should be done by popular vote rather than by the vote  of the National Assembly, as has been done in the past.</p>

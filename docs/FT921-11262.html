			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Life salesmen? Bah, humbug] - Serious Money THE LIFE industry has been manning the barricades ever since this newspaper highlighted a SIB study which revealed appalling lapse rates on certain policies. Just to repeat the figures, in case you missed them: the study found that up to 45 per cent of policies sold by direct or tied agents are terminated within two years. The equivalent figure for independent financial advisers is a better, but still dreadful, 22 to 32 per cent. Anyone who surrenders a policy within two years is likely to get back only a fraction of the premiums paid because the life company has given the money, in the form of commission, to the salesmen and weights all the charges to the early years. This SIB study has been attacked on two fronts. The first is, simply, that the figures are wrong. That is, of course, a perfectly reasonable argument. But SIB's information was culled from returns filed by the life companies themselves to the Department of Trade and Industry. The reason SIB commissioned the study was the complete absence of publicly available statistics on the subject. The second line of attack is that, even if the figures are right, they are not due to bad selling practices. No, sir. They are due, instead, to the UK recession. Of course, a life insurance salesman could not have expected a recession within the 25-year lifetime of his product. He could not have expected a substantial number of his clients to become unemployed, or get divorced, or meet some other change in their circumstances that made it impossible to keep up their payments. In other words, blame life itself, not life salesmen. Bah, humbug] Whose fault is it that the most-promoted of all financial service products is so inflexible and biased so heavily against those who cash-in early? Whose fault is it that the product is so complicated, with three different rates of bonus on some products and two types of unit on another? Only in the life industry could a product described as 'unitised with profits' be hailed for its simplicity. A further point made to me is that the life companies are more concerned about bad selling practices than anyone. Bah, double humbug] If you run an industry where large numbers of salesmen are paid solely by commission, you cannot claim to be surprised if those salesmen use hard-selling tactics. In my personal experience, I have been told that my failure to sign for a life policy immediately was due to 'a psychological inability to make decisions.' I have been told not to discuss taking out an endowment with my wife because 'women don't like long-term financial commitments.' And I have been called at home by a man claiming to do 'market research on inflation' who turned out, of course, to be selling insurance. I sat through one presentation by a woman who knew I was a financial journalist. Nevertheless, she worked through her obviously prepared script which culminated in the ringing phrase: 'What you need is capital' - whereupon she clinched the argument by writing the word 'capital' on a piece of paper and drawing a circle round it. When I told her I was not interested, she demanded that, in return for 'all my efforts,' I should give her the names and addresses of all my friends so she could contact them. Admittedly, all this occurred before the Financial Services Act. But I suspect the tactics simply have altered, rather than improved. My colleague, Scheherazade Daneshkhu, toured the building societies last year looking for a mortgage. Her circumstances obviously made a repayment or interest-only mortgage most suitable, but a Woolwich 'adviser' persisted in pushing an endowment which, she claimed 'is more of a reality.' Nor has the FSA put a stop to the practice of those who are really salesmen passing themselves off as 'advisers.' There are some independent advisers who genuinely live up to their name - but there are others who are just the un-tied salesmen of life companies. How can a tied agent, who cannot recommend anything but the products of his own company, call himself an adviser? As one lady, whose life has been ruined by the activities of a salesman, said to me recently: 'I thought he was an adviser who was on my side. If I had known he was a salesman, I would have had nothing to do with him.' There is absolutely nothing wrong with the concept of straight life insurance. Indeed, more people should have it and there is a simple product, called term insurance, which can provide it. But there is no need to mix-up the concept of life insurance with savings, especially in a form which takes such a long time to give the policy-holder full value. Recent trends have exacerbated this tendency, with bonus cuts concentrated on policies of 10, rather than 25, years and with terminal bonuses assuming an increased proportion of policy value. How many of us can, with hands on our hearts, feel certain we will keep up payments on a policy for 25 years? How many of us really feel that such a commitment is tailored ideally to our needs? And yet, the industry which is devoted to selling these products is supposed to be providing 'best advice.' Bah, humbug to the power of infinity]</p>

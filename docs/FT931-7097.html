			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / When failure followed failure: Alan Pike on the inquiry into the London Ambulance Service THE COLLAPSE of the London Ambulance Service's new computer for despatching vehicles to emergencies was the final failure in a spectacular series of failures. The report of the inquiry into the computer crash, led by Mr Don Page, chief executive of South Yorkshire ambulance service trust, catalogues the failures. There was failure to test the system properly and failure to win the confidence of staff who, even before the introduction of the computer, worked in an atmosphere of 'mistrust and obstructiveness'. There was failure to adopt realistic timetables, failure by senior managers to accept advice about the risks they were taking and failure by the service's board to seek or obtain enough information to exercise its responsibilities. The report says an important factor in all this was a culture within the ambulance service based on 'fear of failure'. This may have put undue pressure on computer managers to introduce the system on time and to budget, and blinded them to difficulties. The report, one of the most forceful criticisms of the management of a public sector body in recent times, stresses the need for continuing action to improve public confidence in the London Ambulance Service, the largest ambulance service in the world. But members of the inquiry team say it will take several years to raise the service to a fully-acceptable standard. The computer system was intended to allocate ambulances to incidents automatically via display screens in vehicles. The report says this was a high-risk quantum leap in the use of technology. The system was withdrawn immediately after its full introduction on October 26 last year following a series of problems which, says the report, were not systems failure in the technical sense but cumulatively led to 'all the symptoms of systems failure'. The report says it is clear that neither the system nor its users were ready for full implementation on October 26 . The software was not complete, properly tuned or fully tested. Hardware had not been tested under full-load conditions. There were outstanding data transmission problems. Staff had no confidence in the system and were not fully trained. The report says there did not appear to be any rational process by which the ambulance service's budget of about Pounds 1.5m was established. It may have been based on misunderstanding of a management consultant's report. The procurement of the system for the service was put in the hands of a contract analyst and an 'arguably unsuitably-qualified systems manager who knew that he was to be replaced and made redundant'. The inquiry says a report to the ambulance service's board recommending purchase of the system did not explain why the bid was 'significantly lower than the nearest competitor'. Some bids were more than three times as high. The project was managed by Systems Options, a small software house, as a result of a decision that the report says was 'basically flawed'. The ambulance service contract was larger than anything Systems Options had handled before and the company rapidly found itself out of its depth, but the report concludes that within the time constraints 'no software house could have delivered a workable solution'. Similarly, the report says that even with the best industrial relations practices it is unlikely that the system would have succeeded 'in the incomplete and unstable state in which it was implemented'. The ambulance service had hoped that the computer system could be used to introduce industrial relations changes but this was 'misguided or naive'. The report says it would be misleading to see management problems in the ambulance service only in the context of the past two years. There was clear evidence that management had failed to modernise the service in the 1980s in line with other ambulance services. This was reflected in a lack of investment in paramedic training, the fleet or buildings. It says: 'Poor communications between staff and staff associations and senior LAS managers have created an atmosphere of mistrust.' The report recommends a new bargaining structure between the service and its unions and investment in management training.</p>

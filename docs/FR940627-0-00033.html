			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the Commission stated in Order Nos. 497 and 497&hyph;A, pipelines need only contemporaneously disclose general transportation information provided to an affiliate; they need not disclose information related to the affiliate's specific transportation request. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  This distinction appears reasonably self-explanatory, and KGPC has not explained why the distinction is difficult to make, nor has it identified specific situations that cause it difficulty, so that the Commission can provide guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Order No. 497, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs. [1986&hyph;1990] Regulation Preambles] at 31,141; Order No. 497&hyph;A, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs. [1986&hyph;1990] Regulation Preambles] at 31,597.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> KGPC further requests clarification of the Commission's statement in Order No. 497&hyph;E that, even though sales and marketing information no longer must be disclosed under Standard F, the Commission is not barred from examining such questions, if relevant and necessary, in specific cases. KGPC requests that the Commission specify the circumstances in which it will consider such issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Order No. 497&hyph;E, the Commission removed the general requirement for pipelines to disclose sales and marketing information. However, the Commission still retains the right to determine in individual proceedings that certain pipelines must disclose sales and marketing information when the circumstances show such disclosure is needed to prevent undue discrimination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  C. Standard H_Tieing Gas Subject to Take-Or-Pay Relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to eliminate &sect;161.3(h) of the regulations which prohibits pipelines from conditioning or tieing an agreement to release gas subject to take-or-pay relief to the purchase of services from a marketing affiliate. The Commission stated that this provision should no longer be needed since Order No. 636 established procedures for dealing with gas supply realignment (GSR) costs resulting from the reformation or termination of take-or-pay contracts after the unbundling of sales from transportation service. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs. Preambles at 30,458.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hadson and Indicated Parties argue for retention of this provision. Hadson states that, while the size of the take-or-pay problem has been reduced, the Commission has approved pricing differential mechanisms for reducing GSR costs under which gas subject to take-or-pay contracts is auctioned by the pipeline or marketing affiliate on a monthly basis. It also states the Commission has approved reverse auctions. These mechanisms, it asserts, still create the potential for anticompetitive tieing. Indicated Parties suggest that the phrase gas supply realignment costs be substituted for take-or-pay costs to ensure that pipelines do not attempt to tie the availability of unbundled transportation and storage services to the purchase of specific gas supplies. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  But they do not explain why retention of this requirement is necessary in light of the procedures established in Order No. 636 and the restructuring cases for dealing with GSR costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> They both also contend the Commission should retain current &sect;250.16(b)(2)(xiii), which requires disclosure of whether any gas being transported is subject to take-or-pay relief. Indicated Parties again suggests the substitution of gas supply realignment costs for take-or-pay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will delete this requirement. Hadson has not demonstrated how the pipeline would rig an auction or a reverse auction <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  that would result in tieing of an agreement to release gas to the purchase of services from an affiliate. The auction or reverse auction involves bidding on gas contracts which is independent of any services provided by a marketing affiliate. Moreover, the Commission can better monitor potential affiliate abuse in auctions by considering the circumstances of the auction mechanism proposed in individual cases rather than by promulgating a generic standard, which may not apply to certain cases. <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In a reverse auction, parties bid an amount that the pipeline must pay them to take over pipeline gas contracts with prices that are above the market price. The pipeline, therefore, accepts the lowest bid (rather than the highest as in a standard auction).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 64 FERC &para;1,305 at 63,310 (1993)(finding sufficient safeguards against affiliate abuse); Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, 64 FERC &para;61,295 at 63,104&hyph;05 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Standard I (New Standard H)_Affiliate Discounts Contemporaneously Disclosed To Similarly Situated Shippers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Retention of Standard H  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is retaining the current standard, which is being renumbered Standard H. Current Standard I requires pipelines making a transportation discount to an affiliate to make a comparable discount contemporaneously available to all similarly situated non-affiliates. A number of commenters contend this provision should be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso asserts the regulation is not needed, contending pipelines will not make an unjustified discount to an affiliate, because the pipelines will lose money. It further argues that pipelines may actually forgo making beneficial and competitive case specific discounts to affiliates because of the vagueness of the term ``similarly situated.'' It asserts pipelines may not offer their affiliates a discount to avoid the risk of having to unjustifiably reduce rates to other shippers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

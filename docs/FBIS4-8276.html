			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Israel and its defense  industry are among serious applicants for close cooperation with  the Czech Republic, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told  journalists today.    "We bear in mind that the Israeli military industry is  state-of-the-art," said Baudys who met Israeli deputies Orri Orr  and Moshe Nissim today. However, it would be premature to speak  about concrete cooperation in this field, he added.    Baudys discussed army modernization, relations between armed  forces and parliament, military buildup and acquiring public  confidence with the Israeli deputies.    "The meeting was very useful" because Orr is a former senior  Israeli military officer "with a very successful military record  so that he can consider the problems both from the military and  parliamentary views," Baudys stated.    Orr and Nissim, who arrived in the Czech Republic for a  one-week visit on April 4, also met the Federation of Jewish  Communities.</p>

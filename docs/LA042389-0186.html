			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COURAGEOUS SUPPORT FOR DRUG CENTER  </P> <P> City Council candidate Lyle Hall showed courage and wisdom by standing up in  support of the Nancy Reagan Center plans to locate in Lake View Terrace (March  14). The drug abuse rehabilitation center is sorely needed in the north Valley.  </P> <P> What astonishes me is the ignorance of those who are resisting the project.  Practicing drug users and pushers are living on our streets (next door?). How  can anyone oppose a facility that exists to help non-using ex-addicts learn to  live clean, productive and fulfilling lives? Where have all our values gone?  Property values most certainly take a plunge when there's a "rock house" in the  neighborhood. I can't buy the notion that a drug abuse rehabilitation and  research facility will threaten the life style of Lake View Terrace. Drugs and  gangs are the threat!  </P> <P> I salute Lyle Hall, whose leadership qualities are rare indeed among today's  politicians, for giving our kids and adults hope for the future and inspiration  that life can be honest, good and better than it is today by supporting efforts  that help our community to become free from drugs and crime.  </P> <P> LYNN WILMARTH  </P> <P> Tujunga  </P></p>

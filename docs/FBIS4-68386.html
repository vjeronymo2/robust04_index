			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Own information report: "In the Extreme North They Are in </F> `Dire Straits'"]    [Text] The regular session of the Russian Federation  government commission on operational questions proceeded under  the sign of modern market terminology and at the same time under  the clearly marked striving for increased government  responsibility for all the matters being reviewed. Of course,  such a mixture of styles is apt to lead to some sort of languor  in the ranks of the radicals. However, the censor-like  vigilence of the adherents to slogans as clear as the eyes of  youth has recently become dull. The main reason for this is the  lack of brilliant victories in the lightening-speed reformation  of sluggish Mother Russia. It has already turned out like this  for us: The slower the harnessing the faster we go. Although  one will not speak about the speed of providing food products,  let's say, to the Norilsk industrial region or the Taymyr  (Dolgana-Nenets) autonomous okrug.    The essence of the question being reviewed is such: The  navigational delivery of goods and resources, including food,  petroleum products and vital necessities required for the  population of the above mentioned territories was always clearly  worked out in the most general terms by the middle of April.  But that was before. It was carried out by the state Norilsk  Nickel concern which has all the necessary means for this work.    But not today. The Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine,  producing half of the world's platinum and tens and hundreds of  thousands of tons of nickel, cobalt and other expensive metals  on the world market, has itself fallen into the financial abyss.  And because of the state they were in, in connection with this  as of 1 April accumulation of freight at the transshipment ports  had practically not been carried out. The breakdown of  navigational deliveries will lead to a sharp worsening of social  tensions in the most important region of the extreme North with  a population of more than 350,000 people, as well as to  significant losses for the country's economy due to a reduction  in the amount of valuable and nonferrous metals.    The opinions of high members of the Commission regarding the  amounts of state financial support for delivering food products  and goods to the regions of the extreme North are divided.  According to a preliminary agreements it was decided in favor  of the following figures: to allocate 500 billion rubles to the  combine for freight deliveries for the current quarter and to  provide for allocation of funds for the third quarter within the  limits of 800 billion rubles.    During the break I asked A. Filatov for his impression of  the  discussion. Anatoliy Vasilyevich diplomatically avoided a  direct answer: "The question will be finally resolved on  Friday. Let's talk then."    Today is Friday. As trusted sources from the government  institutions informed us, the question has been practically  resolved. It is necessary to feed the peoploe...We congratulate  everyone for this.</p>

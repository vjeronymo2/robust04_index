			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (TANJUG) -- The president of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) Zoran Lilic assessed  tuesday that by its air raids in the territory of the Bosnian  Serb republic (RS) near Gorazde, the U.N. has compromised itself  and become directly involved in the conflict precisely at the  time when the Moslem side was militarily defeated in this area.    Lilic said this during his talks with the delegation of the  Greek town Xanti headed by Mayor Filipos Amiridis, it was  reported by the presidential information service.    NATO aircraft raided Bosnian Serb army positions around  Gorazde on April 10 and 11, after Bosnian Serb forces crushed a  Moslem offensive launched in late May [as received] from  Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" which should have been  demilitarized in late spring.    "The Serbs were bombed by NATO because they were exercising  their right to self-defence. The goal in fact, was to prevent a  military defeat of the Moslem side, to prolong the fighting and  even contribute to its escalation", Lilic said.    The attack was allegedly carried out to protect the UN  peacekeepers in Gorazde, though there were only 8 of them  according to our information at the moment of the strikes and  the clashes were taking place quite a long way away from where  they were stationed. Therefore there was no question about  UNPROFOR troops being in danger. The case of Gorazde is a clear  misuse of the protected areas, first by the Moslems and then by  the U.N. and NATO. Attacks in the Gorazde area were launched by  the Moslem forces and this was known and tolerated, the Yugoslav  president set out.    It is particularly surprising that, as some American media  report, only 25 minutes were needed for the U.N. to give a  go-ahead for the air strikes. At the same time, when we ask for  UN authorisation to import medicine or any other humanitarian  aid, which is not even restricted under resolution 820, days and  months are needed and it is sometimes even denied, Lilic said.  This points to the double standard policy pursued by the  international community or a larger part of it, and particularly  the U.N. which has definitely become the handyman of the  powerful.    Lilic expressed his conviction that all peace-loving  countries will condemn NATO and that the Security Council will  have sufficient wisdom and power to return to the peace process.  In this context, he stressed that Yugoslavia would continue its  policy of peace but that it will know how to defend itself if  necessary.    Lilic expressed his gratitude to the Greek people for the  friendly support extended to the Serb people.    Xanti Mayor Amiridis regretted that during the visit of his  delegation to the mother and child hospital in new Belgrade, it  unfortunately witnessed the "devastating effects of the  stringent embargo introduced against Yugoslavia".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fatinah al-Dajani: "Safiyah: Emerging </F> Palestinian Entity Modest, but Promising Start"]    [Excerpt] London -- 'Afif Safiyah, Palestinian delegate to  the UK, has said that there is a pragmatic wing inside the  Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) which should be encouraged.  He pointed out that the movement has so far acted "very  responsibly." He said that the Palestinian entity emerging in  Gaza and Jericho is a modest, but promising start.    Replying to the clamor over the content of a tape of  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat during his meeting with  Muslims in a South African mosque, in which he called for jihad  for the sake of Jerusalem, he said that there is always  linguistic argument about the concept and meaning of the word  jihad. He pointed out that 'Arafat called for jihad for the  sake of Jerusalem, "that is, to strive collectively to liberate  Jerusalem peacefully." Safiyah said that Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin continues to speak of Jerusalem as the eternal  capital of Israel. "What is important is the international will  represented in the resolutions adopted by the Security Council  and the General Assembly, which consider Jerusalem an occupied  territory from which Israel must withdraw."    In a lecture delivered in London the evening of the day  before yesterday at the invitation of the "Council for  Arab-British Understanding" (CABU), Safiyah dealt with a number  of controversial issues on the Palestinian scene, including the  peace process since the Madrid and Washington negotiations  through to the Oslo and Cairo negotiations, in addition to the  future of the PLO, the Palestinian economy, and Hamas.

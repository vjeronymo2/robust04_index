			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA;  </P> <P> PROTESTS FOR DEMOCRACY;  </P> <P> RALLIES ACROSS U.S. ECHO PROTEST OF CRACKDOWN;  </P> <P> CROWD IN L.A. URGES END TO BEIJING BLOODSHED  </P> <P> As troops smashed the pro-democracy forces in Beijing with brute force, Chinese  students and Chinese-Americans gathered on the steps of the Chinese Consulate  in Los Angeles on Saturday calling solemnly -- and in some cases tearfully --  for an end to the bloodshed in China.  </P> <P> The group of more than 100 showed their support for pro-democracy forces in  China with speeches, chants, tears, songs and a call on President Bush,  Congress and the United Nations to condemn the massacre and pressure the  Chinese leaders to stop the killing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Horrible Incident'  </P> <P> "This is the most horrible incident of government brutality in history," said a  declaration distributed by the students. "In addition to being sad and angry,  we should do our best to support our suffering Chinese countrymen."  </P> <P> They sat on the steps and sidewalk and listened quietly as a recording of a  phone call from Beijing to UCLA was played.  </P> <P> Paul Yin, 25, a former Beijing University student now studying psychology at  Cal State Los Angeles, covered his eyes as the voice on the phone reported that  "blood is flowing in Tian An Men (Square)" and heard the names of some of those  killed.  </P> <P> Yin said he knew one of the dead.  </P> <P> In San Francisco's Chinese community -- the largest concentration of  Chinese-Americans in the United States -- leaders called on people of Chinese  ancestry from throughout the world to join in opposition to the Beijing  government.  </P> <P> "Oh my God! Oh my God!" cried Choi Soon, 32, listening to radio reports from  China as she sat across from City Hall. "How can the government kill? Those are  my brothers and sisters in the square, and they are being murdered."  </P> <P> In New York, Mayor Edward I. Koch led a small rally in Battery Park in Lower  Manhattan to protest the military action in China. With the Statue of Liberty  in the background, Koch called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council.  </P> <P> He cried: "Shame! Shame!" and a small crowd picked up the chant.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the demonstrators -- organized by a group of Hong Kong students  and professionals -- wore blue ribbons, signifying democracy, peace and  freedom, as they gathered at the Chinese Consulate in the Mid-Wilshire district  for the two-hour rally.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Mood  </P> <P> Such groups have been gathering for the past several weeks, but the mood  Saturday was quite different.  </P> <P> Someone had taped a banner on the glass doors, reading "United Nations. U.S.  Congress. President Bush. Take Your Stand. Stop Bloodshed."  </P> <P> The rally was led by Richard Leung, 27, a computer science student studying for  his master's degree at UCLA, and Jacqueline Cheng, also a Hong Kong student.  They took turns calling for action to stop the killing in China and led chants  in Chinese and English.  </P> <P> "No more bloodshed! Long live freedom! Long live democracy! Victory belongs to  the people!" they cried, and the others joined in.  </P> <P> Some in the crowd also spoke.  </P> <P> Yao Xiaotian, an engineering student wearing a USC sweatshirt, said the news  had upset him. "We cannot keep silent," he said. "It is time for us to stand  up."  </P> <P> Most of the rhetoric seemed to be offered with more concern than fury, but Yin  declared that he was angry because the tens of thousands of protesters in Tian  An Men Square are "our brothers and sisters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Digging Their Own Grave'  </P> <P> "This government is capable of anything," Yin said. "They're only digging their  own grave. Someday we'll achieve victory."  </P> <P> A sign scrawled on a piece of cardboard hanging from a light fixture declared,  "Blood will be paid by blood."  </P> <P> At the end of the rally, members of the crowd joined hands, raised their arms  and sang "We Shall Overcome."  </P> <P> Then, they cried, "No more bloodshed! Long live democracy! Long live freedom!"  </P></p>

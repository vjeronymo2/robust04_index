			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Juridical Sciences Nikolay </F> Postovoy: "Not a Defendant Before the Voter"]    [Text] The Institute of Legislation and Comparative  Jurisprudence discussed a scientific research plan, which  defines the concept of development of Russia's legislation, and  the new problems arising with the refinement of the status of a  deputy of the Federal Assembly.    A very sharp debate was held during the discussion of the  question concerning the status of a deputy. It brought to light  the problematic nature of the previously existing imperative  mandate of a deputy in connection with the adoption of the new  Constitution. Whereas previously the content of the imperative  mandate included such elements as the report of a deputy to  voters, instructions from voters, and the recall of a deputy,  the Constitution adopted at the referendum rejected all this.    Some scientists and deputies believe that the resolution of  this task can be found in the adoption of laws regulating the  activity of deputies, while others assume that it is impossible  to do this, because it is a matter of questions, which are the  subject of regulation of the Constitution alone. Very likely,  any of these points of view has the right to existence.    The novelty of the suffrage lies in the fact that part of  the  deputies of the State Duma are elected in the all-federal  district from parties and public associations. Who should give  instructions to deputies and to whom should they report? Should  all Russia be included in this process, or should such measures  be implemented in individual territories? How should innovations  be viewed from the standpoint of citizens' equal rights and  political stability? The same concerns the problem of the recall  of deputies elected from the all-federal district.    Thus, the imperative mandate affirmed by the laws of past  years has disappeared together with the old structure of the  legislative body. It was replaced by the free mandate, which  denies the legal and other responsibility of a deputy to voters.  In the opinion of Prof. V.I. Vasilyev, this means that a deputy  is not bound by instructions from voters and acts in the  parliament in accordance with his ideas of what is proper and  his own conscience.    However, even with this the possibilities of a certain  influence on deputies remain. It is easier to accomplish this  task with regard to deputies elected on the basis of party  lists. The party, being interested in enhancing its prestige,  can exert an influence on its deputies through fractions in the  parliament by making demands in accordance with party  discipline. Furthermore, it can warn a deputy about not  including him in the lists of candidates for the next elections.    Concerning contacts between deputies and voters it was  stated  unequivocally: We must have such a norm in the law. Its  importance is due to the fact that deputies, communicating with  voters, will know real life processes to a greater extent and  will be able to take into account the entire spectrum of public  opinion during the drafting and adoption of legislative acts.  Moreover, this will make it possible to overcome the gap among  various social strata and central authorities.    The question of deputies' control functions is no less  problematic. The Constitution does not provide for such powers  for deputies. Now they do not have the right to independently  check enterprises, institutions, and organizations, as was the  case earlier. Long-term experience has shown the uselessness of  such an activity.    In connection with this the following question arises: Does  the parliament itself have such a function? Yes, it follows from  a number of articles of the Constitution. This is expressed in  the following:    --in the right of the chambers to establish bodies for  control over the fulfillment of the budget and a special  commission for the preparation of a conclusion on the removal of  the president from office;    --in the right of control over the implementation of  personnel policy by the president. Both the Council of the  Federation and the State Duma have levers of effect on personnel  policy;    --in the right of control over the president's activity in  the area of foreign policy through the adoption of the law on  the ratification or denunciation of international treaties;    --in the right of the Council of the Federation to approve  or  not to approve the president's edicts on the imposition of  martial law and a state of emergency.    The parliament's control functions could also find their  expression in the form of systematic meetings by government  members with parliament members. During questions and answers,  which occur naturally in this process, it is always possible to  isolate the basic tendencies in the government course and to  give them the appropriate evaluation.    It is impossible not to touch upon the course of discussion  of the question concerning citizens' responsibility for the  violation of the rights of deputies and their family members.  The final opinion was reduced to the fact that legal norms  should be applied to an equal degree and in the same manner to  all citizens when they commit wrongful acts against whomever it  may be. They cannot be toughened or softened on the basis of the  post or the position held.    Otherwise, elements of discrimination against citizens'  rights will arise inevitably.</p>

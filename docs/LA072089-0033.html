			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL TRACK MEET MAKES STOP IN HOMETOWN OF PROGRAM FOUNDER;  </P> <P> LOOKING FOR A RACE, PAIN BECAME MASTER OF THE MASTERS  </P> <P> David Pain thought it a shame that athletics were wasted on the young. So in  1966, the La Jolla attorney did something about it -- he began Masters track  and field.  </P> <P> Pain's idea was simple. Allow athletes to compete against others their own age.  Let 34-year olds run against no one younger than 30, 74-year olds against no  one younger than 70.  </P> <P> It was an idea that quickly caught on. Now, 23 years after its birth, Masters  track and field has hundreds of thousands of competitors worldwide, Pain says.  </P> <P> Some 1,600 of them are gathered here this week for the TAC/USA National Masters  Championships, which begin today and run through Sunday at both San Diego State  and Balboa Stadium.  </P> <P> "It's the equivalent of rolling 20 track meets into one," said Dixon Farmer,  the meet director and a former CIF state champion at 440 yards and the 180-yard  low hurdles in 1958 and 1959.  </P> <P> And of course, David Pain is right smack in the middle of organizing the  monstrosity.  </P> <P> "I've never seen anyone who has such an attention to detail," Farmer said.  </P> <P> But could anyone expect something less than obsession from the father of  Masters track?  </P> <P> Pain was 45 in 1966 and realizing just how difficult it was to juggle a  lawyer's calendar with a social calendar.  </P> <P> "I was competing in handball at the San Diego Athletic Club," Pain recalled. "I  enjoyed the game, but there's always problems with a court game, having to sign  up for a court, be there at a certain time and only have one hour. As a lawyer  it was pretty hard to say, 'I'll be there at 4 p.m.' and keep that commitment.  </P> <P> "So I started running, and the thought occurred to me, 'Why not have a Masters  mile?' "  </P> <P> Pain got ahold of Les Land, who at the time organized a track meet here. Land,  too, asked, "Why not?" He consequently added an over-40 mile to his meet. Pain  and several others competed.  </P> <P> "I think I pulled a muscle and pulled up lame in that one," Pain said. "But  that's part of the game. In athletics, you have injuries."  </P> <P> It was an inauspicious debut for Pain, who never competed in athletics in  college or high school. But the injury did not hamper the idea.  </P> <P> Organizers of the San Francisco Examiner indoor meet, of the Los Angeles Sports  Arena meet and finally the Millrose Games all asked the Master milers to  compete.  </P> <P> "Then I thought, 'Why not have a Masters track meet?' " Pain recalls.  </P> <P> Though a success with some 400 athletes, the first meet -- held in San Diego --  did have some glitches, not the least of which was the fact that only a handful  of the athletes were women.  </P> <P> "We had to run all the women in one race because we didn't have enough in each  age division," Pain said.  </P> <P> There were also several events -- pole vault, hammer, triple jump and decathlon  among them -- not included because Pain and others thought older athletes ought  not attempt them. That was soon regarded as backward thinking.  </P> <P> "We quickly learned that Master athletes could do all disciplines without  exceptions," Pain said.  </P> <P> Pain and his colleagues have been going forward ever since. How far? Well, the  biggest-ever Masters meet will begin next week when more than 5,000 athletes  from some 55 different countries descend on Eugene, Ore., for the world  championships.  </P> <P> "He just got this idea," said Linda Pain, David's wife, "and it took off."  </P> <P> "Like the guy who invented the safety pin, or the guy who invented the paper  clip," David added.  </P> <P> But for those who participate, Pain's idea added more to life than just  convenience.  </P> <P> "The things people write to me makes me think we created something good for  people," Pain said.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best indication of that came two years ago at a banquet following  the world championships in Melbourne, Australia.  </P> <P> "A gentleman went up to the microphone unannounced," Pain remembered, "and he  said, 'I want everyone here to know that Dave Pain gave me a rebirth. He gave  me a new life.' And he said it with such sincerity. There were so many people  in the room who sort of said amen to that in agreement. It gave me a wonderful  feeling to know that there were so many people whose life had been made better  because of this program . . .  </P> <P> "It gives people a forum in which they can compete regardless of age as long as  they have a competitive spirit and athletic ability."  </P> <P> Pain, now 67, still competes in the middle distances. His best year came in  1971 when, at the age of 50, he ran 800 meters in 2:18.7, not world-class but  respectable.  </P> <P> Some of the other athletes who will compete beginning today include:  </P> <P>  -- Paul Spangler. At 90, Spangler will be the oldest American competing (There  will be some "guest" Finish athletes competing over that age). Spangler is a  multi-record holder in the 10,000, 5,000 and "everything down to the 800  meters," Pain said.  </P> <P>  -- Payton Jordan. Jordan, who coached at Stanford and the 1968 U.S. Olympic  team, was a national-class sprinter at USC in 1939 but stopped competing after  college. Until, that is, he turned 55 and entered the Masters program. At 72,  Jordan has run the 100 meters in 12.9 seconds (hand timed).  </P> <P>  -- Derek Turnbull. Turnbull is a 62-year-old sheep-herder from New Zealand who  two years ago in Melbourne won five gold medals, in the 800, 1,500, 5,000,  10,000 and marathon. After all the preliminaries and finals in those events,  and just four hours after finishing the marathon, Turnbull came back for an  encore and participated in an exhibition mile, finishing in less than five  minutes.  </P> <P>  -- James King of San Diego. King, who recently turned 40, set the world record  in the 35-39 age group in the intermediate hurdles at 52.8.  </P> <P> "Without Masters," Pain said, "athletes like James King would fade away. But  now every five years he can look forward to new records and stay interested."  </P> <P>  -- Stan Whitley. Like King, Whitley is an intermediate hurdler. "He and King  will be battling it out, and you'll see a new (Masters) world record from one  of them," Pain promised.  </P> <P> The meet already has taken a crooked turn. About 60 of 100 flags borrowed from  Balboa Park's United Nations display were set up along San Diego State's track  Tuesday afternoon. Sometime that night, they were stolen.  </P> <P> "Whoever did it had to jump the fence to get in there," said Steve Levon of The  Athletics Congress. "It wasn't an easy task. They're going to cost between $25  and $30 apiece to replace, so we'd be happy to take them back, no questions  asked."  </P></p>

The Mosad has begun to assassinate nationalist symbols and  strugglers in the occupied territories, just like the racist  regime did in the South Africa by assassinating the struggler  (?Hanker), and by sparking bloody confrontations that claimed  the lives of thousands of blacks.    The same experience is being repeated on Palestinian  territory. The occupation could not spark bloody disputes  between the resistance factions, so it resorted to  assassinations. Thus, Palestinian strugglers of all the  revolution's factions were subjected to killing and detention,  as happened in Gaza and the West Bank against the strugglers of  Fatah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,  and other factions. The Israeli occupation also aimed at  creating chaos and lack of security on the eve of the supposed  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip and Jericho on 13 December.    However, when these attempts failed, it postponed withdrawal  and started to maliciously sow disputes and provoke  sensitivities, blowing them out of proportion. Some of us have  fallen victim to this black propaganda. Also, international and  hostile press contributed to the great exaggeration of  Palestinian developments, thus predicting an imminent,  devastating explosion in the territory from which the enemy will  withdraw. Thus, this propaganda has robbed many people of their  feelings of joy and created a black cloud of fear and anxiety  hanging over their heads. This led to internal developments and  nationalist and factional disputes, using the media and press as  an arena to spread these unjustifiable differences.    The people's fears of a possible loss of security and safety  were doubled. Thus, we heard more outcries and warnings of what  is to come. Newspapers became full of articles, and the  Palestinian leadership was severely criticized, without anything  happening so far.    The awareness of the masses is required, so that the masses  will get prepared for a national self-reconciliation after a  long expatriation during the occupation. Also, the leadership  cadres will prepare for this mission through their deep  understanding of the nature of the next stage, which requires  disciplined conduct, calmness, and a show of self-confidence and  satisfaction with the future mission. This way the masses will  be satisfied and feel safe and secure.    We are all aware that the Israeli occupation is [words  indistinct] and caused us to starve and robbed us of the freedom  of expression and speech. Its removal means the end of these  diseases that spread because of the occupation on our  Palestinian territory for many years. The removal of the  occupation from part of our territory must restore us to our  natural situation and prompt us to work seriously and freely to  build a free Palestinian society in the future.    This assured conduct is a test of the awareness of the  factions, cadres, and masses, which should not now run after  authority, but after enhancing cooperation between everybody to  launch reconstruction. This is because the authority has not  yet come. The traces of occupation are still visible before our  own eyes. We advise every policeman and security officer to be  a faithful servant of the people's security and to safeguard  their property and protect their freedom of expression. The  masses, through the conduct of the policemen and the security,  should remove from their heads the notion that those people are  coming to impose a coercive order. They should know, right from  the very beginning, that those people have come to maintain  humanitarian relations between the people and to provide a  suitable climate to help the masses return to their normal life,  which they have been denied for a long time. Thus, the people  will cooperate and start holding celebrations, meetings,  seminars, set up social, cultural and economic institutions, and  do everything that one does in a stable community.    This is the responsibility of every member of any faction,  movement, or political party, because democracy cannot thrive,  as an expression of human rights and freedom, unless all  Palestinian organizations have good relations between each other  and with the masses in general. The factions should not cause  disputes, create chaos, or dig up the past that causes  factional, family, or religious disputes. This will make every  citizen feel that the liberated homeland is his to live in, in  freedom, security, and stability.    We are now facing an experiment. The world is watching and  will judge it by our good or bad performance and administration  of the liberated territory. The reaction of the friendly world,  or that which gives aid, will be good or bad in line with our  good administration and the national relations that we weave  between the citizens and the resistance factions in their  relations between each other and their performance of national  duties on the ground.    No community is free of social, political, or economic  problems. However, advanced communities study these problems  objectively and try to resolve them through collective work  after identifying successful solutions. Rival groups steer  clear of disputes and clashes and provoking regional problems so  that the national authority agencies and the resistance factions  can perform their duties satisfactorily without clashing with  the masses and serve the masses' daily interests faithfully and  honestly.    Our past hard experience has disheartened us. In spite of  the many negative manifestations that have surfaced in  Palestinian society, it would be better for us if we go back to  what is part of our nature, in terms of national cohesion,  collective action, and the care we give to serve the masses and  offer them all they need during this transition period where an  atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety prevails, an atmopshere the  enemy seeks to spread throughout the entire Arab region.    The success of the Palestinian experiment is a success for  the entire Arab region. The Palestinian cause is the core of the  Arab-Israeli conflict, and its developments directly reflect on  the Arab state of affairs. We should be a good example in the  way we behave and perform when building our future society.    We recommend, as of now, the formation of voluntary groups  for building in every walk of life. Let us also give women a  major part in social and economic work. Women should learn in  economic, social, and cultural institutions. We should also  open for them training schools so that they become qualified to  work, participate, and share.    Had there been groups in the camps and quarters to carry out  a comprehensive survey of the people's needs and requirements,  it would have been possible to expedite economic development.  We also must teach young people, find jobs for them, and train  them in all cultural, social, and economic fields. Let a school  be opened every day so these young people can join to make our  society one that is replete with qualified people who can build.  As the saying goes: The voice of work is stronger than the  vociferation of words.    We must take into consideration that this stage is a  transition stage, during which we will notice some confusion  between criticism and the freedom of speech, slander, and  defamation; between chauvinism and mature political affiliation;  and between those who are content with just raising national  unity slogans and those who work to translate these slogan into  facts. We also note that confusion will take place between what  is possible, now, in the transition period and what is not,  between the phased objectives and the general strategic  objectives.    We do not have a magic wand that achieves for us all that we  want. We must constantly struggle to realize small achievements  which add up day after day and one year after the other. We  must not search for positions now. We should resort to work, as  it is what will lead us to the positions and locations that  befit us. We are not now at the stage of dividing the bounty,  as some who have little experience imagine. We now are in the  process of taking stock of our capabilities, of developing them,  and having them assume their practical tasks within the  framework of an arduous struggle where means and methods will  differ to attain our national objectives.    The enemy, with all the evil it represents, is still present  among us with all the sufferings, the signs of backwardness, and  social ills it has left behind. We should eliminate all these  in time through our persistent work and our social and political  maturity. We must not punish those who committed mistakes. We  must seek to rehabilitate and redress them, and make them become  good citizens. We also must nurture the spirit of cooperation  among all the militant forces, without exception, and act as  tutors and counsellors, forgive mistakes, and tackle them with  peaceful means, devoid of hatred and rancor. The homeland is for  all and all have participated in its liberation. Therefore, they  should participate in building it.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELVIS  </P> <P> I've just returned from Memphis, Tenn., and I can assure you the real Elvis  Aron Presley is gone forever. Any chance the general public had of  understanding the sensitive yet frustrating 42 years of Presley's  apprenticeship on this planet is now disappearing inside a "freak show" the  former Mrs. Presley continues to call Graceland.  </P> <P> "Eternal Revenue," by Robert Hilburn (June 11), featuring the post-mortem  merchandising of Elvis' name was, in itself, a fine piece of journalism.  However, people planning to visit our beloved Elvis' Tennessee mansion in the  future should not be under the impression that current Presley estate trustees  have created anything more than another tasteless, inaccurate forgery of Elvis'  life.  </P> <P> Perhaps during her lifetime, Lisa M. Presley will defy the selfish ambitions of  her mother and other Presley estate "Cling-ons" in order to seek out and  publicly present a more historically accurate account of her father's legacy.  </P> <P> ERNEST W. CHARLES  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

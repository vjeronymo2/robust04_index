			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Storms help calm troubled Mideast AS if to prove that God, or Mother Nature, or whatever higher power you believe in, stands above mere earthly political squabbles, a reservoir on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights burst its banks this week and 3m cubic metres of flood water 'defected' across the UN-patrolled frontier into Syria. In the Middle East, water, like just about everything else, is a source of acute political tension, heightened recently by several years of drought. The Golan damburst notwithstanding, however, the weather in 1992 has poured far more balm on the area's water problems than anything achieved in the peace talks. Weathermen say there have been few winters like it this century. Explanations for the deluge of rain and snow in Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan this year range from the puzzled shrug to blaming volcanic eruptions last year in the Philippines. So far, two blizzards have smothered Jerusalem in snow, once to a depth of 30cm, bringing down thousands of trees and power lines. More snow is forecast today. But it is the near incessant, drenching rain that has fallen between snowstorms that is having the most dramatic effect. The Jordan river, a lifeblood for Israel, the occupied West Bank, Jordan and southern Syria, has turned from a brackish burn into a swollen torrent, submerging and closing the two bridges that are the only border crossing points between the West Bank and Jordan. As recently as last November, the Sea of Galilee was within centimetres of falling below the mark of 213 metres below sea level at which Israel ceases pumping for fear of permanently depleting the lake. Since the beginning of January it has risen by three metres and will soon breach the 'maximum' level of 209 metres below sea level when sluices must be opened to prevent flooding. This despite daily pumping of 200,000 cu metres into underground reservoirs. In the short term, there has been huge damage materially, especially to agriculture. Jordanian officials estimate 50 to 90 per cent of the delicate crops of the northern Jordan valley, such as tomatoes, aubergines and peppers, have been damaged by frost and floods. In Israel, farmers are calling on the government to declare an official disaster season to trigger compensation. Citrus and soft fruits, important export crops, have been hit at the height of the harvest. For the longer term, the dramatic boost to badly depleted surface and underground reservoirs will ease what was threatening to become a crisis. It may provide a breathing space for negotiators in the peace talks to untangle disputes over water sharing - particularly over Israel's inequitable distribution of water in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

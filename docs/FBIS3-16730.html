Tashkent residents wrote that whatever Uzbekistan had  accomplished was the result of the president's resolute  activities "for the great cause of making the republic one of  the most advanced countries of the world." The authors of the  letters "as Uzbek subjects" wanted to stand by the Uzbek leader  to help him. They emphasized that Karimov "worked  self-sacrificingly for peace and quiet in the Republic."    The letters expressed indignation over "the activities of a  bunch of slanderers who fled Uzbekistan and smuggled into it the  publications that libel the Motherland."    The authors of the letters called on the president to put an  end to the activities of those who smuggled "slanderous pieces"  into the Republic and "could not reconcile to Uzbekistan's  future as a great state."</p>

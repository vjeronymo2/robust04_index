			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT PHARMACEUTICALS POSTS LOSS FOR 1988, CITES COST OF TESTS  </P> <P> Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc., a diversified health care company  in Newport Beach, reported a loss of $4.96 million for 1988, which it  attributed almost entirely to the cost of tests aimed at proving the  effectiveness of Isoprinosine in the treatment of pre-AIDS conditions.  </P> <P> The company reported revenue of $31 million for the year.  </P> <P> In 1988, the company said, it invested over $4.1 million in research and  development to complete tests of Isoprinosine in the United States and United  Kingdom. Last November the company said the results of these clinical trials  failed to show the drug was effective in combatting pre-AIDS conditions.  </P> <P> In January, however, Leo Pharmaceutical Products, the company's licensee in  Denmark, said that a preliminary analysis of the results of Scandinavian tests  was promising. Newport Pharmaceuticals said that upon further analysis of the  results, it will determine whether to seek approval from the Food and Drug  Administration to market Isoprinosine in the United States.  </P> <P> Kenneth Smith, Newport Pharmaceuticals' senior vice president of finance, said  the firm did not have financial figures for a comparable reporting period in  1987 because the company moved the end of its fiscal year from April 30 to Dec.  31.  </P> <P> The company reported a loss of $2.4 million on revenue of $18.1 million for the  eight months ended Dec. 31, 1987.

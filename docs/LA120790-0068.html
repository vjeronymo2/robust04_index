			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART BREAKS OUT FROM BEHIND BARS;  </P> <P> EXHIBIT: PRINTS AND POETRY BY PRISON INMATES WILL BE ON DISPLAY AT CAL STATE  NORTHRIDGE.  </P> <P> The image is simple -- a woman's face on a black background. Touches of red and  gold highlight the crude visage. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the  monotype is the artist's signature:  </P> <P> Leslie Van Houten.  </P> <P> The former Manson family member is one of several dozen prison inmates whose  art and poetry will be on display at Cal State Northridge beginning Monday.  </P> <P> A variety of styles are included in the exhibit, "Perimeters: Prints and  Poetry," which also features pieces by prison art teachers. The quality of the  work varies -- from amateurish to sophisticated.  </P> <P> But with a show such as this, the attraction goes beyond mere color and line,  or words put to paper. This art arrives imbued with powerful social context.  </P> <P> "It's coming from a prison," said Louise Lewis, director of CSUN's art  galleries. "On a very basic level, there's an element of curiosity. What kind  of art will we get?"  </P> <P> Several of the works follow an expected theme. Shattered images of violence and  iron bars fill Q. Langston's hand-tinted lithograph. Wallace W. Williams' poem,  "The Front," is an angry litany:  </P> <P>  I saw him thru his fist in the air as he talked  </P> <P>  about how many heads he busted and seemed proud of.  </P> <P>  I saw him push the little guys around.  </P> <P>  I saw him curse guards.  </P> <P>  I saw him do a thousand push-ups a day.  </P> <P>  Similarly predictable sadness and desperation cloud a junkie's lament by Megan  Silva Gaiduk:  </P> <P>  I know I love you  </P> <P>  because  </P> <P>  I habitually let you fix first  </P> <P>  I insist you do more 'cause you're bigger  </P> <P>  . . .  </P> <P>  I fret about your weight while mine dwindles  </P> <P>  . . .  </P> <P>  and I know you love me  </P> <P>  because  </P> <P>  you allow me to do these things.  </P> <P>  But such themes do not hold true for every print or poem. Some works have  color and joy and figures drawn with soft lines.  </P> <P> C. McDonald creates human figures from swirling colors, set against blocks of  pale red and turquoise. Joe Shaver's linocut, "Indian Signs," is constructed of  basic reds, whites and maroons. Enrique Roquigo draws faces beneath brightly  colored hats.  </P> <P> "I know the expectation is to see grotesque, gruesome stuff," said Jim Carlson,  a state corrections official. "We have some angry people inside the  institutions, just like there are angry people on the street. But we also have  a full range of people inside. A lot of the inmates' work reflects  sensitivity."  </P> <P> Carlson manages the Arts-in-Corrections program, which employs art teachers in  21 California prisons. Some 9,000 inmates regularly attend art workshops and  classes, and the resulting work has shown at galleries across the state.  </P> <P> More important to prison officials, the program appears to have a  rehabilitative effect. A 1983 study showed that inmates with behavior problems  were far less likely to commit rules infractions while working in the arts. A  1987 study showed that parolees who had participated in Arts-in-Corrections  were significantly less likely to be recidivists.  </P> <P> "The whole artistic process helps them in thinking through situations. It  raises their self-esteem," Carlson said. He also believes that the art can  teach a thing or two to people on the outside.  </P> <P> "Not to diminish the crimes, but the art allows us to view inmates  differently," he said. "It speaks to the potential of some of the people in  institutions."  </P> <P> Program officials approached Lewis last fall to ask if CSUN would be host to an  exhibit. There had been numerous inmate shows in Southern California recently,  at such places as UC Riverside and Los Angeles City Hall.  </P> <P> Lewis was immediately taken with the idea. The concept has inspired her to  think about art and notoriety.  </P> <P> "I wonder what the Keating 5 would produce?" she asked.  </P> <P>  "Perimeters: Prints and Poetry" will show Monday through Feb. 16. CSUN design  faculty will exhibit accompanying pieces that explore various forms of media  and communication. The gallery, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge, will be closed  Dec. 22 to Jan. 2 for university holidays and will open Jan. 7 to 27 by  appointment only. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, and  noon to 4 p.m. Mondays and Saturdays. Call (818) 885-2156.  </P> <P> </P></p>

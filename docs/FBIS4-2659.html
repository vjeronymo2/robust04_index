			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "XINHUA Hong Kong Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng </F> Says Xi Yang Case Is Handled According to Law and Brooks No  Interference"]    [Text] Frederick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Hong Kong  Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood, and its  members Lo Cheung-kwok, Leung Kuang-cheung, and Wang Kwok-tong,  made an appointment with Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch this afternoon [9 April] and  submitted a letter on Xi Yang's case addressed to the Beijing  Municipal Higher People's Court.    While talking about Xi Yang's case with Lo Cheung-kwok and  his group, Zhang Junsheng said: "I returned from the mainland  on a business trip only last night. This morning, I heard that  you wanted an appointment with me. To make the meeting as early  as possible, we arranged for the meeting this very afternoon. I  am sorry for the inconvenience, since it is a weekend.    "Just now you talked about Xi Yang's case. That has been a  very unfortunate incident, indeed. I put it that way because  none of us hoped to see anyone breaking the law, nor did we hope  to see such a penalty meted out for that matter. However, a  penalty must be meted out to any lawbreaker according to the law.    "I believe you must have read about a ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE  dispatch today. This is basically a legal affair. From the  related information available to us, we can see that the case in  question involved the stealing of state secrets. In handling  this case, the judicial department carried out an investigation,  enforced custody, and interrogated strictly according to legal  procedures.    "Some people say that the reporter `intruded in an  off-limits  area by mistake' in the course of normal news coverage,  consequently violating the law. Still others think that it was  entirely a matter of press freedom. I do not think this is  correct. This was by no means normal news coverage. When Hong  Kong reporters go to the mainland for news coverage, they have  to send an application beforehand. Take our XINHUA NEWS AGENCY  Hong Kong Branch for example. We often help Hong Kong reporters  conduct news coverage on the mainland. However, we have never  received an application from Xi Yang to cover the People's Bank  of China, nor have we ever made any arrangements to that end.  To our knowledge, Xi Yang had never made any similar  application to the People's Bank of China, nor had he gained  permission to conduct news coverage on related issues, nor had  the People's Bank of China appointed its worker Tian Ye to  accept Xi Yang's interview. It follows that Tian Ye had no  right whatsoever to provide Xi Yang with information on related  matters. This being the case, this was not a matter of news  coverage, not a matter of press freedom, but an issue of  violating the law.    "To handle a criminal case according to the law is entirely  the responsibility and power of the judicial department, which  brooks no interference. It would also be violating the law to  interfere with judicial departments in ruling on a case  according to the law. It would also be wrong to affect judicial  fairness through creating public opinion to add pressure on  judicial departments. People should refrain from turning a  legal issue into a political one. It is my hope that the  British Hong Kong Government will stay away from this matter,  which is within the realm of China's sovereignty. On a  television newscast, we saw Mr. Chris Patten say "The closer  1997 approaches, and the greater the number of similar  incidents, the more uneasy people will be and the more Hong Kong  residents will worry about the future." Such words are wrong,  and intentionally sow discord. Actually, Chris Patten has  hinted that Hong Kong residents will increasingly conduct  law-breaking activities in the mainland. That is throwing mud  at Hong Kong residents."    Regarding the letter submitted by the Association of  Democracy and People's Livelihood, Zhang Junsheng said he would  relay it to the relevant department.</p>

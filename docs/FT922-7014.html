			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries advance on 17% fall in April housing starts US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday after a large decline in April housing starts fuelled hopes of an interest rate cut. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  21/32 at 102 3/4 , yielding 7.756 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  9/32 at 100 25/32 , yielding 4.930 per cent. The market reacted instantly to news from the Commerce Department that housing starts fell 17 per cent in April, a decline that was almost three times analysts' forecasts. The figures sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee, which met yesterday, would react with a cut in interest rates to stimulate the sluggish economic recovery. Although monetary policy remained on hold, there were expectations that the Fed would act soon. But some analysts cautioned the sharp drop in housing starts last month was primarily due to an unfavourable comparison with unsustainably high levels recorded earlier this year. GERMAN government bonds fell slightly following substantial gains on Monday, with trading nervous before the release of money supply data which could determine the future direction of interest rates. The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.21-29 for a yield of 7.96 per cent, little changed from Monday's closing level but below the high of the day. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, closed at 87.48, down from an opening level of 87.56 and well below the high of 87.63. Volume was sluggish at 30,000 contracts against Monday's 80,000. Money supply data for April could be released any time from today and is one of the key economic indicators watched by the Bundesbank. The council of the central bank holds a regular bi-weekly meeting tomorrow. Yesterday, construction industry employers and unions agreed a 5.8 per cent pay increase, plus improved conditions of service. The settlement follows a similar deal between engineering employers and unions agreed on Monday. UK government bond prices were stable to slightly weaker yesterday, but with few investors or dealers taking positions before the retail sales data for April expected today. The benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed at 100 3/4 , close to the opening level, for a yield of 8.9 per cent. The June gilt futures contract on Liffe closed at 99.06, just down from the opening level of 99.08 and below the day's high of 99.11. Volume was 15,000 contracts, well down from Monday. The market was encouraged by figures which showed the public sector borrowing requirement at Pounds 3.6bn in April, against market expectations of closer to Pounds 4bn. This suggested that government finances are not deteriorating as quickly as some analysts had predicted. Official data also suggested that the UK economy is slowly starting to pull out of recession. Manufacturing output rose by 0.1 per cent during March, although the annual rate of growth remained negative, at minus 1.2 per cent. However, retail sales figures due for release today could give a better indication of the post-election performance of the economy. JAPANESE government bond prices continued to trade with a firmer tone overnight in Tokyo, supported by the buoyancy of share prices and the strength of the yen on the foreign exchange markets. The benchmark 10-year bond issue No 129 closed in Tokyo on a yield of 5.48 per cent, from 5.515 per cent on Monday. The yen held on to Monday's gains on the foreign exchange markets, moving in a tight range against the dollar between Y129.25 and Y128.25 in Asian trading. By late afternoon in London, the Japanese currency stood at Y129.00. The Nikkei 225 stock market index closed up 311 points on the day at 18,754, following a 368 point rise on Monday.</p>

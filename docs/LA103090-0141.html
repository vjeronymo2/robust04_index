			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA ;  </P> <P> SINGAPORE'S PARADOX: HOSTILITY TO PRESS, TV DESPITE LITTLE TO HIDE;  </P> <P> THE U.S. ALLY SEEMINGLY ROLLS OUT THE WELCOME MAT TO ALL BUT NEWS  ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH THE ISLAND'S PRIME MINISTER ACCUSES OF INTERFERENCE. AFTER  ONE LEGAL BATTLE, THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL DECIDES TO HALT CIRCULATION.  </P> <P> It is one of the closest U.S. allies in the Pacific, offering access to  military facilities at a time when the Philippines is trying to boot the  Americans out. But despite a strong affinity for the United States and many  aspects of its culture, Singapore continues to take a defiant stand against  what it considers to be the unwelcome incursions of Western news media.  </P> <P> Two developments earlier this month help illustrate Singapore's stand, perhaps  the toughest in the developed world:  </P> <P> * The Asian Wall Street Journal, sister publication of the Journal in the  United States, announced that it was halting circulation in the island republic  after a lengthy legal dispute with the Singapore government.  </P> <P> * Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, whose political party has ruled Singapore since  it gained independence in 1965, issued a scathing criticism of the Western  media, accusing television inparticular of creating false hopes among Chinese  students during last year's disturbances in Beijing and charging that American  news organizations had set out two years ago to deliberately change the view of  Congress about Cambodia.  </P> <P> "Singapore is a totally urban society with state-of-the-art-telecommunications,  and no government can effectively censor what the people read," Lee declared.  "But the government can and will insist on no interference in the domestic  politics of Singapore."  </P> <P> Singapore itself has a fairly tame domestic press, which never criticizes  government policy. Singaporeans are also denied permission to erect satellite  dishes to receive foreign television programs such as CNN, and videotapes  entering the country are heavily censored, primarily to maintain a prudish  standard about sex in films. But books are not censored and the government  retransmits the foreign service of the British Broadcasting Corp., including  its news programs.  </P> <P> By contrast, other Southeast Asian countries limit critical reporting in the  local vernacular press, but few besides Vietnam and Cambodia seek to control  what foreign publications circulate among the educated elite and foreigners.  </P> <P> In Singapore, the government draws the line at what it considers "interference  in domestic politics," which it defines broadly as Singapore's political  system, public institutions, ideology and government policies.  </P> <P> Its hostility toward the Western media is often regarded by both journalists  and native Singaporeans as a paradox because among Southeast Asian nations it  has the least to hide: a booming economy, with a corruption-free government, an  enviable lifestyle and civic amenities that are the wonder of Asia.  </P> <P> Still, Singapore has clashed over the years with a number of foreign  publications, including Time magazine and Asiaweek, a regional news weekly. Lee  has even become personally embroiled in disputes with foreign columnists,  challenging one -- Bernard Levin of the London Times -- to a televised debate.  </P> <P> But never has a dispute lasted as long or been as bitter as the one pitting  Singapore against the Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic  Review, a regional weekly which is also owned by the Journal's parent, Dow  Jones &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The government has prevented the Hong Kong-based Review from basing a  correspondent here since 1987; it similarly barred the Journal from having a  correspondent in 1988. The confrontation briefly bubbled into an international  incident when Secretary of States James A. Baker III wrote to ask the  government to relax the ban for his visit in August, but the Singaporeans  refused.  </P> <P> The dispute with the Review stemmed from an article over detentions of church  workers, while the Journal was criticized for an article about a second-tier  Singaporean securities market called Sesdaq. The Singaporeans were angered when  they were not given a "right of reply" in the form of lengthy letters that they  insisted could not be edited for publication; they then tried to buy  advertisements that were also refused.  </P> <P> When the Journal published an editorial critical of Singaporean courts'  handling of the legal case, Lee sued the newspaper for libel.  </P> <P> In 1987, the government ordered the Review to limit its circulation to 500  copies, and the magazine decided to halt sales in Singapore. So now a pirated  version of the magazine circulates with government sanction, but with the  advertisements blanked out.  </P> <P> The Journal had also seen its circulation limited to 400 copies, down from  5,000 before the ban. In announcing its decision to halt circulation, the  Journal cited a new press law passed by Parliament in August.  </P> <P> The law requires foreign publications to obtain a permit from the Ministry of  Communications and Information. The law gives the minister the power to reduce  circulation at any time and to revoke the permit without giving a reason. The  minister may also require the publication to put up a deposit to meet costs  arising out of potential court actions.  </P> <P> "What the government of Singapore wants is for the foreign press to practice  self-censorship," the Journal said in a subsequent editorial. "A facade of  factual reporting will be allowed, but any statement by authorities must be  taken at face value; lest it disturb either the political monopoly of the  (ruling) People's Action Party or the pretense of democracy, the press shall  not report the opinions of critics within Singapore, let alone the defenses of  those in disputes with the government."  </P> <P> Obviously, Singapore takes a different tack. In correspondence with the  Journal, Goh Chok Tong, the first deputy prime minister, said foreign  publications should report "events in Singapore as outsiders, for outsiders."  </P> <P> "It is not their responsibility to protect Singaporean citizens against what  they may perceive to be an authoritarian government, or to ensure the  functioning of a 'healthy democracy' in Singapore," he said.  </P> <P> A Western diplomat in Singapore described Lee as a strong personality who by  force of will turned the island from a backwater swamp into a world financial  center. "The preoccupation is to maintain control," the diplomat said, "and the  Western press represents a wild card. He can't control it, and there is a  potential for destabilizing the situation."  </P> <P> But Lee went further in his speech, which was given to the British Commonwealth  Press Union in Hong Kong earlier this month. He said news now travels so  quickly that governments have to adjust their ways of formulating policy. Lee  suggested for example that when Dan Rather of CBS interviewed Saddam Hussein of  Iraq, "he ventured into the domain of U.S. foreign policy at a time of crisis."  </P> <P> Lee blamed television for creating false hopes in China's rebellious students  last year during the Tian An Men Square demonstrations. He also blamed the  print media for causing excessive optimism in Hong Kong after a hand-over  agreement was signed between Britain and China in 1984. After last year's  events, he said "the press created excessive pessimism."  </P> <P> Lee said the American press "campaigned tenaciously and skillfully" against the  Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The result was that the Bush Administration altered  course, he said, while the situation on the ground had not changed.  </P> <P> He charged that while the American press had discovered that it could move  mountains in Washington, "they were not an irresistible force in a foreign  Third World country like Singapore."  </P> <P> But why go to all the trouble of so public a clash, he asked rhetorically.  </P> <P> "Well, among other things, it brings home to Singaporeans that regardless of  the pontifications of foreign correspondents and commentators, it is the values  of the elected government of Singapore that will prevail."  </P></p>

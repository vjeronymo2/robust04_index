			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Economic reasoning is faulty Sir, Lester Thurow's Personal View (March 10) on the need for the expanding US economy to 'decouple' from its trade partners contains some remarkably faulty economic reasoning. Ha argues that a surge in manufactured imports would create increased unemployment as the US 'locomotive' moves ahead faster than other countries. Yet that surge in imports would depend on a much larger surge of demand and gross domestic product in America. Imports of manufacture constitute only 5 per cent of America's GDP. Thus to get Thurow's Dollars 45bn surge of such imports, GDP would have to move ahead by Dollars 900bn or 15 per cent. That would create many more new jobs than the Dollars 45bn of additional imports would displace. This is rather obvious first-level economics, and it is surprising that the Dean of the Sloan School at MIT needs this lesson.

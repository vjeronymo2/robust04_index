			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Senior suffers 65% downturn to Pounds 6.3m SENIOR ENGINEERING, the tubing, ductwork and thermal engineering group, yesterday reported a 65 per cent fall in 1992 pre-tax profits, illustrating how the new Financial Reporting Standard 3 can transform the presentation of results. At the pre-tax level profits fell from Pounds 18.3m in 1991 to Pounds 6.3m, due to the accounting implications of the withdrawal from the mining equipment industry, and closure of the large power project contracting side. Losses of Pounds 6.6m on these decisions - completed last week with the disposal of the Senior Conflow water control equipment businesses - have been charged against 1992 profits as planned. But, because of FRS 3, Senior has also had to charge the Pounds 5.6m of goodwill incurred when the businesses were originally bought. The effect leaves net income down sharply at Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 12.4m). Earnings per share dropped from a restated 6.3p to 0.98p. However, executives stressed yesterday that these figures did not reflect the underlying performance. 'We're now in better shape than we've ever been,' said Mr John Bell, chief executive. Operating profits from continuing businesses edged up 1.8 per cent to Pounds 17.2m. The Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) acquisition of Flexonics in the US last February, along with several smaller acquisitions, had added a further Pounds 3.9m of operating profit, more than was expected. Overall, operating profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 21.1m - a figure which Mr Bell views as the yardstick for 1993. 'Underlying' earnings per share rose from a restated 5.68p to 6.26p. The latest results cap a year of considerable activity for Senior. Mr Bell's relief at being out of the mining equipment business is more than matched by his delight with Flexonics, which makes flexible hose and expansion joints. Senior is looking for another similar acquisition, especially in the US. Flexonics, which was virtually unknown outside the US when it was purchased, offered considerable potential for growth, said Mr Bell. The purchase had also helped lift operating margin in the engineered product business from 3.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent and lift operating profits from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 6.9m. Profits also rose from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 8.4m in thermal engineering, but construction services profits dipped from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 5.8m. On the outlook, Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said the increased confidence being generally expressed in the UK economy was not being reflected in the group's businesses except in isolated cases. However, there were increasing signs of improvement in the US. A recommended final dividend of 1.95p maintains the total for the year at 3.15p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Defense Secretary's Trip to South Korea Denounced" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  condemn the U.S. defense secretary's visit to South Korea as a  war trip intended to unleash another war on the Korean  peninsula, an aggressive trip to increase the military  dependence of South Korea and a trip of plunder for fleecing the  South Korean people through arms sale.    A NODONG SINMUN analyst, commenting on the war confabs Perry  and the Kim Yong-sam group held with a view to doing harm to the  DPRK, says:    Raving that the North would "invade the South" if sanctions  are taken by the United Nations, the U.S. defense secretary  described their military step as one intended to prevent it and  made quite a noise as if it were the DPRK, not the United  States, that violated the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions.    This is a jargon that could be uttered only by such  warmaniacs as Perry who are accustomed to justifying their moves  of aggression and war. It is the United States, not the DPRK,  that failed to implement the agreed conclusions reached at the  DPRK-USA contact in New York.    It goes without saying that the United States needed to mass  its Armed Forces in South Korea, an alien land, only to provoke  a war.    Perry decided to resume the "Team Spirit" war gamble with  the  puppets under unreasonable pretexts. This shows that they have  no intention to seek a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue,  and reveals his criminal intention to take the road of military  adventure after massing U.S. Armed Forces on the Korean  peninsula on the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue". Before  setting foot in South Korea Perry sent Apache helicopters and  Patriot missiles, and when he met with the puppets he pressured  them to purchase heavy weapons of the United States, pressing  home the need to build up the combat power of the U.S. forces  and the puppet Army.    It is the intention of the United States to rake up colossal  profits by forcing them to open not only the rice market but  even the arms market of South Korea.    All this proves that the United States unilaterally  discarded  the Korean Armistice Agreement that prohibits the introduction  of arms into South Korea for a war and the DPRK-USA joint  statement on refraining from a nuclear threat to the DPRK and  that the South Korean puppets nullified the North-South joint  declaration on denuclearization that bans the introduction,  deployment and production of nuclear weapons and are openly  racing headlong along the road of war against the fellow  countrymen.    The U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are  recklessly trying to stifle the DPRK with "strength", but it is  a miscalculation.    The United States must know clearly that military pressure  or  "sanctions" cannot work with the DPRK.    If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets  finally  push the situation on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase  of war, they would be unable to escape a thousand-fold blow.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that the aggressors and the  traitors must act not rashly but prudently, clearly mindful of  what tragic consequences their war frenzy would bring to them.</p>

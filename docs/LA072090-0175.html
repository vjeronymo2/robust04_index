			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GRETZKY SWITCHES EQUIPMENT  </P> <P> Hockey's greatest scorer will be doing his shooting with different sticks next  season. But Wayne Gretzky's agent and the company that made his equipment  disagree on the reason for the switch.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Kings' star is changing sticks and equipment after more than a  decade. Karhu Canada, which makes the Titan sticks and Jofa equipment that  Gretzky has worn since joining the NHL in 1979, says Gretzky made the switch  because he couldn't get up to $1 million in a long-term endorsement deal.  </P> <P> Doug Barbor, president of Karhu Canada, said the company offered Gretzky about  $170,000 annually for three years to replace his old deal -- which paid him  about $100,000 last year -- that expired in June. Gretzky's representatives  countered with a request for $250,000 a year for three or four years, Barbor  added.  </P> <P> Michael Barnett, Gretzky's business agent, expressed surprise that Karhu would  reveal confidential terms of past deals with his client. But he stressed that  money was not a factor in the decision and declined comment on whether Gretzky  was unhappy with the quality of the Titan and Jofa products.  </P> <P> "It was a personal decision and has nothing to do with the economics," Barnett  said.  </P> <P> Gretzky has not signed with another manufacturer yet.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department proposes to amend &sect;277.11 to add a new paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(1) which would limit the time period during which State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies may file a request for retroactive funding. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended effect of this proposal is to limit State agency and FNS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources toward the present operation of the program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes State agencies have a responsibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly claim Federal funding on a timely basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Federal programs currently have claim limitations in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits on grants to State agencies for the Aid to Families with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dependent Children and Medicaid Programs. For example, in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, DHHS will reimburse a State agency only if the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency files a claim for an expenditure within two years after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the calendar quarter in which the State agency made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditure. In this rule, the Department is proposing a similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation for the Food Stamp Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department proposes in new &sect;277.11(d)(3) to provide, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the availability of funds, FNS would reimburse a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency for an allowable expenditure at the appropriate Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement rate only if the State agency files a claim with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FNS for that expenditure within two years after the calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of 75 percent funding for fraud control activity, the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-year limit would apply to claims for retroactive 75 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraud funding but there would be an additional limit in that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retroactive funding would not be available prior to the year in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the State agency applied for 75 percent funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Department proposes in new &sect;277.11(d)(2) to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that subject to the availability of funds and any required FNS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval related to the Advance Planning Document under 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 277.18(c), FNS would reimburse State agencies for the purchase of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automated data processing (ADP) equipment and services at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate reimbursement rate in effect at the time the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment or service was received only if the State agency files  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a claim with FNS for that expenditure within two years after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed time limit applies to ADP expenditures approved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding at the enhanced rate and at the regular rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's proposal in new &sect;277.11(d)(4) would provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain exceptions to the two-year limit. State agencies may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request a waiver of the time limit in writing in advance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadline. In order to be granted by FNS, the request must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include supporting explanation, justification and documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as set forth in proposed &sect;277.11(d)(5) the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit would not apply to audit exceptions, or where FNS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines there was good cause resulting from circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the State agency's control for filing a late claim. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit exception means a proposed adjustment by the Department to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any expenditure claimed by a State agency by virtue of an audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Department's proposal would limit the time period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the use of the SF&hyph;270 to repay FNS for an overclaim to three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years from the end of the Federal fiscal year unless litigation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an audit, or a claim is pending at the end of the three-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. FNS reserves the right to assert a claim against State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies for amounts due when an SF&hyph;270 is not submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency to repay any money due FNS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note that under the current program rules at &sect;277.12, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies are required to maintain all financial records for three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years unless there is pending litigation, or an unresolved audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or claim. If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expiration of the three-year period, the applicable records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be retained until these have been resolved. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not proposing any changes to these record retention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> AFDC/Food Stamp Certification Costs_Section 277.9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is also proposing amendments to current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to correspond to current practice related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charging of certain food stamp certification costs to the Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stamp Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulations at &sect;277.9 provide that any cost related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determining the Food Stamp Program eligibility of Aid to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) cases is to be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of the AFDC determination costs and claims and not as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable cost for FNS reimbursement. However, beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1983, as a result of a Memorandum of Understanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the Department and DHHS, the Department changed this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy, but not the regulatory provision, so that the incremental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of certifying AFDC households for Food Stamp Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits shall be charged to FNS, not to the Office for Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance, DHHS. State agencies were notified by FNS regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices of this change in August 1983. Beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1983, State agencies have been allowed to charge such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs to FNS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

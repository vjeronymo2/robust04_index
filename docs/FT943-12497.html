			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Compaq, but it's perfectly formed: Louise Kehoe on how the US personal computer group has, unlike others, produced rapid profits growth Compaq Computer is 'the company that seems to do everything right' competitors say with a touch of envy. While IBM, Apple Computer, Dell Computer and other personal computer manufacturers struggle to keep pace, Compaq goes from strength to strength. Last week, the Houston, Texas, company reported record second-quarter sales of Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn), up 53 per cent from the same quarter last year. Net profits for the quarter were more than doubled to Dollars 210m, compared with Dollars 102m a year before. If sales continue to grow at this rate, Compaq will overtake Apple and IBM to become the world's largest personal computer company ahead of its 1996 target. In terms of numbers of computers sold, rather than revenues, the company is already outselling all rivals. Similarly, in the market for PC 'servers' - the computers used to boost the performance of office PC networks - Compaq has stolen a lead with an estimated Dollars 2bn share of the Dollars 5bn world market. With higher gross margins than any other PC manufacturer and among the highest revenues per employee in the computer industry, Compaq is also a Wall Street favourite. The company's investors have seen the value of their shares soar over the past two years from about Dollars 20 to more than Dollars 90 (before a recent three for one stock split). Compaq's performance is all the more remarkable because three years ago the company was in crisis. Market share was falling rapidly and profits languished as the company struggled in the face of fierce competition from smaller PC makers offering cheaper products. In a move that shocked even hard-bitten industry observers, Compaq's board of directors fired Mr Rod Canion, the company's popular founder, in 1991 and replaced him as chief executive with Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, a German engineer who had built up Compaq's European operations. Mr Pfeiffer has overhauled the company. As other large US computer companies struggle to adapt to rapidly changing technology and market conditions, Compaq's almost textbook turnaround could provide a model. 'I know only one company to compare ourselves with and that is Compaq,' says Mr Enrico Pesatori, a senior executive at Digital Equipment, the Massachusetts-based computer maker, who is responsible for restructuring the computer systems business. 'We can no longer characterise Compaq as just a PC company,' he adds. 'It is a company that has perfectly interpreted the new style of computing that is emerging, based on networks of PCs.' For those looking to learn from Compaq's return to vigorous, profitable growth, six main conditions for a turnaround emerge from its story: Swift action. Compaq reacted quickly when its financial performance declined in mid-1991. Within six months of the first signs of trouble, the company had redrawn its strategy to emphasise the importance of winning market share, realigned its management and begun restructuring its operations. Good corporate governance. These steps would probably not have been taken had it not been for pressure exerted on Compaq's management by its board of directors. Unlike many companies in the computer industry, Compaq's chairman is a non-executive director, rather than the chief executive and all other members of the board (except for the chief executive) are also drawn from outside the company. This structure 'allows the board to preserve its role of supervising management,' says Mr Ben Rosen, Compaq chairman. 'In good times it doesn't matter how the board is constituted. It is when there is a problem, a corporate issue, a strategic change or a management change that it is very useful to have a truly independent board.' Cutting the right costs. While Compaq was initially forced to lay off workers, the company quickly refocused on improving its manufacturing efficiency. Over the two years ending December 1993 Compaq quadrupled its production volumes while adding only about 500 workers, bringing its total workforce to just over 10,500. 'Our strategy was never just to cut costs,' says Mr Daryl White, chief financial officer. The drastic cost reductions under way at some of the largest computer companies without much evidence of efforts to boost revenues 'is very dangerous; they are on a downward spiral', he observes. Willingness to change. 'The cleverest strategy is useless unless management has the willingness, the guts, to implement it,' says Mr Gian Carlo Bisone, Compaq vice-president responsible for US marketing. 'We had to change the mindset of the whole company from building the highest-performance products in the industry to building products that are well positioned to take advantage of the 'sweetspot' of the market at the right cost, so that we could price them aggressively.' Becoming 'customer focused': Compaq adopted this philosophy earlier than most and moved aggressively to make the changes needed for the term to be meaningful. 'The key decision was to shift this company from being a product-centric company to becoming a customer-centric company,' says Mr Bisone. Until 1991, for example, Compaq sold its products exclusively through independent computer dealers (chains such as Computer Land that dominated the PC market until the late 1980s). Today, says Mr Bisone, 'we sell computers wherever the customer wants to buy them. If they want to buy them in gas stations, that is where we will sell them'. It has not come to that yet, but Compaq PCs are sold by mail and telephone, in department stores as well as through traditional dealers. Another radical change for Compaq was to broaden its marketing operations. To be profitable at competitive prices, the company had to increase the volume of its sales. That meant addressing every segment of the market. 'We have more than doubled the size of the potential market we go after,' says Mr Pfeiffer. Set aggressive goals. From its drive to create cost-competitive products in 1992 to its current ambitions to take over market leadership, Mr Pfeiffer has always set 'stretch' goals for Compaq. Despite its impressive achievements, the history of the personal computer industry suggests that past success is no guarantee of future prosperity. The danger Compaq faces is that its fast rate of growth could mean a slip leading to a serious setback. One of the toughest challenges the company faces is how to ensure it can meet unpredictable demand for its products. Last year, for example, its sales of servers were limited by parts supply problems. In an attempt to overcome this problem, the company has encouraged its suppliers to collaborate on 'just-in-time' delivery to its Houston factory. Parts are stored in a warehouse close to the plant, with some parts being delivered hourly. To keep up its hectic pace of growth the company has this year begun expanding its manufacturing facilities at all three existing sites - in Texas, Scotland and Singapore - while also opening a factory in Brazil and an assembly plant in China. Simultaneously, Compaq is developing products that will take advantage of advances in multimedia and interactive television. On the corporate computing front it is improving the performance of its servers to challenge IBM and Digital. Some observers worry that Compaq may be stretching itself too thinly. But it remains confident. 'The best companies are those that have hit the wall and bounced back quickly,' says Mr White. 'The plank that hit us over the head in 1991 is still indelibly etched on our foreheads,' adds Mr Rosen.</p>

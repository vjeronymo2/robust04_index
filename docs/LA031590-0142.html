			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE;  </P> <P> A CASE OF COURT CONGESTION  </P> <P> The cost of switching Sierra Madre from the Pasadena Municipal Court District  to the Santa Anita Court District will be examined by the city manager and the  police department.  </P> <P> The change was proposed by City Councilman George Maurer, who believes the  Pasadena system is too congested. Using the Santa Anita Municipal Court in  Monrovia will be faster and more convenient for Sierra Madre residents and  Sierra Madre police officers who need to appear in court for traffic citations  and misdemeanor violations, he said.  </P></p>

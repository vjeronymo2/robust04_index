			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Hollywood Redevelopment -- Due to incorrect information provided by Los Angeles  Councilman Michael Woo, an article Friday stated that none of his appointees to  a new advisory group on Hollywood redevelopment had previously served as  elected members of the Hollywood Project Area Committee. At the time the  council voted in May to disband the committee, two of the appointees were  elected members of the panel, according to the Community Redevelopment Agency.  </P></p>

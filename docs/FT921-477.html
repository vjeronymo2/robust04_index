			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Tracing plan for medical products MANUFACTURERS of medical devices in the US will soon be required to trace systematically their products through the distribution chain to the patient if proposals put forward yesterday by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) become law. Mr David Kessler, FDA commissioner, said: 'Tracking will help the FDA protect the public by providing the information necessary to quickly remove dangerous and defective devices from the market. Identifying and following patients who receive these devices is also critical, so that the patients can be notified promptly of any problems.' The proposals would apply only to permanent implants and life-sustaining or life-supporting devices. Manufacturers would have to develop a system of tracing, identifying and reporting patients' names and locations of devices to the FDA within three days. The FDA said its new rules would apply to all devices approved after May 28. The proposals come as concern grows that the government agency is incapable of ensuring public safety. It has come under attack for being slow to remove potentially unsafe medical devices, ranging from silicone gel breast implants to heart valves, from the market. Many experts believe that part of the problem with long-term product safety is that the FDA has no power to monitor devices once they are on the market.</p>

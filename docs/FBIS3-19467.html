			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris -- The Foreign Ministry in Paris has confirmed  that [Ambassador to Bonn Francois] Sheer had a "talk" with  [German State Secretary Dieter] Kastrup. However, this talk was  "planned" anyway because of the preparations of [German Foreign  Minister] Kinkel's official visit to Paris on 24 March, Deputy  Spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told DPA.    Concerning Bonn's claim that the ambassador had been  "summoned," the spokeswoman said: "I would not describe it that  way." She could not say, however, whether Sheer's comments to  German journalists had led to his being invited to the Ministry  "today and not yesterday or tomorrow."    She said that Sheer's comments were "informal." The  resulting reports that there is "slight distrust" between Bonn  and Paris "really do not" reflect "our attitude."    The foreign ministers of the two countries "know each other  well, often talk on the phone, and cultivate trusting  relations." This was shown over the past months during the  difficult negotiations on the GATT Agreement, on Bosnia, and on  the expansion of the European Union.    Relations with Germany are "essential" for France, and "the  basis for the stability and prosperity all over Europe." It is  important to further deepen these relations, Colonna said.</p>

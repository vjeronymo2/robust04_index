The  OECD groups the developed nations.    Argentina's entry was formalized after the signing of notes  at the OECD headquarters in Paris by OECD Secretary Jean Claude  Paye and Argentine Ambassador to France Juan Archibaldo Lanus,  thus completing the Foreign Ministry's initial negotiations.    Therefore, Argentina has become the first Latin American  country to be invited to actively participate in the OECD  Development Center, established in 1962 with the goal of  favoring an exchange of know-how among nations in order to  devise general economic policies.    The Development Center groups the democratic countries that  have more developed economies; the entry requirements include,  among others, the existence of a stable democratic system,  respect for human rights, and solid economic stability.    The Argentine ambassador to France said: "Argentina's entry  into the OECD Development Center is the result of Argentina's  change and transformation."    The OECD, described as the "Club of the Powerful," was the  successor to an organization established to administer the  Marshall Plan funds for the reconstruction of countries like  Germany and West Europe after World War II.    In a communique, the Foreign Ministry emphasized that the  document's signing "agrees with the policy implemented by the  Foreign Ministry and the government in its foreign relations,  involving Argentine withdrawal from the list of nonaligned  countries first and now entry into the OECD."    The groups Argentina was invited to join are involved in  reviewing privatizations, tax policy, and trade relations, among  other issues.</p>

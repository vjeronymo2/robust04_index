			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Company start-ups point to recovery THE NUMBER of new companies has risen sharply in one of the strongest signs yet that business activity is picking up as part of a broad-based economic recovery. The 4.9 per cent increase in company starts since the beginning of the year compared with the corresponding period last year is the first year-on-year rise in this indicator since 1989, before the recession started to bite. Company starts were up particularly strongly last month compared with May last year, a sign that entrepreneurial activity may be on the increase and banks less reluctant to lend to new businesses. In the first five months 49,056 new companies were incorporated, up from 46,721 for the equivalent period last year. In the whole of last year 107,375 companies were started, 2.5 per cent down from the previous year. The figures come from Jordans, a Bristol-based business information company. They are based on registrations at Companies House and cover the UK excluding Northern Ireland. Figures for company starts have to be interpreted carefully because they include significant numbers of 'shell' companies, which are responsible for little economic activity. Even so, the data appear to indicate that business enterprise is expanding, possibly linked to signs of an upturn in the hard-pressed property sector. In May 8,799 companies were started, 9.3 per cent up on the 8,049 recorded in the equivalent month last year. Jordans says a significant point is that the rate of year-on-year growth seems to be increasing. The total for the three months between March and May was up a healthy 7 per cent on the corresponding period last year.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Jobs: Prime victims of the recessional axe - While companies are certainly de-layering, there's little hard evidence of empowerment 'HOPE springs eternal in the human breast,' quoth Alexander Pope. And in the case of Susan Mantell of Manchester at least, there is no doubt that he was right. Ms Mantell declares herself fed up with the Jobs column's 'undue pessimism' in its writings on the Laws of Organisational Stupidity. Her charge is not against the laws themselves, which denote certain patterns of lunatic events that regularly bedevil all types of organisations everywhere. What miffs her is my claim that, while some organisations occasionally succeed in breaking the patterns, managements in general have failed to counter such idiocies. Not so], she says, and cites an example she insists is now being widely eradicated. The point she picks on is an explanation often mooted for the workings of the best known of the laws, Parkinson's First, stating: Work expands to fill the time available. The explanation is that the said phenomenon is rooted in the hunger for personal power, which psychological tests have shown to be typically pronounced in people who become managers. A time-honoured way to gain power in organisations is by empire-building, acquiring more and more subordinates. When there's not enough productive work for them to do, as is apt to be the case, they justify their position by creating unnecessary tasks for one another. Moreover such of them as lust for power also strive to acquire underlings for themselves. Hence each rank of management tends to form another rank below it, continually inserting further and successively less productive layers of supervision between the top decision-makers and the shop-floor where the work of serving the customer actually gets done. Now Susan Mantell does not deny that empire-building has been rife in the past. But she does claim that it is being reversed wholesale by the conjunction of two trendily named processes. One is 'de-layering', throwing out entire layers of management between the top bosses and the shop-floor. The other is 'em-powering' in which the power formerly held by the scrapped middle ranks is handed to the folk directly making, selling and delivering the product. Is the Jobs column too senile to have noticed same, she asks. Well, I've certainly observed the de-layering element. But it would be wrong to claim that the ranks so eliminated have in every case been those in the middle. A counter-example is to hand in Britain's local authorities. As revenues have been squeezed, many have just cut the bottom layer, hiving off services they once provided, and keeping the bureaucratic superstructure. That would not have surprised the law's originator, Professor Northcote Parkinson. After all, he pointed out that officials will find ways to keep increasingly occupied even if there is no necessary work to do. For instance, although some authorities have tried to prune the middle by encouraging people to leave voluntarily, they have thereby probably invoked the first of the two laws of organisational stupidity governing payroll cuts. Called Evans's Ejector, it states: After any voluntary redundancy exercise, the number of staff needed to achieve a given output will be larger than before. And the reduction of direct links with the consumer has no doubt reinforced another law, Schein's Syndrome: Internal politics flourish at the customer's expense as exposure to the market decreases. True, in companies which are market-dependent the de-layering has been largely in the middle, and the reverse of voluntary. Even so, while avoiding the effects of the Ejector, it has probably invoked the second law governing staff cuts. But before I state it, let's look at the sort of people most likely to have been in the scrapped middle-ranks, with the aid of the chart below. Borrowed from the American psychologist Albert Bernstein's book Neanderthals at Work (Wiley, Pounds 12.95), it summarises the characteristics of three readily recognisable types of worker. As may be seen, it suggests that middle management is mainly the province of Believers. And the likelihood that it is they who have mostly gone in the de-layering is plain from the second law on staff-cuts, Carew's Axe: In any compulsory redundancy exercise, meekness will be punished before uselessness. If so, the economies in head-counts will not necessarily work to the corporate benefit. For the Rebels below and the Competitors on top will no longer have their individual proclivities moderated by such a strong co-ordinating force of Believers who, as Dr Bernstein says, 'do - and take pride in doing - the hundred million tasks that have to be done every day'. True, the Believers can't all have been thrown out, for as he also says: 'the corporate world would collapse without them.' So the cuts in their numbers might be counteracted if companies were really accompanying the de-layering, as Ms Mantell believes, by empowering the Believers they have left. Alas I do not see much chance of that happening as long as company promotion systems go on awarding the highest posts mostly to Competitors. After all, empowerment requires bosses from the boardroom downwards to cede decision-making authority to their subordinate teams. That conflicts with the very nature of Competitors who see a good team-worker as someone who does precisely as they say. It is solely the Believers who are given to devolving authority. So little real empowerment would seem likely until companies start preferring them for the top jobs. But I can see no hard evidence that such is taking place. The only independent studies of the topic I know of - by Lynda Gratton of London Business School - show that even groups claiming to be dedicated devolvers still systematically promote Competitors to the commanding heights. Accordingly, since they are also the prime empire-builders, I cannot share Ms Mantell's faith. Far from being accompanied by empowerment, the de-layering will most probably just be followed by re-layering once the pressure on costs eases again.                           *      *      * BERNSTEIN'S THREE BASIC TYPES OF WORKER Rebels: Technically expert and often creatively hard work is enough to bring its just reward, intelligent, they're indispensable in crises. they are blind to the need to play politics, so Highly motivated to do things they like, but seldom rise beyond middle management. despise routine duties such as paperwork. They therefore rarely rise above junior rank.

But in their faith that hard work is enough to bring its just reward, they are blind to the need to play politics, so seldom rise beyond middle management.

They're quick to spot how the company system Believers: Work unstintingly and well without really works as distinct from how it's officially fuss even at tasks they dislike, and their supposed to, and manipulate it to serve their straight-dealing makes them highly motivating own ambitions regardless of the best interests managers to work for.

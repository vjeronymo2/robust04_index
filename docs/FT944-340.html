			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Allianz, Berner complete co-operation agreement Allianz, Europe's largest insurance group, has consolidated its position among the leaders in the Swiss market with the completion of a co-operation pact with Berner Holding, one of the country's top 10 non-life insurers. Berner also said the German insurer was seeking to raise its stake to 51 per cent from 31.5 per cent. The Swiss group did not oppose such a move, but said there was no agreement on how or when it would be done. Last June, Allianz revealed it had acquired the 31.5 per cent stake through stock market purchases, and was seeking a co-operation agreement. Berner, which can prevent any shareholder from exercising more than 3 per cent of the votes, said at the time that such an agreement would depend on respect for its independence and maintenance of its share listing. Yesterday, Berner said it had agreed to allow Allianz to vote its 31.5 per cent stake. It added: 'We do not see any problem with 51 per cent.' Coupled with Allianz's SFr2.2bn (Dollars 1.7bn) acquisition of Elvia in September, the Berner move catapults the German group into third position in the Swiss non-life market, after Zurich Insurance and Winterthur Insurance. In the life area, it is probably in sixth position. These moves are a dramatic example of a company exploiting the current liberalisation of European insurance markets. Until a few months ago, Allianz had only a small presence in the Swiss market, with only SFr268m in premium income last year. Although Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, it has been liberalising its market in step with EU directives. Its insurance market is large, with SFr30bn a year in premium income. The Swiss spend SFr3,000 a head annually on insurance, more than anyone else in the world. Berner said it expected to strengthen significantly its position in the Swiss market as a result of the co-operation pact. It hoped to use Allianz's international network to offer its Swiss clients better global coverage and service, and to benefit from Allianz's financial investment skills. Another potential area of co-operation is reinsurance, with Berner having access both to Allianz's own reinsurance division and to its 25 per cent-owned affiliate, Munich Reinsurance. In the Swiss non-life sector, Berner was ranked sixth last year, with premium income of SFr738.2m. Elvia was fifth with premium income of SFr1.3bn. Together, they would overtake La Baloise to occupy third position. In life, Elvia was in seventh position with premium income of SFr720m and Berner, 14th with SFr355m in premium income.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRS PUTS TAX RULE ON HOLD AFTER FIRMS COMPLAIN  </P> <P> Internal Revenue Service responded to business pressure Thursday and delayed  for two months implementing a tax rule that encourages companies to provide  health and life insurance benefits to all their workers.  </P> <P> The new deadline for implementing the so-called Section 89 rules is Dec. 1, the  IRS said.  </P> <P> Legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate that health and  accident plans and group life insurance do not favor higher-paid workers. The  original deadline of Jan. 1, 1989, had been delayed until Oct. 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Opposite Effect  </P> <P> Business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether, arguing that  it is so complex, costly and time consuming that it will drive some small  companies out of business.  </P> <P> They claim the rule is having the opposite effect intended and that companies  are dropping benefits rather than extend them to all workers.  </P> <P> Several measures affecting Section 89 are pending in Congress. One, which has  passed both the House and Senate but must be reconciled before going to  President Bush, would delay implementation until Oct. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> A second bill, passed by the House Ways and Means Committee and the full  Senate, would revamp but not rescind the rules and postpone the effective date  until Jan. 1.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PORTER RANCH REPORT MURKY  </P> <P> The report drawn up by city consultant Frank Fielding, the senior city planner  for the San Fernando Valley who was the chief instigator and promoter of the  immense, proposed Porter Ranch development, is notable for its deceptions and  obfuscations. Fielding is not exactly an unbiased objective observer.  </P> <P> On the one hand, the report claims that the largest residential and commercial  community ever to be built in Los Angeles is needed to bring a "better balance  of jobs and housing." Yet, no scientific study has been made of this argument.  Fielding admits that it would be "speculative," but nevertheless this is the  evidence he submits for "needing" the project.  </P> <P> The almost 4,000 homes would certainly not be available to the estimated 21,000  construction, clerical and retail workers. They clearly could not afford  high-priced housing.  </P> <P> Indeed, construction wage levels would not permit the purchase of expensive  homes of a half-million dollars and upward. When they have finished their jobs,  they will return to where they presently live each night after work. That is  why Fielding refuses to tell exactly how many workers will actually end up  living in Porter Ranch.  </P> <P> The results could be catastrophic!  </P> <P> ARLINE MATHEWS  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

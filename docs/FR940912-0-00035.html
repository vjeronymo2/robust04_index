			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the rule proposal, the FCA is required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 514 of the 1992 Act to ensure that the disclosure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial and conflict-of-interest information by System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel provides investors and potential investors with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information necessary to assist them in making investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions regarding FCS debt obligations or institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA believes that information on compensation of System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directors and senior officers presented in individual System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions' disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 620 of this chapter could provide useful information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors in making investment decisions. Thus, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the requirement of section 514 of the 1992 Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.20(i) requires that the report provide a statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informing investors of the availability of such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA adopts &sect;630.20(i) of the final rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Section 630.20(l) and (m)_Financial Statements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplemental Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.30(l) requires that the System prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and instructions and other requirements of the FCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;630.20(m) further requires that the System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide supplemental information in addition to the audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements and that the supplemental information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be examined by a qualified public accountant for compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with FCA regulations and guidelines and an opinion expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereon. The FCA received comments on proposed &sect;630.20(l)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the AICPA and the FCC and comments on proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.20(m) from the AICPA and Price Waterhouse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to proposed &sect;630.20(l), both the FCC and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AICPA suggested, for different reasons, that the phrase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``instructions and other requirements of the FCA'' be deleted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the proposed rule. The FCC was concerned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed language indicates that regulatory accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices (RAP) may be utilized, causing investor confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, the AICPA provided suggested language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would require both the basic financial statement and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the supplemental information required by proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.20(l) and (m) to be audited in accordance with GAAS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AICPA asserted that the requirements of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.20(m) regarding supplemental information disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear to comprise the ``instructions and other requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the FCA'' referred to in &sect;630.20(l) and, further, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GAAS addresses auditors' reporting on information presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside financial statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Price Waterhouse, the external auditor of the System,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also commented on proposed &sect;630.20(m). Price Waterhouse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asserted that the proposed language that ``supplemental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information be examined by a qualified public accountant for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with FCA regulations and guidelines'' is too broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and would be interpreted as requiring the independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accountant to render a report on the System's compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all FCA regulations and guidelines. This would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant work by the independent accountant. Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waterhouse commented that the proposed regulatory language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;630.20(m) provides insufficient detail to enable the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> external auditor to determine the scope of additional work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be performed and the type of report to be issued by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> auditor on the supplemental information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;630.20(l) was intended to preserve the FCA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to prescribe additional requirements for preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and presentation of the Systemwide combined financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements. However, after consideration of the comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received, the FCA adopts the AICPA's suggestion in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to require that both the basic financial statements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the supplemental information required by &sect;630.20(l) and (m)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be examined in accordance with GAAS and an opinion expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereon by an independent accountant. This change will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolve the FCC concern regarding RAP financial statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Price Waterhouse's concern regarding the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of supplemental information and reporting by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent accountant. However, to preserve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to revise the format and content specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A of the final rule, the FCA retains the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that supplemental information be prepared in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with any additional FCA guidance or instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Section 630.20(o)_Cross-Reference Sheet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.20(o) called for a cross-reference sheet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> giving the location of information required by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, in the order required, and identified by item  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers and captions. The FCC did not object to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of a cross-reference sheet, but suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cross-reference sheet would only be useful to the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and should only be required as an exhibit to copies of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report filed with the FCA. The FCA believes the cross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the content of the report provides useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to readers of the report. To make this indexing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement more useful to investors, the FCA has revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.20(o) to inform readers of the location in the report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the information required under the major disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> captions of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Italy ready to move step nearer to privatisation THE new Italian government's privatisation plans will overcome a big hurdle today when special shareholders' meetings of the four biggest public-sector groups approve their transformation into joint stock companies. The change in legal status is a vitalstep towards the flotation of some, or all, of the groups. The companies include IRI, Italy's biggest public-sector holding, ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals group, ENEL, the electricity generating authority, and INA, the state insurance agency. Approval for the change is not in doubt, but the focus will be on the composition of the groups' boards of directors also up for renewal. The new boards should offer a clear indication of the balance of political forces within the government over privatisation. 'You'll have to count how many old faces move out and how many new ones come in,' said a senior supporter of privatisation in the government yesterday. However, that is not a foregone conclusion. Some executives who owe their jobs to party allegiances are resisting change. The Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the two biggest parties in Mr Giuliano Amato's coalition, are also divided. Observers expect the boards to be slimmed down, giving representatives from the Treasury, now the companies' shareholder, much greater say. The board of directors of ENI, the biggest of the four, currently has 15 members. Officials expect the current, politically appointed, chairmen of the four companies to be reconfirmed. However, it is thought the mandates of the four  -Mr Franco Nobili at IRI, Mr Gabriele Cagliari at ENI, Mr Franco Viezzoli at ENEL, and Mr Lorenzo Pallesi at INA - may be cut from their present multi-year terms. Their powers may also be curtailed. Once the assemblies are over, bankers expect little movement on privatisation until October, by which time a six-member committee of bankers and economists, set up by the Treasury last week, will have presented its findings. The government has already indicated its willingness to float more than 49 per cent of public-sector companies' shares - a virtually impassable barrier in the past. Flotation of IRI's Finmeccanica subsidiary and ENI's Agip and Snam operations is due to go ahead as planned later this year. Ministers are considering sending a much stronger signal to the markets, possibly by disposing of the government's controlling stake in a prestigious state-owned bank. The positive economic effects of last week's labour accord week could push Italian interest rates down another 2.5 percentage points by the end of this year, according to Mr Sergio D'Antoni, general secretary of the CISL union, AP-DJ reports from Milan. He said such a drop would shave some L40 trillion (million million) of interest payments off the government's budget deficit.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ON WEEKEND TV  </P> <P> The World Series will share the sports television spotlight with Bo Jackson's  1990 National Football League debut and the annual installment of what has  become one of college football's most heated rivalries: Miami vs. Notre Dame.  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Reds, who went into Friday's Game 3 with a 2-0 lead over the  Oakland Athletics, are in position to complete one of the biggest upsets in  World Series history when coverage of Game 4 begins at 5 p.m. on Channels 2 and  8, with the first pitch coming at 5:24. The telecast of Sunday's Game 5, if  necessary, also starts at 5 p.m., with the first pitch at 5:37.  </P> <P> The Raiders, tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC (5-1)  and who lead the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC West by one game, add Bo Jackson  to the backfield Sunday against the San Diego Chargers (2-4) (1 p.m., Channels  4, 36 and 39). In his limited NFL career, Jackson has rushed for 212 yards in  three games against the Chargers, including 103 yards last season.  </P> <P> With the Rams failing to sell out 72 hours in advance of Sunday's game against  the Atlanta Falcons at Anaheim Stadium, Channels 2 and 8 will air the  Philadelphia Eagles-Washington Redskins game at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The only other NFL game to be shown by a Southland station matches the Denver  Broncos and Indianapolis Colts on KMIR Channel 36 in Palm Springs. That game,  which also marks the return of running back Eric Dickerson to the Colts, begins  at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> There will be no Sunday night game on TNT. The NFL and TNT did not want to  compete against the World Series for viewers.  </P> <P> In college football, today's premiere attraction is the final game of the  often-contentious Miami-Notre Dame series, 12:30 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8.  (SportsChannel will air a replay at 10:30 p.m.)  </P> <P> In other telecasts involving teams ranked in the Top 25 by The Associated  Press, No. 22 Iowa faces No. 10 Michigan (9:30 a.m. ESPN); Arkansas visits No.  19 Texas (10 a.m. Prime Ticket); No. 13 Washington takes on Stanford (12:30  p.m., Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42); No. 3 Tennessee hosts Alabama (1 p.m., ESPN)  and No. 7 Florida State meets No. 5 Auburn (4:30 p.m. ESPN).  </P> <P> Three games involving Southland teams will also get television exposure. No. 15  USC tries to keep its Rose Bowl hopes alive against Arizona at 3:30 p.m. on  Prime Ticket, KADY Channel 63 airs the Cal Lutheran-La Verne game at 1:30 p.m.  while Cal State Long Beach challenges perennial Big West Conference power  Fresno State at 7 p.m. on SportsChannel.

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (1): Farewell to sweat-shops - A rapidly rising proportion of electronic equipment is now manufactured on behalf of the big international suppliers by outside contractors. Paul Taylor probes the reasons for the emergence of this expanding force within one of the world's predominant industries CONTRACT electronics manufacturing (CEM) has become the fastest growing sector of the European electronics industry and is on target to become a Dollars 22bn global business by the mid-1990s. In the UK a group of dedicated contract electronics manufacturers have successfully shaken off the second-rate 'sweat-shop' image of sub-contract and assembly work in the 1960s by investing heavily in advanced production and test equipment, training and quality processes. Today their big customers are blue chip multinationals such as IBM, Sony, Bosch, Motorola, AEG, and Matsushita which require fast response times, flexibility and first class quality, as well as cost-effective manufacturing. These companies are using contract manufacturers as part of their global strategies to maintain and improve international competitiveness. From humble beginnings the UK industry has entered what Mr Bruce Armstrong, managing director of SCI Europe, describes as its third phase - strategic global partnerships between OEMs and contract manufacturers which can provide full turnkey services from design and printed circuit board layout, through to product distribution. A handful of factors have fuelled the growth in CEM over the past decade. In particular, the pace of technological change has resulted in shortened product life cycles requiring increased manufacturing flexibility and worldwide manufacturing capability. In order to remain competitive in fast moving consumer-led markets companies have had to reduce the period it takes to bring new products to market. At the same time electronic controls are replacing electro-mechanical devices in many consumer products such as cars and medical equipment whose manufacturers have little or no electronics manufacturing experience or capacity. Meanwhile, the continuing push for smaller, more portable but more sophisticated products such as mobile phones and notebook computers requires greater silicon integration and results in more complex devices. These are best manufactured using advanced techniques for placing components on printed circuit boards such as surface mount technology which require expensive specialist machinery and expertise to design, assemble and test and which involve considerable 'manufacturing risk' because of market volatility. The trend towards CEM also mirrors the move towards buying in a wide range of service and other peripheral corporate functions, backed by the management theory that organisations should focus on their 'core competencies' and contract out every thing else - creating what some observers have called 'the virtual corporation'. Recessionary pressures have forced some managements to reconsider the 'make or buy' decision. But generally, although contract manufacturing can result in cost savings, most participants argue this should not be the primary motivation. The arrival of the single European market has encouraged many Japanese and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to set up locally in Europe. As MHM, a market research organisation based in Ayr, Scotland, noted in its latest study of the European CEM market, business from these companies 'has fuelled spectacular expansion in at least one CEM house'. MHM describes the growth of the UK market in the 1980s as 'spectacular'. The turnover of the six largest sub-contract companies in the UK, SCI, Race, Avex, AB, Philips, Welwyn and Timex, grew by an average 42 per cent per year between 1984 and 1990. Growth has slowed considerably since then, in part reflecting the recession and the sharp price war in the computer and IT sector which accounts for a still large, but declining, proportion of the CEM industry order book - a trend which has been partly offset by increased demand from new customers in the automotive, telecommunications and industrial sectors. According to the Association of Contract Electronics Manufacturers (ACeM), part of the Electronic Components Industry Federation (ECIF), formed in 1990 to provide a voice for the emerging industry, the overall UK market was worth about Pounds 550m last year, and is growing at an underlying annual rate of 10-15 per cent. ACeM membership now totals 48 contractors representing 70-80 per cent of the UK CEM industry which, despite being capital intensive, employs around 10,000 people. 'Rapid growth over the last 10 years has resulted in a fragmented industry expanding on the back of a rapidly expanding electronics industry,' said Mr Eric Luckwell, chairman of Datalink Services, a small Loughborough-based CEM, in a study of the UK market. 'The capability of these organisations ranges from the very high volume and complex technological process, such as surface mount technology and automatic component insertion, to the very low volume and simple labour intensive processes,' he said. Mr Derek Duffett, ACeM director, groups the UK CEM market into four groups. Large companies dedicated to contract electronics include SCI and Avex, Scottish subsidiaries of US groups, which are also multinationals in their own right and whose main business is high volume, low margin work for big OEMs. Their particular strengths are their capacity, sophisticated automated manufacturing systems, substantial component purchasing power and worldwide facilities. 'Our customers are global, so are we,' says Carol Brannigan, Avex Electronic's European sales and marketing director and chairman of ACeM's Promotions Committee. 'European customers and global companies operating in Europe are telling us they need total product life cycle management services not just PCB assembly and test,' she says. In response big CEMs are building what she calls 'a transparent or seamless partnership' linking CEM and customer using electronic data interchange (EDI), integrated MRP (Materials Requirement Planning) systems, CAD/CAM design systems and electronic mail. Medium-sized dedicated CEMs are the second group. These generally maintain close links with OEM design houses working in specialist applications areas, such as the industrial and professional markets. Almost half of ACeM's membership falls into this category with most companies employing between 100 and 500 people. They include Welwyn Systems, the contract electronics subsidiary of the TT Group which also acquired AB Contract Electronics last year, and Race Electronics. Small start-up companies, the third group, emphasise their flexibility and personalised service, particularly to entrepreneurial businesses which may want prototypes built and tested or require low to medium manufacturing volumes. The in-house contracting departments of original equipment manufacturers. These units have been created to fill spare capacity or diversify into new areas. Established players include Philips Circuit assemblies and Rank-Xerox Manufacturing Services. These companies often have access to specialised environmental and test equipment in design and failure analysis. Recently they have been joined by other OEMs with excess capacity which, together with the arrival in Europe of new Far East competitors such as Flextronics, is causing concern in an industry which arguably already has excess capacity and thin margins. 'Presently the CEM industry can stand the additional capacity better than many other mature electronics sectors,' said the MHM report, 'but this situation will not continue indefinitely.' An industry shake-out and reorganisation is widely expected amid forecasts that the industry will become increasingly polarised between the high volume, low margin multinational CEMs, and the much smaller niche companies. Mr Gordon Stewart, UK director of specialist management consultants Pittiglio Rabin Todd &amp; McGrath, told an ACeM conference in October that the dominant feature of the CEM industry in the 1990s will be the performance gap between an emerging super- league of multinational manufacturers and a horde of increasingly marginalised smaller competitors. Because the UK market is maturing most of the large CEMs are adopting the twin strategies of trying to win back business which has gone offshore, particularly to the Far East, while also expanding overseas themselves. Armed with internationally accepted quality assurance standards and total quality management programmes the UK's leading CEMs have been stressing the importance of looking at total costs - including loss of flexibility and transport delays - in their attempts to win back offshore business, and have been having some success. They are also helped by the increasingly capital intensive nature of the business, which means that labour cost differentials are growing less important. However, they are handicapped by the prevailing duty and tariff structure which provides a significant incentive to import printed circuit boards or fully built equipment, which are mostly subject to a 4.5 per cent tariff, rather than semiconductors and other components which are generally subject to a 14 per cent tariff. The ACeM has begun to campaign for a more even playing field, arguing that a tariff change could help generate thousands of manufacturing jobs in the UK. At the same time some CEMs have begun to establish footholds on the continent. The UK CEM market is considerably more developed than most of its European counter parts. The Germany market in particular is expected to grow rapidly and, together with France, is attracting attention. Overall the European CEM market is reckoned to be worth about Dollars 6bn - which still leaves OEMs undertaking the vast majority of electronics manufacturing in-house. Despite their growth contract manufacturers have still only captured a fraction of the potential European market. Arguably, of all the changes in the electronics industry over the past decade, the one that has gone most unnoticed, has been the emergence of quality contract electronics manufacturers. That is now changing.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMPANION CALLED TRIGGERMAN;  </P> <P> 1 ACCUSED OF KILLING MIGRANTS DENIES GUILT  </P> <P> One of two San Diego men arrested last week and charged with the possible  hate-crime slayings of two Mexican farm workers pleaded not guilty Monday.  </P> <P> The two alleged killers were characterized as "aspiring Rambos" by A. David  Stutz, the San Diego County deputy district attorney prosecuting the case.  </P> <P> "There has been some indication that they were going out and ridding San Diego  County of anyone with darker skin than theirs," Stutz said in a telephone  interview.  </P> <P> The two victims were shot a number of times Nov. 9 with a South Korean-made  semiautomatic assault weapon, said San Diego police, who said they recovered  the weapon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reportedly Boasted of Crime  </P> <P> After committing the killings, officials said, the two boasted about the crime  to friends and acquaintances. However, San Diego Police Sgt. Frank Martinez  said one of the two, Dennis Bencivenga, 19, of San Diego, who entered the  not-guilty plea Monday, apparently felt remorse later and reported the incident  to police, leading to the arrests last week.  </P> <P> Police and the district attorney's office said there was no evidence that  either man was affiliated with any white supremacy hate group, such as the  Skinheads, who have been active in the San Diego area.  </P> <P> Until Bencivenga came forward Jan. 13, police said, the investigation of the  slayings had been stalled. In statements to police, Bencivenga said he did not  at first think his friend, Kenneth Kovzelove, would actually follow through on  threats to shoot and kill some "Mexicans," according to a police affidavit on  file in San Diego Municipal Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Talked About Killing People'  </P> <P> Bencivenga told police that he was behind the wheel of a pickup while  Kovzelove, 17, fired the shots that killed the two migrants, according to the  affidavit. Kovzelove, who pulled his shirt over his face as he committed the  crime, fired from the bed of the pickup, the document states.  </P> <P> "Kovzelove had talked about killing people before, but Bencivenga thought it  was just because he was going into the Army," stated the affidavit, which is  signed by police Officer P. A. Ruffner.  </P> <P> The two had driven to the site after Kovzelove had talked about robbing some  "Mexicans" in the area, according to the affidavit. Bencivenga said he was  going to ask his companion for a loan if he managed to obtain some money,  according to the affidavit.  </P> <P> The two victims, who died at the scene, were found with more than $300 in their  possession, according to the deputy district attorney. The suspects drove off  shortly after the killings when they noticed other vehicles approaching,  Martinez said.  </P> <P> "It's unclear if they intended to kill and then rob," said Stutz, the deputy  district attorney. "All that's clear is that they killed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrested in Georgia  </P> <P> Kovzelove, who is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail, was arrested Thursday at  Ft. Benning, Ga., where he was in training as an Army paratrooper. He was  scheduled to be arraigned today in Juvenile Court in San Diego. Prosecutors  intend to seek court permission to try Kovzelove as an adult.  </P> <P> "If he's old enough to fight for his country, he can be tried in adult court,"  Stutz said.  </P> <P> However, Stutz said that, because Kovzelove is a minor, prosecutors are  prevented by state law from using a "special circumstances" sentencing  argument, which is necessary for a death penalty. It is also unlikely that the  death penalty will be sought for Bencivenga, said the prosecutor, who noted  that the older suspect helped break the case by coming forward.  </P> <P> Bencivenga, who is being held on $250,000 bail, entered his not-guilty plea  before San Diego Municipal Court Judge Patricia A. Y. Cowett.  </P> <P> The two victims -- Hilario Casteneda Salgado, 22, and Matilde Macedo de la  Sancha, 19 -- were killed along an isolated stretch of Black Mountain Road in a  rural area near San Diego's northern city limits. They were shot a total of 11  times, according to police. Both were legal residents of the United States,  possibly having qualified for legal residence under the farm-worker amnesty  program, according to Stutz. Both are believed to have lived in migrant camps  near the slaying site, police said.  </P></p>

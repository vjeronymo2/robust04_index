			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Property hopes lifted by Pounds 106m City sale One of the City's best-known office blocks, home to Deutsche Bank and Baring Brothers, has been bought by a German investment institution for Pounds 106m in one of the biggest commercial property sales. The sale has been concluded as the London Business School has forecast a sharp rise in the value of commercial buildings over the next two years - reversing a large part of the decline in property values between 1990-93. The 145,000 sq ft building at 6-8 Bishopsgate has been sold by Electricity Supply Nominees, the electricity industry pension fund, to Deutsche Immobilien Fonds (DIFA) - one of the largest German investment funds. It marks the latest in a series of property purchases by German institutions. Other acquisitions by DIFA have included 12-15 Finsbury Circus, let to the Bank of Tokyo, and St Andrew's House, let to accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. DTZ Debenham Thorpe, which advised DIFA, said that the desire of German institutions to acquire UK property had not been diminished by rising bond yields which had affected the appetite of some UK institutions. Further rises in UK property values following last year's gains are expected, according to the London Business School which estimates that capital values will increase by 18 per cent this year and by a further 7 per cent in 1995. The forecasts, sponsored by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, are based on about 1,500 UK buildings, owned by 45 investment institutions. Commercial values according to the institution rose by 6 per cent last year with most of the increase coming at the end of the year. This follows a fall of 25 per cent between the third quarter of 1989 and the third quarter of last year. Mr Richard Lay, RICS commercial property spokesman, said: 'It is pleasing to see that the growing confidence in the property market is supported by this detailed forecast. However, a true recovery in the commercial property market will not come about until there is a sustained recovery in confidence in the business sector which will, in turn, lead to an increase in the take up of space across the country.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariya Barutchieva] </F>   [Text] Sofia, May 3 (BTA) -- Bulgaria will close a  favourable deal on its debt to the London Club of commercial  banks, both in terms of prices and time, Finance Minister Stoyan  Aleksandrov said upon his return from Paris today. The minister  over the second half of April made a tour of six world finance  centres (Frankfurt, Vienna, Rome, Tokyo, New York, and Paris) to  present the deal on Bulgaria's commercial debt and prospects for  debt-for-equity swaps. Mr. Aleksandrov said many creditors  accepted Bulgaria's proposal to repurchase at least 20 percent  of its foreign debt or about $1.5 billion. In March the  Bulgarian side suggested a price of 25 cents per dollar in  foreign debt. The debt-for-equity and repurchase options are  aimed to halve this country's $8.7 billion debt to the London  Club.    Finance Minister Aleksandrov described as "very interesting"  the World Bank's and the International Monetary Fund's (IMF)  willingness to provide additional financing for the whole amount  to be repurchased. Beside amounts agreed, these two  institutions pledged an additional $255 million ($130 million  from the World Bank and $125 million from the IMF) just for the  commercial debt deal. This means there would be no ceiling for  the amount to be repurchased, said the Finance Minister.  According to IMF estimates, this country needs some $900  million for the deal (for the collateral and repurchase). $400  million are needed only for repurchasing the amount already  negotiated.    Finance Minister Aleksandrov voiced a regret that the  Bulgarian side has failed to meet the net bank assets  requirement in the standby agreement with the IMF. According to  Mr. Aleksandrov, this raises doubts about the June 30, 1994,  deadline for the conclusion of the deal. The finance minister  said talks on the finalization of the deal would "make no sense"  unless Parliament amends the Privatization Act or passes a  bankruptcy law by June 30.    According to him, Bulgaria can ensure the deal's conclusion  in several ways; one option is to use $200 million from the  state reserves, which, within a short period of time (a couple  of months), should not heighten tension on the forex market.  Many financial institutions have offered support. Thus Meryll  Lynch seems willing to agree to finance the deal at a 3-percent  annual interest for three months, which the finance minister  sees as very favourable terms.    As to which bank should act as a foreign debt agent,  Aleksandrov thinks it should be the central Bulgarian National  Bank, as it has reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal  Reserve Board for the American side to buy the collateral.    High interest was shown in debt-for-equity swaps. The  finance minister said that it would be possible to use foreign  debt bonds as an instrument of payment in the privatization of  enterprises up for sale, and in the opening of privatization  procedures for companies, which have drawn investor interest.  Thus, French companies have displayed interest in 30 to 40  Bulgarian companies in the foods and tourist industries and  Meryll Lynch and Salomon Brothers in large investment in the  energy sector and telecommunications. Large infrastructure  units such as airports, ports, roads, etc., have also attracted  attention. The Bulgarian side suggested that creditors consider  medium-size, export-oriented and slow-asset [as received]  companies and large corporate taxpayers, said Reneta Indzhova,  Privatization Agency boss who accompanied the finance minister  on his tour. According to Indzhova, a major obstacle is the  lack of Council of Ministers regulation of the way to make  foreign debt payments through bonds. I count on this option to  give a strong boost to privatization, Indzhova said.    According to Minister Aleksandrov, the deal now depends on  home policy and the economy's performance. He said he would not  act as a stooge for any political force. According to him, the  latest developments in Bulgaria have had negative repercussions,  which transpired in the cancellation of an European Union  mission visit. This spells a delay in pledged EU financing,  Aleksandrov said.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: CMB warns of fall in first-half profits CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Anglo-French packaging group, yesterday warned of a fall in net profits for the first half of this year due to adverse exchange rates and difficult market conditions. CMB, which is the leading player in European packaging, said that sales fell by 6 per cent to FFr11.89bn (Dollars 2bn) in the first half of this year, down from FFr12.63bn. Interim profits were likely to fall at a similar rate. This would bring the net figure down to around FFr518m from FFr549m. The profits warning follows a reshuffle among CMB's shareholders. MB-Caradon, the UK building products group, this spring sold its 25.3 per cent stake in CMB for FFr3.91bn to a consortium of existing investors. The consortium included CGIP, the French holding company, which increased its initial 25.3 per cent holding in CMB by 7 per cent. CMB said trading had been difficult throughout the first half with a deterioration in performance in Spain and Germany during the second quarter. The only European market to show signs of improvement in the second quarter was the UK. CMB yesterday said that conditions had improved in Asia, Africa and the US, but there was no sign of recovery in Europe. The group has also been badly affected by changes in exchange rates since the September currency crisis. It estimated that currency movements depressed its sales by 7.5 per cent in the first half, although it did receive a 3.4 per cent boost from acquisitions. The prospect of a weaker franc following this weekend's crisis reform of the ERM should alleviate the currency problem. Last year, CMB reported a 15 per cent increase in net profits to FFr976m on turnover of FFr24.83bn.</p>

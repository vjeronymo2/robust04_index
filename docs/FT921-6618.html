			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Chinese anger at US move on MFN CHINA yesterday angrily rejected a US Senate bill attaching conditions to renewal of China's preferential trade status with the United States, warning it would harm relations, Reuter and our foreign staff report. 'The bill violates the principle of mutual benefit of bilateral trade, and the Chinese side rejects this and will never accept it,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on national radio. 'This kind of conditionality will harm bilateral trade and diplomatic relations.' Both countries yesterday gave conflicting accounts of progress made between them in talks in Beijing. The Chinese press said progress had been made on a number of specific issues. However, Mr Joseph Massey, assistant US trade representative, told a press conference in Beijing that 'we made no specific progress in terms of a document or set of commitments to advance the talks beyond where we have been.' Mr Massey said the differences between the two sides were substantial, with the US calling for profound changes in practices, policies and regulations governing trade in China, many of which remain secret. The Senate on Tuesday approved a bill linking renewal of China's Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status to improvements in Beijing's record on human rights, trade and missile proliferation. Washington first granted China MFN status in 1980 and it has been renewed on a year-by-year basis since then. The vote marks the opening shot in what is likely to be a period of aggressive exchanges between China and the US as the deadline for renewal of MFN status approaches on July 3. It also marks the end of a brief period of calm in US-China trade relations.</p>

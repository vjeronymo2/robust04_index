			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / People: Pattisson's long-standing relationship with Allders Allders, the department store and duty free retail group which is planning a flotation in the next few weeks, has appointed John Pattisson as a non-executive director. Pattisson has a long-standing relationship with the retailer - expected to be capitalised at around Pounds 150m - since he was an executive director of Hanson from which Allders' management bought the business in 1989. Hanson acquired Allders as part of its purchase of UDS in 1983. Harvey Lipsith, Allders' chief executive, says that Pattisson's experience as a public company director and his 'considerable knowledge of working in the City' would be helpful to Allders, as well as his knowledge of the company. Pattisson's involvement with the Anglo-American conglomerate pre-dates Lord Hanson himself since he was a director of Wiles, the fertiliser and grain sack leasing group which later became Hanson, when Wiles first raised money in the City in 1960. Pattisson stayed with Hanson as a non-executive director after it went public in 1964, leaving in the early 1970s when he worked at Dawnay Day, a small bank which was taken over by Jacob Rothschild in 1980. He rejoined Hanson as an executive director in 1981 and stayed for 10 years handling merger and acquisition matters and dealing with the City. Now 62, he is chairman of Imperial Group Pension Trust, the pension fund of Hanson's tobacco business, and is a non-executive director of Wassall, another conglomerate run by ex-Hanson executives, in which Hanson has a small stake. Lipsith says Paul Brooks, one of the group's non-executive directors, who represents one of its venture capital backers, is expected to resign at the time of the flotation. The chairman Lord Prior and the two other non-executives will stay.</p>

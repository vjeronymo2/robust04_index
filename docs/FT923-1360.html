			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (8): Carter's heavenly pennies  -Barbara Harrison discovers a rich Atlanta - and a poor one, too MR JIMMY CARTER, the former US president, has become known in the 12 years since he left the Oval Office for doing good works. Many of the most notable of these have been international. But now he is turning his considerable energy and prestige to the city of Atlanta. Almost a year ago, Mr Carter called for the creation of The Atlanta Project, a non-profit, public and private initiative that aims to alleviate the pain of poverty and its associated ills, including drugs, crime, juvenile delinquency, violence, homelessness and despair. While the Atlanta Project intends to confront American society's most intractable problems, Mr Carter seems undaunted. He believes that with some donated resources and considerable volunteer effort, measurable progress toward resolving these problems can be made and a sense of community can be restored. And while some have called the project Quixotic, he has inspired many others to believe in it. The Atlanta Project, which is expected to be launched formally on October 1, Mr Carter's birthday, now has some 100,000 applications from volunteers and over Dollars 11m in cash pledges from corporations and individuals. According to Mr Dan Sweat, the co-ordinator of the project, a new fund-raising drive next month is expected to raise the remainder of the project's five-year cash needs of Dollars 18.5m. Many more donations have been made through 'in kind' goods and services, including those of Mr Sweat, president of the CF Foundation, and other corporate executives who are on loan. Mr Sweat and others run the project out of the Carter Center, which houses the former president's library and various other international projects in which he is involved. As a measure of the project's popular support, it expects to raise some Dollars 100,000 through a campaign called 'Pennies from Heaven' using canisters to collect the coins. The project's plan of attack is to undertake specific projects for the worst problems in 20 of Atlanta's poorest neighbourhoods. In each of the 20 'clusters', as they are known, local neighbourhood activists will direct volunteers and draw neighbourhood residents into the project as participants. Mr Sweat says Mr Carter's appeal for the project has struck a nerve. 'That nerve has to do with the sense of hopelessness, frustration and despair which has been building in the people of America for a number of years.' He also says that, while it is possibly a less noble motive, many in the business community are concerned about how Atlanta will look to the world when it is in the spotlight of the Olympics in 1996. Indeed, it would be impossible to try to hide the city's social problems during the Olympics, particularly because some Olympic installations will be in some of the poorest neighbourhoods. 'We are going to be judged in this city - not by how well we stage the Olympic Games, but by what's being done for the poor,' says Mr Sweat. While Atlanta has gained fame in recent years as a top business relocation choice and one of America's most liveable cities, it has a stunning amount of poverty and crime threaded in between its glistening towers. The city has a higher proportion of families with incomes below 50 per cent of the average national poverty level than any other city in the US except Newark, New Jersey. Georgia ranks as the top state in the nation for infant mortality and 17 per cent of the newborns at the downtown Grady Hospital are born to mothers who use cocaine. While nearly 12 per cent of the public housing units remain vacant, Atlanta has between 12,000 and 15,000 homeless. Atlanta is one of the highest crime rate cities in the US and in the past five years juvenile drug cases have risen by 1,700 per cent in Fulton County (where the city is located). These are some of the reasons why Mr Carter talks about two Atlantas, a rich one and a poor one. It is these two Atlantas which he wants to bring together through his project. The former president, who volunteers a week of his time every year to build houses for the poor with the Habitat for Humanity organisation, says that if the social divide between rich and poor Atlantans can be bridged, personal contact will melt fears and resentments and build compassion, understanding and ties between neighbours. His only fear of failure for the project, he says, is the failure to try. Yet critics say that the project has raised expectations so high that it cannot possibly fulfil them. If it works, however, Mr Carter hopes it will become a model for other cities around the country.</p>

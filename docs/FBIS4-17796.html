			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 27) TURAN--Yesterday President Aliyev  signed the programme of privatization for 1994, which further  was sent to the discussion of the Parliament.    The draft of the programme was prepared by the Committee for  Property.    "The programme stipulates that approximately 8,000 objects  of  trade, public utilities, enterprises and non-completed  constructions will be privatized," specialist of the State  Committee for Property, Mamedrasul Bilalov, told TURAN's  correspondent.    During privatisation the preference will be given to  employees of this or that enterprise. Only if the employees  refuse to purchase their enterprise, the latter can be sold  through the auctions.    "Each Azeri citizen irrespective of age will have special  account in bank totalling 5,000 manats. These means can be used  only during privatisation and for purchasing of shares. Index  system will be used to protect these means from inflation," said  Bagirov.</p>

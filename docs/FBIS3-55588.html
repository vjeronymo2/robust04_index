A  draft agreement to this effect was signed by the Russian and  Chechen Defence Ministries, the CHECHENPRESS news agency said.    Colonel Musa Merzhuyev, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's  representative in the republic's Armed Forces main staff, said  that under the agreement Russia will provide the Chechen Army  with arms, equipment and ammunition, ensure their servicing and  maintenance at its plants and train officers. It has also  pledged not to use its Armed Forces against the Chechen Republic.    In turn, the Chechen Republic will participate in the joint  defence system to repel possible aggressions and provide its air  bases to Russian Air Force units in wartime. Additionally, it  will take part in joint military manoeuvres and war games and  will not join any military alliances or blocs aimed against  Russia.    The draft agreement also stipulates that in peacetime the  Chechen Republic will have an army not bigger than 1.5 per cent  of its population.</p>

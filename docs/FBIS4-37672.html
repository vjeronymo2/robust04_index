			<p>BFN     [Text] State President Liamine Zeroual received at his  office at the presidency this morning Abdelkader Bensalah,  chairman of the Transitional National Council [TNC], and his six  deputies. The meeting was attended by Mohamed Betchine,  minister adviser to the state president, and Youcef Khatib,  adviser to the state president.    During a brief address at the meeting, the state president  dwelt upon the importance of the TNC as an institution where all  affiliations and viewpoints can meet and as a platform for  democratic debate. He pointed out the great tasks facing the TNC  which should ensure that the principles of the National Concord  [document] are respected.    The head of state added that the members of the TNC bureau  should try and enhance the government's agenda. It should also,  given the fact that it is representative of all society's  strata, supervise, guarantee, and follow up the concerns of all  classes of the society. We will be encouraging you to do so, the  head of state affirmed.    Concerning the absence of some parties from the TNC, the  head  of state pointed out that this should not mean that they are  excluded from the management of the country's affairs. The  latter is facing a very difficult period in its history and  therefore it needs all its sincere sons to rebuild Algeria upon  sound bases which will meet the country's higher interest.</p>

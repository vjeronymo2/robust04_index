			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Less a honeymoon, more a new affair: The altered relationship between media and president IT IS still not quite clear who first claimed in print or on the air that President Bill Clinton's national honeymoon was over and his presidency damaged beyond repair. It probably happened before he even took office. It certainly has been the substance of many column inches and words since. Yet, suddenly, in the past 72 hours, the great American media have begun to have second thoughts. Not to the point of redeifying Mr Clinton, let alone his wife, but of wondering, even in a week when Dallas crushed Buffalo in the football Super Bowl, whether every political issue has to have an irrevocable winner and loser. In a remarkable exercise in media self-criticism, Jonathan Alter, the Newsweek magazine columnist, offered an exquisite and entirely accurate summary of the overall thrust of the reporting of what, in his view, is now a 'manic depressive' journalistic culture. 'He was a hero on election day, a goat during his early disorganised transition, a hero at the Little Rock economic conference, a goat during the week before taking office, a hero at the inauguration, a goat during the fights over Zoe Baird and gays in the military. In each case there may have been sound reasons to reach those judgments but little acknowledgment of their evanescence.' RW Apple, the veteran Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, a man not disposed to instant judgments unless on food and wine, suspects that it is more an awakened public than the media which is ringing the changes. 'A host of factors, including weakened political parties, wider coverage of governmental activities on cable television, the proliferation of pressure groups, the advent of radio and television call-in shows and a popular mood of scepticism and discontent reflected in the candidacy of Ross Perot, have repeat-edly combined to prove the capital's conventional wisdom unwise.' Some are totally disdainful both of their own profession and the tendency towards participatory democracy. George Will, the conservative pundit who would have been at home in Plato's Republic, allows his lips to curl on television when he talks of the US as 'a plebiscatory' in which there will soon be no point in sending members to Congress. It is undeniable that Mr Clinton and the media are experiencing a rocky early relationship. Generalised factors include a media perception that he was given too easy a ride in the election (the president would disagree), that he is de facto green because he is actually younger than many of the media doyens, and the suspicion - not without foundation - that he does not like the press (few politicians do these days). Relations with the White House press corps are particularly fractious. This is normal, because the job of White House correspondent, with long hours, minimal freedom of movement and dependence on photo opportunities and whatever information is doled out, is nothing like as glamorous as it sounds. The main consolation is guaranteed air time and the front page, with inevitable emphasis on well turned soundbites and snappy judgments. George Stephanopoulos, the principal spokesman, has not always been sensitive to this bear garden in the first two weeks. Operating erratically on Clinton Standard Time, restricting access to some offices and occasionally being a little too smart for his own good, he has invited criticism not just of himself but of his president. But Mr Apple's broader point about new pressure points may be more important in the longer run. Last year's election campaign demonstrated that the established media had lost its monopoly of the dissemination of political information and analysis, as candidates by the dozen took to the talk and call-in shows (many featuring, it might be said, establishment journalists like Mr Will). The first sign that Ms Baird's employment of illegal immigrants might jeopardise her nomination to be attorney general surfaced on the talk shows around the country. In Washington, where the Clinton transition was partly operating, it appeared a minor matter and the Senate judiciary committee gave her an initial warm welcome. When mounting public criticism reached even the capital's radio stations, she was gone. But the new genre has a short attention span and Ms Baird now seems but an historical footnote. The latest focus has been on homosexuals in the military, and this time the evidence was of orchestration by well-organised pressure groups, mostly on the religious right. Some popular talk show hosts, like Rush Limbaugh, a ferocious conservative, needed no stoking. There is nothing new in this - ever since the Pony Express, congressmen and presidents have been intermittently deluged with mail from distant quarters. But there may be a new unwillingness on the part of elected representatives, Mr Clinton included, to disregard the voices of the people in the Perotian age. Not that all are uninformed. The audiences that CNN and C-Span, the cable channels, command may look small in the ratings but they seem to pull weight. C-Span is turning out to be something of a national phenomenon. Still mostly set up to air, without adornment, debates in Congress, it has expanded into viewer call-ins and the sort of serious discussion programmes and seminars on government affairs that was thought would only appeal to political groupies. There are more of these aficionados than might be expected. Your correspondent's one appearance on C-Span, not exactly a knockabout pre-recorded discussion on foreign affairs, resulted in more calls from around the country than anything written for the FT in the past 26 years. It would probably, therefore, be as misleading to rush into premature judgment on the new media as the media is to rush into premature judgment on the new president. As Republican Senator Robert Dole said this week: 'It's a long road and he's only had a bumpy beginning.' Or, as Jonathan Alter observed: 'What goes down must come up. And down and up and down and up until we're all dizzy.'</p>

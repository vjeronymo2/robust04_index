			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / People: Another good man - but will he last? Ask any cross-section of analysts to nominate the toughest big company chief executive job in Australia, writes Bruce Jacques, and chances are that Goodman Fielder, the country's largest food group, will outpoll all comers. So, when long-serving Goodman executive Barry Weir was promoted to the managing director's post last week, it's scarcely surprising that investors were underwhelmed. They've seen it too many times before. Goodman has chewed up three chief executives in the past half decade, culminating in last week's passing of the high-profile former Elders executive, Michael Nugent. Weir now has the task of improving the sluggish performance of the unwieldy Goodman conglomerate whose structure remains a legacy of 1980s boom time extravagance. But he should be well equipped for the task. For a start, he's a survivor. In his 17 years with Goodman, 58-year-old Weir has seen all manner of management crises and worked in most parts of the business. He won the chief executive's post by successfully expanding Goodman's European operations, based around its Wessanen business, which have grown under his stewardship to account for 25 per cent of the total business. As a tested, long-term executive, Weir has a reputation as a team player who is likely to improve shattered morale by redeveloping old-fashioned camaraderie among his top executive team. But Weir will get no honeymoon from the markets. Goodman's record of high management turnover plus his age already have analysts calling him an interim chief, 'just keeping the seat warm while the head-hunters find a more high-powered candidate'. Against that, the Goodman board is likely to be keen on stability at the top after its recent experience.</p>

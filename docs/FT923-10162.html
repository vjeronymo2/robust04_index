			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Bulk fears may put Runcorn on the spot REACTION TO the ICI announcement ranged from enthusiasm to fear yesterday, depending on who was involved, where they were based, or what business they were in. Mr David Collins, economic development officer for Cheshire County, said: 'We have very mixed feelings.' ICI employs about 6,000 people in Cheshire but they are split between pharmaceuticals and bulk chemicals. The pharmaceuticals business has its world headquarters in Alderley Edge, near Wilmslow in the prosperous eastern half of Cheshire. Its future, already assured, will be strengthened by its leading role in the new ICI Bio. However, Cheshire also houses the core of the old ICI Mond division at Runcorn on the south bank of the Mersey facing Widnes, in the poorer western half of the county. Chlorine manufacture at Runcorn is already under pressure from environmentalists, following leaks of gases and concern over pollution of the Mersey, while ICI has also warned recently that the rising cost of power may force closure anyway. At Cheshire county hall yesterday, the implications of Runcorn not having pharmaceuticals to lean on far outweighed any improved prospects for Alderley Edge . ICI's specialities business has its world headquarters in the north, at Blackley in Manchester. Its future looks bright as part of ICI Bio, especially since its surfactants operations - mainly bulk production for detergents and located on Teesside - would be transferred to chemicals and polymers. Blackley would therefore be able to concentrate on specialities with high added value for use in industries such as cosmetics and health care. Its staff - and Manchester - are understood to be enthusiastic about the changes, which they see as a natural evolution. The changes are also understood to be welcome at ICI Paints, which has its world headquarters at Slough, in the Thames Valley. The paints business - a mixture of well-marketed decorative products and high-margin industrial coatings - will emerge from the shadow of pharmaceuticals to become the star performer of the new non-bio ICI. Coincidentally, it will occupy the same position in the new grouping as Akzo Coatings does in Akzo, the Netherlands chemicals group, with about 20 per cent of the total busi-ness. ICI Paints - which competitors saw as a sleeping giant in the mid-1980s - has since been woken up under Mr Herman Scopes, its chief executive. Its tight, professional managerial standards are expected to have a noticeable influence on the new bulk chemicals business. Mr Philip Okell, investment management director of Charterhouse Tilney, the Liverpool-based stockbroker, said yesterday: 'We are very keen on this development. This will free the better parts of ICI to do even better but it will expose the bulk chemicals business. 'They will be on their own and their management teams will become more focused. Making a similar split between mature and thrusting businesses has worked very well for Courtaulds. People were gloomy about the prospects for Courtaulds Textiles but it has done well on its own,' Mr Okell added.</p>

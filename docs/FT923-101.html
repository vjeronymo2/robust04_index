			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning from GPA TRADING PROFITS at GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, will show 'a significant reduction' in the second quarter compared with the first, warned Mr Tony Ryan, chairman, at yesterday's annual meeting. The company has been hit by costs arising from the failure of its Dollars 800m (Pounds 468m) share offering in May and a squeeze on lease rental margins. One result is that GPA is likely to make provisions and charges in the accounts for the year ending in March 1993. Mr Ryan said that those 'may be material in the context of annual earnings.' He confirmed that the company was planning a follow-up to its successful Aircraft Lease Portfolio Securitisation (ALPS) aircraft securitisation issue earlier this year. Alps 92-2 will involve the sale of 18 aircraft for Dollars 752m and should go ahead next month. 'We have received preliminary indications from the major debt rating agencies that they will give an AA rating to the senior debt in this fund,' said Mr Ryan. Progress was also being made over the raising of more equity capital. 'This is likely to take the form of an issue of convertible preference shares,' he said. 'Discussions (with the company's main shareholders) have been constructive.' He outlined the agreement in principle with Boeing, the aircraft maker, to defer delivery of aircraft worth Dollars 5bn and added that other deals with suppliers 'will make Dollars 650m of additional liquidity available to GPA over the next 18 months.' Nevertheless, the forces behind the flotation failure and the postponement of orders remained. 'GPA continues to be affected by uncertainty in the world economic scene, by a temporary oversupply of aircraft, the consequences of the withdrawal of our flotation and by lease rental margins and aircraft sales levels that have been adversely affected by recessional influences.' The oversupply of aircraft and low sales levels are important to GPA because much of the company's profits arise from the sale of second-hand aircraft after they have been leased for a few years. Mr Ryan painted an optimistic picture for the longer term. Some 193 aircraft had been leased so far this year compared with 111 in the same period last year. However, 'the benefits of much of the business we are writing today will not be reflected in our financial statements until the aircraft concerned are delivered to customers and start earning revenue.' GPA has leased two aircraft to Air Ukraine International, a newly-formed subsidiary of the national airline Air Ukraine. The 150-seat Boeing 737-400s go into service in November.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HEAVY-DUTY ANGER' HEATS UP  </P> <P> In discussing women's "Heavy-Duty Anger" (Sept. 23), Bettijane Levine and some  of the women interviewed assume equality of commitment by men and women to  certain goals.  </P> <P> The fact is that many women want a package that includes first, security,  marriage and fidelity; children; frequent intimate conversation, and a home  (with nice things in it that are kept clean).  </P> <P> Far fewer men want that exact package -- or they want it to a lesser degree.  Thus, if women are insistent that men live up to the whole deal plus an exact  sharing in the maintenance of it, many of us will opt out. For me (and  increasingly more men -- and some women) life goes on quite nicely alone and  without any of the four items above. A woman who wants more, has got to pay  more in time, caring and work.  </P> <P> MICHAEL KLEIN  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

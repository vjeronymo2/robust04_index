			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sick pay a tax on employers Sir, I am appalled to read the biased reporting in your article 'Treasury set to force severe cuts in sick pay subsidy' (November 12). You write blandly of the 'subsidy' given to employers and the possibility of that 'subsidy' being reduced from 80 per cent to 60 per cent. May I remind your readers that statutory sick pay was a burden placed upon employers a few years ago and that, initially, employers were recompensed by the government for the administration costs of making what amounts to social security payments on their behalf. Statutory sick pay is now a tax on employers. Perhaps with a more factual approach to such reports, your newspaper might avoid preparing such an easy path for the government to impose yet further taxation on industry.

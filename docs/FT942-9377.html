			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Debate over need for European clearing system - Risk and Reward The official opening of the Channel Tunnel earlier this month has finally linked the UK with the rest of Europe. Although much slower and far more expensive to build than most people had ever imagined, this engineering feat shows that the hurdles which stand in the way of European integration can be overcome. So it seems absurd that in the fast-growing and high-tech world of derivatives, there are no links between Europe's futures and options exchanges, even though an electronic trading and clearing system could be set up at a fraction of the cost and the time needed to complete the Channel Tunnel. At the moment, institutions which deal on Liffe in London, the Matif in Paris, the DTB in Frankfurt and the other exchanges from Spain to Austria have to put up margins and pay membership and dealing costs at each exchange. This is an inefficient use of capital, since their risk profile is often lower than the margin they have put up because a position on one exchange might be offset by another elsewhere. 'The consolidation of the clearing mechanism would be beneficial to users,' says Mr Graham Newall, chief executive of BZW Futures. The DTB and the Matif are in the process of linking their trading systems. By October, Matif members will be given direct access to selected DTB products through the installation of screens in France. The next stage would involve listing two Matif products on the DTB. This alliance aims to make the two exchanges more international, increase liquidity and reduce costs. However, the link will be limited to trading since issues such as jurisdiction and currency risk hinder the linking of the two clearing systems. Mr Willi Brandt, spokesman for the DTB, says the DTB products will be cleared through a DTB clearing member and the Matif products through a Matif clearing member. According to Mr Gilbert Durieux, chief operating officer at the Matif, the final aim is to have a centralised clearing system which he says would be easy to design. 'Having said that, we are not in the US but in the European Union, which means there is no single currency and no single central bank,' he says. As a result, the formation of a centralised clearing system is being hampered by important legal questions such as who would be the lender of the last resort. Even proposals such as 'mutual offset' between the two exchanges (whereby members would be able to offset their positions in contracts with similar maturities) would run contrary to the principle of a clearing system, which requires it to be balanced at the end of each trading day. Mr Durieux adds that it is by no means certain that exchange members want a centralised clearing system, since this could eat into income they derive from providing clearing services to their customers. In the near term, the DTB and the Matif hope that the co-operation will attract business away from Liffe, where the lion's share of trading in bund futures and options takes place. By contrast, Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive, does not feel the need to forge any strategic alliances. 'We are essentially an international exchange whereas the DTB and the Matif are domestic exchanges,' he says. Liffe may be riding high at the moment - on 12 days in the last quarter it exchanged more contracts than any other exchange in the world. But observers say if it does not look after its non-sterling products, Liffe could see business drift away. 'The DTB and Matif could really take Liffe on if they are clever about clearing,' says one banker.</p>

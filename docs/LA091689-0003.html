			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HARRY TUGEND; SCREENWRITER WAS ONE OF GUILD'S FOUNDERS  </P> <P> Harry Tugend, whose credits cut a wide and varied swath through the early days  of Hollywood and who was one of the founders of the Screen Writers Guild in  1933, died Monday.  </P> <P> The screenwriter, producer and film executive began as a singer in vaudeville  and wrote for such divergent stars as Fred Allen, Bing Crosby and Shirley  Temple. He was 92 when he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  </P> <P> Born in Brooklyn, Tugend began creating sketches for Flo Ziegfeld's Follies,  then joined the fabled Allen writing crew when the radio show went on the air  in 1932.  </P> <P> He went with Allen to Hollywood to make a film, "Thanks a Million," and soon  began writing other feature productions, including "Captain January" and "The  Littlest Rebel," for Temple in 1935.  </P> <P> After he and about 100 of his fellow writers formed the Screen Writers Guild,  Tugend, a spokeswoman said, signed the note for the guild's first building.  </P> <P> Tugend's writing and producing credits include "King of Burlesque," "Little  Miss Broadway," "Little Old New York," "Seven Sinners," "Birth of the Blues,"  "Golden Earrings," "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" and many more. His last was  "Who's Minding the Store?" in 1963.  </P> <P> He also wrote the Broadway play "The Wayward Stork" and several television  scripts.  </P> <P> Tugend, a widower, is survived by his son, James, and two granddaughters.  </P></p>

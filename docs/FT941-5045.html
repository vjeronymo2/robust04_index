			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (4): Capacity holds rates down - The UK credit insurance market The last three years have seen unprecedented movement in the British credit insurance market. Despite a string of recession-related claims, capital has been attracted to the sector by liberalisation. Competition is dampening any increase in rates, and improved information technology is helping increased product diversity and sophistication. According to the The Credit Insurance Association, a broker which is part of the Hogg Group, 23 insurers - including Lloyd's syndicates - are active in the market. Trade Indemnity (TI), which is owned by nine European insurance companies, is still the market leader with 75 to 80 per cent of domestic credit insurance, but as Ms Barbara Bennett, the company's corporate affairs manager concedes: 'There is an awful lot more competition in the UK than we have ever seen before.' Changes in European insurance regulations, especially the approval of the second non-life directive in 1990, allowed European companies such as Coface of France and Hermes of Germany to underwrite UK risks from their offices on the continent. But it was the purchase by the Dutch group, NCM Insurance, of the privatised short-term export credit insurance arm of the Export Credits Guarantee Department towards the end of 1991, which paved the way for the most significant EU incursion. NCM has already amassed a market share of between 8 and 10 per cent of the UK market, complementing its established position in the export credit insurance market. Other new entrants include AMA Underwriting Agents, which accepts business on behalf of the Dutch insurance company, Aegon, and works closely with the Infocheck, a credit rating agency. AMA has been focusing on smaller companies for whom the cost of traditional covers can be prohibitive. Mr Alistair Malcolm of AMA says his company's premium income has risen from about Pounds 2m in 1990 to Pounds 12m last year. At a time of increasing claims - insolvencies rose from 28,935 in 1990 to 62,767 in 1992 - the influx of new capacity has offset pressures for rates to increase and helped maintain stability. Trade Indemnity increased its rates by about 40 per cent in February 1991. But rates have barely risen since then. The traditional 'whole turnover' policies - in which buyers obtain insurance for specified credit limits for each of their customers - are typically priced at between 0.1 per cent of turnover to 1 per cent of turnover, with the bulk falling between the 0.3 and 0.6 range, depending on the sector in which the buyer operates and the adequacy of their credit management. At the low risk end of the market are companies in sectors such as advertising, whose customers tend to be dispersed across a wide range of sectors and who therefore have little concentrated exposure. On the other hand businesses such as timber, construction and furniture tend to be notoriously susceptible to cyclical pressures and there businesses can pay more. Rates also vary according to other factors such as the dependence of a company on a relatively small number of customers, while insurers have become much more likely to offer lower premiums for customers taking a more active approach to their credit management. 'Rates would have been expected to harden (increase in insurance jargon) with the substantial claims of 1991, 1992 and 1993, but with NCM and the other companies we have seen the balance change,' says Mr Bryan Squibb, marketing director with CIA. 'There is a lot of value for money in there.' Johnson &amp; Higgins, the insurance broker, go further in its annual insurance market overview, arguing that 'there is evidence that a 'price war' may be beginning in credit insurance.' Moreover, the extra competition, combined with the greater sophistication of information, has also stimulated underwriters to offer a wider range of covers and number of relatively new and more sophisticated products. 'The philosophy has changed,' explains Mr Squibb. 'Over the last three to four years the buyer has become much more aware of what is possible.' Both the traditional and newer markets are also selling more catastrophe insurance policies - which covers all losses above an excess point or limit higher than those available in traditional policies. These policies are centred around the policy holder's existing in-house credit controls and depend on a complete integration of credit management and credit insurance. The newer catastrophe type policy is particularly appropriate for larger companies - with turnovers in excess of Pounds 100m. Innovations such as the self explanatory 'pre-delivery risk' policies and the 'multi-market' policies - which provide a combination of export credit and domestic trade credit insurance to companies trading in the UK and most OECD markets - are also becoming more common. Yet despite this proliferation of policies, the market remains a limited one. In manufacturing a sales ledger can amount to 40 per cent of current assets; while in service industries it can easily be as high as 90 per cent, yet - according to some estimates - only about 15 per cent of eligible turnover is insured. There are some signs that the market for credit insurance is beginning to increase. Market research by one recent entrant into the UK market indicates that the take-up by British business has increased sharply over the past 18 months, with the numbers of companies buying credit insurance increasing from about 10 per cent in June 1992 to 24 per cent in December 1993. However, other insurers disagree, suggesting that this assessment is over bullish. Ms Bennett says: 'It is starting to creep up marginally, possibly as a result of the extra competition.' Mr Squibb says that interest is increasing but that the rise has been offset by the increase in the number of companies who are buying more financial information rather than renewing their credit insurance policies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, June 22 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic  Treaty Organization issued a summary Wednesday [22 June]  outlining its partnership programme with Russia, a deal it said  would correspond "to Russia's size, importance and capabilities."    The one-page document was released as Russia completed an  historic turnabout by signing NATO's Partnership for Peace  programme of military cooperation.    The document was titled "Summary of Conclusions of  Discussions Between the North Atlantic Council and Foreign  Minister of Russia Andrey Kozyrev."    Herewith are the four main points as outlined in the  release:    1. Both the Alliance and Russia have important contributions  to make to European stability and security. Constructive,  cooperative relations of mutual respect, benefit and friendship  between the Alliance and Russia are therefore a key element for  security and stability in Europe and in the interest of all  other states in the CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe) area.    Both the Alliance and Russia welcome the progress already  made in their relations, including within the NACC (North  Atlantic Cooperation Council), and seek to strengthen them  further.    2. The signature of Partnership for Peace by Russia opens a  further important opportunity to develop relations through  practical cooperation in the fields included in the Partnership  for Peace Framework Document.    The Alliance agreed to develop an extensive Individual  Partnership Programme coresponding to Russia's size, importance  and capabilities.    3. They agreed to set in train the development of a  far-reaching, cooperative NATO/Russia relationship, both inside  and outside Partnership for Peace. This relationship, aimed at  enhancing mutual confidence and openness, will be developed in a  way that reflects common objectives and complements and  reinforces relations with all other states, and is not directed  against the interest of third countries and is transparent to  others.    4. The Alliance and Russia agreed to pursue broad, enhanced  dialogue and cooperation in areas where Russia has unique and  important contributions to make, commensurate with its weight  and responsibility as a major European, international and  nuclear power through: sharing of information on issues  regarding politico-security related to matters having a European  dimension; political consultations, as appropriate, on issues of  common concern; cooperation in a range of security related areas  including, as appropriate, in the peacekeeping field.</p>

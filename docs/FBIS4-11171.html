			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Evans Beaubrun by correspondent </F> Clarence Renois; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Renois] Let us reconsider the amnesty bill which  was presented on 21 April by approximately 12 or 13 senators of  the Republic in a hotel in Port-au-Prince in the presence of  members of the diplomatic corps. Our guest, Deputy Evans  Beaubrun, himself an author of an amnesty bill that has been  submitted to the lower chamber, will comment on and respond to  the Senate initiative.    Deputy Beaubrun, good morning! You are the author of an  amnesty bill. How does your bill differ from the senators' bill;  how does it resemble theirs?    [Beaubrun] The two proposals differ on the point that the  one  from the senators is a special law, which in principle imposes  certain norms on the law, as we perceive law; while mine is an  amendment to the law already in effect, which provides for a  solution.    [Renois] Another question, Deputy Beaubrun, what are the  chances the senators will accept this bill? What are the  possibilities that the Chamber of Deputies will vote on it in  the event the situation normalizes in the Senate?    [Beaubrun] I must tell you, Clarence, that this bill is not  from the Senate of the Republic. A group of deputies presented  this bill, which was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies on 8  October 1993, two weeks after I submitted my first bill. I must  tell you that that bill was signed by Pierre Simon Georges,  Frantz Robert Monde, Walto Augustin, Beauge Yves Pericles,  Joseph Benoit Laguerre, Olipcial Regis, Lonnes Joseph, Rita  Frederic Moncoeur, and Lionel Bouzi.    The senators simply modified the bill by withdrawing certain  considerations and added two new considerations. Therefore, it  is not a draft of law belonging to the Senate of the Republic.  They are only exhuming a draft that was the subject of many  discussions...    [Renois] Do you mean that this draft, since it has already  been prepared by the deputies, has a greater chance of passing  because Frantz Robert Monde is the current president of the  Chamber of Deputies?    [Beaubrun] That is not what I mean. I mean this draft has  some serious, very big problems. The law must be general, and  this law concerns a group of citizens. It is far from being  general. Furthermore, the law must look to the future. The law  is for the future. This law does not look to the future at all.    [Renois] Have you reproached the senators for not mentioning  the financial aspects -- because you have asked for financial  amnesty, I believe, in your draft?    [Beaubrun] I am saying that this time, the senators have  gone  beyond the scope of this amnesty. That is one of the major  problems with this draft. This draft, all things considered,  presents some imbroglios. Although those senators say they are  opposed to a large amnesty, those same senators say in Article  2: This amnesty extends to all offenses following the coup  d'etat. When they say all offenses, stealing is also included in  the offenses after the coup d'etat; the nonpayment of taxes  could be considered an offense of the coup-d'etat, just to name  two. It is a very extended text. Whatever offenses could be  linked to the coup d'etat are covered by this amnesty.    [Renois] ....are forgiven by this amnesty. Last question,  Deputy Beaubrun. Regarding the steps taken by the Chamber of  Deputies -- I am referring to the consultations begun with the  military and other institutions, even the parliamentary plan  voted by yourself, as well as the political demands that are  being made today for the application of Article 149 -- is this  draft still appropriate or even up to date?    [Beaubrun] Personally, I still believe this draft is  appropriate and up to date. The procedure, however, is faulty  because the Senate has used it as a political weapon. I  understand that the Senate is a political institution. The  parliament has two institutions: the political institution,  which is the Senate; and the working institution, which is the  Chamber of Deputies. But I believe the Senate went a little too  far. The Senate made it a completely political matter. Eleven  senators were to vote and present this draft to the  international community and to the press. Why did they not vote  on this law? This procedure prevents us deputies from  rationally, legally examining this text. Why did they not vote?  Because this is a petition. We cannot receive a petition from  the Senate. We can receive a petition from a citizen or from any  segment of the city or the nation. But from the Senate, we can  receive a resolution....    [Renois] What makes you say this initiative is a petition,  not a resolution?    [Beaubrun] It is a petition. A resolution is voted on  article  by article. A draft is voted on article by article. When it is a  petition, it is presented with the signatures of so-and-so. For  instance, I understand 11 senators signed this text, and that  they are going to ask other senators to countersign. Then they  will ask the deputies to sign this text. I am saying it is a  political approach, not a parliamentary approach.    [Renois] Deputy Beaubrun, thank you for answering our  questions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 20 May (MENA) -- Egyptian Ambassador in  Khartoum Dr. Hasan Jad-al-Haqq has expressed his sorrow and deep  regrets for the Sudanese authority's confiscation of  Egyptian-owned homes and the expulsion of the Egyptian employees  living in them. He said he hoped this conduct will not lead to  undesirable consequences between the two Muslim neighbors.    In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Khartoum on his  reaction to recent developments, Dr. Jad-al-Haqq said he finds  no justification for the Sudanese conduct on such holy days.    Dr. Jad-al-Haqq added that he received a telephone call from  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on the surprising Sudanese conduct,  and the minister hoped things will not go too far.    The ambassador added that he asked Minister Musa to postpone  the dispatch of an aircraft to transport Egyptian nationals from  Sudan. He requested a chance to see whether his contacts with  senior Sudanese officials and key figures, particularly Dr.  Hasan al-Turabi, would succeed in solving this crisis, which  might ruin relations between the two countries.    Dr. Jad-al-Haqq expressed the hope that the Sudanese will be  reasonable and refrain from this conduct, which should never  happen in a Muslim or non-Muslim state no matter what.    The ambassador questioned why officials in the Sudanese  Government did not follow the traditional procedure of notifying  him of their plans in advance.</p>

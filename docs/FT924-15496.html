			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / BT will improve business discounts BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday announced an improved range of discounts for business telecommunications users as part of its attempt to stem the loss of its most profitable customers to Mercury Communications, its main rival. Business customers are being offered a cut in charges of about 3 per cent to 4 per cent from next January. Mercury, which has concentrated on providing services to businesses, said it was committed to remaining competitive, but would not necessarily make a 'knee-jerk response' to BT's move. Business customers are likely to receive a second round of price cuts in the next few months when BT announces annual changes in its standard charges. The company is required by Oftel, its regulator, to cut the price of a basket of its main services by an amount equivalent to the rise in the retail prices index minus 6.25 percentage points.</p>

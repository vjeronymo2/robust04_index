			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Canadian banks cling to a raft of reforms - Fundamental changes to the country's financial services industry Canada's big banks have for years been looking forward to next Monday in the hope that the raft of financial service reforms which take effect that day would once and for all free them to storm into the insurance and fiduciary services businesses. But far from rejoicing, the banks are hopping mad. While they will still be allowed for the first time to own insurance and trust companies, vigorous lobbying by the insurance industry persuaded the federal government at the last moment to tighten curbs on the banks' ability to market insurance policies. So angry are the banks that at least two of their chairmen, Mr Allan Taylor, of Royal Bank of Canada, and Mr Richard Thomson, of Toronto-Dominion, fired off letters of protest to Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister. Despite the government's last-minute change of heart, the reforms are certain to accelerate fundamental changes in Canada's financial services industry. They are unlikely to discourage most of the banks from wading into insurance, and are expected to spur numerous acquisitions and alliances involving different types of financial institution. Some hard-pressed mutual insurers are expected to seek extra capital by converting into shareholder-owned institutions. The trust industry is likely to shrink as banks and their new trust subsidiaries become more active in fiduciary services. The new legislation, consisting of four Acts with 1,300 pages, has been six years in the making. It was conceived as Canada's response to the headlong deregulation of financial services throughout the world. As the precise functions of each type of financial institution grew more fuzzy, regulators could no longer maintain the traditional distance between the four pillars of Canada's financial services industry - banks, trust companies, insurers and securities firms. The first legal barriers were broken in 1987 when outsiders were allowed to invest in the securities firms. All six now own securities subsidiaries, including some of the biggest brokerage firms in the country. The banks have for years been itching to use their vast branch and automated-teller networks as a springboard for marketing insurance policies. Royal Bank of Canada estimates that while Canadians see their insurance broker less than twice annually, they deal with their bank about 36 times a year. Banks, insurers and trust companies have spent the past two years gearing up for the changes which take effect on June 1. All the banks have either bought trust companies or set up new trust subsidiaries, allowing them to expand into such fields as corporate custodial services, and estates administration. Anticipating the reforms, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank have either forged marketing alliances with insurance companies, or started setting up their own insurance businesses. Non-bank institutions have also been busy protecting their flanks. Manulife Financial has bought several small trust companies and recently gave notice that it wants to start a bank. Canada Trust - the country's strongest trust company - has formed a joint insurance venture with Colonia Life. The last-minute changes, contained in regulations under the Bank Act, were made after bitter complaints from insurance brokers, supported by many underwriters, that their livelihood was in danger. For once, the banks were outmanoeuvred in political lobbying. While banks will be allowed to buy insurance companies, they will now be barred from providing their new subsidiaries with any information on their banking customers. The regulations also prohibit them from referring their customers to specific insurance companies or brokers. Any promotion of an insurance product will have to be directed at the bank's entire customer base or all its credit card holders. No promotion or selling of insurance will be allowed within a bank branch. The tightened curbs are an inconvenience not only to the banks, but also some insurers which have hitched themselves to the banks' wagon. North American Life, for instance, bought a direct-marketing business in late-1990 which sells insurance policies to carefully targeted customers of three different banks. Mr Cam Hall, North American's director in charge of this business, says that 'the direct marketing of insurance products when you can't target-market is difficult to do cost efficiently'. However, the new curbs are unlikely to turn the banks away from the insurance business. 'We still expect them to try and sell insurance on an untargeted basis,' says Mr Greg Fast, partner at Madden Fast &amp; Associates, a Toronto financial services consultancy. The banks, which are by far the most powerful players in Canada's financial services industry, have a history of finding the smallest openings in regulatory barriers, and then gradually prising them open. It would be out of character if they did not spend the next few years probing for every loophole they can find until they become the force they want to be in the insurance and trust markets.</p>

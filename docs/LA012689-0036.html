			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DESANTIS' COOL HAND ICES CHATSWORTH WIN  </P> <P> Chatsworth High's Dominic DeSantis beat El Camino Real with the ball in one  hand and his coach in the other.  </P> <P> Chatsworth Coach Gary Shair was arguing with an official who had added a second  to the clock -- from 1 to 2 to play -- with Chatsworth ahead by a point.  DeSantis left the free-throw line, wrapped his arms around Shair and led him to  the bench. The 6-foot forward, who was fouled to stop the clock, said that he  wanted to ice the game.  </P> <P> Shair sat down and DeSantis sank both shots and El Camino Real, 60-57.  </P> <P> "He had to calm coach down," center Cornelius Edwards said of the coach. "He  was about to get a technical and we were only winning by one."  </P> <P> Ten seconds remained when El Camino Real guard Russell Reid raced downcourt  attempting to get the ball to Charles Crow on the wing, but he threw the ball  out of bounds. That mistake, although the most untimely, was not the first for  El Camino Real in the last quarter.  </P> <P> With Chatsworth (10-7 overall, 2-0 in West Valley League play) leading, 56-54,  and fewer than 2 minutes left, Jason Farrell tried to break the Chatsworth  fullcourt press and looped a pass upcourt that was intercepted. The Chancellors  called time out.  </P> <P> And what happened at the end of that timeout profited Chatsworth more than any  strategy discussed during it could have. The Chancellors came back on the court  and began play while El Camino Real was still shuffling out of its huddle. Rick  Garrick scored an uncontested layup to extend the lead to 58-54.  </P> <P> "We had a 100 mistakes in those last two minutes, " El Camino Real Coach Mike  McNulty said.  </P></p>

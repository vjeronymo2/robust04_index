			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> KIPLING RECONDITIONED IN WALT DISNEY'S 'THE JUNGLE BOOK'  </P> <P> Although its slapstick comedy, upbeat songs and polished animation made it one  of the studio's most successful postwar features, "The Jungle Book" (opening  today in re-release, citywide) is best known as the last animated film Walt  Disney personally supervised. It premiered in October, 1967, 10 months after  his death.  </P> <P> Disney's artists took little more than the names of the characters from Rudyard  Kipling's original stories. They transformed Mowgli (voice by Bruce  Reitherman), the noble savage reared by wolves, into a rambunctious,  all-American boy. The ancient, subtle Kaa (Sterling Holloway) became a sibilant  buffoon with psychedelic eyes. Baloo, the dignified old bear who taught the Law  of the Jungle to the animal cubs, was turned into a happy-go-lucky "two-bit  jungle bum" with a shape like a half-filled Hefty bag and a voice by Phil  Harris.  </P> <P> "The Jungle Book" is not so much a great animated film as a film with great  animated sequences. In "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Pinocchio," every  scene advances the story; in "Jungle Book," the story is reduced to a vehicle  for characters' comic antics.  </P> <P> Baloo's loose-limbed movements, coupled with Harris' vocal performance --  especially his jazzy rendition of "The Bare Necessities" -- are as entertaining  today as they were 23 years ago. His jitterbug duet to "I Wanna Be Like You"  with the frenetic orangutan, King Louie (Louie Prima), whose hands, arms, legs  and eyes swivel in all directions, ranks among the funniest sequences in Disney  animation.  </P> <P> "Jungle Book" was one of the last films made by the crew Disney had begun  assembling in the '30s, and the artists were clearly near the height of their  talents. They make Kaa such an engaging presence, the audience doesn't realize  that animating him presented enormous difficulties: A snake has no hands, arms  or shoulders to use in gestures. (The artists cleverly solved the problem by  using sections of his body to suggest limbs.) The affectionate relationship  that develops between Mowgli and Baloo is delineated visually, through  gestures, body language and expressions.  </P> <P> The warmth of these characters contrasts effectively with the icy terror of  Shere Khan, the tiger, (George Sanders, in one of his last roles). Mowgli's  battle with Shere Khan, is a dramatic, David-and-Goliath confrontation, with a  passel of shabby, Beatles-esque vultures providing comic relief. The film  peters out after the battle: Bewitched by a lovely Indian girl, Mowgli gives up  his jungle existence for life in the man-village too easily. The audience has  seen the depth of his feelings for his animal friends, yet he casually abandons  them.  </P> <P> Although it lacks the emotional depth of "Bambi" and the visual opulence of  "Fantasia," "The Jungle Book" remains a high-spirited romp that will delight  children -- and parents weary of action films with body counts that exceed  their box-office grosses. Just don't go expecting Kipling.  </P></p>

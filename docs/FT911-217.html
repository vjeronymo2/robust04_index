			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Australian inflation rate expected to start falling AUSTRALIA'S Labor government is likely to get a much needed boost this week from Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures showing inflation has moved onto a downward path. Analysts are forecasting a rise of around 0.4 per cent in the March-quarter CPI, due on Thursday, which would reduce the annual rate of inflation from 6.9 per cent to 5.5 per cent. This would represent a significant improvement over the 2.7 per cent increase in the December quarter, and would put Australia on course for annualised inflation of less than 5 per cent by the end of the year. It would also allow Mr Paul Keating, the treasurer (finance minister), to claim a measure of success in controlling inflation, which has been the government's top priority since the economy slipped into recession last year. However, critics say the March figures will be heavily influenced by one-off factors, including a 15.6 per cent reduction in petrol prices and lower mortgage interest rates. The improved longer-term outlook is largely a result of the weakness of the economy, which grew by only 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, following six months of negative growth, and is expected to contract again in the March quarter. The government is facing political problems caused by a continuing increase in unemployment, which reached 9.9 per cent in April and is likely to exceed the 10.3 per cent recorded in the trough of the last recession in 1983. The high level of unemployment has increased pressure for an early cut in official interest rates to stimulate growth, but economists say the government may delay until next month, unless the inflation figures are unexpectedly good.</p>

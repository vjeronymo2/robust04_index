			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Yeltsin urges plebiscite on crisis RUSSIA'S president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, declared yesterday that the country was in the grip of a constitutional crisis and that a referendum on who rules the country should go ahead, Reuter reports from Moscow. In an interview broadcast on Moscow radio, Yeltsin said he wanted to reach an accord with conservative rivals, expected to challenge him at this week's session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the top legislature. 'I very much hope to achieve concord at the Congress between the legislative and executive authorities and the president,' he said. 'If the Congress cancels the decision to hold a referendum, and the Congress could do it, this will show a lack of trust in the people,' he said. The referendum has been called for April 11 to determine who rules Russia - president or parliament. Yeltsin's seven-minute interview, showed that he was counting on the plebiscite to strengthen his mandate for radical reform. Yeltsin and his main rival, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliament chairman, have been exchanging verbal blows for weeks as a struggle between the executive and legislative authorities has intensified. This week's emergency Congress, due to open on Wednesday, could bring the conflict to a head. Conservative deputies are expected to renew efforts to trim Mr Yeltsin's powers. Many oppose the referendum, which they warn could destabilise the country further and even lead to its disintegration. Yeltsin called for unity to resolve a crisis whose roots he said lay in the contradictory constitution inherited from the Soviet era. 'I have become convinced that it is not those on the right, nor those on the left, nor the centrists, nor the communists, nor the democrats who can save Russia . . . We need consensus among parties and organisations,' he said. Yeltsin even held out an olive branch to communists, whose party he once outlawed. 'There are also healthy communists who support Russia and its revival and accordingly do not want to wage a confrontational struggle,' he said. Conservative deputies are worried that the president might call upon the armed forces to back him if he does not get his way in the Congress. But Defence Minister Pavel Grachev vowed at the weekend that the army would stay neutral in the conflict. 'The army . . . will not participate in political games. That would be dangerous,' Mr Grachev told Rossiskiye Vesti newspaper.</p>

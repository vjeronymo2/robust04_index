			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review  of all items in the 21 June issue of the Arabic-language  newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic  issues.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Lawyers Announce General Strike    2 Detainee Explains Prison Conditions    3. Sudan's al-Turabi Interviewed    4. Brotherhood Leader Denounces Campaign    5. Writer Explains Anti-Brotherhood Campaign  <H5>  LAWYERS ANNOUNCE GENERAL STRIKE </H5>   Qutb al-'Arabi and Khalid Yunis write on pages 1 and 7 an  approximately 1,200-word report on the Egyptian lawyers'  protests at what they see as the government's harassment of  lawyers. The report notes that on 20 June the Lawyers  Association's Council met and decided to declare a general  strike on 28 and 29 June in protest of the continued detention  of lawyers and the arrest of five new lawyers on 14 June.  'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, head of the Cairo Lawyers Association,  has announced that he will continue his hunger strike until all  detained lawyers are released and the public prosecutor  announces the results of the investigations into the death of  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, the lawyer who died while in police  custody. Muhammad, who is a diabetic, said that should he die  as a result of his hunger strike, the president of the Republic  and the government would be liable before the law.  <H5>  DETAINEE EXPLAINS PRISON CONDITIONS </H5>   On page 2 under the headline "A Bloody Letter From Inside  the  Abu-Za'bal Prison," the paper publishes a letter received from  engineer 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Abd-al-Salam from Samalut, al-Minya  Governorate. In introducing the approximately 2,000-word  letter, the paper notes that it receives dozens of letters,  phone calls, and complaints every day from relatives of people  detained at the Abu- Za'bal Prison in which they describe the  tragic conditions experienced by more than 2,500 detainees  inside the prison, which the paper describes as similar to what  existed in the Middle Ages. 'Abd-al-Salam gives his account of  his four-month stay at the Abu-Za'bal prison and describes in  detail the inhuman conditions and the torture that inmates  suffer inside the prison. 'Abd-al-Salam does not specify the  charges for which he was locked up. A drawing published above  the message shows a prisoner hanging upside down by a rope and  being lashed by a policeman with a whip. Addressing the  prisoner, the policeman says: "If you don't repent, we will  make you repent."  <H5>  SUDAN'S AL-TURABI INTERVIEWED </H5>   On page 4 the paper publishes an approximately 2,500-word  dispatch by European affairs correspondent Ayman 'Ali that  includes an interview Sudanese National Front leader Hasan  al-Turabi gave to Britain's Channel 4 on 5 June. In the  interview, al-Turabi refutes the Western charges against Islam  and the Islamic movement and explains Sudan's Islamic experiment.   <H5>    BROTHERHOOD LEADER DENOUNCES CAMPAIGN </H5>   In an approximately 1,500-word article on page 5, Muslim  Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur notes that Prophet  Muhammad's hegira, or migration, from Mecca to Medina in the  year 622 offers some lessons to Muslims today. He explains that  the first lesson to be learned from the Prophet's experience is  his patience and endurance in the face of "harassment and  torture" by infidels. This shows that the faithful must never  give up their belief regardless of the "pressure" they may come  under, he adds. Mashhur adds: "Every Muslim must feel that it  is his duty to propagate this religion among humanity and that  he must follow the model of the Prophet, may God's peace be upon  him, and his companions in patience, perseverance, and  endurance." He notes that "victory" will be the reward for this  patience and endurance. Another lesson, he writes, is the  attention that the Prophet has paid to the mosque in its  capacity as an "Islamic institution" in which Muslims practice  their rites and discuss their affairs. He adds: "It is  unfortunate to see the scheming against this establishment  nowadays." The mosques and the appointment of the mosque imams,  he adds, have become the prerogatives of the Ministry of Awqaf  and no activity is practiced inside the mosques, which are shut  off immediately after prayers. Turning to the current campaign  against the Muslim Brotherhood, Mashhur writes: "The current  campaign against the Brotherhood is part of the campaign against  Islam and the principles of Islam that is conducted and planned  by active enemies and that is performed by local followers.  They mix terrorism and extremism with Islam, the religion of  peace and security. We even find some people who criticize the  women's veil and reject God's orders in this respect. While the  media organs prevent veiled broadcasters from appearing on the  screen, they allow cheap obscenity involving women in  advertisements and low-quality movies." He notes that the  Muslim brothers are falsely accused of adopting violence and  seeking to overthrow the regime, charges that are published in  the national press which is subsidized by the people's money.  He adds: "We tell all these people and those who collaborate  with acts of injustice that nobody will come to your aid when  God calls you to account for every word said or act done to  support the oppressor." He consoles the oppressed people by  telling them that the Prophet's life gives a vivid example of  how the faithful, who were few in number, have triumphed over  all their enemies. He urges them to be patient, to persevere,  and to pray to God for victory.  <H5>  WRITER EXPLAINS ANTI-BROTHERHOOD CAMPAIGN </H5>   Labor Party official Naji al-Shihabi writes an approximately  1,000-word article entitled "The Campaign Against the  Brotherhood and a New Era" on page 11. He notes that security  documents published in the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR accuse the  Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to establish a political party, as  if it is an unforgiven crime. The Brotherhood, he adds, has  been operating since 1928 and accordingly it has a right to  establish a party to reach power through the ballot box; that  is, by the public will. He explains that describing the Muslim  Brotherhood as an illegitimate group is absurd, since legitimacy  comes from the people whom this group serves. The people, he  adds, voted for this group when it joined the Labor Party in the  1987 elections for the People's Assembly. Explaining the reasons  for the government's campaign against the Brotherhood,  al-Shihabi adds: "We believe that the recent campaign against  the Muslim Brotherhood group is due to its rise as a political  group possessing enough elements of strength that have enabled  it to virtually control the Professional Associations, with all  the human and financial resources available to these  associations." He adds that observers and analysts believe that  such a performance could enable the Brotherhood to reach power  through a "peaceful popular will," something that has frightened  the regime.</p>

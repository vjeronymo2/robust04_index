			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ralston Trust board proposes liquidation THE BOARD of Ralston Investment Trust is proposing a voluntary liquidation of the company. The net asset value of the trust, which is 75 per cent-owned by Caledonia Investments, itself controlled by the Cayzer family, declined by 30.4 per cent between its inception in October 1988 and November 30 1992. Mr Peter Buckley, Caledonia's chief executive, said: 'It's been a bit disappointing. But the formation of Ralston coincided with the start of a period during which the securities of smaller UK companies have underperformed the market.' In contrast with other investment trust restructurings shareholders, other than Caledonia Investments, will receive cash distributions equal to their proportional entitlements to the net assets of the company. A second interim dividend of 1.1p per share will be paid on January 29. Shareholders will be asked to approve the proposals at an extraordinary general meeting on February 1.</p>

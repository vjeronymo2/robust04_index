			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Books: Ammunition for the anti-intellectuals THE INTELLECTUALS AND THE MASSES by John Carey Faber Pounds 14.99, 246 pages WHEN OXFORD'S Merton Professor of English castigates the 'literary intelligentsia' for being hostile to 'the masses', it is a spectacular case of a hound running with the hares. John Carey is the Merton Professor in question, and he has successfully employed a formula used by tabloid journalists: catch someone famous doing something compromising and publicise the fact, applying large doses of moral outrage in the process. A number of 20th century intellectual heroes have said snobbish and nasty things about people in the mass. Carey has caught them at it; his book is devoted to exposing them. The intellectuals' sin, according to Carey, is that they not only disdain mass culture but hate the masses themselves. To protect high culture from the pollution of popular acceptance intellectuals make their work too difficult for the masses to understand, thus marginalising and excluding them. Carey's thesis is that intellectuals feel threatened by mass culture. The threat started with increased literacy in the 19th century, and expressed itself in new popular media like the tabloid press. Population explosion, rapid growth of cities, tabloid journalism, trivial and vulgar pursuits indulged en masse (football crowds, packed beaches) filled the intelligentsia with revulsion, says Carey, and they invented a conceptual idiom aimed at keeping the mobs at bay, namely Modernism; a family of difficult, abstract literary and artistic styles. And some intellectuals did not stop there: they began to hypothesise ways of limiting or even eliminating the encroaching masses. DH Lawrence wished he had the use of a 'lethal chamber' as big as the Crystal Palace; Rayner Heppenstall dreamed of 'total genocide' of the Irish and Arabs at the push of a button; Nietzsche proclaimed that higher men must declare war on the 'the superfluous' to defend against their engulfing mediocrity. The 20th century did not have to wait long for a fairy-godfather to grant these wishes. By copious quotation Carey offers a depressing picture of elitism and cultural bigotry. His book will furnish much ammunition to the already large anti-intellectual majority in the English-speaking world. And that is a pity, for his argument is too flawed and deeply tendentious to be taken seriously. First, it is striking that the cases Carey quotes form a very biased sample. It is well understood that Lawrence, Pound, Yeats, Leavis, Heppenstall and several others of Carey's stars held social and political opinions which make Genghis Khan seem moderate. Carey tells us that, for example, Heppenstall fulminated against the welfare state, trades unions, coloured immigrants, new universities and the working class. Practically all right-wing politicians do the same, relatively few of whom can be described as intellectuals, so it is hard to see how such views are especially representative of intellectuals. Had Carey mentioned others in the intellectual community, like Bertrand Russell, the Webbs, Keynes, Wilfred Owen and other war poets; and had he been more discriminating about EM Forster, and more sensitive to the attitudes of gay and women writers like Auden and Katherine Mansfield, who knew what it was like to be members of excluded groups, he would find that his group of star nasties is markedly unrepresentative. Carey is not over-burdened by a sense of logic, and effects some spectacular inferences. HG Wells was worried about the population explosion, and deplored the haphazard pre-war growth of towns into the countryside. Both are laudable concerns, yet Carey treats them as evidence that Wells hated the masses. This is quite a jump. Carey seems unable to distinguish two things: views about what mass culture sometimes does, and views about individuals threatened with harm by mass culture. He would have been equipped to do so if he had read Harry Payne's The Philosophes and the People, which discusses the same question in an 18th-century setting. Payne shows that most thinkers were concerned to liberate people from the tyrannies of ignorance and cheap sentiment. Modern writers like Wells and Orwell were similarly worried that some aspects of mass culture prevent people from thinking for themselves, and attacked it accordingly. This is not at all the same as disdaining the individuals who suffer the impoverishing effects of mass culture. Carey simply fails to see this. Indeed Carey never once asks whether some of the intellectuals' complaints are justified. Is it not deplorable that the intellectual staple of many is an endless diet of television soaps, the Sun newspaper and royal scandals? Does Carey wish us to think otherwise? If so, that is treason by a clerk indeed.</p>

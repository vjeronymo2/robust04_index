			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Unions in move to block Black's Fairfax ambition AUSTRALIA'S media unions yesterday sought an urgent meeting with Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister) in a bid to block Mr Conrad Black's attempt to increase his stake in the John Fairfax newspaper group. The request is likely to reinvigorate opposition to Mr Black, the Canadian proprietor of the Telegraph newspaper group of the UK, who is seeking to increase his stake in Fairfax from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. In an unusual move, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and the Printing and Kindred Industries Union sent a joint statement to Mr Dawkins urging him to withhold approval for Mr Black's request. 'We are writing to express our extreme concern that the federal government is likely to approve the application by interests associated with Conrad Black to increase their holding,' the unions said. 'As representatives of people working in the newspaper industry, we do not believe that the national interest would be served by allowing the Black interests to increase their holding.' Government officials have signalled recently that Mr Dawkins was likely to approve Mr Black's application, which is required under foreign investment regulations on media investments. Opposition from backbench government MPs has softened in recent weeks, partly because a number of prominent critics of Mr Black were promoted to ministerial positions in a government reshuffle. Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the (Melbourne) Age and the Australian Financial Review, was sold to a consortium led by the Telegraph in 1991. Mr Kerry Packer, the billionaire Australian publisher, revealed last week that he held a stake of more than 10 per cent in Fairfax, prompting speculation that he would launch a takeover bid shortly. Under Australia's cross-media ownership laws, Mr Packer would have to reduce his 48 per cent stake in the Channel Nine television network to less than 15 per cent before acquiring more than 14.99 per cent of Fairfax.</p>

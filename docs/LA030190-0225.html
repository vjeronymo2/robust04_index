			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Council race -- A story about the cost of the 1989 Montebello City Council  election (Times, Feb. 11) incorrectly listed Quiet Cannon Montebello Inc. as a  defendant in a libel suit filed by Montebello City Councilman William Molinari.  </P> <P> The same story referred to David Perrin as the organizer of a political action  committee that opposed Molinari during the 1987 council election. Campaign  disclosure statements do not list Perrin as either an organizer or member of  the political action committee. The statements show only that Perrin  contributed $950 to the committee.  </P></p>

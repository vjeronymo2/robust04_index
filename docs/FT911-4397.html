			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Canadian magnesium smelter closes AN ALBERTA magnesium smelter with capacity for 12,000 tonnes of metal a year and a cost of nearly CDollars 200m (Pounds 97m), has been shut only six months after start-up. The plant used technology based on a British process to produce high-purity magnesium metal from magnesite ore. This involved a one-step reduction process claimed to be more efficient than technology used by the world's biggest producers, Norsk Hydro and Dow Chemical. Magnesium metal is used in die-casting and construction components, as an alloying agent in aluminium and as a de-sulphurising agent in steelmaking. The western world used about 253,000 tonnes last year, produced by Norsk in Norway and Canada, Dow in Texas, and also by Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) and Magnesium Corporation of America. The recession and low activity in the car industry pushed prices down from Dollars 1.60 a pound to about Dollars 1.10, roughly in line with aluminium. The Magcan plant, near Calgary, never produced more than 10 tonnes daily. Alberta Natural Gas, a US-owned pipeline company, invested CDollars 64m in the project and the Alberta government lent CDollars 103m. ANG owned 54 per cent and Magnesium International (Canada), 46 per cent. ANG has now written off its investment. Alcoa was originally associated with Magcan but dropped out before construction began, saying it wanted to concentrate investment on its aluminium smelters. In 1990, ANG moved in hoping to diversify its pipeline business. Industry sources say Magcan produced high-purity metal for the alloy market but the process was new and it misjudged the time required for start-up. The drop in magnesium prices, high interest rates and a high Canadian dollar, worsened the situation. Mr William Demcoe, ANG vice-president, said the new plant did not produce enough metal to approach break-even and his company had no choice but to close it. Norsk Hydro opened a Dollars 500m smelter near Montreal late in 1989 with a yearly capacity of 40,000 tonnes.</p>

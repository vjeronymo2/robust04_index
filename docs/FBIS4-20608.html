			<p>Current   Bi-Based Oxide Superconductor Lead Wire   <F P=102> 94FE0283A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Dec 93 p  15 --FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0283A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Kansai Electric Power Company and Sumitomo  Electric Industries, Ltd., have succeeded in co-developing a  bismuth-based superconducting current lead wire. It has current  capacity of 2,500 amperes, the highest for an oxide  superconductor, and the amount of heat penetration into helium  is .412 watts per kiloampere. It can be used as current lead  wires for superconductive magnetic energy storage (SMES) devices  and other equipment that apply superconductivity, and its  performance does not degrade in magnetic fields.    Two types of lead wire were developed; one has 500 ampere  capacity and the other 2,500 amperes. In the 500 ampere lead  wire, a silver-clad, bismuth-based oxide semiconducting wire 3.5  millimeters (mm) wide and 0.15mm thick has been laminated. As  for the 2,500 ampere lead, a modified version of the 500 ampere  wire is the standard unit, and 4 of them are set side by side.  Total length of the wire is 560mm, and it is fixed in an epoxy  resin support material to increase mechanical strength.    Generally, copper has been used for current lead wire for  superconductive equipment, but the wire has to be thicker for  stronger current and the generation of joule heat caused by the  resistance of the material itself also is a problem. That is why  hopes have been pinned on oxide superconductors, which have  superior heat penetration. Until now, however, maximum capacity  achieved with a yttrium-base wire was 1,800 amperes.</p>

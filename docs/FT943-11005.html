			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / People: ICI boosts its Asia strategy Imperial Chemical Industries' Asian expansion strategy received another boost yesterday when it announced the appointment of Peter Shaw as senior vice president, mergers and alliances, in Asia-Pacific. Shaw, aged 50, below, will co-ordinate and assist the group's international businesses with their merger and alliance activities in the region. Presently based in the London acquisition department, he has previously worked for 10 years in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Hong Kong. Although the company announced last week it would construct a Dollars 100m plant for PET, a raw material for plastic bottles, in the US, the Asia-Pacific region is ICI's top priority, according to Alan Spall, finance director. Excluding Australasia, the region accounts for about 8 per cent of group turnover. But last year, for the first time, the company invested more in the region than in the UK. The company already has a paints joint-venture in Guangdong province, China, in conjunction with Swire Pacific and Guangzhou Industrial Development Corporation. Most recently, ICI opened its CFC replacement factory in Japan, the result of a joint-venture with Teijin, the Japanese group. ICI's largest investments in the region have been in north-west Taiwan, a 350,000 tonne a year pure terephthalic acid plant making raw material for polyester.</p>

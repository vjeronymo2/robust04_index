			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia advances to an eight-month high ACTIVE buying by foreign investors supported share prices in the face of profit-taking by investment trusts, and the Nikkei average finished narrowly higher in heavy trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained 10.33 at 17,858.63 after registering a low for the day of 17,824.12 and high of 18,036.72. The index failed to stay above the 18,000 level due to profit-taking by investment trusts and corporate investors eager to realise profits ahead of the March financial year-end. Volume contracted to 550m shares from 853m. Declines finally led advances by 577 to 430, with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 2.11 up at 1,341.88, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.12 to 1,080.78. Foreign investors were seen covering short positions. Traders said some US pension funds were increasing their investments in Japanese shares, which are seen as undervalued following the recent rallies in US and UK equities. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has led the recent market rally, met profit-taking in early trading but was supported by dealers and finished Y10,000 higher at Y790,000. NEC appreciated Y10 to Y777 on hopes that the company will see a rise in sales as a result of the government's promotion of optical fibre networks in its infrastructure projects. Reports that condominium sales were rising in the Tokyo metropolitan area helped builders, with Daikyo, the leading property developer, advancing Y35 to Y995. Shokusan Jutaku Sogo rose Y11 to Y520 and Taisei Prefab Construction Y50 to Y1,750. Some real estate companies were also higher, Mitsui Fudosan putting on Y20 at Y1,070 and Tokyu Land Y22 at Y482. Some high-technology exporters gained ground on the stronger dollar. Sony rose Y30 to Y4,130 and Fujitsu Y17 to Y605. However, Hitachi lost Y7 to Y740 and Toshiba eased Y2 to Y588 on profit-taking. Brokers moved ahead in the expectation that the recent market rally and rise in trading volume will help revenues. Nomura Securities rose Y40 to Y1,640 and Nikko Y8 to Y713. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 27.90 to 18,765.54 in volume of 132.8m shares. A retreat by railway issues depressed the index, and Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, slipped Y200 to Y10,000. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets mostly set a positive tone. Seoul was closed for a holiday. AUSTRALIA closed at an eight-month peak, pushed up by strong futures buying. On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March Share Price Index jumped 22 to 1,669, moved by a feeling that the market would strengthen after Saturday's federal election. The All Ordinaries index followed, finishing 13.8 higher at 1,647.5. Turnover came to ADollars 325.8m. The gold shares index defied the uptrend to lose 2.8 to 1,063.2 after bullion prices hit a seven-year low overnight. Among banks, NAB climbed 13 cents to ADollars 8.58 and Commonwealth advanced 9 cents to ADollars 7.49, but Westpac closed only a cent higher at ADollars 3.20 after Tuesday's unveiling of its first foreign rationalisation plans under its new managing director, Mr Robert Joss. BANGKOK's SET index rose 16.36, or 1.9 per cent, to 900.07 in a technical rebound from recent declines. Turnover was still relatively low, although up from Bt2.5bn to Bt3.5bn. Banking stocks were among the major gainers, Bangkok Bank, the most active issue in turnover terms, firming Bt4 to Bt119. Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand moved forward Bt24 to Bt362 on details of plans to rescue the failed First City Investment. SINGAPORE rose on last-minute buying, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 10.24 better at 1,667.96. Trading interest in main board shares continued to be meagre, with the focus on Malaysian over-the-counter stocks. KUALA LUMPUR recovered from a bout of profit-taking to close mixed in heavy trading. The KLSE composite index put on 5.58 at 637.37 on the back of the market heavyweight, Telekom, 40 sen higher at MDollars 12.70. JAKARTA remained in confident mood and the official index rose 1.70 to 311.78. Among active stocks, Pan Brothers added Rp150 at Rp2,375 but Lippo dipped Rp50 to Rp3,325. BOMBAY continued under pressure which left the BSE index down 49.81, or 2.1 per cent, at 2,287.15. As the market opened, the exchange halted trading in 17 group A shares to prevent more of the price swings seen on Tuesday.</p>

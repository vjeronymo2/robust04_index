			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: US Smaller Trust asset value soars Over the year to June 30 net asset value of US Smaller Companies Investment Trust rose 17.9 per cent in dollar terms, and 50.3 per cent, from 93.9p to 141.1p, in sterling equivalent. The trust does not hedge currency exposure; the difference is the result of the dollar's appreciation of 27.5 per cent against sterling. The underperformance against the Russell 2500 and the 2-3 Decile Benchmark emerged largely during the second half, primarily because of the market's preference for 'value' stocks compared with 'growth' stocks. Outlook for investment in smaller companies in the US continued to be favourable. On the revenue side total income was Pounds 597,000 (Pounds 397,000) and earnings per share worked through at 0.64p (0.54p). The dividend is again 0.3p, although the previous total included a special 0.2p.</p>

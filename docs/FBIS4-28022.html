			<p>BFN     [Text] Dili, East Timor (JP) -- Government troops have  foiled a terror campaign launched by separatists that was  intended to coincide with a seminar on East Timor in Manila, the  military says.    Colonel Johny Lumintang, military commandant overseeing  security in East Timor, told journalists that the rebels  attacked citizens' houses and "ambushed people in the streets".    He put the number of those involved at "no less than 300"  but  declined to explain how the troops had dealt with them.    He said the separatists meant to use the planned Manila  seminar on East Timor to make the world aware of their existence.    "The clandestine movement's activities are confined to  distributing anti-government and pro-Fretilin [Revolutionary  Front for an Independent East Timor] (secession movement)  brochures," Lumintang said.    Recently, a number of separatists held an anti-integration  demonstration at Hotel Mahkota in Dili where a group of visiting  foreign journalists stayed, he said.    He said some of the demonstrators were arrested.</p>

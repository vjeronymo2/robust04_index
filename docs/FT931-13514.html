			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Eddie George to be governor of Bank of England: Positive reaction in the City Economist editor chosen as deputy MR EDDIE GEORGE was yes-terday appointed as the next governor of the Bank of England and said that, for the first time, the Bank had been given a clear mandate to support the government's fight against inflation. The announcement of his appointment as head of the UK central bank, made by the prime minister's office, ends several months of speculation about the successor to the present governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who has held the post since 1983 and retires in June. The new deputy governor will be Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, editor of The Economist magazine. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, said last night: 'I have made clear to the new governor that his responsibility should be to support the government in our determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation.' Mr George said he was delighted that for the first time the government had given the Bank a clear mandate to support it in the fight against inflation. Mr George, the current deputy governor, will be only the second governor drawn from the ranks of the Bank's staff. Aged 54, he joined the Bank in 1962 after leaving Cambridge University. His appointment to one of the most powerful - and best-paid - UK public sector positions had been widely predicted. The governor's pay in 1991 was Pounds 155,000. The choice of Mr Pennant-Rea, 45, as deputy governor was unexpected. He said last night he had been offered the job only yesterday morning. Mr Pennant-Rea, who worked at the Bank between 1973 and 1977, is a close friend of Mrs Sarah Hogg, head of the Downing Street policy unit. Mr George said of Mr Pennant-Rea's appointment that he 'recognised the case for bringing fresh air into the Bank'. Mr George will be in charge of advising the government on its inflation policy and fund-raising in the UK debt markets. He will also be the leading spokesman for the City's interests both domestically and internationally and will have overall responsibility for supervising UK banks. The choice of Mr George was made by Mr John Major, although Mr Leigh-Pemberton recommended his selection. The other leading candidate was Sir David Scholey, chairman of the merchant bank, SG Warburg. Downing Street signalled that Mr George's professional expertise and his easy relationship with Mr Major had been crucial factors in his appointment. One of Mr George's most important roles as deputy governor has been to advise the Treasury on how and when to intervene in currency markets. However, the prime minister had not blamed him for sterling's forced withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Mr George is generally regarded as a hawk on inflation. He had doubts about the wisdom of joining the ERM in 1990 but said last night that for 18 months the system had worked well. In the City, his appointment was greeted positively. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, said: 'He is a real professional. We have a high opinion of him.' Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said: 'Eddie is a very good choice. He is very straight and open to deal with.' The appointment was also welcomed by European central bankers and government officials as a sign that the Bank of England's stewardship would pass into a safe pair of hands. At Westminster, Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said the opposition 'would not quarrel' with the appointment. Mr George was 'well-respected and very competent'. What was important was 'not so much the governor as the role of the Bank in years to come.' Page 5 Resolute achiever at top Surprise as Bank deputy City approves choice Lex, Page 22</p>

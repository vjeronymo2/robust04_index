			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / People: Schroder Venture Advisers The new man at the top of Schroder Venture Advisers - one of the largest UK-based international venture capital groups - has a strong technology background. Peter Smitham, 51, took over as managing partner of the Schroders affiliate last week in the wake of the surprise resignation of Jon Moulton. Smitham, who joined Schroder Venture Advisers in 1985, spent his early career with ITT Europe, moved to Barclay Securities where he was involved in creating a pharmaceutical group from six acquisitions in two years, and later took over responsibility for Lex Service's European electronics business. This last job came about as a result of being a founder shareholder in a start-up electronics business called Jermyn Holdings, sold to Lex in 1983. Since moving into venture capital he has led 20 of SVA's 105 investments, including most of those involving electronics and information technology companies. One of his most successful deals was the management buy-out from Cambridge Electronics Industries of Roxboro Group, which went public in 1983.</p>

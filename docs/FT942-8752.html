			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Major pledges to stay on as leader Mr John Major has told close colleagues that he is determined to fight any challenge to his leadership whatever the results of next month's European elections. His decision to ride out the expected Tory defeats in the June 9 poll was taken two or three weeks before the death of John Smith, the Labour leader. It was followed by the strong pledges of loyalty offered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, at last week's Scottish conference. Mr Major's assurance that he will not resign has since been reinforced by the radical shift in the political landscape caused by Mr Smith's death. It ended a period in which colleagues had been uncertain how he would react to further assaults on his leadership. In earlier conversations the prime minister had left the impression that he might stand down. Ministers now hope the fall in the political temperature at Westminster will head off a disastrous performance in the European elections. Few expect the party to hold anything like the 32 seats it won in 1989, but talk of a collapse has subsided. Private opinion polling commissioned by Conservative Central Office suggests the party might hope for a share of the vote several points above the 28 per cent it recorded in this month's local elections. In spite of the party's bitter internal strife over Europe the polls also suggest it remains more trusted by the voters than either Labour or the Liberal Democrats to handle Britain's relations with the European Union. That has strengthened the resolve of ministers to focus as much as possible during the campaign on European issues. The party's manifesto - emphasising the government's commitment to a decentralised free-market Europe - will be launched by Mr Major on Monday. The opposition parties are expected to set out their platforms on the same day.</p>

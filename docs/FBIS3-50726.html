Robaina's goals include examining  and strengthening bilateral relations with each of those  countries. Robaina highlights the importance Cuba attributes to  its ties of friendship with the African nations, which  systematically express their support for the Revolution.    [Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1255 GMT on 6  January 94 adds that Robaina's delegation comprises Alberto  Rodriguez Arufe, foreign relations official of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba; Laureano Cardoso,  department chief of the Ministry of Foreign Relations; adviser  Domingo Garcia; and other personalities. One delegate pointed  out that the tour, precisely at the beginning of the year,  stresses the importance Havana gives to its traditional ties of  friendship with African nations. He also commented that African  nations systematically express their support of Cuba in numerous  international forums and that the economic importance of these  countries -- Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, with  approximately 3 million square km and a population of over 34  million -- cannot be dismissed. In addition, there are political  ties, particularly with Angola and Namibia, in whose  independence Cuba played a significant role. Robaina will return  to Havana on 23 January.]</p>

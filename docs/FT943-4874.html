			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Simpler payments to victims suggested Changes in the law to make it easier to pay damages in instalments to victims of personal injury are recommended in a report published yesterday by the Law Commission. The commission, which advises the government on law reform, says changes are needed that would allow insurers to buy annuities to make the payments direct to the victim tax-free. Many victims of accidents prefer the payment of some or all of the damages in instalments. These structured settlements often involve a lump sum up front, with payments for the rest of their lives. The commission says regular payments offer victims greater certainty about their financial future than a lump sum. Furthermore, they can be tailored to the victim's needs. The recommendations would allow the payments to be made direct to the injured person, without deduction of tax. The insurer would then be able to close its books on the case. The report also proposes that the victim should have the same rights under the Policyholders' Protection Act if the life company making the annuity payments collapses. The commission rejects giving power to the courts to order that damages be paid in structured form. It says that the voluntary system should be encouraged. Structured Settlements and Interim and Provisional Damages. HMSO. Pounds 12.85.</p>

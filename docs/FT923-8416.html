			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Credit boost for Argentine farmers ARGENTINA HOPES to increase farm output and exports with the announcement of about USDollars 300m of new low-cost, medium-term, revolving credit lines from state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA). President Carlos Menem announced the new measures on Saturday at Argentina's premier agricultural show. The government also hopes to have more long-term farm loans, provided by multilateral lending agencies, available by the first quarter of 1993. However, no details of the BNA package are available yet. The bank is expected to raise the money on the international financial markets. Nonetheless, Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an agricultural economist, said 'a group of small farms or a single large farm would be able to borrow money for 180 days at interest rates of about 9 to 12 per cent a year, if they commit themselves to export their production'. He said that the BNA, Argentina's largest bank, was lending at about 17 per cent a year. Nominal interest rates at private banks are even higher, ranging between 20 per cent and 60 per cent. Interest rates have dropped sharply as inflation has fallen to 19 per cent after the government pegged the currency at par to the US dollar in 1991. Still, financial costs are a heavy burden, and small farms are worst affected. Mr Sarachu calculates that financial charges average about 8 per cent of wheat producers' costs. Argentina's farmers are expected to spend Dollars 1.5bn to plant 16m hectares (40m acres) of grains this year. They are also investing more on new farm equipment, increasing the demand for credit. Argentina's farm grain exports have fallen steadily after reaching a peak in 1983 when exports brought in Dollars 3.23bn. Last year, exports were worth Dollars 2.05bn. Argentina, one of the world's lowest-cost farming nations, has been undercut by subsidised exports from the US and European Community. Domestic instability has made things even worse for farmers. Sudden economic recovery has led to a rapid increase in imports and Argentina's trade balance may go into the red for the first time since 1987. Any increase in farm exports would have an immediate positive impact on the trade account.</p>

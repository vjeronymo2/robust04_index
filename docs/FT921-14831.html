			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'West likely to build uranium flood barriers' WESTERN GOVERNMENTS might take action to stem the flood of uranium imports from the former Soviet Union, which had sent prices plummeting to 40-year lows, Mr Phillip Crowson suggested yesterday. He is chairman of a working party at the Uranium Institute that has produced the most detailed report ever on world uranium supply and demand. It suggests the uranium market would probably be in balance by the year 2,000 if it was not for exports from the former Soviet Union and China. At present those countries aim to export a total of 6,000 tonnes of uranium a year, or roughly 10 per cent of world demand. Mr Crowson, who is chief economic adviser at the RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining company, pointed out that the former Soviet Union already faced dumping allegations in the US, while the European Community was seeking to 'regulate' Soviet imports. The institute, which includes most western producers, utilities and merchants among its members, estimates that the former Soviet Union has 140,000 to 160,000 tonnes of uranium in stock. But this excludes highly enriched uranium for military purposes. Uranium has only one application - for nuclear energy. Demand depends entirely on nuclear generating capacity in the 25 countries using that form of power. Spot prices of uranium oxide, at under Dollars 9 a lb, are now well below the production costs of most mines. Prices peaked at Dollars 45 a lb in 1978. Uranium mines recently closed down in Canada, the US and in some east European countries. In 1990 mine output covered only 63 per cent of nuclear reactor requirements. The gap between the 28,340 tonnes produced and the 52,100 tonnes required by reactors was filled from stocks. These built up in the 1980s because the industry's earlier forecasts about world economic growth, demand for energy and the amount of electricity to be generated from nuclear capacity were much too optimistic. The report shows there are still 'excess' stocks at utilities of 40,000 to 80,000 tonnes and about 17,600 tonnes held by producers. The report forecasts that total world uranium requirements will grow by an annual average of 2.1 per cent to 64,000 tonnes in 2000. During the following ten years the growth rate will drop to 0.3 per cent to just over 66,000 tonnes in 2010. In comparison, mine output is forecast to rise from 28,340 tonnes last year to 32,600 tonnes in 1995 and then fall back to 22,900 tonnes by 2010. 'Overall it is reasonable to conclude that most of the excess inventories will have been drawn down by 1996-99, although some will continue in east Asia until 2005 and in Western Europe until 2010,' the report suggests. But there should be no shortages of uranium in the period to 2010, given that mines will have substantial spare capacity and that there are large stocks in China and the Soviet Union. Also, the report says, 'easing of east-west tensions has raised the possibility of the release of military nuclear material for use in civil reactors'. It adds, however, 'there are substantial hurdles to be overcome before this could occur and such transfers are most unlikely for several years at least'.

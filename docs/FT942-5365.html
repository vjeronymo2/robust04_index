			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Sport: The Indianapolis formula - Motor Racing Non-American motor racing fans, indoctrinated by the self-proclamation of Formula One that it is the pinnacle of motor racing, can only pause and take thought after visiting the 'Indianapolis 500'. Americans insist it is the world's greatest motor race. And they may have a point. The Indianapolis board does not need to woo Formula 1 for the right to stage a grand prix. Formula 1 is wooing it. This week, as the grand prix world continued fierce arguments over how to improve safety following the fatal crashes of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, many 'Indy' fans were still trekking thousands of miles across the US on their long way home from last Sunday's 78th running of the 500-mile race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. A subdued crowd of perhaps 30,000 watched Damon Hill inherit his first grand prix win of the season at Barcelona on Sunday, but, in the US, some 450,000 flocked to see Al Unser Jr win in his Marlboro Penske Mercedes after 500 miles at an average of nearly 200 mph. Of that total, just under 300,000 were in grandstand seats which cost as little as Dollars 25 - enough to admit an arm and maybe a leg for basic, standing-only admission to next month's British grand prix at Silverstone. Nearly 100 faces filled just one vertical row of grandstands which line most of the speedway's 2 1/2 miles. This is a 'live' spectator event without parallel; the next largest, the Le Mans 24-hour race, on a good year attracts 200,000. It awes first-time spectators and overawes new drivers - even of the calibre of Nigel Mansell, a rookie last year, and other top European drivers lured to north America's Indy Car series. All concede that it offers a challenge to driving skill and bravery with few parallels - even on the most testing grand prix of circuits such as Spa-Francorchamps. So, how can grand prix be considered the world championship if it does not include the world's fastest and most daunting motor race? Superficially, there appears no reason why both grand prix and Indy cars should not take to the track together. The Indy cars, for which the Indianapolis race is the biggest event across the US and Canada, look similar to grand prix cars. They have more power but this is offset by greater weight. In a straight line their performance would be similar but they lack the technical sophistication and cornering power of grand prix cars. But, says Tony Hulman George, the speedway's chief executive, grand prix cars are not designed to withstand impact with the concrete walls that line the circuit. Grand prix's engineers do not all agree; and both Max Mosley, president of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, the world governing body of motor sport, and Bernie Ecclestone, head of the Formula One Constructors' Association, say grand prix cars could be made compatible for this one race without unrealistic engineering effort. But on the commercial and political front, too, Indy's powers-that-be refuse to be intimidated. 'There are a lot of people in Europe who presume that Bernie not only walks on water but that he also owns the water,' said one Indy veteran who has also had a long involvement with grand prix racing. 'Well, Bernie might be starting to feel he needs Indianapolis but the speedway sure as hell doesn't need Bernie.' The Indianapolis 500 is more than capable of standing on its own feet. Even more grandstands and spectator facilities are to be added during the coming year, just as they have been almost continuously under the George family's nearly 50-year stewardship. The additions are still unlikely to be enough: the 1995 race ticket order forms warn new applicants to seek only the cheapest Dollars 25 tickets, the others are already allocated. Yet haltingly and warily - and after a breakdown in negotiations two years ago - grand prix and the Indianapolis authorities might soon be once again groping towards a rapprochement. They are still far apart, and George says that his talks with Ecclestone have not been resumed. But quietly, George and his speedway board have redesigned and landscaped the enormous infield - in which the full-sized golf course is almost lost. A grand prix circuit, combining a long stretch of the oval course and some classic grand prix corners, is in place. All that is missing are the grandstands and George makes clear that he would be prepared to build them. George dismisses the idea that the two types of car will ever run together again around the speedway - even though it was the lightweight rear-engined grand prix cars of the late Jim Clark and Graham Hill which ended the reign of Indy's front-engined monsters in the 1960s. He nevertheless insists that: 'I'm prepared to consider making a decent, permanent home for a US round of the grand prix championship here. Such an event could, he hints, be only two or three years away, but would depend on a more flexible approach from Foca and from Ecclestone, who has a well-earned reputation as a hard financial bargainer. 'If it happens it's going to be on our terms,' says George. There is another pointer to change. In August the speedway will host a big Nascar stock car race. It is the first time an event other than the 500 will have been held there. The breaking of such a long-hallowed tradition could well be the harbinger of the grand prix to come.</p>

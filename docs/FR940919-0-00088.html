			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments received on the Agency's proposal to remove this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition from the exclusion were favorable. Although several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters said that the Agency should go further in modifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing regulations to encourage the recycling of hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes, such an action is beyond the scope of this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such further action could result from the efforts currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underway to reevaluate the regulations applicable to hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste recycling (i.e., the Roundtable discussions undertaken by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Definition of Solid Waste Task Force). One commenter also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urged the Agency to make regulatory modifications only as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Definition of Solid Waste Task Force. EPA does not view the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salutary and relatively modest change to the rules promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> here as undermining the Task Force effort, and so is adopting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the Agency is today removing this condition (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the process be a primary production process) from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``closed-loop'' recycling exclusion. By doing this, secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials that are recycled back into the secondary production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process from which they were generated are excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of solid waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the same reasoning, the Agency proposed and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today finalizing a modification to section 260.30(b), a related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-by-case variance for materials that are reclaimed prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reuse in the original primary production process from which they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were generated (see 50 FR 652 (January 4, 1985) for a discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the existing variance). This modification similarly expands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the variance to make it available for materials that are returned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to secondary processes, as well as those returned to primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Storage Prior to Recycling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At proposal, the Agency proposed to condition the ``closed- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loop'' exclusion (and the related 260.30(b) variance) such that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary materials recycled back into secondary processes from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they were generated would continue to be managed in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally sound manner. The Agency proposed this condition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to address concerns that, absent this condition, a listed waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would otherwise be required to be managed in a protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner (e.g., without direct placement on the land) could begin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be managed in an unprotective manner because, as an excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary material, no regulatory requirements would apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Storage of hazardous secondary materials on the land can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed to be a type of discarding (``part of the waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem'' in the words of the D.C. Circuit), and hence provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for classifying the materials as solid and hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AMC II,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 907 F.2d at 1187. The only comments received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing this proposed condition asked for more clarification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of what would be considered ``a protective manner.'' The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is promulgating the condition to the exclusion that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary materials be managed in a protective manner such that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is no placement on the land, that is no land disposal as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in &sect;3004(k). See &sect;261.4(a)(10) and (11) where EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attached this same condition to comparable exclusions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management that is designed to contain the material or otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent its release to the environment, such as in a containment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building (see 40 CFR 264.1100) or tank, is permissible. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency believes that this condition will not require any changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in how these secondary materials are currently managed and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that providing regulatory relief will not unintentionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase risk to human health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional changes were proposed and are being promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rule in order to implement and be consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in variances discussed above. Previously the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator granted variances from classification as a solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste in 40 CFR 260.30, 260.31, 260.32, and 260.33. Today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfers this authority to grant variances from the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator to the Administrator. The changes in &sect;&sect;260.30 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 260.31 are necessary because such variances involve determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA jurisdiction over secondary materials going to secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes. The other changes in authority to grant variances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;260.32 and 260.33 are being made in order to be consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the provisions of &sect;&sect;260.30 and 260.31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Compliance Monitoring and Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Compliance Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, the Agency is adopting an approach that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow generators and facilities that manage organic toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic (TC) wastes in systems other than those regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Clean Water Act (CWA), those engaged in CWA-equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment prior to land disposal, and those injecting into Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I deep injection wells, to monitor or otherwise determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of underlying hazardous constituents ``reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be present'' in their waste. (See definition at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.2(i).) This means that regulated entities do not have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ascertain the presence of all hazardous constituents for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is promulgating a universal treatment standard. Generators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may base this determination on their knowledge of the raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials they use, the process they operate, and the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaction products of the process, or upon the results of a one-time analysis for the entire list of constituents at &sect;268.48.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency solicited comment on whether generators should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to do some testing of organic TC wastes to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what underlying hazardous constituents are present and whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they meet UTS. Furthermore, the Agency noted that generators who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also treat (including generators who decharacterize their waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but do not treat for underlying hazardous constituents) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as treaters, and would therefore be required to do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some analysis of their wastes pursuant to &sect;268.7(b) and prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a treater's certification pursuant to &sect;268.9(d) (58 FR 48134).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters believed that generators should have to test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their organic TC wastes at least once. Most commenters on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue, however, strongly opposed a generator testing requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and said that generators should be allowed to use knowledge of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their wastes to make such a determination. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, and the Agency's reluctance to require generator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of characteristic wastes but not listed wastes, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency is not imposing a testing requirement on generators of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic TC wastes at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

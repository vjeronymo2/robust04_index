			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: First-half advance at Citic Pacific CITIC PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Beijing's China International Trust and Investment Corporation, yesterday announced a steep rise in first-half profits and an increase in the interim dividend. Net profit for the six months ended June advanced by 83 per cent to HKDollars 802.3m (USDollars 103.6m) from HKDollars 439.5m a year earlier. The interim dividend is going up from 8.2 cents a share to 10 cents. The results included a maiden contribution from the company's 12 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications purchased from China International in January for HKDollars 10.4bn. The purchase was funded through a share placement. The rise in half-year earnings per share was therefore limited to 22 per cent, to 47.8 cents. Operating profit more than doubled to HKDollars 503m, primarily due to a strong performance from the trading operations at Dah Chong Hong (DCH). The company almost doubled car sales in China, although Chinese austerity measures are likely to hit the current six months. DCH is the one investment to which Citic has added significant value, with more than half of its new car sales now going to China. In addition, the group has expanded DCH's trading and retail businesses into the mainland and has taken a 51 per cent stake in a children's food factory in Shanghai. Contributions from associates rose from HKDollars 314m to HKDollars 495m, primarily due to Hong Kong Telecom, and to the performance of Dragonair, which has seen earnings soar on the back of sharply increased business air traffic between Hong Kong and China. This was partly offset by the 46 per cent drop in earnings from Citic's 12.5 per cent stake in Cathay Pacific. Citic is negotiating to buy a 25 per cent stake in a power plant in Shanghai to add to its power project investments in Henan and Jiangsu provinces. It has also taken 25 per cent of a joint venture with Japanese manufacturer Isuzu to assemble trucks in China's most populous province, Sichuan.</p>

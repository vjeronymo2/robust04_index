			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News in Brief: BNP hopes to promote talks between insurers MR RENE Thomas, the chairman of France's state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris, said he would like to promote co-operation between Union des Assurances de Paris and Germany's largest insurer, Allianz, Reuter reports from Paris. 'If UAP so desires, we would like to promote dialogue between these two insurance companies,' he said. Allianz has a 22.3 per cent stake in Germany's Dresdner Bank and the firms have a marketing co-operation accord. BNP is aiming for a 10 per cent share swap with Dresdner in 1993 and has a cross-stake and a marketing agreement with UAP. ***** FIAT, the Italian carmaker, has confirmed it will close its Chivasso plant in northern Italy from September and will lay off a total of 5,600 workers, Reuter reports from Milan. Fiat was committed to re-hire 3,600 carworkers within three years at other plants. However, the company made no commitment regarding a further 2,000 white collar workers employed at the plant and other locations. ***** BANCO Central Hispano is launching a public tender offer for 5.7 per cent of the Spanish insurer Banco Vitalicio de Seguros through its joint venture with the Italian insurance giant Generali Assicurazioni, AP-DJ reports from Madrid.

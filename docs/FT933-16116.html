			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Brazil tariff cuts begin THE last round of Brazilian tariff reductions under former President Fernando Collor's import liberalisation programme have come into operation but they could be the last cuts until 1995, if leading politicians, business people and labour officials get their way. The average tariff dropped to 14 per cent, down from 17.1 per cent. The standard tariff, charged for the greatest number of products, fell to 20 per cent, and the maximum rate was reduced to 35 per cent. Brazil's next scheduled revision is set for January 1995 under the Southern Cone Common Market umbrella, when Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are to establish a unified external tariff system. Business leaders have been insistent that tariff reductions should be put on hold until there is a recovery in the Brazilian economy. They are also urging the government to reduce tax rates and infrastructure costs. Mr Luiz Fernando Furlan, international director for the Sao Paulo Federation of Industry (FIESP), the country's leading business group says: 'The factors that burden production are rooted in the government.' Politicians and officials from the administration of President Itamar Franco are cautious over further import liberalisation. Rising imports and actions against Brazilian exporters, such as anti-dumping action by the US against steel producers, have been adding fuel to the debate over trade. Since last year, Brazilian chemical and petrochemical producers have been increasingly vociferous in their calls for more anti-dumping regulations. Some industries, including textiles and automobiles, are calling for import quotas, arguing that these would reflect international practices.</p>

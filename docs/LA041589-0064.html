			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NICE DOGGIE;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD'S 'BIG WHITE DOG' TURNS OUT TO BE A BIG BAD WOLF  </P> <P> Homeowners around Encino Reservoir probably won't be comforted to learn that  the "big white dog" they complained about to the Department of Animal  Regulation, saying it was running wild in the neighborhood and ate a pet  rabbit, wasn't there at all.  </P> <P> That's right, no dog.  </P> <P> Just a wolf.  </P> <P> When Animal Regulation Officer Dennis Krouplin checked the bring-em-back-alive  trap that officers had set for the "dog" in a brushy area of the Santa Monica  Mountains, he found a white wolf, Animal Regulation Lt. Fred Michael said.  </P> <P> "He was a little bit surprised," Michael added. "That's the first wolf we've  ever found in the Valley that I know of."  </P> <P> The wolf, a full-grown female, weighs "about 90 to 100 pounds," said Thomas R.  Walsh, the department's district supervisor.  </P> <P> Because the nearest wild wolves live far away in Alaska or Minnesota, the  department presumes that the wolf was somebody's pet and escaped or was turned  loose, Walsh said. And the officers hope to find out who the owner was, he  said, partly because they want to discuss the wolf's future and partly because  it is illegal to keep wolves in the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "You need a special permit to keep a wild animal like that, and in the city of  Los Angeles, we won't issue a permit for a wolf," Michael said.  </P> <P> There are no such permits outstanding, he said, and possession of the wolf in  the city limits without one "is a misdemeanor, carrying a fine up to $500 and  up to six months in jail."  </P> <P> If no one claims her, the wolf will be offered to the Los Angeles Zoo, which  will probably reject her because "the zoo worries about disease from animals  that come from the outside," Walsh said. The department will try to find a  legal home for her, he said, but would have to destroy her if none can be  found.  </P> <P> "We can't turn her loose," he said.  </P> <P> The wolf was taken to the West Valley Animal Shelter. She is "very shy and  withdrawn," Walsh said, "but she isn't hysterical, the way a truly wild animal  would be if it were caged. So I'm presuming she is accustomed to people and has  been under control in the past."  </P> <P> She has, however, been loose in the neighborhood around the southern end of  Calneva Drive on the east side of the reservoir for almost two months, Walsh  said. "The residents up there have been reporting her, and our officers have  seen her a few times, but they could never get close to her."  </P> <P> She apparently lived by hunting wild rabbits, ground squirrels, opossums and  quail in the uninhabited brush around the reservoir, Walsh said. But after a  family reported that the "dog" ate their pet rabbit, officers put out a large  cage, baited with food, with a door that snaps closed on the animal, trapping  it without hurting it.  </P> <P> Actually, Walsh said, some officers who sighted the animal thought that it  looked like a wolf,  </P> <P> but the possibility was dismissed.  </P> <P> "Everybody just said, "Naaah, it's probably some kind of mixed breed German  shepherd." The animal is not a crossbreed, not even a mixture of dog and wolf,  he said. "This is obviously a purebred wolf."  </P> <P> He added that it is a good thing that dogs, coyotes and wolves usually prefer  to stick to their own kind for romance.  </P> <P> "If she interbred with all the coyotes we have out there, we might have a hell  of a new kind of coyote around here."  </P></p>

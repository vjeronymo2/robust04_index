			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Mandarin Oriental fall by 17% MANDARIN Oriental, the Hong Kong-based luxury hotel arm of the Jardine Matheson group, has announced a 17.3 per cent drop in net profit for 1992 to Dollars 37.4m, compared with Dollars 45.2m in 1990. This was the second consecutive earnings decline for Mandarin following a 10.3 per cent profits fall in 1990. Turnover in 1991 rose 3 per cent to Dollars 127.2m. Mr Robert Riley, managing director, said there had been an improvement in the hotel market in the first two months of the year, with profitability at a similar level to 1990. The 1991 figures were in line with expectations, given the impact of the Gulf war, the increase in competition from luxury hotels on Hong Kong island and the global recession. The group's hotels in Hong Kong and Bangkok were hit hard last year, but Manila, Jakarta and Macau succeeded in increasing profit contribution. The company announced a final dividend of 3.59 cents per share, making a full year pay-out of 5 cents, the same as 1992. The company also said it would apply for a primary listing in London, if the Hong Kong Stock Exchange goes ahead with changes to the secondary listing rules.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Electrolux down sharply despite better last quarter ELECTROLUX, the world's largest white goods manufacturer, yesterday reported steeply lower profits for 1991 despite a substantial final-quarter improvement. Fourth-quarter profits (after adjustment for capital gains and restructuring costs) rose 18 per cent to SKr335m (Dollars 57.9m) from SKr284m for the same period of 1990. The company said operating income after depreciation increased slightly in the quarter to SKr482m from SKr386m. For 1991 as a whole, profits (after financial items) tumbled by 27 per cent to SKr1.025bn. The result was better than many analysts expected. Group income benefited from SKr250m in capital gains from divestments. Sales fell by 1 per cent in 1991 to SKr79.1bn. Earnings per share after full tax declined to SKr5.50 from SKr10.10, while return on equity after full tax fell to 2.4 per cent from 4.3 per cent. The dividend is being held at SKr12.50 a share. Electrolux said the dividend decision should be seen against the background of the good long-term prospects for core operations and the substantial investments that have been made in recent years in terms of production facilities and new generations of products. Electrolux added that lower capital expenditure and efficient capital management had generated a positive cash-flow last year and additional improvement was expected during 1992 as a result of the SKr901m restructuring programme. This has involved the closure of 10 large plants and around 15,000 job losses since it began in the second half of 1990. It is estimated that the company has saved SKr3bn through rationalisation. The improvement in the fourth-quarter results stemmed from a slight increase in sales in household goods and outdoor products. But Electrolux said there had been a substantial decline in operating income for industrial products, mainly due to the performance of the Granges aluminium product subsidiary. Commercial services showed a downturn in the final three months. Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals group Neste has formed a joint venture with Conoco and Catalytica, both of the US.</p>

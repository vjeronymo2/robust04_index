			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / US judges dismiss Barclays' challenge on unitary tax law The US Supreme Court rebuffed international pressure to outlaw California's controversial worldwide unitary system for assessing corporate income taxes yesterday, dismissing challenges brought by Barclays Bank of the UK and Colgate-Palmolive of the US. Californian fiscal experts do not expect the state, which has introduced an opt-out, to force companies to use the unitary method, but British companies and tax professionals were concerned that the decision might prompt other US states or other countries to impose the system. Under unitary assessment, tax is calculated on a proportion of a company's worldwide income instead of only on income earned in the state. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in an opinion written on behalf of the 7-2 majority, said Barclays had not demonstrated that the tax discriminated against foreign commerce, nor that it imposed an undue compliance burden on foreign companies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said last night he was 'disappointed'. 'The government has always strongly opposed the imposition of worldwide unitary tax on UK-owned companies and supported Barclays throughout this litigation.' He gave a warning that the UK would retain its retaliatory powers in case the US took steps that might harm UK companies. The ruling embraced two actions, one by Barclays and another by Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products company, which challenged an earlier ruling that the unitary method could also be applied to US companies. Barclays, which has waged a 17-year legal battle against the unitary tax system, expressed disappointment at the decision but said it was still 'chewing over' the 'very long and very detailed' text of the judgment. The ruling comes as a huge relief to California, which is in the middle of one of its perennial budget crises and had counted on a favourable decision. Although tax officials expect that only about Dollars 500m will actually be collected, the ruling means California will not have to refund Dollars 1.4bn it has already taken. Although unitary tax conflicts with the tax method embraced by the US federal government and by international tax treaties, the court said California's use of the method did not infringe Congress's sole right, under the US constitution, to 'regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states'. Legal experts said the decision showed the court's determination to leave matters of policy up to Congress, even when, as in the Barclays case, Congress has indicated its stance only by rejecting Administration requests to legislate against unitary tax. 'I think the lesson of this case is that unless a tax is clearly unfair in its application the court is going to defer to Congress,' said Mr Jerome Libin, a partner in the law firm of Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan, which represented the UK government against the unitary tax. California last year passed a new tax law which essentially did away with compulsory unitary taxation by allowing companies to choose instead a 'water's edge' assessment, in which only income within the US is taxed. Mr Tony Hughes, an international tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in London, said: 'I don't expect to see any retaliation because there is not much at stake.' California governor Pete Wilson's budget package had counted on a favourable ruling. UK frustration, Page 7</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report of interview with Eastern Airlines Vice President </F> Xiao Liyuan (5618 4539 0337) by staff reporter Chiu I (5941  3015) in Shanghai on 21 February: "Eastern Airlines Plans To  Have Its Shares Listed on the U.S. Stock Market"]    [Text] Shanghai, 21 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- As one of the two  aviation companies among the second batch of Chinese state  enterprises which had their shares listed on the overseas stock  market, China Eastern Airlines Inc. [CEA Inc.] will seek a  listing on the U.S. stock market, hoping to raise nearly 1  billion dollars. This move has attracted much attention. Today,  this reporter interviewed CEA Inc. Vice President Xiao Liyuan,  who is in charge of the reform oriented to the joint-stock  system. He spoke about listing preparations and the company's  profile.  <H5>  An Appraisal of Property and Funds Has Been Completed </H5>   Xiao Liyuan said: China Eastern Airlines [CEA] is a core  enterprise of CEA Inc., the latter being one of the 55 large  enterprise groups approved by the State Council. At the moment,  a reform is going on toward a joint-stock system, focusing on  the company's air transport services, and preparations are being  made to seek an overseas listing. The company has completed its  internal appraisal of property and funds and has contacted  intermediary organizations abroad, one of which will be  designated before the end of this month, and the asset appraisal  required for the listing can be carried out immediately. Xiao  Liyuan said that the preparations for the listing can be  expected to complete within six months.  <H5>  Total Assets of 11.5 Billion Yuan </H5>   Xiao Liyuan said: CEA now has 69 passenger and cargo  aircraft of world standard and the models include MD-11, MD-11F,  A300-600R, A310-300, MD-82, and FK-100, most of which are on  charter. It has opened over 100 air routes connecting such  countries as the United States, Japan, Bahrain, Belgium, Spain,  the ROK, Thailand, and Singapore; the Hong Kong region; and over  50 cities within China. The total assets of the company amount  to 11.5 billion yuan. In 1993, the company had over 7,000  employees. At the moment, the CEA's Shanghai line has nearly  400 pilots, mostly graduates of the Civil Aviation Flying School  with subsequent training abroad. Each year, they go to Europe  or the United States for retraining in flight simulators to keep  up their professionalism. The total transportation turnover is  850 million tonne-km; 5.5 million passengers have been handled;  the cargo and postal volume amounts to 140,000 tonne; the  average annual utilization ratio of the seating capacity is over  70 percent; the income from mainline operations is 3.467 billion  yuan; foreign exchange earnings are $374.88 million; and all its  economic indexes measure up to the tradewide advanced levels  within China. In the first half of last year, CEA Inc. came  first on the Civil Aviation Administration of China's profit  chart for all aviation companies in the country.  <H5>  Focusing on Developing International Business </H5>   Speaking on the distribution of air routes, Xiao Liyuan said  that before the European and American routes were opened, the  CEA focused on short-distance international and regional routes.  But now, the company has completed its conversion into an  international aviation company. In 1993, the income from  international flights accounted for 65 percent of the company's  total turnover, the corresponding figure in 1992 being 60  percent. In the future, CEA will continue to expand its  operations on international routes and strive to be an  enterprise with a relatively high degree of competitiveness  among international airlines and measures up to world advanced  levels.    Xiao Liyuan said: Despite the fact that international  aviation is in recession and the demand on China's domestic air  market remains brisk, CEA is continuing to expand its  international operations. Some other airlines in the world have  found this hard to understand. Xiao Liyuan explained that  first, the international routes that CEA covers are profitable  and are in the ascendant. Second, as China's opening up to the  outside world is continually expanding, the growth in  international exchanges is bound to increase business volume.  Moreover, Shanghai's strategic goal beyond this century is to  become an international financial, trade, and economic center,  which also requires a matching international aviation company  and CEA is duty bound to contribute to it. In the meantime,  CEA's measures on its domestic routes will focus on  redistributing its transportation capacity, concentrating on the  profitable ones rather than reducing the scope.    Facing the highly competitive international air transport  market, Xiao Liyuan believes that the most competitive asset CEA  has is its low operation cost. This is especially true with the  cost of employees, which is merely one-tenth of that of some  foreign airlines. The major cost outlays are for fuel and  aircraft maintenance. Xiao Liyuan said that because the average  service age of the CEA's fleet is under seven years, heavy  repairs are not yet necessary. CEA is now able to carry out  overhauls on the MD82 independently. To improve the company's  aircraft maintenance capabilities, it is planning to build a new  hangar, which will be the biggest in the Far East, and gradually  enable itself to conduct independent D [in Roman script]-tests  on all large aircraft.  <H5>  Combining Exchange Rates Has No Major Impact </H5>   Xiao Liyuan said: The funds CEA Inc. wants to raise by  listing its shares on the U.S. stock market will mainly be used  to: Buy new passenger jumbo jets suited to intercontinental  flight; repay the interest for aircraft chartering and other  liabilities; improve the company's aircraft servicing  capabilities; and update its servicing equipment. Xiao Liyuan  said: Two A300's will be delivered in 1994 and two more will be  purchased in 1995. Besides, there is also a tentative plan to  buy a certain number of A340's. Xiao believed that because the  CEA has been successful in earning foreign exchange and adjusted  the fares after the exchange rates were combined, the reform of  the exchange rate system has not had much impact on it. However,  he also said that the ongoing tax reform has set the income tax  rate for all enterprises at a flat 3 percent, though the CEA's  income tax rate used to be 18 percent. The company is still  trying to keep the old rate.</p>

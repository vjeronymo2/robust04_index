			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned from  reliable sources reached by telephone in Djibouti that the  family of Muhammad 'Ali al-Qayrahi, one of the secessionist  leaders in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and families of  some other YSP officials, had arrived in Djibouti three days  ago. The sources added that as part of the exodus from Aden to  Djibouti, a Russian ship carrying a number of families,  including the families of some officials implicated in the  secessionist plot led by YSP rebels against legitimacy, headed  by traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid, arrived at Djibouti port  yesterday. The sources said the quarters that receive and  accommodate these families deliberately disembarked some  ordinary passengers and families from the ship for camouflage  purposes and kept the families of ranking YSP figures on the  ship until darkness as a security precaution and for fear of  their being identified.    The secessionist, mutinous leaders are sending their  families  abroad, leaving the Aden people and their families as well as  the misled and helpless ones in the Armed Forces to face dangers  alone and serve as human shields to secure these leaders' escape  and reunion with their families after having become certain that  Aden's fall is imminent and that they will fall into the hands  of the forces of unity and legitimacy.</p>

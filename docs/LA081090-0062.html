			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN AIRS AD ATTACKING WILSON ON THE S&amp;L ISSUE  </P> <P> The campaign for governor exploded into rancor Thursday when, in a risky  strategic move, Dianne Feinstein launched television ads criticizing Republican  Pete Wilson for accepting money from savings and loan executives -- and  implying that Wilson's income resulted in votes that harmed taxpayers.  </P> <P> Enraged, Wilson likened Democrat Feinstein's tactics to red-baiting  "McCarthyism" and demanded that the 30-second commercials be taken off the air.  </P> <P> Assuming that Feinstein will refuse to do so, Wilson announced plans to take to  the airwaves shortly in self-defense -- perhaps beginning a wholesale political  barrage months earlier than expected.  </P> <P> "However juicy the issue, she has got the wrong man," Wilson declared angrily  at a late-afternoon press conference in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Feinstein's move to try to tar Wilson with one of the season's most fiery  issues -- the multibillion-dollar savings and loan conflagration -- came  suddenly and surreptitiously.  </P> <P> Without releasing the advertisements to reporters -- as her campaign had  throughout the primary season -- Feinstein began airing the spots late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The ads were released despite Feinstein's own past assertions that she has no  evidence that Wilson intervened on behalf of the S&amp;Ls during his eight-year  tenure in the Senate. Wilson, unlike Democrat Alan Cranston, has not been  accused of acting on behalf of any scandal-ridden thrift.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Feinstein took the approach that Wilson's absence from  the scandal is as much an indictment of his tenure in the Senate as  intervention would have been.  </P> <P> "Sen. Wilson's duty to the citizens of California was not to sit by and watch  as the S&amp;L scandal unfolded," she said. "And his excuse that he did nothing  isn't good enough. . . . The people want a public official to perform the  duties they were elected to do and not use public office as a steppingstone to  your next job."  </P> <P> The ad implies a connection between Wilson's behavior and his receipt of  $243,000 in contributions from the thrift industry.  </P> <P> Wilson joined the Senate after the thrift industry was deregulated -- the  policy decision blamed for much of the industry's collapse -- and in two major  votes on a federal bailout, he voted against the industry's wishes.  </P> <P> The issue has emerged as a potent one during this year's elections across the  country, where it has been pitched like a grenade between Republicans and  Democrats. The decline of dozens of thrifts across the nation has been splashed  across newspapers and television screens, and the cost to taxpayers of bailing  out failed institutions now is estimated at $500 billion. Voter surveys taken  by political campaigns, including Feinstein's, have shown the electorate to be  highly interested in fixing blame for the costs.  </P> <P> The former San Francisco mayor was fund raising in Northern California Thursday  and could not be reached for comment apart from the prepared statement. But her  most recent remarks about Wilson's role with the S&amp;L crisis -- in which she  said that she did not have any evidence of wrongdoing -- were seized upon by  Wilson as a defense.  </P> <P> "There is no evidence that I have intervened on behalf of anyone, because I  haven't," Wilson said. "Mrs. Feinstein knows that and yet she persists. . . .  The people of this state are entitled to have as governor someone whose  personal ethics can withstand the pressures that apparently she has succumbed  to.  </P> <P> "This is simply innuendo of a kind that we used to call McCarthyism."  </P> <P> Wilson suggested that by launching the advertisement now, Feinstein was hoping  to manipulate public opinion polls and then use the polls to encourage  donations to her campaign.  </P> <P> But Feinstein's campaign manager denied any such intent and defended the use of  the commercial. "I don't have any idea when those polls are starting up," Bill  Carrick said.  </P> <P> The decision to run the commercials is risky for Feinstein, in part because it  virtually depletes her campaign bank accounts. At the close of the last  financial reporting period, Feinstein had about $650,000 on hand. The Wilson  campaign estimates that she has since reserved in the neighborhood of $800,000  in television time.  </P> <P> Carrick would not disclose how close to the financial brink the campaign has  come, but did acknowledge that the budget was tight.  </P> <P> "We'll be driving on fumes from here till Nov. 6," Carrick said.  </P> <P> The campaign manager indicated that the advertisement was released because  Feinstein's forces fear that unless they become aggressive, they could cede  momentum to Wilson. Wilson has been attempting to chip away at Feinstein since  the primary with a series of commercials criticizing her record and recent  statements.  </P> <P> "There's a concern, which is basically that that tone of the campaign was set  by the Wilson campaign," Carrick said. "The lessons of the 1988 presidential  campaign are pretty clear. We're not going to sit back the month of August and  do a Michael Dukakis imitation."  </P> <P> Dukakis entered August of 1988 with a lead in the polls of as much as 17  points, then watched it decline as George Bush went on the attack. The  Democratic effort has since become something of an exemplar in how not to run a  campaign.  </P></p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Observer: Waxing matters Has Britain's recently married food minister, Nicholas Soames, taken his eye off the ball? A set of draft regulations about mineral hydrocarbons are bubbling to the surface in Soames' department and are causing a bit of a stir amongst his buddies in the landed gentry. Soames' officials have long been concerned about the harmful effects of these compounds in foodstuffs. The plan is to ban almost all of them, but to continue to permit their use in defeathering waterfowl, coating cheese and in chewing gum. All fine and dandy, except that the only two kinds of mineral hydrocarbon to be allowed - high melting point microcrystalline wax and high sulphur microcrystalline wax - are not, according to those who are supposed to know, remotely suitable for the aforementioned processes.</p>

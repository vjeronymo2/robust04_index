			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bidding dispute over Paramount The two protagonists in the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications became embroiled in a complex dispute over bidding procedures yesterday, as QVC Network called on the Paramount board to declare the latest offer from rival Viacom in violation of the rules and take appropriate action. QVC said it would await the action of the Paramount board, which is to consider the Viacom offer tomorrow before deciding what action to take. Observers said that if it did not win the support of the Paramount board, QVC might go to the courts in an attempt to block the Viacom offer. Viacom unveiled its new bid - as well as an Dollars 8.4bn merger agreement with video rental company Blockbuster Entertainment - on Friday night, shortly before the expiry of QVC's tender offer for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's shares. Viacom increased the value of its cash offer for 50.1 per cent of Paramount to Dollars 105 a share, compared with QVC's Dollars 92, but it cut sharply the value of the securities being offered for the remainder. Traders said that Viacom's stock and shares offer for 100 per cent of Paramount remained below QVC's offer. QVC, which announced yesterday that its tender had attracted 26.8m Paramount shares - more than 20 per cent of the total - argues that Viacom broke the bidding rules by launching an offer inferior to the one it had on the table. In spite of this, QVC yesterday extended its bid to January 21, the same closing date as Viacom's latest tender, as it is required to do under the bidding rules. There had been hints that QVC might try to close its bid earlier than this. Viacom argues that its current offer is superior to QVC's and it has fully complied with the bidding procedures.</p>

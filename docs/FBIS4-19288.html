			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["norb"-signed report: "Vranitzky and Mock Are Courting </F> Strasbourg"]    [Text] Brussels/Vienna -- Foreign Minister Alois Mock in  Brussels on Wednesday [13 April] advocated a stronger European  Parliament [EP]. Austria would actively support this as a  member of the European Union [EU], Mock said before the group of  the European People's Party. On the same day, the 800-page text  of the treaty of accession was delivered to the members of  parliament. Mock appealed to the deputies: "Vote for Austria  on 4 May! In this way, you will create the decisive  prerequisite for us to jointly develop the Europe of tomorrow."    Chancellor Franz Vranitzky also wooed the Europeans. In a  letter, the Social Democratic Party of Austria chairman politely  asked his party colleagues to advocate sufficient participation  of the Social Democratic members of the European Parliament in  the decisive vote.    Moreover, Vranitzky asked Vice Chancellor Busek to step in  for him at the hearing of the four candidate countries before  the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday, since he will  be unable to attend because of his meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Recession and price wars hit Provigo PROVIGO, Canada's second -largest food distributor, was hit by the recession and east Canada price wars in the fourth quarter ended January 25. Net profit was CDollars 6.2m (USDollars 5.21m) or 7 cents a share on sales of CDollars 1.5bn, down from CDollars 15.1m or 18 cents a share on sales of CDollars 1.6bn a year earlier. For the full year, Provigo earned CDollars 49.3m or 57 cents a share, up from CDollars 700,000 or 1 cent a share a year earlier after special charges, on sales of CDollars 6.7bn, up 3 per cent. Provigo said fiscal 1993 would be another difficult year due to the recession. He denied rumours that Provigo may team up with Loblaw, Canada's largest food distributor, to buy part of the loss-making Steinberg supermarket group in east Canada. Imasco, the tobacco, fast-food retailing and financial services group, plans to raise CDollars 150m by an issue of 10-year debentures in Canada.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance  Movement, Hamas, has issued an important statement on recent  developments in light of the political perspective set forth by  the movement, the various official and media reactions to this  perspective, and the statements made by the U.S. secretary of  state, enemy officials, and officials of other states.    The statement asserts that the valiant popular resistance  will be stepped up, and that jihad and military operations  against the Zionist enemy will continue as long as the Zionist  enemy continues to occupy our blessed Palestinian territories.  The pursuit of this approach will continue until the liberation  of all of our usurped Palestinian territories from the  Mediterranean to the Jordan River.    The statement also underscored that the negotiations between  the 'Arafat leadership and the Zionist entity are doomed to  failure, because they were based on consecrating injustice,  aggression, and occupation. The statement noted that the  statements and communiques issued by the Political Bureau of the  Islamic Resistance Movement have not contained what some  attempted to promote, namely, that the movement recognizes the  usurpative Zionist entity or accepts UN Security Council  Resolution 242, or that it has abandoned its own platform as  well as its noble Islamic constants, which deem Palestine to be  Islamic territory whose abandonment is forbidden, and over which  there can be no bargaining.    Concluding its statement, the Islamic Resistance Movement  has  reiterated that it, along with all sincere elements of our  people, will persist in the jihad and valiant resistance to the  savage Zionist enemy along the path of victory and liberation.</p>

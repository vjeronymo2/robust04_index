			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. FARMERS BAZAAR GETS BACK TO BUSINESS  </P> <P> The Farmers Bazaar, closed last May after a devastating fire, will resume full  operation at a new downtown San Diego location next month.  </P> <P> As did the former market, the new Farmers Bazaar will aspire to offer shoppers  a cornucopia of fresh produce, meat and fish. Restaurants and jewelry shops are  also planned. The new warehouse at K Street and 7th Avenue is next to the  original Farmers Bazaar location, now a parking lot for the new market.  </P> <P> The market has operated at limited capacity since June and now offers only  produce and flowers. By mid-March, however, 18 vendors will occupy the  20,000-square-foot market.  </P> <P> "By the middle of February we should have a jewelry store," said George May,  the supervisor of the operation. "By the first of March, we should have the  restaurants in, and we should be going full force by the middle of March."  </P> <P> Even after the other tenants have moved in, the main attraction will remain the  produce, May said.  </P> <P> From rapini, a green spice used in Italian sauces, to Asian pears, whose taste  and texture are similar to a cross between an apple and a pear, to four  different kinds of squash, the La Cresta Market at the bazaar offers a large  selection of produce at prices that customers believe are significantly lower  than those charged by supermarkets.  </P> <P> "You get good buys, and they're awfully good and fresh," said Wynne Flack, a  part-time San Diego resident from Canada. "You've got such a good choice here,  better than the markets. . . . We've got nothing like this in Canada."  </P> <P> The roll-up doors, cement floor and large, institutional lamps hanging from the  30-foot ceiling reflect the bazaar's warehouse origins. But they do not seem to  deter shoppers.  </P> <P> "You never see a mouse here," said a woman who has been shopping at the market  for five years, a vocal advocate of the market who declined to give her name.  "It's a lot bigger than before, more room to move around in. It's better. The  fire helped," she said.  </P> <P> Jesse Moreno, manager of the 10,000-square-foot produce stall, said sales are  just keeping up with expenses. At $6,000 a month rent, costs are no different  than what Moreno would have to pay if he were to operate his own store, he  said.  </P> <P> But he is optimistic that extra vendors will boost business. "It will get a lot  busier soon, because the restaurants will be here, fish and meat market and  some shops, so we expect to do about twice the sales we are doing now," Moreno  said. About 2,000 customers a day troop through the market.  </P> <P> The costs of doing business, such as rent and salaries, have gone up  significantly since the fire at the original location. But, at the same time,  business has increased about 50%, Moreno said.  </P> <P> Moreno said connections with farmers in all parts of the country and a large  sales volume make lower prices possible. On an average day, he sells more than  4,000 pounds of bananas, 40 boxes of apples and 80 boxes of lettuce  </P> <P> The rest of the bazaar is filling in fast, May said, with space renting for  $2.50 a square foot per month, twice the rent charged at the old location.  </P> <P> Mexican and Italian restaurants have both signed leases that begin in March,  and May hopes to find a Chinese restaurant. The 600-square-foot areas available  for the restaurants will rent out at $1,500 a month.  </P> <P> And the effects of the restaurants should spill over to the other enterprises,  May said.  </P> <P> "We are getting more people buying produce than we had before, but we used to  have a terrific lunch crowd," May said. "We expect that crowd to return, and  that's expected to increase sales all around."  </P> <P> The bazaar, owned by San Diego businessman and developer Tom Hom, is in its  15th year of operation. The downtown market attracts people from all over the  county -- as far away as Oceanside and Escondido, May said.  </P></p>

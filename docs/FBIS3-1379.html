In another statement signed by the chief press  secretary to the head of state, Mr. David Attah, government said  it finds it absolutely necessary to give more information on the  border feud between Nigeria and the Cameroon in order to put the  facts straight.    According to the statement, historically, the Efiks of  Nigeria in Cross River state, who migrated from (Uwan), now in  Akwa-Ibom state, while searching for better fishing grounds,  discovered (Udombi), which the early Europeans to the area later  renamed Bakassi Peninsula. More specifically, (Udombi) or  Bakassi was founded in the late 16th Century on the authority of  the king and chiefs of Old Calabar. It was then too that  fishing settlements were established at Ekang, renamed Archibong  in Abana and Atabong out of south (Udomhi).    The statement has it that the Efiks and (?Efuts) declared to  the British Council in 1884 that their allegiance was to the  kings and chiefs of Old Calabar, the only authority approved by  them for entry into a treaty with the British Council. British  acceptance of the legal authority of the king of Old Calabar of  (Udombi) led to the treaties of 1985 [as heard], 1890, 1893, and  1906 between the UK and Germany. The treaties preserved  (Udombi) as part of Old Calabar.    The implication of the treaty is that Germany, which had  authority over the then Cameroon agreed totally that (Udombi)  people are Efiks and the territory Nigerian, not southern  Cameroon. Even when southern Cameroon passed on to the UN  trusteeship after World War II, it did not alter the legal  status of (Udombi) as an integral part of Nigeria. The  statement goes on to assert that when the present Western  Cameroon was part of Nigeria, (Udombi) area was administered  from Eket on the authority of the former Eastern Nigerian  Government.    The statement expressed the Federal Government's disquiet  when Cameroon let loose its gendarmes into Nigeria's fishing  settlement in Bakassi to harass, plunder, and murder at will  Nigerians. Nigeria continued to remain calm despite the  provocations, and sought dialogue with Cameroon, using  established diplomatic machinery.    Nigeria's efforts would have resulted in a meeting between  President Paul Biya and General Sani Abacha in Maiduguri in the  northeastern part of Nigeria which has border with Cameroon.  Government explained that, unfortunately, before the planned  meeting, the Government of the Cameroon took steps to  externalize the conflict with French connivance. The statement  stressed that Nigeria's policy of accommodation should not be  construed to mean inability to maintain Nigeria's territorial  integrity in the face of violation of our rightful borders on  land, sea, and air.</p>

The rules for the last benchmark survey, covering 1989, are deleted. The major change in reporting requirements since the last survey that is implemented in these final rules is the raising of the exemption level for determining whether a long form or a short form must be filed for nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parent companies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> These rules will be effective January 5, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Betty L.

No comments on the proposed rules were received. Thus, these final rules are the same as the proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The benchmark survey will be conducted by BEA under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, hereinafter, ``the Act.'' Section 4(b) of the Act, as amended, requires that ``With respect to United States direct investment abroad, the President shall conduct a benchmark survey covering year 1982, a benchmark survey covering year 1989, and benchmark surveys covering every fifth year thereafter *&blank;*&blank;*'' Reporting in the survey is mandatory. The responsibility for conducting benchmark surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad has been delegated by the President to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated it to BEA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benchmark surveys are BEA's censuses, intended to cover the universe of U.S. direct investment abroad in value terms. U.S. direct investment abroad is defined as the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, by one U.S. person of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest in an unincorporated foreign business enterprise, including a branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the benchmark survey is to obtain comprehensive data on the overall operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates, and on positions and transactions between them. The survey is mandated by Congress to provide a factual framework for addressing the concerns of policymakers and the general public about the effects of direct investment abroad on the U.S. and foreign economies. The data from the survey are needed to record the size of U.S. direct investment abroad, measure changes in such investment, and assess its impact. The data will provide benchmarks for deriving current universe estimates of direct investment from sample data collected in other BEA surveys in nonbenchmark years. In particular, they will serve as benchmarks for the quarterly direct investment estimates included in the U.S. international transactions and the national income and product accounts, and for annual estimates of the U.S. direct investment position abroad and of the operations of U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benchmark surveys are the most comprehensive of BEA's surveys in terms of subject matter in order that they obtain the detailed information on U.S. direct investment abroad needed for policy purposes. As specified in the Act, policy areas of particular interest include, among other things, trade in both goods and services, employment and employee compensation, taxes, and technology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The survey consists of an instruction booklet, a claim for not filing the BE&hyph;10, and the following report forms: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Form BE&hyph;10A for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is not a bank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Form BE&hyph;10A BANK for reporting by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Form BE&hyph;10B(LF) (Long Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets, sales, or net income greater than $50 million (positive or negative); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) (Short Form) for reporting nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents with assets, sales, or net income greater than $3 million, but not greater than $50 million (positive or negative); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

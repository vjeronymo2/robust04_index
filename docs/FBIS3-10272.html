Hector Rosada,  chairman of the government's Peace Commission, said the human  rights issue will be the first point to be addressed in this  round in an attempt to resolve it "because it has already been  discussed previously." They will also decide on the timetable  of the agenda for subsequent meetings.    Rolando Moran, leader of the Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity [URNG], emphasized that human rights must be  "the first point discussed in the meeting. Agreements in this  area have already been reached and signed with the previous  government. There are a number of points that have already been  signed. We have to base ourselves on them and discuss  them...therefore, the human rights issue is the first topic to  be discussed, mainly because of its importance in Guatemala," he  added. The guerrilla leader said human rights are very  important, as shown by Argentine expert Monica Pinto's report  presented at the Geneva meeting on the situation in Guatemala.    Today in Mexico, the government and the URNG General Command  resumed talks to end the armed conflict in the Central American  nation which has lasted for more than 30 years. The government  delegation of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio also includes  General Carlos Pineda, deputy chief of staff; Gen. Arnoldo  Balconi, Army inspector general; and Gen. Victor Argueta,  commander of the Honor Guard. Commanders Gaspar Ilom, Pablo  Monsanto, Rolando Moran, and Carlos Gonzalez, and members of the  Political-Diplomatic Commission are participating in the  guerrilla delegation.    Today, UN-appointed mediator Jean Arnault met separately  with  the two sides to find points of concurrence. In January in  Mexico City, the two sides agreed to resume the negotiations  after they were suspended for eight months because of former  President Jorge Serrano Elias' self-inflicted coup. The  government and the URNG held talks for the first time in Mexico  City in April 1991. Only relative progress has been achieved to  end the conflict that has caused more than 100,000 deaths and  left 50,000 missing.</p>

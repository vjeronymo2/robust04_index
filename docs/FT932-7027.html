			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / ITC to examine Tyne Tees again THE Independent Television Commission is to review Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television's performance at the end of this year to make sure that the merged ITV company is carrying out its licence obligations. The decision follows an investigation launched amid fears that the merger was undermining the the company's ability to act as a separate broadcaster in north-east England. In a letter to Sir Derek Palmar, the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees chairman, published yesterday, Sir George Russell, ITC chairman, makes clear that the commission has insisted on a restructuring of the company to emphasise the separate identity of each region. Under the new structure there will be no group director of programmes. Instead Mr Clive Leach, group chief executive, will work with Mr John Fairley, managing director of Yorkshire, and Mr John Calvert, managing director of Tyne Tees. The commission has accepted the arrangements put in place because they provided 'a clear and unambiguous chain of programme commissioning and production, together with editorial and scheduling responsibility within Tyne Tees'. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.</p>

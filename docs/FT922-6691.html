			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Indonesian shareholder to sell part of Astra stake ASTRA International, Indonesia's second largest conglomerate, has confirmed that the Soeryadjaya family, which has a 76 per cent stake in the company, is to sell part of their holding. Bankers say the sale is required for the family to support the troubled, privately owned Bank Summa in which they are majority shareholders. Astra accounts for over half of Indonesia's vehicle sales and has distribution rights for Toyota, Peugeot, Isuzu, BMW and Renault. Vehicle sales have dropped by 40 per cent against 1990, brokers say, and profits are forecast to fall by 15-20 per cent this year from Rp210bn (Dollars 103m) in 1991. Bank Summa has suffered from customers defaulting on car purchase loans, as well as a fall in the prop-erty development market. Its shareholders have recently injected Rp300bn in new capital and Summa is discussing a possible merger with Bank Danamon, Indonesia's second largest private bank, which has reportedly provided Summa a Rp100bn loan. Astra declined yesterday to state how many shares the Soeryadjayas would sell or to whom. Brokers say the family may be preparing to sell up to 90m shares, almost half their holding, worth Rp1,125bn at the current market price. Brokers say possible buyers include General Electric of the US, Temasek (a Singapore government investment fund), and Toyota of Japan. Brokers welcomed the possibility of a large foreign partner being taken on board. Astra accounts for about 7 per cent of Jakarta's stock market capital.</p>

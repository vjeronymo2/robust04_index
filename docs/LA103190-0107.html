			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'ANGEL WAS INNOCENT,' UNCLE SAYS OF SLAIN TEEN-AGER  </P> <P> Sixteen-year-old Angel Brito-Guadarrama went to Fairview Villas to visit a  cousin Monday night. His uncle says the trip cost him his life.  </P> <P> "He went over there because he has a bunch of cousins living over there," said  Cleto Brito-Guadarrama, who shared an apartment with his nephew and Angel's  older brother, Luis, 19. "He was a good boy. He had a job and he paid his own  bills."  </P> <P> When a gunman opened fire on Angel and several other young men as they stood  near a bank of pay telephones shortly after 10 p.m., the teen-ager turned and  tried to run. But after 25 yards, he collapsed and died from three bullet  wounds in the chest, one of three victims in what police suspect was a  drug-related shooting.  </P> <P> "Angel was innocent, he had nothing, nothing at all to do with any drugs," his  uncle insisted Tuesday.  </P> <P> The handsome lad with thick, dark hair, like his brother before him, left  Mexico to escape its poverty, the uncle said. His parents, who remained in  Iguala, a small pueblo in the Mexican state of Guerrero, where Angel grew up,  are so poor that "they can't even afford to pay the local mill to grind their  corn," the youth's uncle said.  </P> <P> Angel was a worldly teen-ager and owned a car he had bought from his earnings  as a day laborer at construction sites in Orange County. He had been in the  United States only 11 months, his uncle said.  </P> <P> Although he was only 16, Angel lied to prospective employers, saying he was 18.  His uncle said the youth used his older brother's immigration card to persuade  employers that he was of age and in the United States legally.  </P> <P> Relatives said he was a happy teen-ager, more involved in physical exercise and  weight-lifting than the sort of violence that claimed his life.  </P> <P> "I called his parents by telephone and gave them the news that he had been shot  to death. Now we don't know how we're going to pay to have him shipped out of  here and back to Mexico where the family wants to bury him," the uncle said.  </P> <P> Luis, who had accompanied Angel to Fairview Villas from their apartment on  South Euclid Street in Santa Ana, ran to his brother's aid after Angel had been  shot. But Angel did not respond.  </P> <P> "I was calling for help," said Luis Brito-Guadarrama, sitting on a stairway  within the same complex Tuesday, wearing tennis shoes splattered with his  brother's blood. "But no one helped me."  </P> <P> Police hesitated to say whether Angel was an innocent party to the fatal  shooting. Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said police investigators were  trying to unravel the evidence and interview witnesses.  </P> <P> The other two dead men were Mario David Mora, 23, of Santa Ana, and Noel  Herrera Arroyo, 20, of Santa Ana. Miguel Angel Toledo Soto, 22, who was shot in  the head, remained in serious condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, a  hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> At the apartment of Angel's uncle, several of the youth's relatives tried to  make sense of the violent shooting that took the young man's life. Most blamed  the growing drug epidemic, which they said is consuming that part of Santa  Ana's Latino community.  </P> <P> "You want my opinion?" said Fabian Reyessa, who is married to a cousin of  Angel's. "This is all a consequence of the drug problem. I used to live in  those same apartments, and that's all you see over there every day is people  selling drugs. I had a (truck) battery stolen and I had my truck stolen. It's a  bad place to raise a family."  </P></p>

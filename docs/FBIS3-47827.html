Kang Sang-chun, the general manager of the Macao Chokwang  Trading Co., thought to be Pyongyang's intelligence office in  Macao, was recalled and deputy general manager Pak Cha-pyong  took over as general manager and chairman of the company on Dec  18, 1993, according to a North Korean watcher who wished not to  be identified.    "For Pak, it was a glorious return, for when the North  Koreans first set up shop in Macao back in 1974, it was Pak who  headed the firm," he explained.    Another North Korean watcher told THE KOREA HERALD that Pak  was general manager of the company for many years and was very  active in the Macao social circles.    "It was Pak who had placed North Korea on the Macao map, so  to speak. Whenever there were major functions, particularly  China-related, such as national day receptions of the People's  Republic of China or spring festival activities by the  Beijing-oriented Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Pak would  always be there" he disclosed.    In the 1980s, however, as the fortunes of Chokwang Trading  Co. fell, so did Pak.    First, North Korean military personnel engineered a mass  assassination plot in Rangoon in October 1983: most of the  cabinet members and aides accompanying then President Chon  Tu-hwan were killed. Chon was on his way to a national cemetery  when the explosion occurred and escaped unharmed.    Then, a Korean Airline (KAL) passenger plane exploded in  mid-air over the Indian Ocean, killing all aboard in 1987. Two  persons, one elderly man and a girl, Kim Hyon-hui, were arrested  in a Middle East city for sabotage. Both swallowed poison but  the girl survived.    It was later confirmed that Kim Hyon-hui and her senior  accomplice had been trained in Macao for six months before they  planted the bomb on the KAL plane.    According to North Korean watchers here, a serious car  accident, involving explosives, occurred in Macao within one or  two years after the KAL bombing.    Several senior officials of the Chokwang Trading Co. in the  car were killed and their bodies were returned to Pyongyang  without Macao officials being allowed to perform autopsies.    "It was rumored that the men were killed on Pyongyang's  order  and that Macao security keeps a very close watch on Chokwang," a  North Korean watcher here said.    Shortly after these incidents, Pak, who had by then become  very unpopular, was recalled to North Korea.    His successors came, but like the Vietnamese officials who  came to Hong Kong after the 1979 border incident with China,  they adopted a low profile, he explained.    "Although they were duty bound to turn up at the many  functions they always kept to a corner and tried not to attract  attention -- just like the Vietnamese in Hong Kong," he  disclosed.    Despite this, the source went on to say, protocol was  observed to the hilt by all parties. On Kim Il-song's birthday,  for example, the Macao XINHUA News Agency would send flower  trays to Chokwang and Chokwang would hold small parties.    While Kang was managing the Chokwang, according to the North  Korean watcher, Pak suddenly turned up in 1992, apparently in a  bid to regain some of the North Korean limelight because, he is  still well-known in the Macao community.    "However, he was demoted to deputy general manager. Part of  his duties appears to be the reestablishment of North Korean  prestige and also the reorganization of North Korean business  activities in Macao," he explained.    In these two fields, he explained that there has been some  progress. Pak is now in his early 60s and should retire soon  but he has once again been appointed general manager.    "Speculation is ripe here that his returning to the post may  either be a kind of reward for his contribution to Pyongyang or  a move to coordinate the return to power of Kim Il-song's  brother, Kim Yong-chu," he added.</p>

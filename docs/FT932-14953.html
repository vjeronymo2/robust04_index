			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Russians convinced they have made advances WHEN Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russian deputy premier, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, took the stage at the end of the two-day Group of Seven meeting, they were convinced Russia had done well from the gathering. Mr Kozyrev suggested that the get-together was evidence that 'democratic forces on both sides won the cold war', although that assertion will be put to the test by the Russian referendum on April 25, a date which inspired the hurriedly arranged meeting. That date was also on the mind of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who explained that 'we simply could not wait for our annual summit in July to act decisively on behalf of the reform government in Moscow.' If the 'forces of reform' were to be defeated, he said, 'we would face increased instability' and the 'necessity to continue to invest dollars in defence of and not in the urgent domestic needs of our people'. Mr Kozyrev said the aid programme would certainly help the 'day-to-day lives' of the Russian people, and suggested the international support shown for Mr Yeltsin would 'give him more authority and more strength'. Mr Fyodorov said the aid programme was now better linked to the economic reforms under way in Russia. He said the support promised for small business was 'very important', as were the 'clear mechanisms' for the implementation of the aid programme. His reference to 'clear mechanisms' reflects Russian disappointment that funds from past programmes have been slow to flow because of international agencies' strict conditions. He also cautioned that some detail was yet to be determined: 'There are many aspects which will require further study. There is much more detail to be decided.' Mr Fyodorov said it was understandable that a US proposal for a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) privatisation fund was not immediately supported by other G7 countries. The fund is designed to help big companies, and the US has pledged Dollars 500m and expects fellow G7 members to supply at least Dollars 1.5bn. 'The question of privatisation will be analysed. By the time of the G7 summit in July we will have a better idea of whether it will be supported,' Mr Fyodorov said. US officials also said they were not disheartened by the unenthusiastic response to the privatisation proposal, but made clear the US would be disappointed if its G7 partners failed to commit funds by the time of the summit.</p>

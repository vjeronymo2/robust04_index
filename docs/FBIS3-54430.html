			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] As you know, the 12th session of talks between the  governments involved in the Middle East crisis and Israel  started yesterday afternoon. Following the signing of the  'Arafat-Tel Aviv accord, these discussions faced a stalemate for  four months. But after the meeting between the U.S. President  and his Syrian counterpart in Geneva, a new round of talks has  begun. The special characteristics of and the outlook for the  new round of talks are discussed by Ne'matzadeh, an expert in  the News Research and Commentaries Group.    [Begin Ne'matzadeh recording] In the name of God, the  almighty and merciful. Good morning, dear compatriots.    This round of talks is largely on the level of the heads of  the Arab delegations from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine  and Israel. The most important development compared with the  previous 11 rounds is that this one is being held away from the  propaganda atmosphere and the mass media, such that they have  been described as completely confidential talks.    Even though the head of the Israeli delegation has said that  the mass media and propaganda are being avoided because of the  useless or harmful role played by propaganda in previous rounds,  some political observers believe that this new tactic represents  a middle line between Israel's insistence on completely  confidential talks and Syria's insistence on open discussion.  Perhaps the outcome of the discussions between the United  States and Syria in Geneva on Sunday was to select this middle  line: Open talks but far from the mass media and propaganda.    The other characteristic of this round is that no one has  stated when the talks will end. The current round of talks in  Washington is significant and sensitive, because of its links to  last week's meeting between al-Asad and Clinton. The talks  resuming after a long interruption was the most important  outcome of the discussions between the United States and Syria.  Thus, the failure of the current talks or, to be more fair,  their becoming routine will only mean the defeat and failure of  the United States in this phase.    The countries participating in the talks, particularly  Israel  and Syria, which are considered to be the major sides in this  round -- while trying to preserve the optimistic propaganda  atmosphere created by the Geneva meeting--cannot hide their  concern over the behavior and motives of the other side and have  started blaming the possible failure of the talks on the  self-centered and expansionist policy of the other side.    Irrespective of Syria's efforts during the Geneva meeting  and  afterward to display its goodwill and support for a peaceful  Middle East solution, Israel has not held back from reacting  negatively to the al-Asad-Clinton meeting. Thus, the success of  the current round of talks depends on the outcome of a  tug-of-war involving Syria's fundamentalism, Israel's behavior,  and U.S. pressure.    Of course, the futile pattern of 'Arafat's experience in his  unending talks with Israel and his wasted dreams is no secret to  the sides sitting at the negotiating table with Israel. The  bombing of south Lebanon by Israel in tandem with the  commencement of the 12th round of Washington talks shows that  Israel insists on showing its aggressive nature to the  negotiating sides that have entered the negotiations with the  Zionist regime and that it is very hopeful of leaving the talks  with its hands full, helped by Washington's support.

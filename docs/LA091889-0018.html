But looking back, I feel I played really well."  </P> <P> Marc Rosset, a wild-card entry who was born in Geneva, upset fourth-seeded  Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina, 6-4, 7-5, in the final of the Geneva Open  at Switzerland.  </P> <P> Rosset won all but four points on his service in the 38-minute first set.  Perez-Roldan, ranked 37th in the world, seemed to tire at the end of the  one-hour second set.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Martin Jaite of Argentina said he pressed fourth-seeded Jordi  Arrese hard from the start, defeating the Spaniard, 6-3, 6-2, in the final of  the $175,000 Madrid Grand Prix tournament.  </P> <P> The top-seeded pair of Gigi Fernandez and Robin White needed only 55 minutes to  defeat Australians Elizabeth Smylie and Wendy Turnbull, 6-2, 6-2, in the final  of a $175,000 international women's doubles tournament at Tokyo.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Fred Kovaleski of New York City upset defending champion Bob  Sherman of Santa Barbara, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4, to take the 65-and-over title in  the United States Tennis Assn.'s senior grass-courts championships at  Cedarhurst, N.Y.  </P> <P> In the women's 70-and-over division, Dodo Cheney of Santa Monica earned her  193rd USTA title by defeating Pat Yeomans of Los Angeles, 6-3, 6-3.  </P></p>

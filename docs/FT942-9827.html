			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brewin Dolphin raising Pounds 6.6m via share offer Brewin Dolphin, the private client stockbroker, will raise Pounds 6.6m from a forthcoming share offer, which will also include the sale of about 15 per cent of existing employee shareholdings, writes Simon Davies. The flotation is expected to value the brokerage at between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m, against the Pounds 6m price of its management buy-out two years ago. Trading for the four months to April 8 has been ahead of budget and up from the previous year. In 1993, it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.52m, excluding exceptional write-offs. The issue is sponsored by Charterhouse Bank and pricing will be announced on May 26.</p>

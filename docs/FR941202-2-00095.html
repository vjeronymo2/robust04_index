Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx, pursuant to rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to extend the close of trading on the Exchange's equity trading floor from 4:00 to 4:15 P.M., creating a new Post Primary session (``PPS''). The PPS would take place each trading day from 4:00 to 4:15 P.M. Exchange rules applicable to floor trading during the Exchange's regular trading hours ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 9:30 a.m.&hyph;4:00 p.m.) would continue to apply to floor trading during the PPS, except that during the PPS, orders that are designated ``PPS'' are eligible for execution. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to amend the following Phlx rules: Rule 101, adding Commentary .02 to specify equity floor trading hours; Rule 229, Commentary .17, adding reference to implementing the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communication and Execution System (``PACE'') as a routing system only, with Floor Procedure Committee approval; Rule 232 to add the PPS as well as opening before the primary market; and Equity Floor Procedure Advice EF&hyph;1, which provides the procedures for the designation and execution of orders in instances where the primary market is not open in an issue for which the Phlx is open, to change the eligibility designation from use of the yellow copy of the order ticket to the designator ``EXP'' and to make several clarifications. The text of the proposed rule change is available in full at the Commission Public Reference Room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II.

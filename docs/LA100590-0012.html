			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA QUINTA ENDS PACIFICA'S REIGN  </P> <P> The memories of a loss following a last-second field goal and another when a  running back fell en route to a touchdown were erased by La Quinta High School  Thursday night at Bolsa Grande High.  </P> <P> Quarterback Donald Hopkins passed for 233 yards and tailback George Sanchez  rushed for 127 yards as La Quinta beat Pacifica, 29-6, ending Pacifica's  four-year winning streak in the eight-team Garden Grove League.  </P> <P> Pacifica had won 21 of its last 22 league games and its only loss, 31-17, to  Bolsa Grande in 1987 was later reversed by a forfeiture.  </P> <P> La Quinta had come close to beating Pacifica the past two years but lost,  15-14, in 1988 on a last-second field goal and lost, 35-28, last year when  running back Jason Cherms fell on the 13-yard line on an apparent touchdown run  late in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Pacifica (3-2, 1-1 in league) failed to contain La Quinta's potent offense or  generate any offense of its own Thursday night. La Quinta's defense, led by  linebacker Joe Slouka, limited Pacifica to 20 yards rushing and 34 yards  passing.  </P> <P> La Quinta (5-0, 2-0) also intercepted two passes and recovered a fumble in  defeating Pacifica for the first time in 10 years.  </P> <P> "They outhit us, executed better and wanted to win more than us," said Bill  Craven, Pacifica coach. "We couldn't contain their passing game and we couldn't  get anything going offensively. La Quinta deserved to win."  </P> <P> Hopkins completed 16 of 24 passes, one for a touchdown and rushed for another  before retiring with nine minutes remaining and La Quinta leading, 26-6.  Afterward, he said an effective running game made passing easy.  </P> <P> "It was our best running game of the season," Hopkins said. "When we're running  like we did tonight and the line is giving me that type of protection, our  passing game is pretty tough to stop."  </P> <P> Hopkins threw to four receivers, but his main target was tight end Justin  Sogoian. Sogoian caught six passes for 108 yards.  </P> <P> Sanchez gained 127 yards in 18 carries and scored twice as La Quinta amassed  192 yards rushing against a flat Pacifica defense.  </P></p>

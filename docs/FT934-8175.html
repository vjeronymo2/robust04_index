			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / RSPB calls for law to safeguard forests after privatisation THE GOVERNMENT must have powers to buy back forests if they are not managed to high environmental standards after privatisation, according to Europe's largest wildlife charity. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds also wants Forestry Commission properties to be excluded from privatisation if their sale would jeopardise the wood-processing industry, local jobs and communities, public access and recreation, or wildlife conservation, research and education. These are the principal components of the government's current policy of 'multi-purpose' forestry. The RSPB, which has 870,000 members including at least 40 in the Commons and Lords, is proposing a private member's bill as part of a campaign to highlight what it sees as the difficulties of safeguarding environmental values in the event of a sale of Britain's forests. It will be lobbying MPs who come top of the private members' ballot on November 25. The charity, which itself manages an estate of about 190,000 acres, has been successful in getting two previous private member's bills on to the statute books, in 1991 and 1992. If its latest bill were to succeed it would upset any privatisation plans by making purchases less attractive, particularly for buyers interested only in timber exploitation. A review group of civil servants, due to report to ministers early next year, is considering options for the privatisation of all or part of the 2.8m-acre Forestry Commission estate. Although privatisation is favoured by some Tory MPs, it is opposed by the majority of interested parties from wood processors to environmental groups. The bill would enable the government to buy back land after five years if it was not being managed to the environmental standards currently laid down by the Forestry Commission. It would also require all privatised land to be subject to a management plan. If the new owners failed to implement the plan the government would be able to do so. Mr Roger Turner, the RSPB's forestry policy officer, said Forest Enterprise, which manages the Forestry Commission's land, follows government policy of ensuring there is a variety of old and young trees and dense and open woodland of the kind required by different species of birds and plants. For conservation purposes it fells some trees earlier or later than it would if it were seeking the maximum return from the timber. He said: 'We're concerned that in virtually all the options for transferring ownership, if the forest goes into the hands of individuals or organisations who wish to pursue a single purpose, like making money from the timber, then these requirements will not be met.' The RSPB estimates that it would cost the government an additional Pounds 51.55m a year in grants and administration to maintain current conservation standards on Forestry Commission land and develop its environmental potential in the event of a wholesale transfer to the private sector. This would compare with a book value of Pounds 1.7bn for the estate and predictions that it could fetch as little as Pounds 500m on the market. 'It would be a short-term gain for a long-term cost,' said Mr Turner. Last week three former executives of the Forestry Commission said additional expenditure would amount to Pounds 44m a year in 2000, while the government would be losing Pounds 20m a year in timber sales.</p>

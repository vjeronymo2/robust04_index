			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan's industrial machinery  manufacturers urged the trade minister Wednesday [2 March] to  take steps to ensure that the Japan-U.S. trade friction will not  negatively affect the industry's earnings.    The call came from Tsunesaburo Nishimura, president of the  Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers, in a  meeting of industry leaders with International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai.    Nishimura said the industry is concerned about the yen's  renewed surge against the dollar following the breakdown in  February of the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks.    The Japanese currency's excessive strength may undermine the  industry's cost-cutting and other restructuring efforts, he said.    Nishimura and nine other industrial leaders, each  representing machinery manufacturing for such sectors as  engineering, construction, textiles and robots, jointly made the  request to Kumagai during consultations over breakfast.    The machinery industry hopes the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI) will ensure the trade dispute does not  deal a blow to its earnings, which are just recovering in some  sectors from the long recession, said Nishimura, who is also an  adviser to Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.    Kumagai said MITI will do its best to have the request  reflected in its policy.    Nishimura said some bright spots are being seen in such  sectors as semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, machines for  making housing materials and waste disposal machinery.    But construction machinery, a major leading indicator for  Japan's economy, is still in the doldrums, he said.</p>

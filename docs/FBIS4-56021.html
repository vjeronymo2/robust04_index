			<p>BFN     [Text] At an extraordinary closed meeting today, the  government adopted the draft framework agreement with the  parliament that was proposed by Prime Minister Berov. It will  be in effect until new parliamentary and municipal elections are  held in the fall.    The Executive Bureau of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]  and the leadership of the BSP parliamentary faction discussed  the framework agreement. It was agreed to support the segment  that deals with setting a term for early parliamentary and  municipal elections in the fall. The Socialists will also  support the commitments of the Council of Ministers in the  social sphere and its efforts to successfully end the  negotiations on the country's foreign debt. They think the  amendments to the Privatization Bill and a program on social and  mass privatization should be adopted in June, while the Law on  Defense and Armed Forces, amendments to the Election Bill, the  Municipal Administration Bill, the Judicial Act, and the  Constitution should be adopted in July.    In the decision that was adopted the Socialists committed  themselves to supporting the personnel changes envisaged in the  framework agreement and have proposed a candidate for the post  of deputy prime minister.</p>

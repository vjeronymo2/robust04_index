			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Actor Martin Sheen took his crusade to help the homeless to the streets of  Hollywood while accepting his star on the Walk of Fame. "The sidewalks of  Hollywood are known all over the world as the Walk of Fame, but many sidewalks  in America could be known as the 'Walk of Shame' because of the 4 million  homeless people residing on them full-time," Sheen said Friday as he received  the 1,897th Hollywood star. His 30-year career has included such movies as  "Apocalypse Now" and "Wall Street." Sheen, 49, in his role as honorary mayor of  Malibu, recently declared the upscale beach community a sanctuary for the  homeless. The actor, flanked by his wife, Janet, and sons Emilio Estevez and  Charlie Sheen, asked the crowd to pray with him for the 400,000 homeless  children. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

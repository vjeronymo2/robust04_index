			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Unions win rise in injury payouts Compensation payouts for union members have risen markedly in the past year, says a report from the Labour Research Department. It suggests that the total paid to members of unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress last year may dwarf the Pounds 300m in settlements for 1992. The report says 15 large unions won a total of almost Pounds 175m in work-related illness injuries compensation in 1993 covering 51,000 cases. The report also pinpoints a large increase in claims covering repetitive strain injuries. Eleven of the unions surveyed reported a rise in the number of such cases. Its findings will increase concern among business about the viability of employers' liability insurance, which usually finances compensation. Insurance companies have increased premium rates and reduced their exposure to employers' liability business in recent years after suffering heavy losses. Buyers are worried that cover could be reduced next year as a result of developments in the reinsurance market, where reinsurance companies plan to limit their exposure to the business. At its conference last week the risk and insurance managers' association warned that compensation claims were 'snowballing' and that 'serious steps' were needed to reduce soaring costs. The Labour Research survey covers 18 of the largest unions, representing 87 per cent of TUC membership. Of the 13 unions that supplied researchers with a comparison, 11 said there had been an increase in payouts last year, and two said the figure was similar to that in the previous year. The TGWU general union, the largest in the survey, won more than Pounds 81m for its members last year, an increase of more than Pounds 8m on 1992. The highest single award was Pounds 800,000 won by the TGWU for a lorry driver who remains in a coma after a road accident. The survey revealed an increasing trend to settle compensation claims for industrial injuries out of court, and most claims are proving successful. Four unions had negotiated 'no-fault compensation schemes' with individual employers. The report says Royal Mail and British Telecommunications have taken out personal-accident insurance schemes covering employees who suffer injuries resulting in permanent disability.

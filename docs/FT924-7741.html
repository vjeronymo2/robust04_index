			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: . . . and trouble with Elizabeth Sir, Peter Norman's article, 'Bank urges stable prices' (November 12), included a fascinating chart plotting 700 years of British inflation. Since 1300, it seems that there have been two 50-year periods that have suffered from rampant inflation: the second halves of the 16th and 20th centuries. Perhaps the various anti-inflation policies of the last 20 years have missed the point; the simple answer being not to have a queen called Elizabeth.

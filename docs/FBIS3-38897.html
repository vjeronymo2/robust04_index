			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas  expressed his skepticism about the efficiency of possible air  strikes on Serb positions in ending the Bosnian conflict. Garcia  Vargas says he understands the need for firm action on the  international community's behalf because of the very serious  situation in Sarajevo. However, the minister admits that for  various military and technical reasons a possible NATO air  strike will not be enough to lift the siege of the city.    [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] There is a request  formulated  by the international community asking for the siege to be  lifted. The possibility exists that force may be used in a very  selective and specific way. That is to say that lifting the  siege without deploying ground forces would be very difficult.  Why? Because the mortar sites cannot be attacked from the air,  the planes cannot see them from the air. So, air strikes would  be a warning and an expression of the international community's  will to put pressure on the areas that right now have the most  responsibility in the conflict, and specially on those who are  carrying out these unacceptable massacres in the city of  Sarajevo.

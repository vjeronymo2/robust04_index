			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Appointments: More scope for Anglo-Danish trade Jim Davis, chairman of Scandinavian Seaways Ltd, the UK arm of the Danish ferry company, adds the position of chairman and director of the Danish-UK Chamber of Commerce to his long list of other directorships. Davis, 63, says he intends to give the organisation, which was founded as recently as 1989, 'a shot in the arm'. 'On their side there are all these wonderful names like Carlsberg, Bang &amp; Olufson and Lurpak, and Denmark is one of our oldest allies. But we do a whole lot less business together than we might.' Whereas Britain is Denmark's third largest trading partner, Denmark ranks fourteenth with Britain. Last year British imports from Denmark amounted to Pounds 2.27bn; exports were worth Pounds 1.4bn. His career has been spent in international shipping and transportation, including at P &amp; O, followed by 15 years as a director covering shipping and transportation finance at Kleinwort Benson. He says he qualifies for the Chamber on a number of scores - 'with two Danish au pairs, and one Danish girlfriend a long time ago'. He has also chaired Scandinavian Seaways UK since 1984. Other current commitments include the chairmanships of TIP Europe and Bromley Shipping and a directorship of Associated British Ports Holdings. Davis's predecessor at the Chamber of Commerce was Sir Ronald McIntosh, who is now advising John Gummer and the UK government on food aid to Russia.</p>

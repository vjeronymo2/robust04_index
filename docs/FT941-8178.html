			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Dinosaurs eye the PIA The stakes in the tortuous game of bluff and double bluff that the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) has been obliged to play with the more recalcitrant members of the life assurance industry were raised a further notch yesterday. In responding to a formal application from the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) to become the new unitary self-regulatory organisation for the retail investment business, SIB simultaneously announced that it was 'minded to recognise' the PIA and 'minded to revoke' recognition of two existing retail investment watchdogs, Fimbra and Lautro. Behind the legal jargon lies a difficult set of calculations both for the regulators and the life assurers. The PIA has to achieve widespread support before Mr Andrew Large, head of SIB, can obtain the Treasury's permission to recognise the new unitary watchdog and bring down the curtain on its two predecessors. Yesterday's publication of a prospectus inviting applications to join the PIA constituted a formal start to this process. The task is a formidable one, and not just because a handful of big insurers are hostile. If the PIA's claim to raise standards in retail financial services is to carry conviction the new body will have to reject applications from people who are currently authorised to conduct investment business. That is not a recipe for popularity in the industry. Nor should it be. Meantime the recalcitrants, who rank the Prudential and Standard Life among their number, have to ask what they can achieve by continuing to oppose the changes to the existing regime. They would also be well advised to ensure that a dignified means of retreat is available if their arguments fail to carry the day. Or, indeed, if they succeed. Treasury ministers may not relish being railroaded into unwelcome policy options, any more than big insurance companies enjoy changing their ways to suit the regulators. Repeated scandals Part of the problem is that many opponents of the proposed new structure start from the assumption that they were promised self-regulation under the original 1986 Financial Services Act regime and are still entitled to it. This is hopelessly unrealistic in the light of repeated scandals to do with the industry's sales practices. Public confidence has been severely dented and will not be restored without some clear indication that the system is being significantly strengthened. Against that background the special pleading from leading practitioners about a surfeit of public interest representatives on the PIA's board is a public relations disaster which undermines the credibility of the whole industry. Genuine alternative Nor does it help to suggest that statutory regulation provides a genuine alternative to the problem. In the long run it may or may not do: but there is a crisis in the here and now, and one which urgently needs to be addressed. To suggest that consumers of financial services should be allowed to wait for several years while a statutory alternative is put in place looks, at best, disingenuous. At worst it risks being interpreted as an attempt by the life assurers to make hay for as long as possible before the whistle is blown. A unitary retail watchdog makes sense in a financial world where the organisational boundaries between banks, insurers and other managers of personal savings have become anachronistic. There are undoubtedly shortcomings in the present process of accountability to parliament. It remains to be seen how effective a watchdog the PIA might become. And there will no doubt be arguments about specific elements of the PIA's prospectus and its accompanying document on the new body's approach to regulation. But only an industry suffering from extreme myopia would fail to recognise that SIB's current approach is the only half-decent damage limitation exercise on offer. The hostile insurers do no service to their shareholders, policyholders or the general public by failing to offer their support. They should wake up and shut up. The PIA is better than an interminable wait for an ideal system that may or may not materialise in the year 2000.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Roh ends MP boycott with fair vote pledge SOUTH KOREA'S National Assembly may resume normal operations this week following President Roh Tae Woo's promise that December's presidential election will be conducted fairly under a neutral caretaker government. The two main opposition parties have been boycotting the assembly since the spring in protest at the government's decision to postpone the election of local officials until 1995. The opposition charges that senior local officials, who are at present appointed by the government, would use their influence to support the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) candidate, Mr Kim Young Sam, in the presidential election. Opposition fears were given credence when it was disclosed that local officials in one county bribed voters to support an unsuccessful DLP candidate in last March's parliamentary election. This followed other allegations that intelligence agency and military officials engaged in illegal practices to support DLP candidates during that election. The growing election scandal forced Mr Roh on Friday to announce that a neutral caretaker cabinet would be formed early next month to ensure a fair presidential election, while he would quit the DLP. The appointment of independent ministers to head the Home Affairs Ministry, which is in charge of local government, and National Security Planning, the intelligence agency, would theoretically guarantee that the government would not use these key agencies to influence the election in favour of the DLP. Mr Kim Dae Jung, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Democratic Party, yesterday welcomed Mr Roh's decision and promised to end the boycott of the assembly. The National Assembly must consider several important economic measures, including the 1993 budget, before its current session ends in December. Mr Roh made his decision under pressure from Mr Kim Young Sam, a former opposition leader who merged his party into the DLP in 1990. Mr Kim has been concerned that the election scandal would harm his popularity among voters and reduce his lead over Mr Kim Dae Jung. Mr Kim has also been concerned that allegations of political favouritism regarding the award of government contracts this year could hurt his election chances. He recently insisted on the cancellation of a lucrative mobile telephone licence to Sunkyong after the opposition charged that the contract was awarded to the Korean conglomerate because its chairman is an in-law of Mr Roh. Some officials in Mr Roh's majority faction of the party are expressing worries about the growing influence of Mr Kim and the possibility that many influential bureaucratic positions may be filled by Mr Kim's supporters if he wins the presidential election. One new threat to Mr Kim emerged yesterday with the announcement that Mr Lee Jong Chan, who stood against Mr Kim for the DLP presidential nomination, will form a new political party and possibly field a presidential candidate. Mr Lee's party could attract dissatisfied elements within the DLP.</p>

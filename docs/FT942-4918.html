			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Markets Report: US dollar consolidates The dollar consolidated Fri-day's gains in fairly light trading yesterday, as dealers marked time ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting and the European elections later this week. Remarks from Mr Dieter Hiss, a Bundesbank council member, were seen as confirming recent indications that the scope for further German interest rate cuts was limited. Meanwhile, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the administration had not pursued a policy of driving up the yen. However, support for the dollar was hardly overwhelming, and while the US currency finished ahead of Friday's closing levels, it ended below yesterday's opening rates. The dollar opened the day with some momentum following Friday's sharp fall in US unemployment, which made traders believe that further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve were more likely. Dealers were also perceived as being unenthusiastic about European currencies ahead of Thursday's polls, and the strength of the US Treasury bond market was seen as lending the dollar support. Mr Hiss, head of the regional central bank for Berlin and Brandenburg, said in Berlin that room for lower German interest rates would decrease if US interest rates continued to rise. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said: 'Until now, the Bundesbank has stood clear of implying a link between German and US monetary policy.' The Hiss remarks were seen as a further sign that official German interest rates were unlikely to fall much further, although Mr Hiss added: 'The current level of discount and Lombard rates leaves room for an adjustment of the repo rate, which is the main refinancing rate for the banking system.' Meanwhile, Mr Kantor's remarks were the latest in a series of comments by US officials, seemingly designed to correct the market impression, formed earlier this year, that the Clinton administration was happy to see a weaker dollar. However, not all official comment was positive for the dollar yesterday. Three Federal Reserve governors, Mr Lawrence Lindsey, Mr Edward Kelley and Mr John LaWare, were quoted in the New York Times as saying the pace of US economic growth had slowed. Traders perceived the comments as indicating that the pace of Fed interest rate increases might ease. The dollar ended in London at DM1.6692, up from Friday's close of DM1.6665 but below yesterday's DM1.6700 opening. Against the yen, the dollar closed at Y105.35, compared with Friday's Y105.245 finish. Yesterday's New York close was DM1.6705 and Y105.275. Sterling's exchange rate index edged up to 80.6, after opening yesterday at 80.5 and closing on Friday at 80.4. The pound drifted higher against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.5164 from Friday's DM2.5074. However, sterling's strength against the D-Mark was seen as merely tracking the dollar/D-Mark rate. Against the US unit, the pound edged up to Dollars 1.5076 from Friday's Dollars 1.5046, but Mr Peter Luxton, economic adviser, global foreign exchange at Barclays Bank, said it cannot break through Dollars 1.51. 'Expectation of higher base rates gives sterling some support,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London. He thinks Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will press for  1/4 percentage point rise in base rates when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, on Wednesday. 'So far, the indications are that the tax increases have not had an adverse effect on the economy,' added Mr MacKinnon. Yesterday's consumer credit figures were interpreted by the markets as showing that the recovery was still on track. 'The pound should sail through the European election results since the market is already discounting bad news for the Conservatives,' Mr MacKinnon went on to say, although he feels that sterling's potential upside in the summer will be limited by international investor concern about a potential Tory leadership election. The central bank of the Netherlands cut 10 basis points off the special advances rate, reducing it to 5.0 per cent, in a move seen as reflecting recent guilder strength against the D-Mark. The guilder finished the day virtually unchanged against the German currency at DM0.892, versus Friday's closing level of DM0.893. The Italian lira ended higher against the D-Mark, rising above the L970 level to close at L969.4, from L971.7 on Friday. According to Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), the Italian unit benefited from a perception of reduced interest rate risk and from strong figures on trade and automotive sales. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 375m of assistance in two tranches yesterday, after earlier forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. Overnight rates traded between 3 and 4 7/8 per cent.</p>

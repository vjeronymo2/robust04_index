			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / VSEL put into deep freeze For a government tenderly nursing its political bruises, the prospect of entering a very public fight over an obscure submarine maker cannot have been very appetising. Hence the stock market's assumption that the trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, would not refer either British Aerospace or General Electric Company to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in their bids for VSEL. What upset that calculation was the Office of Fair Trading's insistence that there was a competition issue raised by GEC's bid, since it already owns Britain's other large warship maker, Yarrow on the Clyde. Once GEC was headed to the MMC, effectively freezing its bid, then the least contentious option was to send BAe too. Both now will face three months of scrutiny, GEC on competition grounds and BAe on the rather murkier issue of 'public interest involving national security'. Since BAe is not normally considered a threat to national security this phrase may more accurately be read as 'political expediency'. Yet it was not supposed to be that way. The Ministry of Defence, currently VSEL's only customer, had raised no competition worries about either company. If the MoD as customer was not concerned, why should anyone else be worried? It was the intervention of the Treasury which tipped the balance. The chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, is thought to have been concerned about competition and argued that it was not the MoD but the taxpayer who was the customer. As a procurement agency, the MoD should not dictate the public interest. There is certainly a great deal for the MMC to mull over. UK defence competition policy seems to be heading in two directions. Market testing is introducing more competition to parts of the MoD, while shrinking defence budgets are forcing consolidation and a reduction in competition. For the companies involved in this battle, the next three months will require a great deal of management time to be spent at the MMC, one reason perhaps why GEC is considering whether it wishes to continue. BAe, which has said it will fight on, will also continue its restructuring programme. It has raised Pounds 178m as a result of the first phase of its rights issue. That money will probably be used to rationalise its turboprop regional aircraft business. Negotiations between BAe and ATR, the Franco-Italian company, are progressing and a joint venture could be formed before the VSEL issue is resolved. BAe is also negotiating a merger of its missiles business with Matra, which also may be concluded in the next few months. For VSEL shareholders and employees, the uncertainty continues. If the MMC investigation is drawn out, it might also interfere with the bidding for the next batch of Trafalgar class nuclear hunter-killer submarines. That is due to be decided next year and GEC is a possible bidder against VSEL for the Pounds 2.5bn contract. It would be possible for the MoD to slow down the Trafalgar bids, but VSEL cannot afford to wait long as a gap is beginning to open up between the end of work on Trident and the beginning of Trafalgar. Work on Trident has been slowed once to ease that problem. But however politically convenient it is to stick VSEL into the deep freeze, the company cannot afford to wait forever. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMBIA S&amp;L CHIEF HITS PREDECESSOR'S JUDGMENT;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: EDWARD HARSHFIELD TELLS SHAREHOLDERS THAT THE INSOLVENT INSTITUTION'S  TROUBLES DATE BACK LONG BEFORE THE COLLAPSE OF JUNK BONDS.  </P> <P> In an unusually scathing speech, the new head of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan on  Tuesday ripped the regime of former Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel, saying  Spiegel and other executives placed the insolvent thrift "in harm's way" by  their actions over the past four years.  </P> <P> "This is not hindsight. It's not Monday morning quarterbacking. The evidence  was as visible then as it is now," said Edward G. Harshfield, who took over as  Columbia's chief executive three months ago.  </P> <P> Harshfield's speech to the Beverly Hills thrift's annual shareholders meeting  clearly took Columbia stockholders and employees by surprise. It was the first  public sign that a schism has developed between Harshfield and the  controversial Spiegel, who left as Columbia's chief executive on Dec. 31 amid  growing losses caused by problems in the thrift's huge portfolio of risky,  high-yield junk bonds. Those bonds, worth about $3 billion now, have lost about  $1 billion in value over the past year and now are for sale. The thrift is now  in danger of being seized by regulators.  </P> <P> Harshfield's speech also was unusual if for no other reason than that Spiegel  and his family still control Columbia, although their grip has weakened because  regulators are now heavily involved in decision-making. Spiegel sat in the  front row during the meeting but did not speak. His father, Abraham, presided  over the meeting as chairman.  </P> <P> Harshfield, who did not mention Thomas Spiegel by name, took issue with the  conventional explanation that Columbia's problems are primarily due to  accounting changes stemming from the requirement in last year's thrift bailout  law that thrifts must sell their junk bonds by 1994.  </P> <P> Because most of the junk bonds mature after 1994, accountants are requiring  Columbia and other thrifts to constantly revalue their bonds to current market  prices. Because the junk bond market has collapsed over the past year, Columbia  has had to realize huge losses on the value of its bonds.  </P> <P> But Harshfield said Columbia's problems were emerging as far back as late 1986,  long before the junk bond market collapsed and Congress required thrifts to  sell their bonds. Earnings, he noted, slipped steadily from $193 million in  1986 to $119 million in 1987, $65 million in 1988 and finally a huge  $591-million loss last year.  </P> <P> Provisions for loan losses more than quadrupled in the same period while  expenses doubled, Harshfield said. Columbia's junk bonds clearly declined in  value over the years, and the losses were compounded by problems with its  commercial real estate projects.  </P> <P> Even if Columbia didn't have to continually revalue its bonds to their market  value, many of the issuers defaulted or Columbia suffered other actual losses  on the portfolio, Harshfield said. The need to recognize those losses would  have wiped out virtually all of Columbia's shareholder value anyway, Harshfield  argued.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that all but about $17 million in stockholder equity was  wiped out, not by government action, but by the business judgments and  management actions over those several years," Harshfield said. He estimated  that only 3% of the loss in stockholder value can be blamed on the newer  accounting methods.  </P> <P> Although he remained jovial at the meeting, Spiegel clearly was bothered by the  remarks and defended his 13-year tenure.  </P> <P> "Ed has been here for three months. He has his perspective of the situation  being here three months. I have my perspective being here 13 years," Spiegel  said after the meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today the Jerusalem District Court sentenced Barukh  Marzel to three months in prison, after convicting him of  rioting near the Prime Minister's Office three years ago. The  judge determined that Marzel will serve his term immediately  after he completes his current term in detention. The judge  pointed out that over the past 14 years, Marzel was convicted 10  times on similar charges. Ever since he became an adult, this  person has been violating the law, and his acts indicate that he  has no regard for the authority of the law and the  establishments of the state. His criminal record, the judge  said, calls for severe punishment.    Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that upon coming  out  of the courthouse, Marzel claimed that he is being discriminated  against.</p>

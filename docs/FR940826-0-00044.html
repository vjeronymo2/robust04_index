No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) No other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section require prior approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Cohen and Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] Government will start transferring powers to  provinces as soon as this week but has warned that regional  authorities will first have to prove an ability to manage their  own affairs. Public Service and Administration Minister Zola  Skweyiya said yesterday he had begun urgent consultations with  all nine provincial premiers to clarify the process of  transferring powers to regional public services.    But -- to avoid "authority vacuums" -- provinces would have  to prove they were capable of managing their public services  before central government would allocate them specific powers.  The undertaking follows anxiety on the part of some provincial  governments about their lack of power and a proclamation in the  Government Gazette which temporarily transfers all provincial  and homeland government powers to Pretoria.    The Inkatha Freedom Party's central committee expressed  "deep  disquiet" at the weekend over reports that central government  would assume provinces' powers. It resolved to take whatever  steps necessary to ensure that the powers claimed by  KwaZulu/Natal's premier were devolved as expeditiously as  possible.    Skweyiya denied that government was holding on to powers  which would allow provinces to run their own public services.  "Provinces will first have to show they are ready to take  control. We do not want chaos," he said, adding: "I understand  the impatience of premiers."    He was keen to hand over the powers as soon as possible. In  the interim period, however, government was responsible for SA's  900,000 to 1.2-million public servants.    Skweyiya said he had begun meeting individual provincial  premiers, making it "very, very clear" what criteria had to met  before powers were handed over. Each premier received a  proposal to study. They had to go back to their provinces and  study the documentation -- which included details on future  personnel, assets and budgets -- before they would meet the  Minister again, as well as the Public Service Commission.    The proposed packages for each of the nine provinces varied  according to their needs, Skweyiya said. He confirmed that not  all the provinces had yet followed the example of KwaZulu/Natal,  which had requested in writing that central government allocate  it all the powers it was entitled to under the interim  constitution.    Skweyiya said he had already met the premiers of the  [Orange]  Free State and the Northern Transvaal. Today he is scheduled to  meet those of the Western Cape, Northern Cape and PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], and in the next two days the  leaders of KwaZulu/Natal, the North-west and the Eastern Cape.    The Minister said he had been impressed with the level of  preparedness of the Free State, largely because, like  KwaZulu/Natal, the province's borders had "remained intact". He  indicated that, where borders had been redrawn and former  homelands reincorporated into new provinces, he expected it  would take longer before the provinces were ready to manage  their own public services.    However, he said the difficult process of restructuring the  public service was gaining momentum. "I am happy with the pace  of restructuring."    The Minister denied that government would in any way renege  on undertakings in the interim constitution guaranteeing public  servants their jobs. "There is absolutely no intention to drive  anyone out of their jobs and onto the streets".    Although changes would be necessary to make the public  service more representative of the new SA -- "a number of  blacks" would be appointed at managerial level, and the gender  imbalance would be tackled -- no one (and Skweyiya singled out  white public servants) had to fear losing their jobs. He said  his job was to create a single public service, at a national and  provincial level, which ensured uniformity and parity, including  pay.</p>

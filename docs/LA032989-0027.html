			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAY DIFFERENCES  </P> <P> As a high school administrator, I have to wonder what type of message we are  sending to our youth. With the Eastern Airlines strike in full force, I have to  question where our priorities are when we read about these "tyrannical wages"  being paid to baggage handlers. Compare their income levels to those in the  profession of educating the leaders of tomorrow. Furthermore, many of my  colleagues place their life in jeopardy each day they enter the school grounds.  What is more important, the care of our bags or the care of our youth?  </P> <P> Recently, I posed a question to my 11th grade history class: What occupation  would you prefer, that of a high school teacher or an airline baggage handler?  </P> <P> Their overwhelming answer was to be a high school teacher. Then I explained to  them that the average wage of a baggage handler is (without overtime and bonus)  $44,000 -- $20,000 more than a teacher's salary. The overwhelming response was  which way to the airport?  </P> <P> DUKE DULGARIAN  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P></p>

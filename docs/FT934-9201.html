			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: BellSouth provides Dollars 1.2bn for shake-up BELLSOUTH, the largest Baby Bell regional telephone company, announced yesterday that it is to take a Dollars 1.2bn restructuring charge in the fourth quarter for modernising its network and cutting its workforce by 10,200 over the next three years. The move comes as the company is weighing whether to join the takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications by making an investment in QVC Network, the home shopping channel making a Dollars 9.7bn hostile bid for the company. Paramount has agreed to a Dollars 10bn takeover proposal from cable group Viacom. BellSouth, which provides the local telephone service in the south-eastern US, is the latest of several regional telecommunications groups taking large charges to slim down and modernise their operations to cope with growing competition in the previously monopolistic market. The company said that the charge, which would reduce net income by Dollars 760m, or Dollars 1.53 a share, was to cover re-engineering of its local exchange network which would be completed by the end of 1996. It was 'dramatically changing the way it works with customers, redesigning its fundamental processes and streamlining systems for handling customer service'. Some Dollars 550m of the charge relates to the introduction of new systems, while Dollars 310m covers consolidating and eliminating certain operations and Dollars 380m is for job losses.</p>

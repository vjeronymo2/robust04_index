			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Books: It was all real to me - JDF Jones enjoys Penelope Mortimer's memoirs ABOUT TIME TOO by Penelope Mortimer Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 16.99, 219 pages THE PUMPKIN Eater, Penelope Mortimer's best-known novel (do you remember the film? Anne Bancroft having a nervous breakdown in Harrods?) ends with the following haunting and elegant lines: 'Some of these things happened, and some were dreams. They were all true, as I understood truth. They were all real, as I understood reality'. That might stand as introduction to About Time Too, the second volume of her autobiography. Penelope Mortimer is today in her mid-70s. This memoir takes us from 1940 to 1978, that is to say from her 21st birthday (when she closed her award-winning first volume, About Time, which has just been re-issued by Weidenfeld and Nicolson in paperback) to the purchase of a house and a garden in the Cotswolds which will, we hope and assume, be the subject of a third instalment. The Pumpkin Eater was 'about' a woman who had a horde of children and was in love with a gifted, difficult, promiscuous husband. Mrs Mortimer has six children by various fathers and was married, for part of this new book, to the well-known lawyer and writer John Mortimer. Mr Mortimer does not come well out of this account and if he is realistic he will hardly have expected to. His ex-wife favours candour and she loved him not wisely but too well. The revelation of the infidelities, miseries and delights of a trendy liberal marriage of the 1950s and 1960s will be eagerly consumed in many a literary dinner party and by the up-market gossip columnists. But this book is something better. It is, or appears to be, appallingly honest. It is beautifully written. It is vague or erratic on detail, the narrative fast, full of gaps, the opposite of plodding. The author does not pretend to remember everything and only occasionally quotes from diaries - 'I scrabble and search but don't know what I'm looking for. We were in love, ambitious and in charge of five children: those are the things that motivated our lives' - or again, and typically, 'Only fragments of that time survive . . .' Even so, some of the detail seems approximate. The children are always in the forefront and always the most important thing in her life, but this is also the story of the life of a serious writer, blocks and all. After the success of The Pumpkin Eater she was involved in cinema and taken up in America, a relationship which lasted surprisingly long, eventually including a couple of spells in East Coast academia. Although it is clear that she always belonged on this side of the Atlantic, her description of her time in America is very good (she is so much more interesting when she gets away from John). Some of her vignettes are hilarious, none more so than her stories of her friendship with Bette Davis ('She was old and hating it. 'Ten years]' she snarled, pouring a treble whisky. 'Ten years since I had a fuck] What d'you think of that?''). Mortimer has a writer's gift for the telling phrase: of her mother, for instance - 'She was aggressively humble, blatantly self-effacing, passionately frigid'; or, 'Antonia Fraser, exquisite as usual, sitting the entire evening on a small sofa, her expression placid, as though about to moo'. These days it is easy to forget that Penelope Mortimer had a reputation as the author of witty, not-overly-fictitious short stories in the New Yorker, before she produced the novels she is most proud of - My Friend Says It's Bulletproof, The Home, Long Distance. Perhaps the detail is thin because she spent so much of the time on pills - not just the 'uppers' that fuelled that generation but the drugs her successive psychiatrists prescribed with such lunatic nonchalance. She tells of a lifelong struggle with Depression, of breakdowns, a suicide bid, electric shock treatment, nursing homes. There have been plenty of men in her life, and she is happy to name names, but this book, like her adult life, is dominated by John. 'Whatever the pain and fury connected with John as a husband, as an individual he was my only familiar'. She is not unaware of his own dilemmas: of a final bid at a reconciliation, she writes, 'There is no point, either for writer or reader, in telling it all as it was, except to say that it was perhaps the nearest John has ever been to hell, a place on which, as a day-tripper, I thought myself an authority. John was a novice at unhappiness . . .' John eventually married a second, much younger Penelope and Penelope the First worked at her escape. America came in useful. In the end she returned home and bought a cottage in Chastleton. I know she is about to become a gardener.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fall in oils as German financials revive Bourses mostly fell, oil shares dropping into line with their North American counterparts, although German financials took a turn for the better, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN reacted uneasily to the general election victory of the right wing Freedom Alliance, with profit-taking by domestic investors evident following Monday's sharp gains. The BCI index rose a modest 0.30 to 693.82. Reaction from analysts was mixed. Mr Fabio Basagni of Actinvest was bullish, saying that this was the first time in 50 years that a government had been elected with a clear majority. A free market policy would be adopted, and there would be an acceleration in the number of privatisations. Mr Richard Davidson, a Morgan Stanley strategist, commented that there remained a question mark over how the alliance partners would co-operate. 'We maintain a zero weighting in our model portfolio,' he said. 'We think that the incoming government is unlikely to continue with budgetary policies as vigorous as those of the past two governments ..and that will damage interest rate hopes'. Elsewhere Olivetti, which led the consortium awarded the licence for the second mobile telecommunications network by the outgoing government late on Monday, went against the trend, rising L54 to L2,650. PARIS was hit by weakness in the bond market and a fall in oil stocks, the latter reacting belatedly to falls in oil prices, following the Opec agreement to maintain output until the end of the year. The CAC-40 index lost 22.01 or 1 per cent to 2,122.48. Turnover was slack at FFr3.6bn. Elf Aquitaine and Total both fell back on the Opec news, the former losing FFr12.70 to FFr387 and the latter FFr7.10 at FFr310.50. Casino, which held its 1993 dividend at FFr5, dipped FFr5.50 to FFr171. FRANKFURT put up a relatively strong performance, the Dax index closing the session 6.93 higher at 2,168.35 and the post bourse at 2,162.82. Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that the influence of the bund futures market had been moderated by the strength of the D-Mark against the dollar: 'People don't want to get out of it just now,' she said. Turnover rose from DM7.7bn to DM8.2bn. Share prices reflected a consolidation in cyclicals, favoured in the first quarter of 1994, and a revival in financials. Allianz was the outstanding winner, up DM50 to DM2,575 for a two-day gain of DM99 although Dresdner Bank, up DM10 to DM406, ran the insurer close. Among the big cyclicals, BMW and Hoechst fell DM9 to DM829 and DM6 to DM332.50 respectively; both of these were strong performers on Monday. MADRID hit a new low for the year, the general index falling 2.84 to 324.48 on Wall Street's losses as turnover picked up to Pta30.8bn. Repsol was the hardest hit, falling Pta135, or 3 per cent to Pta4,365 on Wall Street, the weaker dollar and falling crude oil prices. ZURICH chose to ignore favourable analytical reaction to the Ciba-Geigy results, and a drop in Swiss inflation. Ciba registered fell SFr17 to SFr864 and the SMI index by 35.0, or 1.2 per cent to 2,827.4. Banks were pressured by continued worries that European interest rates might not decline as far, or as quickly as previously thought. UBS headed the actives list and dropped SFr19 to SFr1,209. AMSTERDAM was marked down in low volume, with some heavy falls seen among the major issues. The AEX index slipped 4.03 or 1 per cent to 406.90. Royal Dutch, off Fl 1.60 at Fl 190.20, reacted to volatility in oil prices following the meeting of Opec at the weekend. ING, the financial services group, which said that it was planning to issue a Fl 1bn bond and reported a 11 per cent rise in 1993 net profit, in line with expectations, lost Fl 1.80 to Fl 81.10. BRUSSELS was flat, the Bel-20 index ending just 0.83 lower at 1,480.65, but a loss at the Luxembourg-based steelmaker, Arbed, left the latter down BFr175, or 4 per cent at BFr4,235. STOCKHOLM racked up another decline in a two-week downtrend which has wiped out the gains achieved earlier in 1994. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 18.2 to 1,416.7. On the world stock market prices and indices page highs and lows are now shown for 1994.

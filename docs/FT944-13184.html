			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: London &amp; Metro Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.14m against Pounds 3.45m were announced by London &amp; Metropolitan, the property group, for the half year to June 30. The outcome was helped by a fall in interests costs from Pounds 3m to Pounds 1m as a result of last year's restructuring. The UK side had performed well but progress had been hindered by the net running costs of the Pont Royal golf resort in the south of France. Turnover of continuing operations dropped to Pounds 1.63m against a restated Pounds 10.3m. Losses per share were cut to 4.7p (5.6p).</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / HK confirms Jardine deal The Hong Kong government confirmed yesterday that a company owned by trading house Jardine Matheson had won the contract to build a navy base for China before the British colony reverts to Beijing's control in 1997. The HKDollars 790m (Pounds 62.8m) colonial government contract to build the base was awarded to Gammon Construction by the government's Central Tendering Board, secretary for security Alistair Asprey said. Gammon is owned by Jardine Matheson, Jardine Pacific and British-headquartered Trafalgar House, in which Jardine group company Hongkong Land has a 25 per cent stake. Jardine, which moved its group headquarters to Bermuda in the mid-1980s, has been embroiled in a dispute with Beijing over its backing of democratic reforms in the territory. 'The actual contract itself is a straightforward Hong Kong government contract,' Mr Asprey said. China was not consulted, he said, but added it would be consulted on its requirements for design of the base.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN WILSON VS. KRAMER, IT'S NO CONTEST; VIKINGS ROLL  </P> <P> Wade Wilson passed for 212 yards and three touchdowns and connected on two key  passes just before halftime Sunday to turn a close game into a rout, leading  the Minnesota Vikings to a 32-3 victory over the New Orleans Saints.  </P> <P> "I think Wade was probably as alive as I've seen him," Viking Coach Jerry Burns  said. "He had a take-charge attitude."  </P> <P> While Wilson was completing 16 of 24 passes and starring for the Vikings, his  former teammate and adversary, Tommy Kramer, was a goat for the Saints.  </P> <P> Kramer was signed by the Saints during training camp after having been cut last  off-season by the Vikings. He spent 13 years in Minnesota, the last three as  Wilson's rival in an often bitter quarterback controversy.  </P> <P> Sunday, Saint starter John Fourcade sustained a concussion in the second  quarter, forcing Kramer into the game for four series. He was one for three for  two yards, was sacked twice and threw an interception during the Vikings' key  spurt just before halftime.  </P> <P> The Vikings were thrilled to see the nimble Fourcade exit in favor of the  35-year-old Kramer.  </P> <P> "My legs were dancing," nose tackle Henry Thomas said. "I said, 'Oh good, we  don't have to chase that other guy.'  </P> <P> "I couldn't wait. For years in practice, all I heard was, 'Hank, don't hit the  quarterback.' But, oh, this time I could. And I got him."  </P> <P> Asked if he felt sorry for Kramer, Wilson said: "No. Why should I? I don't feel  sorry for him. I don't feel happy for him. I don't feel anything for him."  </P> <P> Kramer, who often fanned the flames of competition in the past, had nicer words  for Wilson this time: "I thought he played extremely well. I want him to do  well -- against other teams."  </P> <P> Wilson wasn't the only star for the Vikings (1-1), who have won 13 straight  home games. Mike Merriweather had two interceptions, Mark Dusbabek recorded a  safety and Minnesota forced five turnovers. Hassan Jones had four receptions  for 103 yards.  </P> <P> New Orleans, still without a touchdown this season, is off to its first 0-2  start in Jim Mora's five seasons as coach.  </P></p>

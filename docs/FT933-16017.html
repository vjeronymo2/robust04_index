			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / BAe discovers it can play hard to get: The on-off talks between UK defence contractors YESTERDAY'S news of the breakdown of joint venture talks between GEC and British Aerospace was accompanied by a sharp reminder of what prompted them in the first place. As yesterday's White Paper on defence spending shows, times are getting steadily tougher in the defence industry. As the UK's two dominant defence contractors, GEC and BAe both compete and co-operate. They were rivals for a Pounds 500m-plus mid-range surface to air missile contract cancelled yesterday. At the same time, they are jointly bidding for several defence contracts in international markets. It is unlikely that Sunday's breakdown of talks - precipitated by disclosure in the weekend press - is the end of the matter. The two companies have held occasional discussions ever since BAe was privatised in 1985. The basic logic is clear. BAe makes warplanes and missiles, while GEC supplies them with sophisticated electronics. The relationship, as BAe conceded yesterday, is symbiotic. In one sense, BAe might be thought the senior partner. Its defence business is at least as large as GEC's. It is also a prime contractor with a massive order book, especially to Saudi Arabia. In all important respects, GEC is merely BAe's supplier. But in reality, the two companies are far from being equals. After prolonged upheaval, BAe was brought last year to a point of near-collapse, which at one point saw its stock market value slump to a mere Pounds 426m. Since then, its share price has more than tripled, chiefly because of energetic restructuring by the new chairman, Mr John Cahill. Nevertheless, its value is still only one sixth that of GEC. Given the well-known predatory instincts of GEC's boss Lord Weinstock, it is thus a measure of BAe's increased self-confidence that it was prepared to talk to GEC at all. Indeed, it seems likely that the underlying reason for the breakdown of talks was not the unwelcome publicity, but a feeling by BAe that it was time to back off and start afresh from a position of greater strength. In recent months, runs the argument, BAE has not merely seen a huge appreciation in its share price. It has also made great strides in its corporate strategy, which will ultimately involve shedding peripheral businesses such as motors and property and focusing on its traditional business of defence. The further BAe progresses along this path, the harder it will be to sell to shareholders the idea of hiving the chief business off into a joint venture. Also, by implication, the longer BAe waits, the better the terms it can extract from GEC. Whether Lord Weinstock sees it in that way is another matter. When BAe was at its most vulnerable last year he went out of his way to tell journalists how much he wanted to do a deal. As a master of the long game, he is not known for overpaying. On the other hand, putting together a dominant force in UK defence has been his central ambition for many years. Thwarted in his first bid for Plessey, he was obliged eventually to share the spoils with Siemens of Germany. When he bought Ferranti's radar business, he was for once induced to pay over the odds. He is now in the galling position of knowing that the Ministry of Defence, which opposed his ambitions for much of the 1980s, is finally on his side. If BAe returns to the table, he will find it hard to walk away. Lex, Page 20</p>

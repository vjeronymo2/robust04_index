Discussing the issue  of further revising political reform bills in the House of  Councillors, Murayama showed a positive stance on a recent  proposal, saying: "The proposal that proportional representation  seats should be decided on a prefectural basis is worth  studying." However, he took an uncompromising attitude on ways  to reallocate seats for single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation and to handle political donations by  companies and other organizations. He stressed: "If we adopt  loose rules on them, it will decrease the significance of  efforts to prevent political corruption and to achieve political  reform. We should leave these key points untouched." He added:  "If there is a portion on which political parties cannot reach  an agreement, a vote should be taken. That is the only  alternative."    Concerning the possibility of the dissolution of the House  of  Representatives for the general election following a failure to  enact the political reform bills in the extended Diet session,  Hata said: "It may be good for political parties to contend in  the election for their policies." But he was negative about  dissolving the house, saying: "It is not time to dissolve the  lower house since there are many issues to be tackled." As for  the issue concerning whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  should take political responsibility if he fails to have the  political reform bills adopted, Hata said: "The prime minister  is making sincere efforts for the reform. And yet, can you hold  him responsible for failing to achieve reform? The public will  ask each Diet member to take responsibility."    Meanwhile, Murayama said: "If the bills are scrapped, the  cabinet will be held responsible for it. We should make as much  effort as possible to avoid the dissolution of the House. But  if the bills should be scrapped, it is possible the government  will ask people's judgment on the bills." While stressing that  the SDPJ would work for the passage of all four political reform  bills, Murayama said: "If the bills are scrapped, the Diet  itself will be held responsible for the failure of political  reform. It may as well try to at least pass the bill on the  prevention of political corruption to live up to the people's  expectations. This is one option." In this way, Murayama  indicated that if it were impossible to enact all four bills, it  might be necessary to separate the bill on the prevention of  corruption from the others to have it enacted.</p>

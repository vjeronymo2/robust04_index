			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Turning over the recovery tea-leaves NOW FOR the tough part. Unemployment is soaring, there is only a very slow and patchy deceleration in factory gate price rises and in pay settlements, and industrial delegations are beginning to arrive in Whitehall pleading for special treatment, if not yet quite threatening a bare knuckle fight. Fortunately, companies are presenting a slightly more robust face to the stock market. It looks as though the declared fall in industrial profits for 1990 will be no more than about 4 per cent, according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, albeit including a 10 per cent drop in the second half-year. Meantime, dividends declared this year appear to be showing overall growth of about 5 per cent, rather than the zero which some of the pessimists were predicting back in the depths of the past winter. It suggests that listed companies in general are reasonably happy about their prospects for recovery. Nevertheless as the economy heads towards its trough the political stakes are being raised. Only now, nearly three years after Nigel Lawson began to push up interest rates, to cope with a temporary 'blip' of rising prices, is the government beginning to realise just how hard a task it will be to stuff the inflationary genie back into its bottle. If it isn't hurting it isn't working, somebody once said. Industrialists like Robert Horton, chairman of BP, are starting to hit back at the government's failure to control inflation. The government, for its part, might argue that employers could do more to put their own house in order, and that a 12 per cent rate of increase in unit labour costs output might justify a more robust stance on pay, in the boardroom's executive compensation committee as well as on the factory floor. Still, it has long been common ground between employers and trade unions in the UK that it is more appropriate in hard times to cut jobs rather than pay. In these terms, you could rather cynically point to a record rate of increase in unemployment, at over 100,000 a month, as a demonstration of the improved responsiveness of modern British management. But from the stock market's point of view there is an uncomfortable paradox: this year's rises in share prices have been celebrating the expected reduction in inflation and the imminent economic recovery, but on the evidence of the reported figures the corporate squeeze may not have been severe enough to have the desired effect. If it doesn't work, there may have to be even more pain. However, there are different ways of looking at the degree of resilience of profits. Something like two-fifths of the profits of British listed companies are earned by overseas subsidiaries, and although the weakness of the dollar was a problem in 1990 its strength in 1991 (plus 15 per cent against sterling so far) looks like coming to the rescue. As for the domestic picture, the official statistics show a drop of about 2 per cent in company trading profits last year. The decline has been more dramatic in terms of the share of national income: by the final quarter of 1990 profits represented only 11 per cent of GDP, down from a 1988 peak of 15.4 per cent. That is either an indication of how companies are being squeezed, or a hint of the recovery potential. If, as a shareholder, you are confident that your company is going to survive, and is unlikely to dilute your investment excessively by jumping too enthusiastically on to the current rights issue bandwagon, then you are not going to be particularly interested in how far its profits may fall this year. It is the potential a year or two out that is far more important. That is why earnings downgradings by analysts, which caused so much panic last year, have ceased to be of great concern in 1991. ICI's first quarter profits, published on Thursday, may have been halved compared with the same period last year, but they were sharply higher than in the fourth quarter, and the share price went up. Somewhere down the road company profits generally are going to rise substantially. But it could take a while. In 1982 profits only rallied modestly as the economy began to recover from the deep recession of 1980 and 1981, and it was only in 1983 and 1984 that substantial earnings gains were seen. On that basis we may be a good two years away from a really healthy profits upturn. And it is rather more anticipated in advance today, when the market p/e is 13, than it was in 1981 when the p/e was more like 10 (and the dividend yield was a percentage point or so higher, too). It is going to be a nervous summer, as the politicians and industrialists sift through the statistical tea-leaves looking for the recovery which the Treasury's computer has promised us. This week it began to look as though the upturn may begin in the wrong places. Retail sales jumped in March, and the housing market flickered to life as well, so that building society lending jumped sharply for the month, while bank lending to the corporate sector was dead as a dodo. Maybe we should not be too concerned about a transient VAT-beating flurry in the shops, but any more persistent consumer-led economic recovery could put serious pressure on the balance of payments, which is running at an annual rate of Pounds 5 1/2 bn even in the depths of the recession. It was very different in 1981, when there was a balance of payments surplus and sterling was embarrassingly firm. This time, if consumer demand were to be the main engine of the recovery rather than the Treasury's projected 4 3/4 per cent rise in export volumes over the next year, the government would find it impossible to continue its delicate balancing act of edging down interest rates while maintaining sterling in a healthy position in the European Monetary System. Still, it all gives scope for interesting conversations when those industrial delegations come round for tea.</p>

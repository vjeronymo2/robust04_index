			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES: WHIMPERS IN 'ECHOES' SHOW AT MANDEVILLE;  </P> <P> SURREALISM: A SHOW OF 12 CALIFORNIA ARTISTS CONTAINS WORKS THAT DO JUSTICE TO  ORIGINATORS OF MOVEMENT BUT ALSO INCLUDES PIECES THAT EXPLOIT ITS POPULARITY.  </P> <P> In a 1924 manifesto, Andre Breton introduced surrealism as "a new vice,"  delivering ecstatic freedoms to its addicts -- freedom from the contamination  of reality, freedom from the entangling skeins of logic, freedom for the mind,  the heart, the unconscious to roam at leisure.  </P> <P> Surrealism's "mysterious effects and special pleasures" continue to tempt many  an artist and seduce many a curator. This year's abundance of shows related to  surrealism -- locally and elsewhere -- has turned the surrealist label into a  catch-all of instant virtue. Certainly the heady conceptualism that reigns in  today's art scene begs a more intuitive, sensuous antidote, but what is being  passed off as contemporary surrealism doesn't always fit the bill.  </P> <P> "Echoes of Surrealism" (at UC San Diego's Mandeville Gallery through Oct. 28)  is a show of 12 contemporary California artists, and contains several  resounding voices that do justice to the ghosts of Breton, et al., but also  includes some weak, derivative whimpers that exploit the movement's popularity.  </P> <P> Surrealism, from its inception, has always been less a style than a frame of  mind. Defined as pure psychic automatism by Breton, surrealism suggests a  sensibility devoid of reason, "exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern."  Black humor, rebellious pride, fidelity to chance and a disdain for the  regimental social order all made surrealism a potent postscript to the  anarchism of Dada. Political critique was rarely spelled out in the art itself,  but was present in the artists' own revolutionary acts, in their defiance of  convention, their poetic poison arrows sent to the guardians of the status quo.  </P> <P> Given this heritage, it is surprising how overt and literal much of the imagery  is in the Mandeville show. Carolyn Cardenas paints a painstakingly detailed  chronicle of decadence and despair in her hinged triptych, "West of Eden." An  updated version of Hieronymus Bosch's "Garden of Earthly Delights," Cardenas'  painting takes Southern California as its target, particularly its inhabitants'  indulgences in carnal pleasures and material diversions. A couple soaks in a  hot tub while the world around them erodes -- physically, ethically, socially.  </P> <P> Like Cardenas, Deborah F. Lawrence engages in slick social satire that has  little to do with surrealism's poetic subterfuge, but much to do with decaying  value systems and art's impotent, though highly visible, role in this process.  Lawrence's painted montages twist familiar icons of art and popular culture,  from the Mona Lisa to Marilyn Monroe, into humorous, irreverent positions.  </P> <P> Other artists in the show have pledged a little too much allegiance to  individual members of the original surrealist circle. Mark Bryan aligns himself  uncomfortably close to Rene Magritte, while Phyllis Shafer borrows heavily from  Yves Tanguy. Their efforts are overly stylized. They haven't the freshness and  startling oddity of their precedents from 60 years ago.  </P> <P> Of all the bizarre, fantastic visions here, Paul Singdahlsen's have the  greatest power to seep beneath the skin and abrade one's sense of security and  order. A train crosses over a jagged chasm in one of his dark, bare-bones  landscapes, richly drawn in pastel. In another, Singdahlsen lays out his  haunting, apocalyptic vision of glowing, shell-like shelters beneath a  ravenous, brooding sky. The first band of surrealists had dreams to mine --  this generation suffers nightmares.  </P></p>

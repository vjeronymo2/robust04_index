			<p>BFN     [Text] The security forces face four phases of potential  disorder in the election process. One is the run-up during  which groups with low political tolerance try to intimidate one  another, as well as other parties whose tradition of tolerance  is perceived as weakness. This has already begun, the process  already marked by events such as the Johannesburg massacre, the  intensification of communal violence in kwaZulu/Natal and on the  East Rand and -- on a decidedly lower key -- the breaking up of  NP [National Party] and DP [Democratic Party] meetings.    Next is the polling period when intimidation is likely to  intensify (especially if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stays  out of the election and the very act of voting becomes a public  political statement). Confusion and panic are possible at the  polling stations, where most voters have absolutely no  experience of the process. Attempts to interfere with the  polling process are possible, while tensions could be created by  people marching in large groups to cast their vote, out of a  sense of insecurity.    A period of over-exuberance could threaten public order  immediately after the results are made known. It would be  exacerbated if the ANC should register the kind of runaway  victory that could encourage some of its supporters to press for  a scrapping of the power-sharing mechanisms of the interim  constitution. It is possible elements of the disadvantaged  classes will have totally unrealistic expectations and will  stream into the suburbs to claim their houses, swimming pools  and cars. And the losers could seek to give forceful expression  to their rejection of the outcome.    Finally, a phase of disillusioned anger is almost certain,  and this could occur after the military reservists have been  demobilised.    Chris de Kock and Charl Schutte, of the Human Sciences  Research Council, examine this question in depth in an empirical  study of the question of violence over the elections. They note  that posters promoting voter literacy pose the question: "Why  vote?" then answer: "Education, housing, jobs and peace." They  ask if the compilers are ignorant of the theory of rising  expectations or whether they want to pass on a subtle message  stimulating such expectations.    "Whatever their reasons, there can be little doubt they are  doing an elected transitional government a great disservice.  Expectations of immediate gratification in terms of housing,  education, work and peace are being aroused in the largest  segment of the South African population."    They say no transition government could meet such  expectations in a short period, which will cause high levels of  frustration and aggression to be exploited by enemies of the  transitional government. "One should also not lose sight of the  fact that the black population in particular, after a decade of  ungovernability and not paying for services and alternative  structures, will not recognise the authority of a transitional  government that does not 'deliver the goods' overnight."</p>

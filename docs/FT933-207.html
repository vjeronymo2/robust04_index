			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Refunds to Kuwait probed: Inland Revenue focuses on Pounds 600m linked to BP investment THE INLAND Revenue has launched a formal investigation into whether Kuwait should repay more than Pounds 600m in tax refunds which it received in connection with its Dollars 1.7bn investment in British Petroleum. The Revenue's international division will lead the investigation. The Financial Times reported last week that the Gulf state may have abused its sovereign immunity from taxation in relation to its purchase in the late 1980s of a stake close to 22 per cent in BP. A UK government official said yesterday: 'The Revenue is investigating allegations that sovereign immunity has been abused by Kuwait.' He added that it would be impossible to judge how long the inquiry would last. 'It depends on co-operation from the other side (the Kuwaitis)', he said. The Kuwait Investment Office, the emirate's international investment arm, enjoys sovereign immunity from taxation on investments it makes on behalf of the state fund, the Fund for Future Generations. These tax savings have been worth more than Dollars 1bn annually in some years, according to tax experts. The FT report said that Kuwait may have abused this immunity by receiving more than Pounds 600m of refunds on the BP investment. According to the testimony of a former senior Kuwaiti official, the investment was made by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which is not entitled to sovereign immunity even though it is state-owned because it is a company set up by issuing shares. After the BP shares had been bought, Kuwait told the Inland Revenue that they been purchased by the KIO on behalf of the state investment fund. The Kuwait Investment Authority, the government agency to which the KIO reports, said during the weekend it would conduct its own review of the 'historical background' to the BP investment. It also said it 'cannot accept the allegations made in the report of the Financial Times' and that it 'never had the intention to mislead the British authorities'. The Inland Revenue will not be examining whether there should be changes to the rules which give tax immunity to states or sovereigns making investments. The question of whether the scope of sovereign immunity should be narrowed is a matter for the government, not the Inland Revenue, the government official said.</p>

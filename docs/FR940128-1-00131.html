			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Example <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The ABC Crab Co. produces pasteurized crabmeat. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pasteurization process being used has been established by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the university extension service (a process authority). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process provided by the extension service includes limits on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how to stack the canned product into the pasteurizer, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process temperature, and the length of time needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve proper pasteurization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pasteurization equipment being used by ABC Crab Co. is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least equivalent to that described by the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from the extension service. It is equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both a mercury-in-glass thermometer and a recording  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermometer. The recording thermometer is compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mercury-in-glass thermometer during each pasteurization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle. It is adjusted as necessary to meet the critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit. The mercury-in-glass thermometer is calibrated at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent laboratory every 6 months. The temperature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each pasteurization cycle is controlled to meet the critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits using the mercury-in-glass thermometer and the length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of each cycle is controlled using a wall clock. The loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the cans is checked before starting each batch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. For making sure that the pasteurization process was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly established: before using a pasteurization process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. For making sure that the pasteurizing equipment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly designed: before using pasteurizing equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. For properly delivering the process: each lot or batch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. For monitoring the temperature: each lot or batch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. For checking the accuracy of the temperature recorder:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the beginning and end of each production day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. For calibrating the thermometer: at installation and at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least annually after that.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. For monitoring the length of the pasteurizing cycle:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each lot or batch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. For monitoring other critical factors: as often as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to achieve control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Zero tolerance for product produced with a deviation from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum established pasteurization process, including such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical factors as time, temperature, initial temperature,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container size, and product formulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The temperature-indicating device should agree within 1  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NIST) traceable thermometer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The temperature recording device should be adjusted to agree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as nearly as possible, but never to be higher, than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature indicating device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A record that describes the results of a scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation, conducted by a process authority, of the adequacy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pasteurizing process.

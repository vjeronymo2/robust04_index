			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tomorrow morning President Lech Walesa will hand  Grzegorz Kolodko his act of appointment to the post of deputy  prime minister and finance minister. Professor Kolodko was  already a candidate for finance minister during the creation of  Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet last fall. He relinquished  participation in the government at that time because the  economic program he presented was not accepted by the whole  coalition.    [Unidentified Correspondent] Prof. Kolodko, who already took  part today in a meeting of the Council of Ministers' Economic  and Social Committees, said that he identified with the  government's position on the strikes and the neopopiwek  [wage-control law].    [Begin Kolodko recording] I never was an advocate of the  neopopiwek, but I always was and remain an advocate of a tough  anti-inflation policy. The government will shortly be proposing  solutions that will, after acceptance by the trade unions, serve  to protect real wages, which the prime minister spoke about, and  here the issue of the popiwek, the neopopiwek, should be seen in  the proper perspective.

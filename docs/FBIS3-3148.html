			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- After Taiwan is admitted  to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the  average tariff rate on agricultural product imports will be  somewhere between those adopted by Japan and South Korea, an  official with the Council of Agriculture said Thursday [17  March].    "In adjusting tariff rates on agricultural imports, we'll  not  only consider GATT requirements but also refer to the rates of  GATT members whose economic levels are similar to ours, such as  Japan and South Korea," the official explained.    South Korea's average tariff rate on agricultural products  stood at 19.6 percent in 1993, slightly higher than Japan's 18  percent but lower than Taiwan's 21.63 percent. After the GATT  Uruguay Round accords take effect later this year, the official  said, the two countries must further lower their tariff rates by  24 to 36 percent.    The official said Taiwan will be forced to open its  agricultural market after it is admitted to the Geneva-based  world trade regulatory body which advocates free and fair trade.    "With its limited production, Taiwan's agricultural industry  cannot compete in international markets," the official noted.  "And without tariff and non-tariff protection, the products  will not even be able to compete on the domestic market."    Among others, growers of sugar, peanuts, red beans, garlic,  mushrooms and potatoes will be hardest hit if the government  removes subsidies and cuts tariffs in accordance with GATT  regulations, the official said. Current local prices for those  products are two to four times those quoted on international  markets. Peanuts, red beans and garlic are major crops for  farmers in southern Taiwan. "The social and political costs for  allowing importation of these products will be very high," the  official warned.    Many locally produced fruits, including pears, peaches,  plums, apples, grapefruit, bananas, mangoes and guava, may also  be squeezed out of the market after current import restrictions  are eased, the official said.    To help local farmers overcome difficulties that are  expected  to arise after Taiwan's GATT entry, the official said, the  agricultural council will adopt several strategies to cope with  tariff problems.    First of all, the official said, the government will ask  GATT  to allow Taiwan to import only limited quantities of rice for  the first 10 years of membership. "The import quota will be set  at 1 to 4 percent of Taiwan's total annual rice consumption,"  the official said. "If this goal can be realized, the impact on  our rice farmers will be limited," he noted.    Meanwhile, the official said, Taiwan will liberalize  importation of other farm products under a tariff system.  "After we join GATT, we'll use different tariff strategies  toward different farm products," he explained.    For example, the government may lower tariff rates on some  farm products during the off-season. The government may also  adopt a two-tier tariff system for some items under which  imports within quotas will be subject to lower tariff rates and  higher rates will be imposed on those exceeding the quotas.</p>

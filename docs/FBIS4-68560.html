			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with First Deputy Foreign Minister Zhirayr </F> Libarityan in Yerevan; date not specified]    [Text] Zhirayr Liparityan, first deputy minister of foreign  affairs, recently returned from a working tour of Russia,  France, Turkey and Iran. What were the results? What issues were  discussed? What changes were observed? These are the topics our  correspondent discussed with the first deputy minister in an  interview.    [Liparityan] Our principal goal was to convey to those  countries our view of the present situation which was created as  a result of the developments of recent months and to hear their  assessments. When I was in the United States in January, I was  able to convey our approaches to officials of the State  Department. At that time I also met with Jan Eliason, the  chairman of the Minsk Group of the CSCE. Let me note with regard  to this trip that we discussed the issue of the development of  bilateral relations with Iran. Although we do not have bilateral  relations with Turkey, we agreed that we must reinstate the  direct ties that were cut following the recent occupation of  [Azerbaijani] territories.    [AZG] Last year you visited Turkey again and, if I am not  mistaken, at that time you noted a certain understanding in the  Turks' position. Of course one cannot expect any change of  position on matters of principle, but did you notice any  movement in terms of the correct perception of the  [Armenian-Azeri] conflict?    [Liparityan] I think that there is such a movement. Our  meetings were all working meetings. We were very interested in  knowing the results of [Azerbaijani President Haydar] Aliyev's  visit to Turkey. The Turks intend to back Azerbaijan's  approaches, at least officially. When Azerbaijan began to  respond negatively to all the proposals put forward, the Turks  reaffirmed that Azerbaijan has the right to do that. Turkey's  position is also that [Armenia] should withdraw from the  [occupied] territories. During our talks we focused on that  issue in greater detail and pointed out that it is impossible to  solve the Azerbaijani problem with that approach.    First, our position is that the problem is not one of  territory because both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia have  endorsed the plan which envisages that they withdraw from those  territories--except Lachin which, as a complex problem, must be  discussed in the second stage.    We asked why Azerbaijan is raising the issue of territories  and is trying to seize by force what it can get without any  fighting. Azerbaijan continues to state that it does not wish to  discuss the issue of blockades. The Turks agree with these  questions we raised. They are also in agreement on the issue of  a ceasefire, but they are not so keen about the insertion of  peacekeeping forces. We explained to them that the situation is  already such that it is doubtful if a ceasefire can be  maintained without separating forces.    [AZG] Has there been any movement in Turkey's policy with  regard to Azerbaijan?    [Liparityan] I think that the Turks now realize the mistakes  they permitted last year during Elchibey's tenure. Now that they  see how Aliyev plays with different countries, they do not have  the confidence they had during Elchibey's time. At the same  time, however, they do not wish to lose their influence over  Azerbaijan, and, as a result, do not want to engage in a  confrontation with Aliyev. My impression is that Aliyev asked  for many things but did not get much. He demanded much, but  promised little. Consequently, the Turks were not very happy  with his visit.    [AZG] What is the situation in Iran relative to Turkey?    [Liparityan] In our opinion, Iran's position is more  practical. Iran is saying: We will accept and are prepared to  contribute to any initiative which works, brings peace and ends  the conflict.    [AZG] But Iran persists in speaking out in favor of  Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Also, it has stopped  offering its offices for mediation.    [Liparityan] For the present time, Iran has not offered a  mediation role. Our opinion is also that at this time what is  needed is not a new mediation mission, but to reduce the  existing missions and combine them into a single one. The  Iranians are prepared to help in any way that the sides propose.    Also, in their newspapers the Iranians refer to changes of  borders rather than territorial integrity. In this regard the  most severe comments were made by Rohani, the deputy speaker of  the Iranian parliament.    I told them that such a question does not exist. Azerbaijan  can recover all of its territories if it wishes by agreeing to  any peace plan.    [AZG] Did you discuss the issue of the blockade around  Armenia with Turkey?    [Liparityan] We did. They have no intention of resolving  that  problem until the conflict ends and the peace process begins. If  that happens they are also prepared to develop bilateral  relations.    [AZG] What is the status of Armenian-Iranian relations?    [Liparityan] Those relations were frozen in a political  sense. Now things have changed. We even agreed to exchange  ambassadors instead of charges d'affaires. For the Iranians what  is important is not so much the issue of occupied territories  but the establishment of a ceasefire, because they are concerned  that all these developments may have an effect on the Azeris  living in Iran. However, this must not be interpreted in general  that the issue of territories is not of great concern to Iran.    [AZG] You also visited France. What is the position of  French  diplomats?    [Liparityan] France believes that it is no longer possible  to  work with the Vienna plan. They think if one of the sides has  rejected that plan, the others must work on new approaches. We  explained to them that there are a few ways of solving that  problem. First we must think about the cessation of hostilities  and then move on to the other steps. At present there are two  major difficulties. One is that the parties to the conflict do  not trust each other. Azerbaijan believes that Karabakh wants to  keep the occupied territories or to exchange some of them for  recognition of its status. Karabakh believes Azerbaijan will use  any ceasefire to rearm and to resume its offensive. The other  difficulty is that there are countries that want to solve other  problems. For example, Turkey wants to use this conflict to  advance its agenda in Azerbaijan and Central Asia. Although  Turkey is interested in ending the conflict it wants to develop  its relations with Azerbaijan, and to that end has not  established relations with Armenia. Unlike Turkey, the problem  Iran wants to solve is not this. It has not predicated the  development of its bilateral relations with Armenia on this  conflict. In contrast, Turkey has not only refused to establish  relations with Armenia, but has taken a position in the conflict  which is not rational.    [AZG] What is Russia's position in the wake of recent visits  by Kazimirov and Kondratev to the region?    [Liparityan] That is related to the 18 February document.  Azerbaijan rejected it at the beginning but agreed to it later.  However, there are no practical results because additional  meetings are necessary to solve the technical problems.    [AZG] Azerbaijan rejected that plan at the beginning, but  they declared later that they accept it. Subsequently it was  stated that they rejected it. How can that be interpreted? Are  there differences within the Azeri leadership or is it another  ploy?    [Liparityan] It can be interpreted in two ways. It seems  that  there are some differences [within the Azeri government]. On the  other hand, they can always agree to it today and reject it  tomorrow. When Russia says a few words they say yes. When  Russia's envoy returns to Moscow they say no again. Azerbaijan  has always had that problem. Its representatives never had the  necessary authority during negotiations in the Minsk Group. Even  when they agreed to a plan, they reneged on it after they  returned to Baku.    We have never had such problems--saying yes first and then  saying no.</p>

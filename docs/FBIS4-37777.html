			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Knesset correspondent Yona Kohen] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres confirmed in the  Knesset there is room for concern regarding the events in North  Korea, which is dodging international supervision.    Addressing the Knesset plenum, Peres emphasized the need of  implementing international political steps regarding this issue.  Peres said the world is changing its shape from a world of  enemies to a world of dangers. The lethal combination of  missiles and nuclear weapons has changed the issues of borders,  defenses, and settlements; it is doubtful whether there is any  way to prevent the missile danger. Peres said that our defense  system must meet the magnitude of the missile and nuclear  weapons danger.    Peres added that political agreements can prevent the  nuclear  danger. The foreign minister hopes an international coalition  will be formed against the countries harboring missiles and  nuclear arms. North Korea is presently playing a "cat and mouse  game." The United States is heading the countries confronting  the North Korean threat. Peres said that the United States is  determined to prevent the danger, adding that Israel will  support whatever action it takes in this issue.</p>

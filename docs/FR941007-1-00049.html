			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There would have been five ratings_``outstanding,'' ``high satisfactory,'' ``low satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' and ``substantial noncompliance''_under each of the lending, investment, and service tests so as to measure with more refinement the variations in performance among institutions. The agencies proposed to have only four overall ratings, however, as required by statute_``outstanding,'' ``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' and ``substantial noncompliance.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The December proposal was originally published with a 60-day comment period. This period was extended for 30 additional days in view of the magnitude of the proposed changes, the complexity of the issues, the level of interest in the subject, and delays resulting from the holiday season (59 FR 5138). After considering the thousands of comments received, the agencies produced the revised regulations proposed today, which respond to suggestions in the comments while preserving the December proposal's goal of emphasizing performance over process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Overview of Comments on the December Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Collectively, the agencies received over 6700 comment letters on the December proposal. The agencies received comment letters from representatives of banks and thrifts, consumer and community groups, Congress, state and local governments, and others as shown in the following table:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 6,L2,i1,s200,12,12,12,8,8 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table of Comments Received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Agency  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Letters from banks, thrifts and their trade associations  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Letters from consumer and community groups  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Letters from government entities  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Letters from others  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Total <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> OCC  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1329  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 253  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 78  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 153  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1813  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1236  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 209  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 54  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 181  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1680  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2002  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 219  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 71  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 82  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2374  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTS  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 486  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 240  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 62  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 55  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 843 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The agencies reviewed and considered all of the above-described comments concerning the December proposal. Comments are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of the revised proposal. As a general matter, the vast majority of commenters expressed support for the agencies' goal of developing more objective, performance-based assessment standards that minimize burden while stimulating improved performance. Many commenters believed that, under the existing CRA regulations, the agencies focus too closely on documentation of CRA performance and too little on actual performance. These commenters felt the present documentation requirements are overly burdensome. Many commenters also supported the agencies' goal of ensuring consistency and evenhandedness among the agencies in CRA evaluations. Commenters supported enhanced CRA examiner training to increase consistency. While most commenters generally supported the agencies' goals in amending their CRA regulations, many expressed concern over some aspects of the December proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

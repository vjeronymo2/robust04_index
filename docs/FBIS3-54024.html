Last week, al-Qadhdhafi again asked to visit Cairo or  al-Sallum to remove the misunderstanding between his country and  Egypt because of the al-Khikya incident.    In his message, al-Qadhdhafi renewed his offer to mediate  between Egypt and Sudan and to host an Egyptian-Sudanese summit  in Tripoli.    The Egyptian information minister told him that the Egyptian  and Sudanese foreign ministers are holding contacts to resolve  controversial issues between the two countries, and that any  future summit depends on the success of the expected meeting  between the two foreign ministers.    Safwat al-Sharif also informed Libyan officials that the  Egyptian Government categorically refuses to deport Libyan  opposition activists in Cairo because they have not violated the  terms of political asylum granted to them. Libya had proposed  that the opposition activists be deported from Cairo to avoid  any tension their presence might cause to Egyptian-Libyan  relations.    Egypt last week refused to welcome the senior Libyan  official, al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, who requested to visit Cairo  during his recent presence in Tunis.</p>

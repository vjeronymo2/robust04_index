			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Adorno Ruiz] </F>   [Text] In one of the most important operations against the  drug traffic conducted by the Office of the Attorney General of  the Republic [PGR], Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents  confiscated a shipment of nearly 53 kg of heroin. Worth over 200  million new pesos on the black market, it would have been used  to process more than 2 million doses. The operation was carried  out in the town of Ensenada, Baja California, where the agents  also captured four Thai, two Mexicans, and a Lao belonging to an  international drug trafficking ring.    In this connection, the PGR reported: "One of the most  severe  blows recorded in the history of this effort was dealt to the  heroin dealers. Therefore, the investigations will be continued,  so as to capture all the members of the criminal group."    Through its representative in Baja California State, Arturo  Ochoa Palacios, and the Federal Judicial Police deputy  commissioner, Raul Loza Parra, the PGR announced that the  following were captured during the operation: Seachao Vern  Chieng, a native of Laos and resident of the United States; Phan  Saeng Vern, a Thai naturalized as a U.S. citizen; Vang Yao Fow,  Seaphan Sou On, and Seaphan Aecho (also from Thailand, but  residents of the neighboring country to the north); and the  Mexican women, Maricruz Barrera and Armida Aldaco.    The officials stressed that those arrested admitted their  guilt of all the charges of crimes against health brought  against them. Consequently, within the next few hours they will  be remanded to the pertinent federal authorities.    As for the manner in which the arrests were made, the  officials noted that a surveillance operation was implemented  for several weeks, after the detection of two cardboard boxes  containing heroin that had been transported by the Postal  Service delivery unit. They had originally been sent to  Thailand, and later returned to Mexico, for no apparent reason.    The sources indicated that the mailing and return operation  took place on several occasions, attracting the detectives'  attention.    They added: "At the fourth postal administrative office,  Federal Judicial Police agents located a third cardboard box  holding 18 bars of toilet soap. When the shipment was inspected  in the presence of the federal public prosecutor, eight packets  were found containing pure heroin with a gross weight of one kg  and 726 grams."    "Furthermore, at the administrative office of the Mexican  Postal Service's Francisco Zarco Branch, the Federal Judicial  Police found two boxes with similar features that had been sent  from Thailand. They contained several packages wrapped in  plastic, holding heroin with a gross weight of 9.706 kg."    Ochoa Palacios added that the probe was continued and, as a  result, PJF personnel, backed by the Federal Highway Police,  intercepted the drivers of a Chevrolet sedan with Baja  California plates. They were identified as Phan Saeng Vern, Vang  Yao Fow, Seaphan Sou On, Seachao Vern Chieng, and Seaphan Aecho.  A few days earlier, these individuals had attempted to retrieve  the boxes containing the drugs at the Postal Service offices in  Ensenada.    Addressing the federal public prosecutor, who opened  preliminary investigation 19/94, the subjects stated, with the  aid of a translator, that they had already managed to move large  heroin shipments to the United States, using a "bridge"  established between Asia and Mexico.    They revealed that they were sending boxes containing soap  and shampoo to Thailand, and that the containers were emptied in  that country and filled with heroin, for subsequent return to  Mexico by air, using the "merchandise returns" service. On  Mexican territory, they arranged to have the shipments picked up  in the parcel post area, assigning other persons to do this, in  order to avoid arousing suspicion.    With the information that they provided, the federal agents  captured Maricruz Barrera who, upon her arrest, informed them  that three suitcases containing drugs were at the residence of  her friend, Armida Aldaco, located in the second section of  Ensenada's Colonia Francisco Villa. After searching the site,  the agents found the bags in a closet, and turned them over to  the public prosecutor, Luis Ibanez Cornejo, who found 42 kg of  heroin inside.    The PGR representative reported that the narcotics were to  be  sold in the towns of Visalia, Santa Ana, and Fresno, California.    He also noted that Alfonso Romero Verdugo, employed as head  of the MexPost department of the Mexican Postal Service, at the  No. 1 main post office in Ensenada, was arrested. The presumed  drug traffickers claimed that they had given him money for his  cooperation in receiving and sending the packages containing  heroin.</p>

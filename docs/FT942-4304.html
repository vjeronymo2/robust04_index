			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Election opportunity wasted Sir, The European election campaign produced a disturbing symptom of British insularity which we ignore at our peril. All the evidence is that the European Parliament is rapidly becoming an effective force. There is a series of really important and difficult issues of European policy crying out for it to address. How is the European Union going to handle future security problems on its doorstep such as Bosnia? How protectionist should Europe be in the world after the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? How is a long-run solution to be found to the problems of European agriculture, which constantly clog the working of the Union? How does the dirigiste concept of 'trans-European' networks for everything from public administration through trunk roads to telecommunications (the latter discussed in your admirable leader, 'Networking Europe', of 3 June) ride with the ardent free market policies of some Commissioners? I am sure others could think of many similar issues. The attitudes of the new MEPs and their groupings towards these matters may turn out to be formative for a large part of our future. Yet none of them surfaced in the European election campaign in Britain. To the extent that it dealt with European as distinct from domestic issues at all, it was a collision between 'European' and 'Euro-sceptic' philosophies, with the social chapter as a sort of chopping block. An important opportunity to influence all our futures has simply been wasted. J M Harper, 11 Lullington Close, Seaford, E Sussex BN25 4JH</p>

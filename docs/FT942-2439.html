			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Madrid acts to reassure business over economy Spain will not deviate from its current economic policies, despite the defeat suffered by the ruling Socialist party in last week's European elections, according to economy minister Pedro Solbes. He told an audience of businessmen in Catalonia at the weekend that this would mean tight national budgets for the next three years. Cutting the public sector deficit was essential to enable the country to grow and create jobs on a permanent basis, he said. His comments, aimed at reassuring business in an unsettled political climate, followed pressure from hardline sectors of the Socialist party to move towards the left and seek a rapprochement with the Communist-led United Left party. The Socialists need United Left support to continue running the regional government in Andalucia, where they suffered heavy setbacks in elections last week. The government has at the same time been pressed by leaders of the conservative Popular party to respond to the verdict of voters in the European ballot. Mr Rodrigo Rato, the PP's parliamentary spokesman, said in an interview published yesterday that Spain needed tougher budget cuts and lower social costs to industry. However, Mr Solbes, appointed last year as a non-party independent in the Socialist administration, said the government would 'swerve neither to the right not to the left'. Any rapprochement with United Left would jeopardise the government's current pact with the Catalan nationalist party Convergencia i Union, whose 17 deputies provide the Socialists with just enough support for a working majority in parliament. Mr Jordi Pujol, the CiU leader and Catalan regional president, reaffirmed his readiness to keep supporting the government in a meeting on Thursday night with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister. However, he made clear this was pegged to specific economic and regional policies. Both the CiU and the Basque Nationalist Party have discouraged the government from seeking their explicit backing in a confidence motion in parliament. See Spanish Banking and Finance Survey</p>

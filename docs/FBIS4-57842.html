			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who was removed from the  Sandinist National Directorate during the party's special  congress, has said he will continue the struggle for deep  changes in the Sandinist Front [FSLN], which is now controlled  by Daniel Ortega's orthodox faction. I will continue promoting  ideas of change, transformation, and renewal within the FSLN,  the former Nicaraguan vice president and chief of the FSLN bloc  in the National Assembly said. He added: These are not battles  one wins in only one day. He also said a crisis emerges when  something does not complete its birth and death processes.    He indicated that one must struggle for something new to be  born in Sandinism. In that constant struggle, nothing is over  [words indistinct] the day of its victory, Ramirez said. He  said that in the National Assembly, the conservative group that  now controls the party has already carried out the first phase  involving crushing those who do not think like it does. He was  undoubtedly referring to Daniel Ortega and those who currently  hold important key positions in the FSLN. Ramirez said they will  now implement the second phase of the plan to control the  legislative faction, the newspaper BARRICADA, the media  stations, and those who do not think like the new Sandinist  leadership that emerged from the FSLN congress.</p>

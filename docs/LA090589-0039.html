			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH THE LADIES -- BUT NOT QUITE  </P> <P> The Ladies of Jazz. An interesting idea for a concert -- especially on a  pleasant Sunday afternoon in Barnsdall Park. And free, at that.  </P> <P> Sponsored by the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation, it was the  centerpiece in a group of three programs described as the second annual Los  Angeles International Jazz Festival.  </P> <P> Things didn't work out quite as advertised, however. Trumpeter/singer Clora  Bryant, for example, opened the show backed by an all-male ensemble. Not  another female on stage. The first two numbers, excerpts from a suite dedicated  to Dizzy Gillespie, allowed plenty of space for Bryant's trumpeting. Curiously,  it resonated with stronger echoes of Roy Eldridge than Gillespie. Bryant also  sang effectively, especially on another original, "Ain't No Use."  </P> <P> Rose Gales &amp; Velvet Jazz were the only performers to fulfill the promise of  the concert's title. Pianist Gales played a conservative role in a strong  rhythm section that also included bassist Leslie Baker, drummer Andrea Brown  and percussionist Elmira. But the group's two upfront players -- violinist  Karen Briggs and guitarist Lady Mac -- were the stars of the day, stealing the  thunder from the musicians of both sexes.  </P> <P> Lady Mac ripped off a series of solos that blazed with images of Jimi Hendrix  and Kevin Eubanks. Briggs was even more arresting. A fine technician, she moved  beyond an obvious Coltrane influence into a soaring originality that suggested  the emergence of a potential world class jazz star.  </P> <P> As the concert wound toward its close, the "Ladies of Jazz" premise disappeared  entirely with the arrival of a bland, all-male fusion band led by saxophonist  Wayne Wayne. Two numbers later they were joined by blues vocalist Barbara  Morrison. Her first songs, "My Funny Valentine" and "Don't Explain," revealed a  sweet voice and a convincing jazz rhythmic sense. But Morrison's move into a  group of rhythm and blues numbers brought an effective end to the jazz  proceedings for the day.  </P> <P> In the other programs of the Second Annual Los Angeles International Jazz  Festival, Larry Gales, Buster Cooper and Sonny Craver were featured on  Saturday, and Cedar Walton, Charles McPherson, Bill Henderson and the Buddy  Collette Band showcased the final concert Sunday night.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Cao Zhi (2580 2535)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, chairman  of the Central Military Commission, recently signed a decree to  promulgate the "Afforestation Regulations of the Chinese  People's Liberation Army [PLA]." The "Regulations" have  specific provisions on military afforestation undertakings and  management, on the protection and use of forest resources, and  on awards and penalties in related work.    The "Regulations" stipulated that the PLA Afforestation  Committee leads all military afforestation work. Afforestation  committees (leading afforestation groups) at and above  regimental level will lead afforestation work in their own units  or systems. The basic tasks in military afforestation work are  to plant trees, plants, and flowers on military land and in  surrounding garrison areas; to afforest uninhabited hills,  wasteland, and barren beaches in an effort to turn military  camps and bases into parks; and to protect, develop, and use  forest resources so as to serve army building and the national  economic construction. The military afforestation drive aims at  integrating military, ecological, social, and economic benefits.  The "Regulations" imposed new afforestation requirements on  military camps and bases: Military units garrisoned in urban  areas must afforest an area no less than 25 percent of the total  area of their military camps or bases; military units garrisoned  in suburban and rural areas must afforest an area no less than  30 percent of the total area of their military camps or bases.  The "Regulations" stipulated that the survival rate of military  afforestation undertakings should be 5 percent higher than that  of local afforestation endeavors.    At an interview with the correspondent, a person in charge  of  the PLA Afforestation Committee pointed out: The "Regulations"  were formulated in accordance with the "Forest Law of the  People's Republic of China" and the National People's Congress  Standing Committee's "Decision on Nationwide Compulsory  Tree-Planting Campaign," and after we summarized experiences of  the army's afforestation work for more than 10 years. The  "Regulations" are an integral procedure for governing the army  according to law. The formulation and implementation of the  "Regulations" indicate the Chinese Army's afforestation work is  governed by the legal system and will definitely further enhance  healthy progress in such work.</p>

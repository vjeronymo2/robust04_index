			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: US carrier lifts domestic fares AMERICAN Airlines, the US carrier, said it will restore domestic fare levels to its original 'value plan' pricing levels which were set on April 9 and add another 4.4 per cent on to that figure to compensate for rising fuel costs, Reuter reports from Dallas. The new prices effective on all tickets, begin on July 7. But American will not match 10 per cent fare rises announced by Northwest Airlines and other carriers last week. ***** INVESTORS yesterday paid nearly HKDollars 30bn (USDollars 3.8bn) in their rush to buy a slice of Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, a Taiwanese-controlled manufacturer of sports shoes in southern China, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The Yue Yuen issue was for 550m shares of HKDollars 1.18 to raise HKDollars 649m. The company's advisers, Standard Chartered Asia, said the issue, for 25 per cent of the company, was 45.39 times oversubscribed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rafael Caldera today issued two decrees --  which were subsequently approved by the Council of Ministers --  to suspend the value-added tax [VAT] for consumers throughout  the country. Central Information Office Director Guillermo  Alvarez Bajares publicly announced that the presidential decree  issued on 27 December 1993 was repealed, while Decree 51  temporarily suspends the economic guarantees established in  Article 96 of the national Constitution.    [Begin recording] [Alvarez, in progress]...Chapter 5 of the  economic rights section. Everyone may freely dedicate himself  to the lucrative activity of his choice without any limitations  other than those established in this Constitution and by the law  for reasons of security, health, or social interest. The law  will dictate norms to prevent profiteering, improper price  increases, and generally abusive actions intended to obstruct or  restrict economic freedoms. Obviously the previous  administration could not enforce the application of the VAT, or  at least with any practical consequences, because the  appropriate mechanisms for proper oversight or application did  not exist. Store owners who did not charge the VAT in the past  few days because of the measures that had been announced, even  though they were not in effect, will not be subject to any  penalties.    [Unidentified reporter] Those who did not charge the tax  will  not be [words indistinct]?    [Alvarez] No, that will not go into effect. Store owners who  did not charge customers the VAT will not be subject to  sanctions.    [Reporter] What about those who charged the tax until 18  January?    [Alvarez] Those who charged the tax until the date announced  will have to proceed according to the regulations on the matter.  [end recording]</p>

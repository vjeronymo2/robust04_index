			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> COULD SEEK 2ND TERM -- WALDHEIM  </P> <P> President Kurt Waldheim today dismissed suggestions that Austria has suffered  international isolation during his presidency and said he does not rule out  running for a second term.  </P> <P> "I have made more trips in 2 1/2 years than my predecessor," Waldheim said in  an interview with Austrian radio during a visit to the Persian Gulf and Cyprus.  </P> <P> Waldheim, elected in 1986, has been shunned by other Western leaders because of  controversy over his wartime service with Hitler's army. Asked whether he  thinks he will eventually be invited to visit Western countries, Waldheim said:  "That will come. . . . I am in the middle of my term. I have 3 1/2 years to  serve and I can still make many such trips."  </P></p>

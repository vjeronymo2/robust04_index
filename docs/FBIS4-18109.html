That could explain why the UN Iraq  Sanctions Commission noticed inconsistencies in the export  application from a German company. Other circles maintain that  the owner of the firm "Ary Design Jewelry" is a certain Ariel  Schweininger, who has frequently attended international  conferences on the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and  chemical weapons, including ones in Stockholm. Schweininger, who  uses only the Christian names Axel and Andreas in Germany, could  not be reached on Tuesday [29 March]. Apparently -- it is  rumored in New York -- a Middle Eastern intelligence service has  lodged applications with the Iraq Sanctions Commission on  several occasions, some of which have been approved. Now, the  people in New York have become "suspicious."    According to information from the German authorities, the  Mannheim company's application for the export deal with Iraq is  being checked with "great skepticism." On Tuesday, a spokesman  for the Federal Export Agency in Eschborn said the authorities  had submitted certain questions to the owner of the company but  these had not been answered as yet. The Federal Office of  Foodstuffs and the Federal Office for the Agricultural Market  also reported that the business was "very dubious." The  Mannheim state prosecutors office has launched a preliminary  investigation in connection with the affair. The Foreign  Ministry denied that there had been omissions in its handling of  the export application from the Mannheim firm "United Oil  Company" as this newspaper reported on Tuesday.

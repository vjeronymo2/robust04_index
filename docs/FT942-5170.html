			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: Litigation costs accountants Dollars 1.1bn Litigation last year cost the big US accounting firms over Dollars 1bn for the first time, according to figures published by the six biggest firms. The amount, just short of Dollars 1.1bn, compares with Dollars 783m the year before and is made up of judgments, out-of-court settlements and legal defence costs, writes Richard Waters. Publication of the figures, for which no detailed breakdown was given, is part a campaign by accountants in the US for legislative reform to limit their exposure to malpractice suits. Most of the increased costs last year were met by insurance. Payments from insurance companies (after deducting premiums) came to Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 185m in 1992 and only Dollars 8m in 1991. After insurance recoveries, litigation costs amounted to 12 per cent of their accounting and audit fees, according to the firms - Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse.</p>

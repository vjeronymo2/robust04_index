			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Swedish krona stumbles Fears of a weak minority government following elections on September 18 yesterday undermined the Swedish krona, writes Philip Gawith. Opinion polls showed that the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) might fail to win an outright majority, lessening the prospects of a 'yes' vote in the November referendum to join the European Union. A poll in Finland, which votes in October on EU membership, also showed a move towards an anti-EU vote. Both currencies weakened as a result. Traders said there was evidence of small-scale intervention from the Finnish central bank to support the currency. The Swedish krona finished in London at SKr4.94, from SKr4.905 on Friday, against the D-Mark. Market activity was generally very subdued with US markets closed for the Labor Day holiday. The dollar showed no sign of recovering from Friday's three-pfennig fall, trading in a very narrow range to end at DM1.5537 from DM1.5602. Against the yen it finished at Y99.25 from Y99.395. The counterpart of a weaker dollar was generalised D-Mark strength. It closed at L1,011 against the Italian lira from L1,009. Sterling also had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index ending at 78.9 from 78.8. Swedish markets were disturbed by two opinion polls which showed the Green and the Left parties making progress at the SPD's expense ahead of the election. Financial markets are concerned at whether a new government will be able to cut the mushrooming debt/GDP ratio, estimated by Citibank to be 93 per cent of GDP. The krona recently stabilised when the SDP released details of a proposed SKr61bn austerity package, but its ability to implement these measures would be hampered if it lacked an outright majority. Traders are predicting that currency volatility is likely to continue until the election and the EU referendum, on November 16, are out of the way. Markets will be keeping an eye on the meeting today of the EU monetary committee, and a meeting later in the week of EU finance ministers, where the problem of countries with high deficits will be discussed. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, commented: 'The meetings have refocused the market towards those currencies that are weakened on the public finance front.' The tendency, he said, has been towards selling the currencies of countries which combined high fiscal deficits with forthcoming elections (Sweden) or political instability (Italy). The outlook for sterling is, for different reasons, also affected by EU issues. With controversy having sprung up again about the possibility of a multi-speed Europe, traders are focusing on a keynote speech that UK Prime Minister John Major will be giving later this week in the Netherlands. Mr Hawkins said the market wanted to hear Mr Major affirm that the UK belonged at the core of Europe. He added that sterling would come under pressure if the prime minister were seen accepting second division status for the currency. Also important for sterling will be the monthly monetary meeting tomorrow between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England. Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said expectations of a change in policy were low following good inflation data, a fall in house prices and weak car sales recently. If rates were to rise, this would be a surprise to the market, which would probably lend support to the pound. If policy stayed on hold, added Mr Austin, sterling's fate would be likely to remain in the hands of the dollar. The general expectation is that today's quarterly tankan survey of business conditions by the Bank of Japan will show that the Japanese economy is in the early stages of recovery. What this will mean for the yen is less clear. Some analysts argue that a recovering economy will suck in more imports and curb the trade and current account surpluses, causing the yen to weaken. Others warn that the trade surplus is unlikely to decrease before the end of the year, partly because of stronger than expected exports and firm overseas demand. Further, economists at New Japan Securities in London argue that the combination of stimulatory fiscal policy and high real interest rates is the classic recipe for keeping a currency overvalued. They predict the yen at Y97.50 against the dollar at the end of the year. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 75m late assistance. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 110m liquidity, at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 400m shortage. In Germany, call money rates rose to 4.90/5 per cent from 4.85/4.95 per cent. With the repo rate fixed at 4.85 per cent for a further two weeks, after six weeks at this level already, traders said they were scaling back their expectations of when a rate cut could be expected.</p>

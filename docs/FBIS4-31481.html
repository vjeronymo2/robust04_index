			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- Greeting a visiting delegation of  the Albanian People's Assembly, President Lech Walesa on  Thursday praised its President Pjeter Arbnori for his  contribution to the building of democracy. "Politicians engaged  in the process of building democracy and market economy pay  great price and cannot expect society to be grateful for this.  What is important is the aim, not personal successes," the  president said. The Albanian delegation has been visiting Poland  at the invitation of the Sejm.    During the meeting with Lech Walesa, President of the  Albanian People's Assembly Pjeter Arbnori thanked for support  offered to Albania by the Polish delegation in the Council of  Europe. He recalled that Poland has always had its own opinion  at the crucial moments of history, and owing to that it became  an example for Albania and other states on the road to reforms.  On Wednesday, the Albanian MPs met with the parliamentary floor  group of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and representatives  of Sejm committees.</p>

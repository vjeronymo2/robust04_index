			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: SA engineer edges ahead Contracts related to three large capital projects and exports to China helped Murray &amp; Roberts (M&amp;R), the South African engineering and construction group, offset difficult local trading conditions in the half-year to December 1993. Pre-tax profit edged forward to R180m (Dollars 51m) from R178m in 1992. Sales climbed 13 per cent to R3.7bn, as the group's engineering and materials divisions picked up work on the Alusaf smelter expansion, Columbus Stainless Steel expansion and Nawakwa Sands projects. Mr Andre van der Colff, chief executive, said M&amp;R would reap the full benefit of its involvement in the projects by the year-end. He said the group continued to export successfully, supplying engine blocks to Volkswagen South Africa for a R900m order from China, valves for a Hong Kong/China water pipeline, and seatbelts for a US motor manufacturer. M&amp;R's exposure to reconstruction spending has made its shares popular among foreign investors buying South African equities. The shares closed unchanged at R84.75 yesterday, near their R86 high 10 days ago. Income before interest and depreciation charges rose to R377m from R340m, before higher interest payments of R60m against R43m. A lower tax bill flattered after-tax income, but distributable profit slid to R107m from R111m. Earnings fell 3 per cent to 171 cents from 177 cents a share. Mr van der Colff said despite falling operating margins, tight cost controls were improving the group's cash generation - operating cash flow per share rose to 363 cents from 255 cents - which lay behind the decision to increase the interim dividend by 2 cents to 58 cents. It would be an 'exceptional' achievement, given South Africa's unsettled political and economic climate, for the group to claw back the earnings decline by the year-end.</p>

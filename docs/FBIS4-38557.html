			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 31, BNS -- The Latvian Foreign Ministry  is closely studying the issue how to regulate the  Latvian-Chinese- Taiwanese relations, State Secretary Maris  Riekstins told reporters.    The People's Republic of China diplomats were present at the  opening ceremony of the new premises of the Latvian Mission to  the United Nations and the meeting of President Guntis Ulmanis  with U.N. Security Council officials.    The fact is remarkable because Chinese diplomats last  contacted the Baltic country late in 1992 before the Latvian  Government established official relations with the Republic of  China on Taiwan.    Riekstins explained the presence of Chinese diplomats with  their awareness of Latvian intentions to improve relations with  mainland China.    During Ulmanis' trip to the United States, the U.S.  Government approved the most favored nation status in trade with  China. "Even a power like the United States cannot disregard  this country with 1 billion residents and a huge market,"  Riekstins said.    On the one hand, Latvia is interested to forge economic ties  with Taiwan. On the other hand, Latvia has "no serious  relations" with China, Riekstins noted.    Ulmanis underscored that Latvia should seek to form  diplomatic relations with China, simultaneously looking for a  correct settlement of the Latvian-Taiwanese relationship.    When asked whether China is setting conditions for the  improvement of relations with Latvia, Riekstins said that the  Chinsese position stems from the Latvian-Chinese 1992 agreement.  According to this document, Latvia makes a commitment to avoid  establishing official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.    Simultaneously, China is aware that Latvia cannot afford  sharp curves in the sphere of international relations, Riekstins  added.    Ulmanis claims that the issue of Latvia's relations with  China is also "an issue of the Latvian prestige" and Latvia  should avoid sharp fluctuations in relations with foreign  countries.    Latvia established diplomatic relations with China in  September, 1991. In January, 1992, Latvia agreed with Taiwan on  the exchange of General Consulates after what China withdrew its  embassy from Latvia though retaining official diplomatic  relations.    China, with 1.2 billion population, regards Taiwan, with 21  million residents, as a renegade island province ruled by the  rival Nationalist government, which fled the mainland in 1949  after losing a civil war, according to The Associated Press.    Taipei and Beijing both claim to be the sole legitimate  ruler  of all China. A growing rapprochement between the rival sides,  however, is observed on the trade, cultural and private levels,  AP said.</p>

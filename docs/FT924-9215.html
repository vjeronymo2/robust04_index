			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Union reform bill will abolish wages councils WAGES COUNCILS, which set minimum pay rates for 2.5m low-paid workers, will be abolished under a bill published by the government yesterday. Women in industries such as catering and retailing will be most affected by the measure. The bill will also impose further curbs on trade unions which will have to give employers seven days' notice of industrial action. Full postal ballots, open to independent scrutiny, will be required. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, claimed the bill would strengthen the employment rights of individuals and increase the competitiveness of the economy by removing obstacles to the creation of jobs. Employers were split over the bill. The Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry welcomed it, while the Institute of Management criticised the government over the 'insensitive timing of the new bill' which will go before parliament on November 16. Mr Roger Young, director general of the IoM, said: 'In the middle of a recession the government surely have higher priorities than abolition of wages councils and new union curbs.' The Trades Union Congress said the government was 'putting the boot' in to the nation's poorest workers by abolishing the councils which were set up by Winston Churchill in 1909. The TUC is seeking legal advice and threatening to take the government to court for an alleged breach of European law, claiming the abolition of councils will discriminate against women who make up the majority of workers covered. Mr Garfield Davies, leader of the Usdaw shopworkers union, many members of which have their wages set by the councils, said the government would harm the economy by forcing down the wages of people already on the poverty line. Publication and first reading of the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill surprised trade unions. Mrs Shephard said last week that the bill, expected to be brought forward this autumn, was being postponed on technical grounds until later in the year. The bill has now been squeezed into the parliamentary timetable. The legislation, on which Tory MPs are united, could be a morale booster to a party divided on other issues. In addition the government may feel it wants to be sure of the new powers relating to strikes and public services before the full impact is felt of any pay squeeze in the public sector. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman, said: 'This will be good for unscrupulous employers, but bad for everyone else. To make up for wages which will now be cut, money will have to be paid back in benefits.' Analysis, Page 15 Editorial Comment, Page 22</p>

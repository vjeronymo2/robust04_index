			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Howard Davies to be CBI chief THE Confederation of British Industry is expected to announce next week the appointment of Mr Howard Davies, controller of the Audit Commission, as its new director-general. He will replace Sir John Banham, who also was controller of the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, before becoming director-general of the CBI in 1987. The CBI said there had been 'a great deal of speculation' about the post, which had attracted more than 100 applicants. It added that an announcement was expected on election day, when the organisation's ruling council meets. The choice of a CBI director-general is the responsibility of Sir Brian Corby, the organisation's retiring president. He is to be replaced by Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Unilever. Mr Davies has apparently been chosen because of his political contacts and organisational experience. He spent a period at the Treasury while on secondment from McKinsey, the management consultants, as an advisor to Mr Nigel Lawson when he was chancellor. He was appointed controller of the Audit Commission after Sir John's departure. Observer, Page 18</p>

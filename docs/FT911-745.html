			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Arsenic and Old Lace - Chichester Festival Theatre It is the elderberry wine that is deceptive. I had forgotten what a good play Arsenic and Old Lace is. Indeed it is rather a long time since we've seen a well-made play with two intervals, a beginning, a middle and an end, and with so many good parts. It also seems astonishing now that this play is American. The US must have been a much simpler place when it was written: whites murder whites; there is not a trace nor a mention of blacks or hispanics. If I hadn't known better, I'd put a lot of it down to Harrogate and Agatha Christie. Yet Arsenic and Old Lace is as American as they come. One of the characters thinks that he is President Roosevelt: Theodore, that is. The piece is strewn with political references, some of them by now a little obscure, but by no means getting in the way. The Panama Canal is being built in the cellar of a Brooklyn house. Yellow fever abounds - at least in the imagination. Between the cast there is a minimum of 25 killings. Somehow, however, Joseph Kesselring's play makes murder inoffensive. Although it may run in the family, some people commit it in a more civilised way than others. The old ladies do it with elderberry wine laced with arsenic: their nephew, Jonathan, lacks the advantage of having been fully house-trained. He murders all over the place: South Africa, Australia, South Bend, Indiana and even London. His aunts, played by Elizabeth Spriggs and Rosemary Harris, have the better of him, probably by one body. One of the sheer delights of the play is the sustained use of dramatic irony; almost every other line excels in it. It also comes in the form of the double-take; for example, when a man looks behind him and sees (say) Boris Karloff, at first his mind doesn't click. Then, as you see the thought processes working, it does. Annie Castledine's direction carries double-takes into triple, possibly quadruple, and does it to perfection. The first body under the window seat in the drawing room is subsequently replaced by another. It is a question of who knows what, and when. There are lots of incidental jokes. Insanity does not just run in the Brewster family; 'it gallops'. Mortimer, the nephew who turns out not to be a Brewster after all, is the theatre critic for a New York newspaper. He preferred writing about real estate for the financial pages. The friendly neighbourhood cop is writing a play of his own about 'the things you wouldn't believe go on in Brooklyn'. Two performances stand out: Bernard Bresslaw as the Boris Karloff look-alike, Jonathan, who on Wednesday was cheered off the stage, and Peter Davison as Mortimer who seems to have dramatic irony running in his blood. The whole performance is terrific.</p>

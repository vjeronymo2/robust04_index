			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currencies call the tune for equities CONCERN over sterling unsettled UK equities again yesterday, restraining the beneficial effects of another strong recovery in the Japanese equity market. An early gain of 17 points on the FT-SE scale was cut back rapidly towards the close as heavy central bank support for the dollar left the pound slipping lower against the German currency. The London stock market closed last night just before the final onslaught on the US dollar, leaving equity traders to watch in nervous silence as the latest currency rates marched across the trading screens. The final reading put the Footsie at 2,365.7 for a gain on the day of 6.3. Yesterday marked the close of the two-week equity trading account which has seen the Index gain 15.6 points, or 0.7 per cent in volatile trading. On the bullish side of the balance, the London market was relieved to see the German Lombard rate left unchanged by the Bundesbank on Thursday. But the outlook for UK interest rates has been challenged by the pound's weakness in the ERM range, while stock market confidence has been dented as poor corporate reports have revived dividend worries. Share prices opened higher in London after a rise of 949.12, the third successive daily advance, took the Nikkei Average above the important 16,000 benchmark again. Also helpful at first was the pound, which opened up against the D-Mark. Once again, trading volume increased yesterday as share prices struggled to hold on to their early gains. The day's Seaq volume of 436.9m shares compared with 425.9m in the previous session. However, Thursday's retail business was worth only Pounds 822.7m, still on the low side for the UK stock market. Although investors remained very cautious, there was demand for utilities, and similar defensive stocks. Sterling's initial improvement relaxed interest rates worries a little and store and consumer shares rallied. The market peaked early at 2,376.3, however, and became nervous when sterling eased later in the session. Equities came off the top and the dollar intervention steadied nerves only briefly before share prices crumbled again. The final half hour of business saw share prices slipping away in a nervous stock market. Traders said that Monday's opening is likely to reflect the fortunes of the pound in New York and the Far Eastern markets. Retail turnover has remained well below profitable levels, and mostly below the comparative daily totals for last year.</p>

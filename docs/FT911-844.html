			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Trafalgar interim falls to Pounds 51.5m TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the construction, property, shipping and hotels conglomerate, yesterday reported a slump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 116.9m to Pounds 51.5m for the six months to March. The fall would have been worse without a 40 per cent rise in construction and engineering profits to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 27.4m) thanks to a strong order book of Pounds 2.9bn. Taxation rose from 27 per cent last year to 33 per cent because the group is not making sufficient UK profits to offset against its advanced corporation tax (ACT). Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, said: 'We are very concerned with the level of our tax. It is very difficult in a recession as tough as this to retain UK profits. However, we are looking at ways of mitigating ACT.' Sir Eric said the group was looking at three possible solutions: skipping the dividend payment, issuing convertible loan stock or acquiring UK businesses. The convertible loan stock is understood to be the most desirable. Interest paid on the stock would be tax deductible. Shareholders would not want the group to pass the dividend, and any acquisitions through an increase of debt could affect gearing, already at 54 per cent. Borrowings for the end of March stood at Pounds 450m compared with Pounds 830m of shareholders' funds. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 1.6bn and earnings per share before extraordinary items more than halved from 16.9p to 6.7p. The interim dividend has been maintained at 8.8p. The group has had to reduce costs and overheads which has led to the loss of 500 jobs from its 18,000-strong UK workforce and 250 out of the 10,000 employeed overseas. Sir Eric said the second half would be tough. 'We need further cuts in interest rates before things are going to get a lot better.' The recession hit Trafalgar's property and investment division which suffered a 55 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 127.4m (Pounds 224.6m). The commercial and residential markets in the US remain slow, although Sir Eric said there were some signs that the UK market was improving. In a significant change of policy, certain development properties for sale, worth around Pounds 200m, are to be reclassified as fixed assets which will be revalued in September. The shipping and hotels division was badly affected by the Gulf war. Group hotels were only half full and profits fell from Pounds 337.6m to Pounds 290.6m. Business from the shipping sector, valued in sterling, will now be calculated in dollars, allowing the group to increase its borrowings in the US and reduce them in the UK. The share price rose 6p to 268p. Lex, Page 20</p>

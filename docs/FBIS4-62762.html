			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Avdeyev report: "Terrible Mushroom Grows in </F> Maritime Kray Taiga"]    [Text] The devil is evidently laying his hands on military  arsenals: Ammunition dumps of the Red-Banner Pacific Fleet have  blown up once again. The memorable Vladivostok explosion of two  years ago now looks like child's play -- on Saturday 14 May the  major arsenal of the fleet's air force thundered forth in  Maritime Kray. This was the equivalent of the blast from a  five-kilotonne atom bomb.    The mushroom that grew near the village of Novonezhino was  very similar to the familiar silhouette in textbooks on nuclear  security -- the height of a substantial hill, black and crimson,  it terrified the local inhabitants. It was a sunny day, and  people were digging in truck gardens. The shock wave bowled  them all over. They got up and ran to the houses. A second,  mightier blast caught them 40 seconds later. After the third  one they could enter the houses from any side: They had neither  windows nor doors, indeed some people had no walls left either.    Panic set in. For some reason mothers began pushing their  children under the beds. Grandmothers shouted "It's war!" and  started praying. Cats went crazy, dogs howled. A sickening,  acrid smell of burning hung in the air....    There were not, however, any nuclear or chemical charges in  this arsenal. Aerial bombs, missiles, and shells, brought here  from the Baltic region, were exploding. The dumps were very  well guarded, and the military took pride in them. The arsenal  was also located well from the safety viewpoint: The villages  were quite a long way off and were protected by hills. This  saved the inhabitants. So far there has not been a single  casualty. The fire was extinguished by the next morning.  Sappers, militia, and counterintelligence officers are working  there now.  <H5>  From KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's File </H5>   Free-flight rocket -- based on tanks, aircraft, and ships.  Range -- 10-15 km. Explodes on impact by self-detonation.    Antitank guided missile -- based on aircraft, ships, and  infantry fighting vehicles. Equipped with self-destruct device.  Self-detonated, could hit chance target, i.e. function in line  with combat launch. Range -- 20-25 km.    The evacuation of people was organized professionally. The  military, the authorities, and the militia secured a lot of  buses amazingly promptly and evacuated five villages:  Smolyaninovo, Romanovka, Novonezhino, and two small  farmstead-railroad halts. All the locals had long known from the  military that if THAT blew up, everything would be destroyed for  30 km around. So they evacuated people beyond the 30km zone --  to Shkotovo and Bolshoy Kamen.    Fortunately it was not the entire arsenal that blew up. But  even what did was enough to cause a minor earthquake. Windows  were broken even in buildings in Vladivostok and in blocks at  the "Okean" children's camp, which are a good 50 km away as the  crow flies. There is scarcely a single building in the villages  that did not suffer.    A Vladivostok-Partizansk electric train was approaching the  "Kilometer 53" halt at the moment of the first explosion. When  the engineer caught sight of the mushroom from the explosion, he  stopped braking and took the train through the falling debris to  the next station. A couple of minutes later the railroad was at  a standstill -- the contact wires had been broken, and debris  and blocks were falling right onto the permanent way.    "Not many people in the village were injured," Divisional  Militia Captain Viktor Bityuk said. "Some were hit by bricks  from a falling chimney, some were cut by broken glass, and some  did not open their mouths or put their hands over their ears in  time and now cannot hear."    On that day Viktor himself had only just finished his shift  and was getting ready for bed. Now it is 48 hours since he  slept. He was leading people out of their yards, and they were  stopping vehicles on the road until the buses arrived....    "Imagine, there was not a single instance of a private  driver's refusing to take people in his vehicle further away  from the blast," he said in surprise. "On the contrary, there  were volunteers who offered their help and first-aid kits. They  released the sailors locked up in the garrison guardhouse and  made them help me. I set them to guarding stores and the  savings bank. Believe me, there was not a single robbery!"    Just one case of looting has been recorded so far. Fish  protection inspector Vladimir Snurnik was leading people from a  danger zone by the river while his own village of Romanovka was  being evacuated. He found himself nearby and called at his  home. Everything there had been turned upside down, and the safe  had been opened. They had evidently been looking for his  pistol, which he had with him at the time.    Weapons, incidentally, have always drawn thieves and bandits  of various kinds to the arsenal. The small arms of all the  nearby military units were kept there. Last year a major  robbery occurred, for which a unit commander and six of his  accomplices were arrested. The investigation also links the  present disaster to the problem of weapons thefts.    Almost everyone is certain that this was no chance ignition.  There are eyewitnesses who say that the first fire broke out  right in the middle of one of the dumps. Rockets at once flew  in various directions and started a fire right around the  perimeter of the huge arsenal.    Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy commander in chief of  the Navy, who has arrived in Maritime Kray with a group of  experts, is still very cautious in his assessments of the cause  of what happened. He has said just one thing unequivocally:  The destruction is colossal, such as I have never seen before  in my life.    ...A friend and I were once collecting ferns in these  places.  There were so many of them on the slopes of the hills that we  could pick them without straightening up. These hills that are  turning green are now strewn equally thickly with unexploded  shells and debris. I walked with Anatoliy Panteleyevich  Shevchenko, head of Smolyaninovo Administration, through the  streets of the deserted settlement. There was still  intermittent rumbling, and he showed me which hill had taken the  most terrible blow and which one had saved 100-year-old  Romanovka, which has lived through two wars and now, so it turns  out, also a third one.    "Where can I find that much window glass now?" the head  grieved, looking at the gaping windows.    Yes, we will all need a lot more window glass. This Pacific  Fleet arsenal is not the last one....</p>

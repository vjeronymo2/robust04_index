			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): Strategy rules WRITERS ON STRATEGY AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT By J. I. Moore Penguin Pounds 7.99. 311 pages EXECUTIVES AND management consultants, as well as business students, have for 30 years made use of a Penguin reference paperback called Writers on Organisations. Updated several times since publication in 1964, it summarises the teaching of four dozen leading international writers, from Frederick Taylor and Max Weber to Tom Peters, Robert Waterman and Rosabeth Moss Kanter. Penguin has now produced a companion paperback on the associated subject of strategy and strategic management. This is a newer field, so the book's list of big names is shorter than its companion, even if the volume is longer - allowing the typeface to be larger (a welcome relief) and enabling over a dozen pages to be allotted to each of several strategy 'greats'. These include Igor Ansoff, Harvard's Michael Porter, and Canada's Henry Mintzberg. Significantly, Mintzberg also rates a decent entry in the Organisations volume. Indeed, part of his strategy entry is about organisational issues - an indication of the extent to which the two subjects have become more integrated since Mintzberg and others realised that the relationship between strategy and structure is not linear in either direction - as previous academics had argued with great authority, and ad nauseam - but is constantly iterative. The new volume is notable for the attention it pays to such influential academics as Richard Rumelt, James Brian Quinn, and Charles Lindblom, names known by far too few 'educated' European managers. But it does have important omissions. Though it includes some of the many contributions made to strategic analysis and management by McKinsey &amp; Co, the consultancy, there is no mention of Ken-ichi Ohmae, whose pathfinding work on global and 'Triad' strategy has helped companies worldwide understand the forces shaping modern international business, and how to react to them. Another curious omission is the two-man team of CK Prahalad and Gary Hamel, of Michigan University and London Business School respectively, who since the late 1980s have had an impact on US and European executives which comes close to that of Michael Porter. On those writers who are included, some readers may be frustrated at the shortage of critical analysis. But then, as with the Organisations book, the purpose of the new one is to summarise the most important work of the leading writers. With a few exceptions - such as a jibe at Ansoff, and at Porter's controversial insistence that his 'generic strategies' are mutually exclusive - readers must deploy their own judgment.</p>

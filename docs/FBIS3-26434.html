Provincial party Secretary Pu Chaozhu spoke at  the meeting. He pointed out that since the Second Plenary  Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the  provincial party committee and government have unremittingly  persisted in doing two types of work simultaneously and have  conscientiously carried out the three anticorruption tasks set  by the party Central Committee and the State Council.  Procuratorial and judicial institutions at all levels have  closely coordinated with each other in cracking major and  important cases. [passage omitted]    The provincial government has held an executive meeting to  encourage all functional departments to severely curb the  arbitrary collection of charges and imposition of fines. The  general situation in anticorruption work is good and its  development is healthy.    Pu Chaozhu stressed: We should understand that the fight  against corruption is a protracted and difficult task running  through the entire process of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. We should not overestimate the achievements in  the current fight against corruption or remain contented with  the initial results in this fight. Instead, we should carry out  this combat unswervingly. [passage omitted]    All levels of party committees, discipline inspection  departments, supervisory departments, procuratorial departments,  and courts should have a clear idea of their responsibilities,  organize their personnel, and take measures to fulfill the three  tasks. The current anticorruption work should focus on solving  major and important cases and on curbing malpractices. The  circular on strictly prohibiting the use of public money for  extravagant eating and drinking must be put into effect.    He Zhanjun, chief procurator of the provincial people's  procuratorate, briefed the meeting on the results since the  beginning of last year in examining some corruption and bribery  cases throughout the province. He said: Last year  procuratorial institutions throughout the province put 1,348  corruption and bribery cases on file for investigation; of  these, 749 were major and important cases, 55.6 percent of the  total cases put on file; and 1,285 cases had been examined.  [passage omitted]    Qiu Chuangjiao, president of the provincial higher people's  court, reported to the meeting on the relevant situation. He  said: Since the beginning of last year, people's courts at all  levels in the province have examined 1,078 economic crimes of  all kinds, including corruption, bribery, speculation,  smuggling, deception, and tax evasion cases. They have  sentenced 1,080 economic criminals.    The meeting was presided over by provincial party Deputy  Secretary Ling Huan. Provincial party and government leaders He  Zhiqiang, Liang Jinquan, Yin Jun, Liu Shusheng, Zhao Shumin, and  Lang Dazhong attended the meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

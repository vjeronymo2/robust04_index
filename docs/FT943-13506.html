			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Rohm &amp; Haas expects big earnings rise Rohm &amp; Haas, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported that its 1994 results will be substantially above 1993 earnings and may exceed the company's record 1988 performance of Dollars 230m, Reuter reports from Philadelphia. However, currency changes and the current upward trend in raw material costs could influence the third-quarter results. Rohm &amp; Haas said that price increases in key feedstocks, including ammonia, methanol, acetone and styrene, would hit its third-quarter costs and force it to raise prices for certain product lines. The company reported earnings for the second quarter of Dollars 93m, or Dollars 1.37 per common share, up from Dollars 61m, or Dollars 0.90 per share in the second quarter of 1993. 'Earnings are up - that's good news,' said Mr J. Lawrence Wilson, the company's chairman and chief executive. 'But they still are below the levels we feel we need to achieve to do well in an industry where competition is becoming more and more fierce.' He added that his company would have to do more to control internal costs.</p>

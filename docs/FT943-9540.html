			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Jitters over kiwi dollar The US dollar yesterday traded in a narrow range as markets waited to assess the success of the quarterly Treasury refunding programme, writes Philip Gawith. For much of 1994 the dollar and US bond markets have moved in tandem and an unsuccessful auction could put downward pressure on the US currency. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5820, from DM1.5811 on Monday. Against the yen it finished at Y101.2 from Y101.345. It ended New York trading at DM1.5817 and Y101.295. Volumes were generally low, with markets stuck in a lacklustre summer rut. Most of the excitement was generated by the New Zealand dollar, which weakened on fears of a possible government defeat in the weekend Selwyn by-election; and by a lower Italian lira, which again broke the L1,000 barrier against the D-Mark. Sterling had a steady day, with the market ignoring May trade figures that were in line with market forecasts. The pound closed at DM2.4349 from DM2.4380. In Europe the D-Mark was generally firmer, finishing higher, inter alia, against the French franc, lira and Danish krona. The New Zealand economy has been one of the better recent success stories in the Anglo Saxon world, combining high growth with negligible inflation. Swiss Bank Corporation estimates 1994 inflation will average 1.4 per cent, with growth of about 4 per cent. Other plus factors are a strong fiscal position, with an anticipated surplus being used to pay off external debt, and an independent central bank whose policy transparency is appreciated by markets. These are the factors that lie behind the recent strength of the 'kiwi' dollar, which has risen by about 7 per cent, from the Dollars 0.56 level in January against the US dollar to around Dollars 0.60 currently. Yesterday, however, the currency suffered a bout of the jitters as a newspaper poll suggested that the National party-led government might lose the weekend by-election that it must win to keep its one seat majority in parliament. The kiwi closed in London at Dollars 0.6007 from Dollars 0.6046. Prime Minister Jim Bolger aggravated matters when he predicted economic disaster if the Alliance party won. He said it raised the spectre of a falling dollar and higher interest rates and inflation. 'Essentially what we have in Selwyn is the most important by-election this country has ever faced,' said Mr Bolger. Analysts said investors who expected the National party to hold the seat should buy the currency, as recent weakness reflected political rather than economic considerations. The Italian lira weakened following the latest evidence of political discord. Traders were unnerved by the row between the office of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Mr Umberto Bossi, his Northern league coalition partner. The row had its roots in controversial television advertisements, criticised by Mr Bossi, in which the government sought to outline its achievements in office to date. The lira finished again on the wrong side of the L1,000 level against the D-Mark, at L1,001 from Monday's L997.9 close. Commentators had predicted that the parliamentary recess would help Italian financial assets by lowering the political temperature. The latest squabble has confounded their predictions. The Bank of Japan stressed that it had not changed its monetary policy stance following a recent run-up in money market rates. Benchmark three-month yen certificates of deposit were issued at 2.3 per cent, the highest rate since mid-March. The Bank said the recent rises reflected strong demand for funds because of end - September corporate book closures, and slight changes in the interest rate outlook. Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London, said the next move in Japanese short-term rates would 'certainly be up, but that move is some way off'. He added that if the recent rise in rates was the result of an economic upturn, this would probably shrink Japan's current account surplus, leading to significant yen weakness. Ahead of the treasury auction, Mr Michael Burke, international economist at Citibank, said the balance of risk for the dollar was on the downside. He said the Treasury had Dollars 40bn of bonds to sell and investors have not much appetite to add to their holdings. Disinflationary forces, such as low and falling oil and commodity prices, appeared to be unwinding and putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. In the UK the futures markets were fairly quiet. The December short sterling contract traded 21,530 lots and finished at 93.44 from 93.40. In the cash markets three-month sterling LIBOR moved slightly to trade at 5 9/16 per cent from 5 5/8 . In its daily operations the Bank of England provided Pounds 474m liquidity, at established rates, to the market after forecasting a Pounds 450m shortage. Overnight rates traded between 3 per cent and 4 3/4 per cent.</p>

An aide to UNPROFOR chief General Jean Cot said the March 7  date, given on Sunday by the UN chief of peacekeeping  operations, Kofi Annan, "only relates to the arrival of the UN  first troops" from the Nordic Battalion at the airport.    A full handover of the airport in northeastern Bosnia to the  UN peacekeepers "is not expected until March 17, and the first  flight on March 18 at the earliest," he said.    "We have not made this timetable public, as it is still not  final," he continued. "There could be further delays for a  number of reasons, for example if we run into difficulties  getting supplies. If that happens, public opinion will be quick  to complain about the lack of political will."    Earlier Tuesday, General Cot told reporters that Annan  "should speak to me before making statements. Give us a bit of  time."    The strategic Tuzla airport, which lies in a Moslem-led  Bosnian enclave, has been closed since May 1992 by Serb  shelling. The Nordic Battalion of 1,000 Swedish and Danish  troops has been working for three months on a plan to reopen the  airport.</p>

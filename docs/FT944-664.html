			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Down Mexico way Food and drinks group Allied Domecq reflected the stock market's nervousness over the Mexican economy and the shares tumbled 8 to 544p. The devaluation of the Mexican peso and fears about the simmering rebellion in Chiapas have cast a further cloud over Allied's acquisition of Pedro Domecq earlier this year. The Mexican market, where it sells brandies such as Presidente and Don Pedro, accounts for about half Domecq's profits. Allied shares, which stood at 612p before disappointing interim figures a month ago, were yesterday on a sub-market rating and one of the highest yields in the sector. There was some support for drinks issues via an encouraging and festive piece of research from US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The pharmaceuticals and drinks specialists have pooled their respective skills and concluded that alcohol is good for you. Couched in the sober terms of city analysts, the team cites the refreshing fact that in Ireland pregnant women and nursing mothers got their Guinness on the national health service until a few years ago. As evidence, it pours in the findings of a 13-year study on 12,300 male UK doctors, among whom modest drinkers were healthier than abstemious colleagues. The research is not encouraging investors to rush for the sherry, but to pick up stocks which might experience 'beneficial effects regarding price/earnings multiples'. Guinness shares were steady at 451p, Greene King up a penny at 528p and GrandMet a penny firmer at 409p. Activity in utilities was subdued, with the market's main focus among the regional electricity groups seemingly shifting north of the border. Scottish Hydro put on 6 to 323p and Scottish Power added 6 at 346p, but turnover in each case was minimal. Northern Electric, which this week received a hostile cash and paper bid from Trafalgar House, retreated a penny to 1006p, with the market - caught up in seasonal festivities - momentarily losing sight of an anticipated white knight and increased offer possibilities. British Gas dipped 2 1/2 to 310 1/2 p in 2.1m tuurnover. Among water stocks, Wessex Water, unchanged at 300p, saw fair volume trading 4.1m shares while Welsh Water improved 5 to 655p. Telecoms shares remained active despite the seasonal pressures clamping trading volume generally. BT and Cable and Wireless notched up 11.9m turnover between them, with the former easing to 382p but C&amp;W advancing a further 4 to 385p as rumours of talks with US telecoms giant AT&amp;T continued to circulate. The odds on a deal with AT&amp;T appeared to shorten yesterday, with C&amp;W shares seemingly shrugging aside the latest round of price cuts by its Mercury subsidiary, which is cutting the price of day-time calls to the US for big corporate customers by 55 per cent in the face of vicious competition. Analysts suspect some sort of link between AT&amp;T and Mercury could be forged early in the new year, with best bets pointing to the US group taking a sizeable minority stake. Bell Canada paid Pounds 480m for 20 per cent of Mercury in 1992, but that was before the present competitive squeeze took hold. TeleWest Communications lost further ground, closing at 172p - 10p below the recent flotation price - with only a handful of sessions before the the issue's stabilisation period ends on December 30. Irish building materials group CRH, which has announced nearly Dollars 33m of US acquisitions in the past two months, jumped 9 to 355p. Among merchants, Wolseley dipped 4 to 780p. Former building society Abbey National improved 2 to 436p as its subsidiary Abbey National Independent Financial Advisers announced an acquisition. It has bought the WF Company, which advises on the establishment and operation of small self-administered pension schemes. Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca eased despite approval of its latest acquisition in the US as drug stocks were sold down following their recent gains. NatWest Securities described the company's acquisition of cancer-care group Salick as 'a superb move vertically to integrate the group's cancer business'. However, the shares fell 10 to 883p on profit taking after reaching a new high earlier in the week. Elsewhere, Glaxo dropped 8 to 673p, Wellcome 4 to 705p and SmithKline Beecham 5 to 466p. Many analysts are looking for a strong performance from the sector in 1995. Analysts said that after three years of lagging badly, it should benefit from rotation from cyclicals and a more upbeat picture for the industry worldwide. The sector has a 1995 p/e ratio of 13 times, broadly matching the market. Mr Mark Brewer, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, argues that it could regain a 10 to 15 per cent premium on the market by the end of next year. Among engineering stocks, FKI hardened to 146p after NatWest Securities put out an add note following recent significant underperformance. The shares, lately hit by programme trades, have lagged behind the market by 12 per cent over the past month. NatWest pinpoints robust profit margins and - in the longer term - the possibility of a 'sizeable' acquisition. Motor trading and bus group Cowie put on 7 to 224p as hopes built for the success of the recent Pounds 33.1m rights issue. Lex Service gained a similar amount to 300p but Inchcape retreated 4 to 435p following a cautious note from NatWest Securities. Among transport shares, National Express added 4 to 291p while Stagecoach closed unchanged at 225p following news of its latest acquisition, the Pounds 4.25m takeover of a Scottish bus company with a fleet of 75 vehicles.</p>

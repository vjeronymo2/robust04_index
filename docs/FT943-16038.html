			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: GDC receives new proposals Group Development Capital Trust has received alternative proposals for its winding-down. In May, the directors announced plans for shareholders to 'realise their investment for a sum approximating to asset value' through a repayment of capital and the sale of certain unquoted investments. New proposals, which could, according to the directors, 'provide a more attractive alternative' include arrangements for holders to dispose of their investment on an adjusted formula asset value basis giving a value in line with the current share price.</p>

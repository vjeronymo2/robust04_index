			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Revenue gears for change - Do-it-yourself tax / The Budget and You The wheels are grinding slowly into action at the Inland Revenue in preparation for the move towards do-it-yourself tax returns. In his Budget speech, Kenneth Clarke confirmed that next year's finance bill will contain much of the legislation needed for the new system. It means that around 9m taxpayers - all those who now receive tax returns, about half of whom are the self-employed - will be able to assess their own tax liabilities or refunds and send the money directly to the Revenue. There will be no obligation to use the new system, though. The Revenue will still receive tax returns and calculate the liability, but will require earlier submission. While self-assessment will not operate fully until after the 1996-97 tax year, some self-employed people will start to be affected from next year. Anyone who creates a business after April 5 1994 will be taxed on a current-year basis, in contrast to the preceding-year basis now in force. Others who are operating businesses already will continue to pay on a preceding-year basis for the next two years, but will then begin to be involved in transitional arrangements. For the 1996-97 year, tax returns will have to be submitted by September 30 1997 if the Revenue is to assess the liability; or by January 31 1998 if the taxpayer decides to calculate it. After the transition year, taxpayers will pay up to half of their estimated tax for the current tax year at the end of each January, and an estimate for the remainder of the year at the end of July. Any adjustments for the final payment will be made in the following January. Those who fail to complete their returns by these dates will be liable to a one-off fine - probably Pounds 100 - as well as interest. Further details of the new scheme will be introduced in the 1995 finance act. Issues still to be determined include the design of the new tax return and the role of employers in the new arrangements.</p>

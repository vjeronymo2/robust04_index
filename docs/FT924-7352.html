			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / France loses ground in battle with EC partners on farm trade FRANCE last night lost a last-minute struggle to gather sufficient support to prevent a farm trade accord between the European Community and the US in talks starting tomorrow in Washington. Amid a welter of contradictory statistics about what agreement would mean for EC food exports, France's partners gave 'a clear benediction' to Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner and chief farm trade negotiator, said Mr David Curry, UK junior agriculture minister. 'His hand is greatly strengthened,' an aide to Mr MacSharry said. The Washington talks are aimed at settling an EC-US row over oilseeds and clearing the way for agreement on the Uruguay Round trade reforms being negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the French farm minister, told his colleagues in a closed meeting that the cuts in subsidised exports and EC output which would result from a Uruguay Round deal, and agreement with the US on the oilseeds dispute, would go beyond the price and production cuts agreed in the reformed Common Agricultural Policy. France produced a paper to substantiate its position, which drew from the same material in an alleged European Commission document leaked to French papers over the weekend. A senior Commission official described the French figures as 'a doomsday scenario with a political spin'. Inside the Council of Ministers, Mr MacSharry dismissed the French analysis as 'rubbish and nonsense, with capital letters'. According to Mr Curry, 'nobody endorsed the French figures'. Ireland and Spain also expressed concern over whether a Gatt deal on farm trade - needed for an overall Uruguay Round agreement - would be compatible with the new CAP. But France's support was less than at last week's foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. France argued that the Commission negotiators were working on the false assumptions that average farm yield would stay flat, and that EC farmers would recapture swathes of their own market in spite of commitments to open up to imports. Furthermore, they insisted, a Gatt deal would require the EC to take significantly more land out of production than the 15 per cent 'set-aside' agreed under CAP. Mr MacSharry argued against the French claims. He pointed out that oilseeds output was sharply down this year and would decrease further next year - including under French projections. He argued that Gatt would reduce only subsidised food exports, but that with the price cuts to world market level agreed under the new CAP, there would be no restraint on unsubsidised exports. Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister, who chaired the meeting, said of the French claims that 'it is fantastic to assume that the commissioner would be negotiating away large areas of Europe to be set aside'. Mr Laurits Toernaes, the Danish farm minister, said of the Washington meeting that a Gatt agreement was 'very close'.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 4 December that the Foreign  Ministry plans to drastically reorganize its structure, so that  a new Diplomatic Intelligence Bureau for the systematic  management of industry and technological intelligence on  advanced nations and a new Science and Environment Bureau is  established.    With a view to enhancing efficiency in personnel management,  the Foreign Ministry also plans to degrade 17 of 47 vice  minister-level special first-class grade officials to a lower  first-class grade, and to readjust its overseas missions.    The Foreign Ministry will readjust the diplomatic  organizational network that was established at random in an era  of confrontational diplomacy between the North and the South.  It will close down some of its missions in Africa, Latin  America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe and augment others  to carry out additional functions.</p>

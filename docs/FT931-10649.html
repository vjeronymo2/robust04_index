			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Motoring: And now the one-box vehicle IF THE developing fashion for multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) is anything to go by, the family car of the future will be box-shaped. It would be sensible. A car with neither bonnet nor boot takes up less road space than a 'three-box' saloon or 'two-box' hatchback or estate. And, logically, there is no reason why the engine should be up front, where the horse used to be before the horseless carriage came along. More than 40 years ago, Volkswagen's Microbus - the first MPV - had the engine tucked away at the back. Renault's Espace, the first MPV to be bought because it was smart as well as practical, has a normal front-wheel drive power pack, but that is inside the body and under the sharply-sloped windscreen. Toyota took the bold step of burying the engine of its rear-wheel driven Previa MPV under the floor. Why not? All routine checks can be made simply by lifting the grille. And no one tinkers with electronically-managed engines any more, if they are wise. The latest MPV to reach Britain is Nissan's Spanish-built Serena. At first sight, I thought it looked like a cross between one of those Italian hearses with chromium-plated cherubs on each corner and a dignified, 1930-ish English limousine. When I swung up into the high seat behind the wheel, it felt decidedly van-like. But the more I drove it, the more I liked it. Building a vehicle as tall as this gives it an enormous amount of interior space. Passengers sit high enough to peer over hedgerows. The driver's view of the road is so commanding that I found the Serena ideal transport in the crowded West End of London. There is hardly any bonnet - the engine is mounted further back than usual - and no rear overhang at all. Combined with very light power-assisted steering, this makes the Serena easier to park than a conventional car of similar size. The top-of-the-range SGX model I used had a British-made, 126-horsepower, 16-valve, two-litre engine driving the back wheels though a pleasant, five-speed gearbox. Fairly low overall gearing made it flexible in town, lively when accelerating up to 60 mph (97 kmh), and good at romping up hills in top or fourth gears, even loaded. It takes time to reach 80 mph (128 kmh) but holds it on an autoroute without sounding frantic. On a windy day - or when overtaking speeding container lorries - you are aware it has higher sides than a car. There are seven Serena variants offering four or five doors (including the huge tailgate); six, seven or eight seats; and 1.6 or two-litre petrol engines plus a two-litre diesel. The one I drove had six separate and plumply comfortable seats, two normal front doors, and a single sliding door on the near side. Having six seats is useful, but only when the rear pair are folded away is there a large amount of luggage space. One of the optional layouts with seven seats (converting to five with a vast boot) would be more useful to a family with three children and a dog who do not want to travel long distances with all the luggage on the roof. Prices range from Pounds 12,950 for the 1.6-litre LX to Pounds 17,750 for the two-litre SGX which comes with ABS brakes, two power-operated sun-roofs and air-conditioning as standard.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Redeeming Vices - Theatre Saki (the pen name of HH Munro) led a retiring, mundane, life before he was shot in the head by a sniper during the Great War. All his venom, wit and quirkiness went into his short stories, many of which are classics. Michael Browning has trawled through the Saki anthologies, picking a character here, a plot line there, and striking aphorisms everywhere, to assemble the play that Saki would never have written. It is set in classic Saki territory, a weekend house party before the War, and populated by Saki regulars, notably Clovis, the clever, cynical, epicene youth whose task is to undermine county gentility. It is much as if PG Wodehouse (a gentler contemporary of Saki) had suddenly gone to the devil. Like Wodehouse, Saki's youth was organised by aunts; and Redeeming Vices involves totally useless young men contriving, with the help of husband-hungry young gels, to break loose from dominating older female relatives. It is the kind of clever, civilised, resolutely middle-class play that perhaps delighted matinee audiences in the 1920s: it is certainly an antidote to contemporary drama. The plot is borrowed from Mansfield Park. The young things get up to the most innocent of mischief while the Gorgonesque Mrs Thunderford (Richenda Carey) is supposedly away: to pay for their over-indulgence in bubbly and trifle they face dismissal from the house next day - before luncheon. Unfortunately Browning, who enthusiastically takes part as the genial Uncle Ludo, does not trust Saki's superb reticence. He makes one of the girls, Joy (Claire Weller), a rampaging nympho and Clovis comes way out of the closet. Still, there is mild fun to be gathered from Saki's Oscaresque witticisms; from the bustle of the amorous pursuits, motivated by money rather than love; from Stephanie Turner's assured performance as a merry widow-to-be whose husband is 'between Folkestone and Heaven'; and in the marriageable Trevor Thunderford's (Tom Wallers) stuttering diffidence. Much depends on the pivotal Clovis. Simon Beresford's imperturbable outrageousness seems restrained by the smallness of the venue, but as he grows in mannered confidence, and the rest of the cast finally remember the stage names of their fellow actors, Redeeming Vices could go with a swing. It provides an unusually effervescent evening. Director Philip Grout manages to move a large cast around deftly and speedily. New End, Hampstead, north London, until June 6. 071 794 0022</p>

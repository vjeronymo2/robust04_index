			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "Belarus is Trying to Keep </F> Russian as a Donor"]    [Text] In the very near future the interstate agreement on  unifying the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus will be  presented for signing. Government heads Viktor Chernomyrdin and  Vyacheslav Kebich stated on 5 January that "the necessary  preparatory work...has been practically completed," and  certified the "achievement of a high degree of readiness of the  monetary systems" for unification. Both passages in the  statement do not seem obvious. Even with all its difficulties,  the stability of Russian finances is significantly higher than  that of its "Slavic brother." The negative balance in Belarus'  trade has reached more than 100 billion rubles [R], its rate of  inflation is 20-25 percent higher than Russia's and the exchange  rate of the surrogate "zaychik" to the ruble is 4.5:1. At the  same time, the level of wages and pensions of our neighbor  exceeds that of Russia by three times.    The motives which are compelling the Belrusian leadership to  force monetary integration are extremely transparent. First of  all, union, judging by the words of the Belarusian Central Bank  chairman Mr. Bogdankevich, is thought of according to the  artificial exchange rate of 1:1, thus Russia is supposed to  allocate approximately R1.6 trillion to maintain currency  circulation. Secondly, the need for our neighbor to pay for  energy sources in freely covertible currency will disappear, and  the possibility of raising the question of "brotherly"  prices--like those for Russian consumers--appears. Thirdly, the  Belarusian taxpayers are saved from the excise tax, while in  Russia oil and gas are subject to a strict tax.    Despite the optimism of the two countres' prime ministers,  the Belarusian side has still not expressed its readiness to  sign the agreement on the single mechanism for managing the  budget systems, which indicates their wish not to come under  Russian control. The situation becomes even more understandable  taking into account the agreement, already signed by  Gerashchenko and Bogdankevich, on the schedule for unifying the  mechanism for the function of the common monetary system.  According to this agreement, the Central Bank of Belarus has  the right to establish credit limits and to grant licenses to  banks on its territory, while the Central Bank of Russia "is to  ensure satisfaction of the basic (? A.B.) requirements...for  currency bills."    Thus Belarus maintains its political independence, including  an independent emissions bank and an autonomous budget, which,  as is known, is the main calalyst of inflation.    There is no precedent for unifying monetary systems under  similar conditions. Consequently, it is possible to discuss the  seamy political issues of what is going on. The striving by the  high officials of the Russian Central Bank to reanimate, even in  a truncated version, the monetary-credit [system] of the USSR is  an open secret. There are supporters and collaboraters in the  government. However, one must think about the economic  consequences of such a "mutually beneficial" union for Russia.  There is still one tricky obstacle. Belarus is not opposed to  the agreement being implemented by decree of the Russian  Federation government, bypassing the State Duma. It is not  difficult to guess that the opposition would not hesitate to use  this as grounds for accusing the president and the cabinet of  ministers of betraying national interests.    In September during the signing of the agreement on creating  a ruble zone of a new type, Belarusian Supreme Soviet chairman  Stanislav Shushkevich delicately posed the question of writing  off his republic's debt to Russia. Hastening the current  agreement, Belarus apparently wants to keep Russia as a  financial donor and achieve with a "caress" what Kazakhstan and  Uzbekistan did not succeed in with pressure.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Patten rules out change to A-level exams MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday said the government had 'no intention whatsoever' of changing A-level examinations, in spite of a Labour proposal that they should be replaced. He pointed out that sixth-formers had the choice of AS-levels, which allow supplementary subjects, and vocational A-levels. He said: 'I think it would be perverse to get rid of a qualification which is admired and respected throughout the world in favour of a system based on the lowest common denominator.' Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said this showed that Mr Patten was 'wrong and in isolation'. She said: 'It's not just the Labour party which is calling for the abolition of A-levels.' She described the list of organisations which have called for reform as 'both extensive and impressive'. It includes the university vice-chancellors and the standing conference on university entrance, as well as the Confederation of British Industry and the two main bodies representing independent secondary schools, the Headmasters' Conference and the Girls' Schools Association. The Institute of Management also opposes A-levels. Labour's proposals, which are still consultative, envisage a General Certificate of Further Education (GCFE) which would allow students to accumulate credits until the age of 18 in a variety of academic and vocational subjects. Further education would be more closely integrated with sixth-form colleges. Mrs Taylor said: 'We want to structure education provision so that young people do not regard 16 as the end of their educational experience. A GCFE would help young people to see education as on-going and could be part of a continuous structure for the 14-to-18-plus age group.' Labour's proposal is in line with the recommendations of Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, who is reviewing the national curriculum for England and Wales.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Technical review of Doc. 9.19.1 will continue and the U.S. may offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further comment on the affected resolutions before or during the COP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States supports deletions of resolutions that are out of date or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer relevant. However, recent discussions in the International  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whaling Commission (IWC) highlight the fact that illegal trade in whale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products continues, in spite of the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States has requested that this item be discussed at COP9 (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agenda item 15). The IWC has not yet completed an observation, inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enforcement program which would certify that the products of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial whaling which occurs in the future are taken in compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IWC regulations. Therefore, the admonitions contained in Resolutions Conf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.8 and 3.13 appear to the United States to be as pertinent today as when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they were adopted by the Parties. These resolutions are neither out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date, nor have they been superseded. Therefore, the United States opposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deletion of these resolutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States opposes deletion of the aspects pertaining to plants in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conf. 2.18, 4.24, 6.18, and 8.17(b) and 8.17(c), which provide an important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal basis, which is different from using a limited departure from Conf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.9 on what is readily recognizable, to guide the standard exclusion or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption from CITES provisions of certain specified parts and derivatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certain plants, e.g., the cut flowers of artificially propagated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix I hybrids and the flasked seedlings of all artificially propagated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orchids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Future germane proposals on taxa for Appendix I simply can be directed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conf. 8.17(b) and 8.17(c), without subsequent proposals on the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions. Future proposals to uplist orchid taxa thus would be routinely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guided by Conf. 8.17(c) and their flasked seedlings would be exempt. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar process has been in effect for the proposals on Appendix II plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxa, where routinely certain parts or derivatives are standard exclusions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as specified through Conf. 4.24 (e.g., for tissue cultures) and Conf. 6.18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., for flasked seedling cultures).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) Consolidation of valid resolutions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents have been received at several Standing Committee meetings. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States essentially supports those consolidations prepared thus far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Secretariat; a review finds them to be a diligent and accurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidation of a complex array of resolutions dealing with the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject. Proposed consolidations have been discussed at Standing Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings and approved for transmission to the Parties on the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues (final text has not yet been received from the Secretariat,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however): Transport of live specimens (consolidate Conf. 3.16, 4.20, 5.18,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.13, and 8.12); Disposal of illegally traded specimens (consolidate Conf.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.15, 3.9, 3.14, 4.17, 4.18, 5.14, and 7.6); Trade in elephant ivory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (consolidate Conf. 3.12, 6.12, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, and 7.8); Annual reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and trade monitoring (consolidate Conf. 2.16, 3.10, 5.5, 5.6, 5.14, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.7); Trade in readily recognizable parts and derivatives (consolidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conf. 4.8, 5.9, 5.22, and 6.22); Permits and certificates (consolidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conf. 3.6, 3.7, 4.9, 4.16, 5.7, 5.8, 5.15, 6.6, 8.5); Trade in plants (12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior resolutions: consolidate Conf. 2.13, 5.14, 5.15, 8.17, propose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeal all or part of Conf. 2.18, 4.24, 5.14, 6.18, and 6.20, and deal with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conf. 2.14, 4.16, and parts of 5.14, 8.18, 8.19 in a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidation); Trade with non-Parties and reserving Parties (consolidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conf. 3.8, 8.8); and Transit and transhipment (consolidate Conf. 4.10,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Establishment of a List of the Other Decisions of the Conference of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ongoing Standing Committee and Secretariat efforts to differentiate between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties which provide guidance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of the Convention, or call for continuing activities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indefinite duration, and decisions of the COP that direct the Secretariat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or permanent committees to perform certain specific activities of limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Standing Committee has recommended that decisions of the Parties at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COP be distributed in a manner similar to that for resolutions. The United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States supports this procedure, utilizing guidelines to be adopted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COP, that have been approved by the Standing Committee. Often,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations to the Secretariat or permanent committees are included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolutions, when these recommendations are relevant for a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee only, or for a short time period between two COPs only. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States supports separating these specific and/or short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions from resolutions, wherein resolutions should refer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations for implementation of the Convention, and interpretations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Convention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Report on National Reports Under Article VIII, Paragraph 7, of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Convention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support efforts to encourage all Parties to submit annual reports, for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species of flora and fauna, consistent with their domestic legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support efforts whereby proposals for transfer of certain species from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix I to II with an export quota or pursuant to ranching only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered for Parties that are current with their annual report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each Party is required by the Convention to submit an annual report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing a summary of the permits it has granted, and the types and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers of specimens of species in the CITES Appendices that it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported and exported. Accurate report data are essential to measure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of international trade on species, and can be a useful enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Review of Alleged Infractions and Other Problems of Implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Convention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

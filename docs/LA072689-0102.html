			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Former Trader at Drexel Barred: Former Drexel Burnham Lambert trader Carey J.  Maultasch has been barred permanently from the securities industry for his part  in Wall Street's biggest insider trading scandal. Maultasch, 37, once a senior  trader under junk bond financier Michael Milken, the former chief of Drexel's  Beverly Hills-based high-yield bond department, settled civil securities fraud  charges in April without admitting or denying guilt. As part of the settlement,  the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted a proceeding barring him from  associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser or investment firm.  </P></p>

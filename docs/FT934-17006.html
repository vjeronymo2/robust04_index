			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / US indicators hint at faster expansion THE OFFICIAL index of US leading indicators rose by 1 per cent in August, suggesting the US economy could be poised for a period of faster growth, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The increase was the biggest since December, reflecting gains in 10 of the 11 component indicators. The main positive factors were a rise in building permits, a decline in weekly claims for unemployment insurance, and a rise in orders for plant and equipment. Other figures published yesterday painted a positive but somewhat less encouraging picture. New orders for manufactured goods rose 0.9 per cent in August, failing to make good a 1.9 per cent decline in July. Orders, however, were 5.9 per cent higher than in the equivalent period last year. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a reliable guide to manufacturing industry conditions - rose slightly to 49.7 per cent last month against 49.3 in August. This was the fourth consecutive month below the 50 per cent level generally regarded as the threshold for expansion in manufacturing. Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Managers, said the index had failed to rise much, partly because new orders had been weaker than expected. The outlook for employment in manufacturing, however, had improved slightly. Yesterday's figures follow a week of generally positive economic news. Consumer confidence rose modestly last month and personal incomes were stronger than expected in August. But new home sales were weaker than expected. The latest figures appear consistent with a consensus forecast of 2-3 per cent growth at an annual rate in the second half, up from just under 1.5 per cent in the first half.</p>

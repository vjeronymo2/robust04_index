			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Cleaning up with orange peel DISCARDED orange peel, especially from Brazil, has turned out to have astonishing powers as an industrial solvent and cleanser. It may replace one of the chemicals doing most damage to the ozone layer, which the world's governments have agreed to ban by 1995. The solvent, called Pronatur, cleans stubborn materials such as oil and bitumen from any surface, including human skin, but is so safe it can be drunk - although this is not recommended: it might smell like oranges, but it tastes ghastly. It is made from a blend of natural oils squeezed from orange peel from around the world. Because there is no scientific breakthrough to patent the blend is being kept secret, as are the names of most of the countries the oranges come from, although Brazilian peel is an important source of oil. Oranges, it appears, have locally determined natural chemicals in their zest. Bulked out with an inert paraffin, the product sells at Pounds 2 a litre. Edward Billington &amp; Sons, a Liverpool sugar merchant and food company, has spent more than Pounds 250,000 setting up a plant in Bootle to make 1m litres a month. The product was developed by Mr Richard Manbiot when he worked for Glenmarkie, a small Aberdeen solvent manufacturer. He and Mr Paul Richardson, a colleague, were negotiating to buy the company from its owner, but were hesitant about the risks of borrowing the necessary Pounds 750,000. Impressed with the potential of Pronatur and related solvents, Billington - a customer - has bought the rights to the products and set up a subsidiary with equity stakes for Mr Manbiot and Mr Richardson. Mr Manbiot said yesterday: 'This is a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem. EC countries use 113,000 tonnes of 1,1,1-trichloroethane a year and have agreed to ban it by 1995 under the Montreal protocol because of the damage done to the ozone layer after it evaporates. 'I'm a cook rather than a chemist. I developed Pronatur by trial and a lot of error. Then it was matter of working out how to scale up for mass production. We reckon we have a two-year lead on the rest of the world. Citrus has always had grease-cutting power. This stuff maximises it.' Trials have proved Pronatur is good at cleaning up oil slicks. It absorbs the oil immediately, forming a solution that mixes in water and floats on top of it. 'You then skim or vacuum it off. If you drag an oil-absorbing polyester cloth across it, you can even cart it all off in plastic bags and burn it safely,' Mr Manbiot said. The solvent is being used in hospitals to dissolve bitumen splashes off the burns they cause, reducing further damage to tissue. It takes 30 times longer than conventional solvents to evaporate, so less needs to be used. Most solvents waste 90 per cent of their power by vaporising before they can act - aggravating pollution. The new solvent has been endorsed by the Department of Energy as category 1, meaning it is ideal for a wide range of cleaning purposes. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has approved it for use in oil spillages. It already has approvals from Powergen, Nuclear Electric, British Gas, Eastern Electric, Rolls-Royce Aerospace, ABB Transport, South Wales Electric and Scottish Power. Mr Manbiot said: 'We have all the approvals needed for this to be a window of opportunity to break into bigger markets.' When Pronatur breaks down it forms safe carbon dioxide. That means it should also score over the alternative to 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, which is toxic when inhaled.</p>

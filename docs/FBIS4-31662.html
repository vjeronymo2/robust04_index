			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(zl)"-signed and TA SR report: "The Christian Democratic </F> Movement Is Intimidating the Voters"]    [Text] Bratislava--At a movement press briefing yesterday,  Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement  [KDH], said that, in conversations with him, his foreign  partners have expressed the view that, if Meciar's Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] wins the elections in Slovakia, the  process of the Slovak Republic's integration into European  structures will be slowed down. In reply to a question from  SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA on whether he thinks it is democratic for  foreign states to influence Slovak voters, he said that these  countries have the right of veto in admitting new members into  the European Union and that we cannot prevent them from doing  this. In reply to other questions from SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA,  which has obtained information that government members have  increased their salaries without the agreement of parliament, he  said that this is not true, and, in reply to a question on  whether he thinks it is right that the government has exempted  the daily NARODNA OBRODA from tax, he said that he knows nothing  about it. He did not rule out the possibility of forming a  postelection coalition with the Party of the Democratic Left.  He said apropos of the HZDS: "A coalition with Chairman Meciar  is not being taken into consideration for the KDH."</p>

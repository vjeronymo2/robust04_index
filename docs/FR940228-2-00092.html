			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Enhancement to the Exchange Market <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange established the membership categories of Competitive Trader and RCMM to provide a means whereby members, subject to certain conditions, could add to the quality of the Exchange market by initiating proprietary transactions on the Floor. The current restriction in Rule 96 defeats this purpose in some instances by precluding Floor professionals from initiating such Floor transactions in any stock where they have an option position overlying such stock (or where they know their member organization has such an option position). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will further the purposes of Rule 107 by facilitating RCMM participation as dealers on the Exchange. Currently, the prohibition in Rule 96 conflicts with the purposes of Rule 107 by effectively precluding RCMMs from participating as dealers in any stock where they have an option positin in that stock. By deleting the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options, the proposed rule change will eliminate this barrier to RCMM dealer participation, thereby permitting RCMMs to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market in situation where they currently may not do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a similar vein, the proposed rule change will facilitate transactions by Competitive Traders on the Floor by permitting them to initiate such transactions in a stock where they have an option position in such stock. This enhanced ability to initiate transactions on the Floor will, as with RCMMs, add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Concerns <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 96 was adopted in the mid-1930's to regulate trading where members have a position in OTC options, not listed options, and the trading abuses in the OTC market that gave rise to Rule 96 are simply not present with respect to today's closely surveilled trading in listed options. The Exchange believes that regulatory concerns as to listed option trading can be addressed by monitoring and surveillance of revised Rule 96. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange notes that if the prohibition in Rule 96 were to be removed as to listed options, RCMMs and Competitive Traders would remain subject to the restrictions on members' on-Floor proprietary transactions stated in Rules 108 and 112, <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and thus would not be in any greater position to exploit their alleged time and place advantage over public investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under Rule 108, an on-Floor order placed by a member to establish or increase a position in the member's proprietary account is not entitled to priority, or precedence based on size, over an off-Floor order placed by a public customer. On-Floor and off-floor are defined in rule 112; that rule also prohibits frontrunning of block transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of Barrier to Fair Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange notes that off-Floor professionals (including specialists and market makers on regional exchanges) are not subject to any restrictions in effacing off-Floor proprietary trades in a stock where they have an option position (whether a listed or OTC option) in that stock. Thus, off-Floor professional can be said to enjoy a significant competitive advantage over Floor professionals on the Exchange, who are restricted in their on-Floor proprietary transactions in a stock where they have an option position in that stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange acknowledges that a floor professional my initiate an off-Floor order in a stock where he has an option position in that stock. However, a significant reason why Competitive Traders and RCMMs become registered as such is to be able, in the routine conduct of their business, to initiate proprietary trades  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> on the Floor rather than ``upstairs.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, the ability of Floor professionals to initiate off-Floor orders in a stock in which they have an option position is largely meaningless when viewed in the context of the way such professionals routinely conduct their business. The Exchange does not believe that any viewed in the context of the way such professionals routinely conduct their business, when off-Floor professionals are not subject to comparable restrictions in the routine conduct of their business. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

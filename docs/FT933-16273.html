			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Bank of England governor says interest rates at 'right level' UK INTEREST rates were at the right level, Mr Eddie George, the new governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday. They were not particularly high when measured against the underlying rate of inflation, and the long-term aim should be to reduce the underlying rate of price increases to a range of zero to 2 per cent, he said.</p>

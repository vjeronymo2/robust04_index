			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 21 TASS -- Scenarios of an armed  attack on the Russian Far East which were simulated at joint  U.S.-Japanese command and staff exercises, do not threaten the  security and national interests of the Russian Federation,  although they are a relapse of the Cold War, said on Monday  representatives of the Russian chief naval staff.    They commented on an article in Sunday's Japanese newspaper  MAINICHI that the United States and Japan conducted exercises  codenamed C-1, C-2 and C-3, during which representatives of the  Pentagon and the Japanese Defence Agency annually drafted plans  for invading the Russian Maritime Territory, the South Kurils  and Sakhalin.    In the opinion of Russian experts, the article does not  reflect present-day realities. The world has changed, as has  the nature of relations between countries. For instance, Russia  and the United States will stage a joint exercise with beaching  a landing party.    Russian-Japanese contacts have also become more active. They  became more open and trustworthy.    Russia has adequate forces to protect its Far East both from  land and sea, representatives of the Russian chief naval staff  claimed.</p>

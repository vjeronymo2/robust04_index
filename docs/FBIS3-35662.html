The negotiations proceeded in accordance with Security  Council Resolutions 849 of 9 July 1993, 854 of 6 August 1993,  858 of 24 August 1993, 876 of 9 October 1993, 881 of 4 November  1993, and 892 of 22 December 1993.    It was pointed out that the provisions of the Memorandum of  Understanding of 1 December 1993 were, in the main, being  implemented.    There has been an exchange of prisoners in accordance with  the principle "all for all."    Representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  have  organized the first preparatory trip in order to discuss the  possibility of the voluntary return of refugees and displaced  persons to their permanent places of residence.    The number of international observers in the conflict zone  is  being increased.    On 15-16 December 1993, a meeting of a group of experts  working out recommendations on the political status of Abkhazia  was held in Moscow in which representatives of the sides  involved in the conflict, the UN, and the Russian Federation and  a CSCE observer participated.    At the same time, it was pointed out that, in separate  rayons  in the conflict zone, armed groups that were not subject to any  control had carried out combat actions, which had brought  renewed suffering upon a part of the population.    Work has not yet begun on searching for persons missing  without trace and reburying the dead.    During the second round of negotiations in Geneva, the sides  emphasized that efforts aimed at achieving a full-scale  regulation of the conflict as soon as possible should be  continued.    1. The sides again confirm that they will fulfill the  obligations placed upon them without the use of force and the  threat of the use of force against one another.    2. The sides have agreed that the creation of favorable  conditions for the further promotion of the process of a  political settlement and the practical implementation of the  agreements that have been reached will contribute to the  implementation of a full- scale operation to maintain peace in  Abkhazia. They have appealed to the UN Security Council,  requesting that, when it discusses again the activities of the  mission of UN observers in Georgia, it widens its mandate  accordingly, in particular, that this mission be entrusted with  ensuring that there is no resumption of hostilities in the  conflict zone. The sides have again stated that they support  the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces or other forces  sanctioned by the UN in the conflict zone. They have expressed  their consent to the use of a Russian Federation military  contingent in such forces.    In accordance with a decision of the UN Security Council,  following the deployment of additional international observers  in the conflict zone and the arrival of peacekeeping forces, the  sides will withdraw over the course of five days all armed  formations along with their weapons and combat equipment from  the Inguri River and other possible areas of active  confrontation in the conflict zone that will be determined by  the command of the peacekeeping forces and the mission of UN  observers in Georgia in coordination with the sides and, at the  same time, international observers and peacekeeping forces will  enter the zone that has been created.    Volunteer formations and individuals who have come to take  part in the conflict are to be disarmed and withdrawn and  international observers will be allowed to carry out inspections  at crossing points along the Psou River.    The sides request the UN Security Council to strengthen the  international civilian presence in the conflict zone, which  necessitates the deployment of appropriate civilian specialists  there who will contribute to the resolution of the refugee  problem and other humanitarian questions.    3. It is the view of the sides that a special voluntary fund  created under the aegis of the UN will contribute to the  accomplishment of the task of regulating the situation.    4. The sides will continue to elaborate a quadrilateral  agreement on the voluntary return and repatriation of refugees  and forcibly displaced persons to Abkhazia.    The sides have agreed to create a special commission for  refugees that will be made up of representatives of the sides,  the UN, and Russia and that will begin work on 25 January 1994.    The sides have agreed to start the process of the gradual  return of refugees and forcibly displaced persons to Abkhazia on  10 February and Gali rayon has been named as the first stage [in  this process]. The sides will make every effort to ensure the  safety of the refugees, forcibly displaced persons, and the  personnel taking part in this operation. The Abkhazian side is  to bear primary responsibility for receiving and protecting the  refugees and forcibly displaced persons and also the  aforementioned personnel. In addition, the sides request the UN  and the Russian Federation to assist in creating a safe  situation, which will facilitate the return of refugees and  forcibly displaced persons.    The sides pin their hopes on the effective assistance of the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees; in particular, on the  temporary department of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  beginning work in the conflict zone in the near future.    5. The sides recognize that the main task is to achieve a  full-scale political settlement of the conflict and every effort  has to be made to this end. They have agreed to continue to  discuss the problem of the political status of Abkhazia taking  into account the interests of both sides. The next meeting of  experts to discuss this question will be held in Moscow on 8  February. Their report will be heard at the next meeting of the  sides and sent to the UN and CSCE.    The UN, CSCE, and Russian Federation call upon the sides to  be guided by the necessity of protecting the fundamental  principles underlying the full-scale regulation of the  situation: Protecting the territorial integrity of Georgia and  completely safeguarding the interests of the entire  multinational population of Abkhazia.    6. The sides have stated that they are interested in  creating an international commission to promote economic  recovery in Abkhazia with the participation of international and  national organizations by 15 February of this year at the  latest. Their primary task should be the reconstruction of  vitally important installations, transport communications,  airports, bridges, and tunnels.    7. The participants in the negotiations have agreed to hold  the next meeting on 22 February 1994 either in Moscow or Geneva.    [Signed] On behalf of the Georgian side -- J.

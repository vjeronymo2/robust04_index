			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / OFT rejects newspaper distribution complaint The Monopolies and Mergers Commission will today reject complaints that national newspaper distribution is a monopoly that acts against the public interest. In the latest of a series of investigations going back to 1976 the commission has decided that newspaper distributors such as WH Smith, John Menzies and Surridge Dawson operate an efficient service that gets the largest number of newspapers to the public at a reasonable cost. After looking at the industry for more than a year the commission has come up with only one significant recommendation for change - that newsagents should be allowed to 'sub-retail' newspapers to others. Some newsagents sell on papers to others and split the discount. This is seen as a 'pirate' operation and discouraged by the distributors. The commission decided that some sub-retailing on a 'sensible' and local basis would act as a safety valve for those who wanted to sell papers but could not get supplies. One of the main pressures for change has come from small convenience and grocery stores, which want to sell papers but have generally been refused supplies on the grounds that they are in areas already served by newsagents. VG Distributors, the independent high-street grocery chain, told the commission inquiry that the market was 'rigged' and that fixed newspaper distribution territories, often operating on an exclusive franchise basis, should be dismantled. VG said it was campaigning on behalf of more than 40,000 convenience stores which could not get newspapers even though, they argued, newsagents were increasingly entering the grocery sector by selling items such as milk, bread and baked beans. A number of ideas which would have opened up the newspaper retail market more fully to outsiders were rejected. Professor Samuel Eilon, a member of the commission panel, suggested a system of 'minimum list values' - setting a guaranteed minimum of copies that would go to non-traditional outlets with the Office of Fair Trading increasing the total each year. The idea was rejected by the majority. Proposals for a cash-and-carry scheme, allowing prospective sellers of newspapers to pick up copies direct from wholesalers at their own expense, were also rejected. Newspaper distribution was first referred to the commission in 1976 and its report two years later found that a complex monopoly did exist, but that it was not against the public interest to limit the number of retailers.</p>

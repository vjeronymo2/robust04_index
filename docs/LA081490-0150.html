			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCUMENTARY;  </P> <P> MADNESS IN THE MARSHES: HUSSEIN'S LAST WAR;  </P> <P> THE IRAQI LEADER'S TACTICS WERE SURGICALLY PRECISE IN THE SPRING OF 1984.  THOUSANDS OF IRANIAN TROOPS PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.  </P> <P> "Majnoon" is what they call the marshes on the border that divides Iran and  Iraq just below the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. It's the  Arabic word for "madness." And in the spring of 1984, when the Majnoon marshes  became the latest battlefield in the prolonged Iran-Iraq War, Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein redefined the word.  </P> <P> As one of only a handful of European and American journalists who managed to  reach the actual fighting at the time, I watched Hussein's army slaughter  thousands of Iranian soldiers in a rare and little-known military operation  that combined high technology, hatred and the horrors of war into a blend of  brutality almost beyond comprehension.  </P> <P> What we saw was vintage Saddam Hussein, the efficient and surgical military  muscle that made the Persian Gulf War one of the bloodiest in the history of  man and made Hussein himself the most awesome leader in the Arab world.  </P> <P> And it left behind haunting images that now help define America's newest enemy  in the Middle East and graphically underscore the ruthless dedication of his  million-strong war machine.  </P> <P> The Battle of Majnoon wasn't nearly as widely documented as Hussein's use of  vast chemical weapons arsenals on Iraq's rebellious Kurds, whose poisoned  bodies littering the roadsides have been shown time and again on Western  television during the past 10 days. Nor was it as well publicized as the Iraqi  leader's devastating "War of the Cities" missile attacks on schools, homes and  mosques throughout Iran during the eight-year war.  </P> <P> In fact, there were very few shots fired, and only a handful of artillery  barrages. They were hardly needed, given the creative killing methods devised  by the Iraqi army for the occasion.  </P> <P> "You wait until nighttime, and you will see how we are killing these Iranian  dogs," an Iraqi officer said with a broad grin. "We are frying them like  eggplants."  </P> <P> He then took us on a tour of dozens of thick electrical cables his troops had  lain through the marshy battlefield, a spaghetti network that snaked in and out  of the patchwork of lagoons. He showed us the mammoth electric generators that  fed the exposed power lines from positions just behind the Iraqi front lines.  And, when the Iranian Revolutionary Guards made their regular evening advance,  the officer and his men demonstrated the macabre genius of their invention.  </P> <P> Iraqi gun batteries fired just enough artillery to force the Revolutionary  Guards from their marsh boats, and, when hundreds of them had been forced to  continue their advance through the lagoons on foot, the men manning the Iraqi  generators flipped a few switches and sent thousands of volts of electricity  surging through the marshland.  </P> <P> Within seconds, hundreds of Iranians were electrocuted.  </P> <P> But the horror show did not end there. The following morning, Iraqi troops  began another grisly routine that the officer called "the morning road detail."  </P> <P> They made their way through the marshes, gathering up the dead Iranian soldiers  like dynamite fishermen harvesting a day's catch. Working methodically, the  Iraqis piled the corpses on top of one another in the water in head-to-toe  stacks, five bodies high and five across.  </P> <P> Together, the human piles formed long rows, the width of a troop truck, the top  layers above the water's surface. Each row extended in a straight line through  the marshes from the Iraqis' positions toward the Iranian border. Finally, the  rows were sprinkled with lime and covered over with a foot-thick tier of desert  sand.  </P> <P> It was the Iraqi method of road building, using the bodies of their enemies to  construct assault routes for tanks and trucks.  </P> <P> There are other grisly anecdotes from the Iran-Iraq War that help define Saddam  Hussein -- glimpses of an enigmatic leader who in the last 12 days has sealed  his nation to all outside journalists and crafted his image through Iraqi  government television clips.  </P> <P> For Saddam Hussein, a teen-aged assassin who led his splinter faction of the  Arab Baath Party to power in a ruthless July 30, 1968, coup, the pursuit of  physical power and military might has been as much a characteristic as his  penchant for security.  </P> <P> During three meetings with Hussein in small press conferences or interviews in  1984, I was led through three metal detectors each time and thoroughly  body-searched twice by his personal guards. Throughout the rambling sessions,  Hussein turned answers into political diatribes and always referred to himself  in the third person.  </P> <P> Every trip he made outside his presidential palace was an unscheduled, surprise  visit. Foreign journalists were never permitted to accompany him. And he would  travel in a convoy in which several limousines were used as decoys.  </P> <P> It was during another rural journey through the Iraqi countryside that it  became clear Hussein's troops were capable of using on their own people the  very same ruthlessness they show their enemies.  </P> <P> There were three of us that day, journalists from the United States, Britain  and Canada, traveling by civilian bus on an unauthorized trip from the capital  of Baghdad to the southernmost war-front city of Basra. Every 20 or 30 miles,  our bus was stopped at military checkpoints. At first, we were afraid for  ourselves. We were traveling out of Baghdad without permission. But, each time,  the soldiers who boarded the bus approached us only with genuine smiles and  awkward greetings in broken English. And each time, they left the bus with  several young men in civilian clothes.  </P> <P> Finally, at a checkpoint near Basra, we learned all too clearly the purpose of  the searches.  </P> <P> A young man who had been pulled off the bus by the troops turned suddenly from  the checkpoint and started running from the soldiers. As we watched through the  bus window, three of the soldiers calmly knelt, took aim and shot him several  times in the back.  </P> <P> Noting the horror in our eyes, an elderly passenger sitting nearby turned to  us, brushed the air with her hand, as if swatting away a fly, and said,  "Deserter."  </P></p>

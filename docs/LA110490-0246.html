			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHOM DOES THE REALTOR REALLY REPRESENT?;  </P> <P> ALLEGIANCE: THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE LISTING AGENT'S  PRIMARY LOYALTY IS TO THE SELLER.  </P> <P> You have probably heard that this is a great time to purchase a home during the  current buyer's market. So you drop in at a few Sunday open houses. The  friendly real estate agents are only too eager to answer your questions and act  as your agent for buying a home.  </P> <P> But be careful. If the agent you speak with is the listing agent, no matter how  nice and friendly he or she might be, his or her primary loyalty is to the home  seller.  </P> <P> Before you get heavily involved in the home-buying game, please spend a few  moments to understand whom the real estate agent really represents.  </P> <P> The listing agent. The real estate broker who obtained the listing of the home  for sale is known as the listing agent. He or she has a fiduciary duty to the  seller.  </P> <P> During the listing term, the listing agent must tell the seller all material  facts that develop, such as comments of prospective buyers about the home as  well as any unfavorable information that the agent learns, such as city plans  to widen the street in front of the house to a four-lane expressway.  </P> <P> However, questions remain unanswered as to how much information the listing  agent must disclose to prospective buyers. Obviously, the listing agent must  tell the buyer about all known defects in the property.  </P> <P> But should the listing agent tell prospective buyers that the house is in  foreclosure and the seller must sell quickly to avoid losing the house? Or  should the listing agent disclose that the house is being sold due to divorce  or bankruptcy? If it is a material fact, the listing agent must disclose it to  the buyer.  </P> <P> Suppose the home is listed for sale at $150,000, but the seller tells the  listing agent she will take $125,000. Must the listing agent disclose this  confidential information to a prospective buyer? No. Price information is  considered opinion and need not be disclosed.  </P> <P> The dual agent. Getting back to our scenario where you meet the listing agent  at a Sunday open house of the listed property. You already know the listing  agent represents the seller. But who represents you? If you wish, the listing  agent can act as a dual agent and represent both the seller and the buyer.  However, this seems like an inherent conflict of interest, doesn't it?  </P> <P> The real estate industry is one of the few where one agent can legally  represent both parties to a transaction. Lawyers, for example, wouldn't think  of representing both husband and wife in a divorce. But one real estate agent  can represent both seller and buyer without running afoul of the law.  </P> <P> But problems can develop with a dual agency. For example, suppose the seller  tells the listing agent not to say a word about the barking dog and the  obnoxious neighbors who hold noisy all-night parties next door. Must the  listing agent tell the prospective buyers about this?  </P> <P> As you can see, when one agent represents both buyer and seller there are  opportunities for conflicts of interest.  </P> <P> The sub-agent. Another agent possibility is the agent who finds a buyer for the  house who does not want to act as the buyer's agent, but as a sub-agent of the  listing agent. This was the common situation when the listing agent put the  listing on the local multiple listing service and offered sub-agency to any  member agent who located an acceptable buyer.  </P> <P> However, this circumstance has recently changed. Many multiple listing services  no longer offer sub-agency and now require an agent producing a buyer to  represent the buyer exclusively.  </P> <P> The buyer's agent. Many multiple listing services allow the agent who locates a  buyer to represent the buyer exclusively. This is possible even when the  listing agent and the selling agent split the sales commission paid by the  seller.  </P> <P> However, there is one situation when an agent cannot represent the buyer  exclusively. It occurs when one agent with a brokerage is the listing agent and  another agent with the same firm produces the buyer. Then the agents can act  either as both seller's agents or dual agents. But the selling agent cannot act  as the buyer's agent exclusively because that would be an inherent conflict of  interest.  </P> <P> The unrepresented buyer. Finally, we come to the situation where the buyer is  not represented by any real estate agent. This can happen, for example, in our  first scenario where the listing agent shows the buyer the listed home.  </P> <P> Although the listing agent can write up and present the purchase offer to the  seller, the listing agent can choose to represent the seller exclusively. Then  the buyer has no agent.  </P> <P> Another situation where the buyer is not represented by an agent occurs where  the agent who obtains the purchase offer from a buyer wants to act as a  sub-agent of the listing agent. This arrangement was the traditional method and  still is widely used in many states. But buyers should be informed that nobody  is looking out for their interests when both agents represent the seller.  </P> <P> At this point you are probably thinking this is a very confusing joke. But the  vested interests in the real estate sales industry want to keep things the way  they are.  </P> <P> The realtors resisted agency disclosure, and only under threats from the  Federal Trade Commission did they reluctantly agree to disclose to buyers and  sellers who really represents whom. As a result, most states now require real  estate agents to disclose in writing which agent, if any, represents you.  Further information on this still-developing agency situation is available from  local real estate attorneys.  </P></p>

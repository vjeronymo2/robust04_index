			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: SKF bond seeks to raise up to Ecu145.3m SKF, the Swedish roller bearings group, is raising up to Ecu145.3m (Dollars 114.9m) with a convertible bond issue aimed at international investors. The Swedish group will be the first European company to use liquid yield option notes (known as LYONs), the zero coupon convertible bonds developed by Merrill Lynch. LYONs have been used by several companies in the US - including Disney and Eastman Kodak - since their launch in 1985. The 10-year bonds will be issued at a price of Ecu426.22, presenting a discount of 57.378 per cent on the face value of the bond. Each note, with a principal amount of Ecu1,000, can be converted into 24.9 unrestricted SKF series B shares. The issue is being managed by Merrill Lynch, and part of it is expected to be placed privately in the US. SKF said it may raise up to Ecu145.3m, which would correspond to 8.5m unrestricted series B shares if the entire issue is converted. The money will be used to refinance some of the company's debt. SKF increased its debt by about SKr2bn when it acquired part of Ovako, a speciality steel producer which has plants in Finland and Sweden. Moody's Investors Service has given the SKF LYONs issue a Baa1 senior debt rating in view of SKF's 'moderately leveraged capital structure and Moody's expectations that returns and cash flows are likely to remain under pressure in the intermediate term'. Moody's points out that while SKF has a strong business position in bearings, its operating earnings are expected to recover only gradually because of losses at Ovako and the expected 'sluggish economic upturn' in the automotive and capital goods markets in the US and Europe.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / China's HK committee starts work THE Chinese Communist party yesterday rolled out the red carpet for the first meeting of a controversial new panel that Beijing officials said would 'study' issues relating to Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The 'preparatory work subcommittee' was created by China's National People's Congress at its annual meeting in March and represents a achievement for the party's 'united front' tactics in Hong Kong ahead of 1997. It is headed by Mr Qian Qichen, foreign minister, and includes a number of leading Hong Kong citizens such as businessman Mr Li Ka-shing and former advisers to the British colonial government such as Mrs Rita Fan. The presence at the inauguration of Mr Jiang Zemin, Communist party chief, and Mr Zhu Rongji, executive vice-premier, was seen as a demonstration to Britain that many of Hong Kong's leading figures opposed Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's scheme to broaden local democracy. Since China's decision to create the panel was announced, fears have been expressed in Hong Kong that it may act as a 'shadow authority', second-guessing the British colonial government's every move before 1997. Mr Qian moved yesterday to quell those fears. He said China would not undermine British sovereignty; the panel 'cannot be some second power centre or shadow authority'. Mr Jiang said it ushered in a 'new stage' of preparing for Hong Kong's takeover; he hoped Beijing and London could 'overcome their misunderstandings and strengthen co-operation and trust' to promote a smooth transition. Other senior Chinese government officials took the opportunity to send various signals to Hong Kong. Mr Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said measures taken to curb economic overheating on the mainland would inevitably slow investment in Hong Kong. He said no existing investment would be recalled, but China would curb frenzied mainland speculation in Hong Kong's stock and real estate markets: 'China's is a developing economy that should try to retain its capital.' Gen Xu Huizi, deputy chief of the general staff, said Beijing would station troops in Hong Kong's rural and urban areas. They would be a multilingual, incorruptible elite trained in the colony's law. However, Mr Allen Lee, a member of the panel and a conservative Hong Kong politician, warned Beijing not to station troops in urban areas. 'The Chinese leadership ought to consider the psychological effect on Hong Kong people,' he said.</p>

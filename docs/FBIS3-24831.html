			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Naftal Donaldo] </F>   [Excerpts] DOMINGO has found that there are good relations  between Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] soldiers and the  UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] military observers at the  assembly areas of Neves and Chipandzane, in Inhambane Province,  and Changanine, in Gaza Province. The Renamo men have been  gradually handing over their weapons to the officials in the  Unomoz peacekeeping mission.    DOMINGO interviewed Renamo liaison officers in the three  assembly areas in the area of jurisdiction of the Southern  Regional Command, and it found that there is mutual trust  between the Renamo forces and the "blue helmets" who have been  deployed at those centers.    Major Aurelio de Freitas and officer Meque Nyumba, of the  Renamo command for Neves assembly area, noted that good  Renamo-UN relations also extend to the civilian component.    To back up their statements, Freitas and Nyumba explained  that, from a comparatively small group of 50 men, the number of  soldiers increased to more than 200 in only a matter of days.    In addition, the health post set up by the peacekeeping  mission has been assisting the people who live in the vicinity  and who are under Renamo's control.    This climate of trust is further enhanced by the fact that,  as the soldiers receive orders from their Maringue headquarters  to move to Neves and present themselves for registration, the  process of disarmament and collection of war materiel is  accompanied by the distribution of the goods to which they are  entitled. In concrete terms, those goods are food and clothing  that is distributed to individuals or to groups of men. [passage  omitted]    Freitas and Nyumba confirmed that each one of the soldiers  under their command had received the quantities of food set by  the World Food Program, WFP. Those foodstuffs included corn,  rice, beans, peas, cooking oil, sugar, and salt. [passage  omitted]    Good relations between Renamo and Unomoz were also confirmed  by Captain Cassama, a Guinea-Bissau observer in the UN  peacekeeping force. Major Sven Kallstrom, a Swedish major in  the Unomoz forces, also confirmed that relations were good,  though he avoided going into details for reasons that have to do  with ethics and internal regulations.

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UAL'S SHARES DECLINE WITH HOPES FOR BUYOUT;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: UNITED AIRLINES' PILOTS, MANAGERS AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS FACE BIG  OBSTACLES IN PACKAGING A NEW OFFER FOR UAL CORP.  </P> <P> UAL Corp. shares dropped more than $21 Friday, one day after British Airways  said it would not support a revised bid for the parent of United Airlines.  </P> <P> UAL closed at $168.50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange as Wall Street  grew pessimistic about a potential buyout. The airline's stock price has fallen  $116.50 a share since financing of the $6.75-billion plan for an  employee-management buyout collapsed a week ago.  </P> <P> "It's a depressing situation," said one trader whose firm invested in UAL  shares. "It can make you feel like crying."  </P> <P> Representatives of United's pilots, flight attendants and top managers met with  their advisers in New York on Friday in an effort to restructure the deal. The  group, led by United Chief Executive Stephen M. Wolf, needs to find a partner  with deep pockets to replace British Air. The British carrier had agreed to  contribute $750 million to help buy the airline but withdrew its offer after  banks declared the deal too risky and refused to lend money to finance it.  </P> <P> The Wolf group was expected to meet with the advisers through the weekend. In a  statement, the pilots union said it would present UAL's board with a proposal  at "the earliest possible time." People familiar with the situation said it was  doubtful that the Wolf group would have a solid new offer ready by the time  UAL's board meets on Monday, although it was possible that a preliminary plan  would be delivered.  </P> <P> It was not clear what action the board would take. It could continue to study  its options or it could say that the company is no longer for sale. Some  sources in the financial community said the board, embarrassed by the failed  takeover, might feel pressure to fire Wolf or UAL's chief financial officer,  John C. Pope, who led the buyout group's unsuccessful effort to finance the  transaction.  </P> <P> None of UAL's directors could be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Traders, stock analysts and bankers who followed developments surrounding the  transaction said it might be difficult for the Wolf group to find a new partner  quickly. Two employee groups, the machinists union and an organization that  represents United's non-union workers, have opposed a buyout and called for  Wolf's resignation. The division among United's workers might make a potential  partner hesitate about financing a Wolf-led buyout, informed observers said.  </P> <P> Moreover, any partner willing to finance a takeover would probably want control  of the airline, a condition not likely to go over well with United's pilots and  managers, who would have owned 85% of the airline under the failed proposal.  </P> <P> For that reason, it was considered unlikely that Los Angeles billionaire Marvin  Davis would help the Wolf group finance an employee buyout. Davis, who in  August set in motion the events that led to the buyout proposal with a  $240-a-share bid, has said that he might give employees a stake in UAL but that  he wants control. He said this week that he is still interested in the airline.  </P> <P> Sources said Davis was exploring whether financing would be available for a UAL  transaction in the wake of the failed bid. Davis and the Wolf group use the  same lead bank, Citicorp.  </P> <P> Besides dealing with tricky financing problems, Davis would have to bring  together United's fractured labor unions. The machinists, United's largest  labor group, have tried to derail a buyout and cheered British Air's  withdrawal. "I'm surprised it took them this long to see the folly of their  ways," said Brian Freeman, an adviser to the machinists.  </P> <P> Freeman said the machinists would continue to oppose a debt-financed employee  buyout, a position that could hurt the Wolf group's chances.  </P> <P> Japanese bankers especially have been leery about backing a buyout not endorsed  by all United's unions, and that attitude isn't likely to change.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- A considerable portion  of stocks scheduled to be issued this year will be postponed to  1995 following a recent government decision to standardize the  listed companies and stock trading.    A press release issued by the State Council Securities  Committee (SCSC) here today says that China's stock market is  still in its infancy, therefore its development should be a  step-by-step process and pursued on an experimental basis.    To ensure the quality of listing companies, from now on  enterprises should accept a six-month-long coaching by relevant  departments before they begin public stock offerings. The  coaching aims to help enterprises build up a mechanism in line  with a share- holding company, according to the press release.    The coaching period will be extend to twelve months in 1996,  before and after an enterprise issues stocks.    With the introduction of the coaching system, stock issue  plans of most enterprises will have to be postponed until next  year. The stock issuing quotas local governments have received  for 1994 will be effective in 1995.    This year, the stock issuing will be linked with bank  deposits and issue prices will be controlled, the press release  says.    Meanwhile, the government will enhance supervision of share-  holding companies and stock trading.    A guideline for enterprise management transformation will be  worked out and the stock trading system will be further improved  to prevent market manipulation and insider-trading.    Violators including securities companies and individuals  will  be punished according to law.    Institutional investors with long-term investment schemes  will be the backbone of the future stock market. Therefore open  investment funds will be set up when the time is proper, the  press release says.    This year, the government will increase B share issues and  no  domestic enterprise should go public on the overseas market  without SCSC approval or become a listed company on the overseas  market through buying into a listed shell company, the press  release says.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons It must come as a relief to Allied-Lyons that it is finally free to go ahead with its Carlsberg venture, especially on slightly less onerous terms than those originally proposed by the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission. Instead of rationing supplies to its tied outlets, Allied faces the simpler task of freeing a further 400 from the tie. That was not enough, though, to prompt a share price reaction yesterday. The market has assumed for some time that the venture would go ahead and that the short-term earnings impact would be small. Consummation of the deal will produce a cash inflow of some Pounds 135m in the current half, which should cut the interest bill on the company's Pounds 1.9bn debt. But those savings will probably be offset by rationalisation charges in distribution and administration. Of more immediate interest is what the company says about current trading at next week's interim results. Worries on that score, though more particularly over food and spirits than beer, have been the ostensible reason for a 3 per cent share price fall since Tuesday. That looks odd against a rising market, but Allied has outperformed Guinness by over 15 per cent since Black Wednesday - all the more ambitious since the two are now trading on an almost identical historic multiple of 15.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Manual Arts 72, Dorsey 48 -- Marcell Capers scored 19 points and Dwain  Bradberry added 16 to lead the top-seeded Toilers in the other 4-A semifinal at  the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Manual Arts outscored Dorsey, 24-9, in the second quarter, with Capers and  Bradberry combining for 12 points.  </P> <P> The Toilers (24-4) had a distinct advantage in the backcourt. Dorsey's starting  guards, Kareem Sconiers and Tim Cage, managed only 13 points, with Cage scoring  nearly half of that total in the game's final minutes.  </P> <P> "The big court hurt Dorsey more than it hurt us," Manual Arts Coach Randolph  Simpson said. "We have big guards who can cover more area. We wore Dorsey down,  and a guy like Marcell (Capers) took over."  </P> <P> Simpson said he is looking forward to facing Crenshaw in the final once again.  </P> <P> "Everybody wrote us off at the beginning of the season, but our goal was to get  to the City final," Simpson said. "Now that we're there, we will face Crenshaw,  but this year should be different because we are deeper."  </P> <P> James Bacon led Dorsey (20-7) with 13 points. LONNIE WHITE  </P></p>

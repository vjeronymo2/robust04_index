			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Chevron expects Dollars 375m gain from settlement CHEVRON, one of the biggest US oil and gas groups, yesterday said it expected to record a fourth-quarter extraordinary gain of Dollars 375m following settlement of its litigation with Pennzoil. Under the agreement, Pennzoil will acquire a group of Chevron's US oil and gas fields in a tax-free exchange of stock. The deal will reduce Pennzoil's stake in Chevron to about 5.3 per cent, or about 17.2m shares, from about 9.7 per cent. Chevron's litigation with Pennzoil started in 1989, when Pennzoil's stake in Chevron reached 9 per cent. Once the deal is completed, both companies will drop all legal claims against each other stemming from Pennzoil's 1989 investment. In addition, both companies have agreed not to purchase additional shares of each other's stock for five years.</p>

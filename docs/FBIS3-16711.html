			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Morozov] </F>   [Text] Bucharest, 17 Mar -- An agreement on cooperation  between the defense ministries of Romania and Ukraine was signed  today in Bucharest by Gheorghe Tinca and Vitaliy Radetskyy, the  heads of the military departments of the two countries. [passage  omitted]    During the talks, issues of regional safety were discussed  in  depth, Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy  said in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. We believe  that the proposal in the sphere of ensuring regional safety,  which President Leonid Kravchuk made in Budapest last year, and  the "Partnership for Peace" program are interconnected. The  adoption of the Ukrainian proposal may become the first step in  tackling the problems of the "Partnership for Peace".    We regard talk about isolating Russia from these processes  as  unrealistic, the head of the Ukrainian military department  stressed. Russia is a great neighboring state, and a common  historical past unites Ukraine and Russia. We treat Russia with  great respect and are ready for bilateral cooperation with it.    As to the prospects of joining NATO, in accordance with the  decision of the parliament, as is known, Ukraine is not a member  of any bloc. Military-political and military-technical issues  connected with it are being worked on at the moment, and the  Defense Ministry proposals will be submitted to the new  parliament that has the prerogative to make a corresponding  decision.    The territorial issues of North Bukovina, the south of  Bessarabia, and Zmeinyy Ostrov were not raised at the talks in  Bucharest, V.Radetskiy noted. We recognize Romania's  territorial integrity, and Romania fully recognizes the  territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Romanian side stressed  that some would have liked to raise this issue for the purpose  of causing the two neighboring countries to quarrel or of  creating tension between them. However, we must proceed from  the official stand of the heads of state. That is why Ukraine  and Romania do not lay any claims on each other.</p>

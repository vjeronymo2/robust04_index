			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Kerkorian hits out at Chrysler policies Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire US investor who is the biggest shareholder in Chrysler, yesterday launched an attack on the carmaker's anti-takeover defences and said he wanted to raise his stake in the company. In a letter to Chrysler's board yesterday, Mr Kerkorian also called on the company to take steps which would increase the value of the company's shares. These included undertaking a 'meaningful' stock buy-back programme over the next year, raising its quarterly dividend and enacting a two-for-one stock split. The Las Vegas-based investor said he had been rebuffed in his earlier approaches. Chrysler said it would 'consider these requests as it considers the requests of all shareholders'. The company's shares jumped 5 per cent in heavy trading during the morning, lifting Chrysler's market value to Dollars 17bn (Pounds 10.3bn). When Mr Kerkorian first bought his stake of more than 9 per cent in December 1990, the company was in the throes of a financial crisis and was valued at less than Dollars 3bn. Under a poison pill plan adopted in 1990 to ward off Mr Kerkorian, Chrysler's directors could thwart any attempt by an investor to take a stake of more than 10 per cent by giving other investors the right to buy additional shares at half-price. Chrysler said the plan was originally intended 'to act in the best interest of all the company's shareholders if someone should seek to obtain a position of control or substantial influence over Chrysler'. Tracinda, Mr Kerkorian's private investment company, indicated that it would seek approval under US anti-trust law to take its stake in the carmaker to as much as 15 per cent. A week ago, a brief announcement by Mr Kerkorian which was filed with the SEC for regulatory purposes, prompted concern among Chrysler shareholders that he was preparing to sell part of his investment, hitting the company's share price. To conserve cash, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 15 cents a share in 1991. This year, with the North American car markets booming, it has raised the dividend twice, to 25 cents. Directors are scheduled to meet on December 1 to agree the next dividend payout.</p>

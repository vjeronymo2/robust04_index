			<p>BFN     [Text] Maya Ganiyeva, our correspondent in Uzbekistan, once  again in her reportage returns to the program's theme of spring  floods, but the report is much more alarming than those from  Nizhniy Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don. The fact is that,  specifically because of heavy flooding, the threat of  radioactive pollution hangs over the heavily populated Fergana  Valley of Uzbekistan. Let us hear from Maya Ganiyeva:    [Ganiyeva] I am bringing you this report from the shores of  the mountain river Mayli-Say. The town with the same name in  Kyrgyzstan is situated not far from here. It was founded in the  1930's following the discovery of uranium ores. Its processing  capacities--an enrichment factory and a hydrometallurgical  works-- were soon built. In 1968, when all supplies were  exhausted, they were simply destroyed. Traces remained,  however, just as the burial grounds of radioactive materials  also remained. What is interesting is that there is radioactive  waste in the ground from everywhere, even from Czechoslovakia.    Following the mudslides, heavy rain, and landslides, there  was a real danger of poisonous substances finding their way into  the river. It is swollen to an incredible size here. At any  moment, the water sweeping all around may also wash away the  radioactive tombs. There below is the Fergana Valley. The most  alarming thing is that this whole area, the Syr Darya River that  runs through it, and large regions of Central Asia may become  polluted. That is why the Governments of Uzbekistan and  Kyrgyzstan and the public have sounded the alarm. Even now a  government commission has been set up, and there has been rapid  strengthening of the banks. Hydrological facilities that may  absorb the waters are being planned.    I flew in here with a special international group headed by  Ecosan, the Uzbekistan ecology and health fund. The Ecosan  international fund has brought aid--medical supplies and  disposable syringes--to those hit by the landslides.    My companion is Yusuf Shedemetov, president of the Ecosan  international fund. Yusuf Shedemetovich, what is being done to  avert a disaster?    [Shedemetov] The main task is to bring it to the attention  of  the world community, the leaders of the Central Asian states,  and the governments of this region--all governments. In  addition, it is also necessary to ask the Russian Federation for  help. Many specialists and many leaders of the ministry of that  time worked in this region. They left a lot of traces. Also,  our research here shows that there is still a lack of technical  documentation that would be very useful today for deeper  scientific research. That is why the Academy of Sciences of the  Russian Federation and many ministries, departments, and state  committees could render practical aid.    [Ganiyeva] Yes, it would be a very great mistake if these  blossoming pistachio and apricot orchards were turned into a  mini-Chernobyl. One would like to hope that the efforts of  ecologists and the public will not be wasted and that the valley  will be preserved for life.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Agrarian Alliance Chairman Tamas Nagy by </F> Gaspar; place and date not given: "Whom Does the Agrarian Force  Attract?"]    [Text] We are approaching the elections. Not only the  parties and their candidates, but also democracy will face a  test on 8 May. The lines are delineated more and more  spectacularly on the political palette. The parties "squeezed"  between the right and the left, parties that call themselves  liberal, have also "shaken up." As for their chances, we asked  the head of one of the parties forming the group of four -- the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young  Democrats [FIDESZ], the Agrarian Alliance, and the  Entrepreneurs' Party -- namely Agrarian Alliance Chairman Tamas  Nagy.    [Nagy] The Agrarian Alliance caused a positive surprise,  because it has 134 individual candidates. Our forces are  proportionally divided all over the country, and our strongest  group is in western Hungary. This is very important for us.  This is a tremendous change compared with 1990, because we were  weak in this area at that time. Although I count on a close  struggle, if we do well in the campaign, we will be able to  participate in Parliament as a government party.    [Gaspar] In the opposition or in the coalition?    [Nagy] I think a coalition should be formed on the basis of  the programs. The essence of the four-party agreement signed  recently was to make our group work stronger and work out a  joint action program that we can present to the voters: If the  voters show confidence in this group, or a party within this  group, we will take a stand in favor of such a concept.    [Gaspar] One hears that you also discussed the possibility  of getting in touch with the socialists or rejecting this.    [Nagy] No, this is not correct. We were laughing at the  fact that we said it for the fifth time that only elections were  coming up, and everyone tells his alliance preferences during  elections. The aforementioned four parties are together. We  also said that we do not exclude the possibility that we can  show a considerable force. From this moment on, the question is  who will arrive in our group, and not with whom will the SZDSZ,  the FIDESZ, or the Agrarian Alliance go.    [Gaspar] In other words, all for one, and one for all.    [Nagy] We are trying to take a common stand. We will  probably sign a contract on this. If we succeed in coming to an  agreement on a coalition, this group will attract someone. It  is possible that we will not be successful in the elections, but  we will nevertheless try to take a common stand. We would like  to get enough votes to determine the coalition talks. This bloc  received close to 1 million nomination slips.    [Gapsar] In your view, what is the cooperation between the  parties like?    [Nagy] My opinion is that there is always a possibility for  cooperation between democratic parties. The Agrarian Alliance  will conduct a policy that leads to a strong and capable  government. I do not think it is wise to exclude democratic  parties, parties that accept the rules of the game and act  accordingly. It is another matter what Viktor Orban, Ivan Peto,  or Tamas Nagy feel personally.... Because none of these  parties is made up of one person, but bodies that make decisions  and approve the results of coalition talks. Politicians allow  themselves a lot of things, but not hysterics or personal  gossip! This is our position and this is also stipulated by our  coalition guidelines.</p>

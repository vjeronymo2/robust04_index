			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to include as a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative standard the requirement that an institution have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no outstanding liabilities owed to the Secretary unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution has made satisfactory arrangements to repay those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities and is honoring those arrangements. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that unless a participating institution demonstrates it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has met all its programmatic, contractual, and fiscal obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the past, and has taken positive steps to rectify problems and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities in the past, there is no reason to presume that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution has the capability and willingness to administer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs responsibly in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to take into account whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant problems have been identified in final reports and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations issued by the Secretary, the OIG, accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, SPREs, guaranty agencies, and State authorizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies and findings in criminal, civil, or administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings, in addition to financial and compliance audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports and program review reports, in assessing an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability. The Secretary believes that pertinent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information from any of the agencies or proceedings identified is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant to determining whether an institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively capable. An institution should be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively capable only if there is no evidence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant problems in those reviews or proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability standards, the prohibition against debarments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspensions, and causes of debarment or suspension under E.O.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12549 and the FAR, 48 CFR subpart 9.4. The Secretary proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend this section to provide that an institution would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered administratively capable if (1) cause exists for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debarring the institution under 34 CFR 85.305, or for suspending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution under 34 CFR 85.405, (2) any principal (as that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term is used in 34 CFR part 85) of the institution is debarred or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended, or (3) the institution is an affiliate (as that term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is used in 34 CFR part 85) of any person so debarred or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended. Under these changes, the Secretary would not certify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the administrative capability of an institution that fits into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of these categories. The Secretary would not permit such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to begin participation in a Title IV, HEA program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Secretary would require a participating institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rectify the problem that adversely affects the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability. A participating institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inability or unwillingness to rectify the problem would warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiation of an emergency action, limitation, suspension, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination proceeding against the institution under subpart G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary expects that such a proceeding would be combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a debarment or suspension proceeding under 34 CFR part 85.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect the Title IV, HEA programs when serious questions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised about the honesty and lawfulness of the conduct of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's owners, officers, directors, management, employees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or affiliates whose duties involve the administration of or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence over those programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require that an institution comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any standards regarding completion and placement rates and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pass rates on State licensing examinations established by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State in which an institution is located as a standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability. The Secretary supports the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of appropriate standards by each State, as individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States will be able to address local concerns and conditions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the development of standards. In the absence of such a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, the Secretary believes an institution must comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate standards regarding completion rates, placement rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pass rates on required State examinations, as established by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary, in consultation with institutions located in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require as a standard for full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs that institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have default rates that do not exceed 20 percent for the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, and default rates that do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not exceed 15 percent for the Federal Perkins Loan program. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal SLS programs, a 20 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trigger is currently used as an indicator of impaired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability. For the Federal Perkins Loan program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary has used a 20 percent trigger as an indicator of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impaired administrative capability. The Secretary is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to change this figure to 15 percent for consistency with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory requirement of section 461(g) of the HEA that requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution with a cohort default rate of 15 percent in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Perkins Loan program to establish a default management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan pursuant to regulations. Under this proposal, institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying for participation under a change of ownership or for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewal of their participation with default rates exceeding these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed amounts would be provisionally certified for a lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability if no other serious administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability problems were identified that warranted denying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. The Secretary notes that, under this proposal, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution applying for a renewal of participation that has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default rate under the Federal Stafford Loan programs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds 20 percent could submit information demonstrating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigating circumstances as provided in &sect;668.15 of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to demonstrate that the institution's default rate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a basis for denial of full participation. If no other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious administrative capability problems were identified that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warrant denying the application for full participation, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution with default rates over these triggers could receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full participation if it successfully showed that those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigating circumstances existed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

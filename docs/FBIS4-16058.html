			<p>BFN     [Text] Gennadiy Burbulis, president of the Humanitarian and  Political Center "Strategy," said at a meeting with the public  in the Central House of Cinematographers that the capture of the  Kuril Islands was an aggression by Stalin.    In his view, Russians should come to terms with the need to  give these islands back to Japan, sooner or later.    In his view, none of the democratic politicians are an  attractive or constructively uniting figure for the 1996  presidential elections. For this reason Boris Yeltsin could run  for reelection under the proviso, however, that he "shows in no  uncertain terms where his social support lies, seeks support  from specific organizational/political structures and sheds the  role, adopted over recent years, of charismatic leader of the  nation who is supposed to be fully aware of what is going on in  the nation and can rely on its support at any time."    Burbulis said that Boris Yeltsin had a realistic chance to  become a strong president, a head of state. For his part,  Burbulis would work for creating a base of support for the  president.    In Burbulis's words, "today Yeltsin remains a major source  of  stability in the country and we, while reproaching him justly,  must give him sufficient backing for our own good."    Burbulis said that while the formation of a political party  by Yegor Gaydar was a historically legitimate idea he also  believed that this idea led nowhere.    He explained that the new party would rely too much on the  confrontation and denunciation that had worked in the past.</p>

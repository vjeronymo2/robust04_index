			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: A savings option that paid off - Serious Money WHEN the First Option Bond was launched in July 1992, the pound was still in the Exchange Rate Mechanism and base rates were 10 per cent. Those who rushed to buy the bond in its early weeks (provoking howls of protest from the building societies) can pat themselves on the back. They have earned 10.34 per cent gross, or 7.755 per cent net, over the year and have been able to gloat while their friends and neighbours suffered the fall in building society rates to 6 per cent and below. Bonds start to mature on July 7. National Savings will be writing to holders to tell them that the rate for the coming year will be 6.34 per cent gross, or 4.75 per cent net. Anyone with Pounds 20,000 invested, including last year's interest, can earn a bonus of 0.4 per cent gross (0.3 per cent) net if the bond is held for another year. Holders who want to earn that return need take no action; your money will be automatically reinvested. If you want to cash in your bond, complete the form on the back and send it to National Savings in Glasgow. It is possible to earn more than the new First Option bond. Britannia Building Society is offering 6.75 per cent gross on investments of over Pounds 1,000; the rate is guaranteed for 13 months, after which investors can withdraw their money without penalty (but not before then). As our Best Rates table shows (on Page VI), higher returns can be earned from variable rate accounts. You can earn over 7 per cent on gilts, if you are prepared to hold the bond for five years, and you do not mind turning part of your capital into income. If you want more than 8 per cent, you have to look at gilts with a maturity of 10 to 15 years. If you are a firm believer that inflation is conquered, and you believe the government will control the budget deficit, then 8 per cent offers a very healthy real return. Of course, those are two big 'ifs'. In April 1992 and January this year, I wrote about a simple stock-picking theory devised by Michael O'Higgins, a US fund manager. Take the ten highest yielding stocks in the Dow-Jones Industrial index and select from them the five with the lowest share prices. You hold these stocks for a year, and repeat the process, discarding those which no longer meet the criteria. O'Higgins found that between 1973 and 1991, a portfolio selected using the theory made an annual average return of 19.4 per cent, against 10.4 per cent from the Dow. Applying this theory to the FT-30 index in the UK over the period 1979 to 1992, annual returns were 22 per cent, compared with 17.5 per cent from the All-Share. At the start of the year, the theory threw up Blue Circle, British Gas, Forte, Hanson and Lucas. The good news is that so far this year, the theory has worked. Up to June 30, the shares made the following returns: Blue Circle, up 26.6 per cent; British Gas, up 2.2 pc; Forte, up 20.7 pc; Hanson, down 3 pc; and Lucas, up 3 pc. The average is 9.9 pc, compared with 5 pc for the All-Share. Of course, the above calculations do not allow for costs, but nor do they allow for the higher than average dividend yields which the selected stocks should pay. Readers should be aware of many caveats. A small portfolio of stocks will inevitably be volatile; just because the theory worked in the past does not mean it will in the future; and the above stocks are not the FT's recommendations. Coincidentally, Michael O'Higgins was in London this week. He had distinctly gloomy views about the prospects for world stock markets, believing we are due for a big fall in the US market, with the Dow Jones Index dropping from its 3500 to somewhere around 2200 over the next 12 months. O'Higgins believes that the investments where money will be made over the next 12 months are gold, oil, resource-based economies such as Latin America and Australia and selling short major stock markets such as the US and Japan. Why does he hold these views? He believes the US market is expensive, in terms of key statistics such as p/e ratios, price-to-asset ratios and dividend yields. There are long periods in history, he argues, when corporate earnings have increased but stock prices have gone nowhere because price-earnings ratios have declined. Someone who bought shares in 1929 would have still been behind 25 years later. Admittedly, O'Higgins is only a small manager by US terms with Dollars 150m under management. But he can cite a strong record, with his median fund up 115.6 per cent over three years, compared with 32 per cent for the median US equity fund. O'Higgins has launched a Bahamas-based fund, Mabrecose, for non-US investors but the minimum investment is a hefty Dollars 1m. Certainly, there are other commentators who are worried about stock prices (see Barry Riley's Long View on Page I). Even if they are not as gloomy as Michael O'Higgins, cautious investors can certainly afford to wait before switching their funds into equities.</p>

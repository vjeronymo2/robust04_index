			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Technology: US brewers go alcohol free - The reasons why American companies are intent on developing the fastest growing part of the beer market After a late start in the non-alcoholic brewing business, American beer companies are catching up fast with their European competitors as a result of a determined drive. Until 1989, the US non-alcoholic beer market was occupied almost exclusively by European imports. A few years ago, Heileman, Miller and Anheuser-Busch marketed their first non-alcohol products, and the US brewers have been swiftly and single mindedly gaining market share at home ever since. As a result, all the chief US groups now offer non-alcoholic beers. Coors and Stroh launched their own brands last year, and even small American brewers are starting to get in on the act. The reason for the new love affair with non-alcoholic brews can be simply stated: the fact is that in a stagnant market, non-alcoholic and low-calorie beers are expected to provide the only real growth in the industry during the next few years. 'No-alcohol and low-calorie beer are the only parts of the beer market that are really growing fast,' says Julie Dulow, a spokesperson for Coors. 'The non-alcoholic market is expected to be up 40 per cent next year.' Although that would still represent scarcely a drop in the bucket compared to the overall beer market - non-alcoholic beer accounts for less than 1 per cent of total sales - it may help provide expansion room for an otherwise stagnant industry. The campaign in both Europe and the US against drink-driving and the trend to a healthier lifestyle make non-alcoholic beer a real attraction for consumers. Ron Siebel, a beer market consultant in Chicago, thinks that non-alcoholic beers have an important edge over other non-alcoholic products. 'If you take the alcohol out of beer and you produce it right,' he argues, 'you will have a beverage that will taste like a beer. You can't make a non-alcoholic wine because if you did, you'd have grape juice; and if you had a non-alcoholic spirit you'd have water.' Even if it is granted that non-alcoholic beer may be much easier to make than non-alcoholic wine, American brewing companies have found that taking the alcohol out while leaving the taste in is no mean feat. According to industry standards, non-alcoholic beer must contain less than 0.5 per cent alcohol. In taste tests, consumers still say that non-alcoholic beer often has a sweet or watered-down quality. The technology has been improving, and the American brewers are starting to come up with their own methods. 'The Europeans have been at the (non-alcoholic) game longer, but the Americans have quickly moved to the cutting edge of new technologies in the market,' said Joseph Owades, a technical beer consultant who credits himself with concocting the first light beer in 1967. Stroh has come up with a new, patented method to produce its Old Milwaukee NA brand. The process, enigmatically dubbed the Alfa-Laval Centritherm method, uses centrifugal force to separate the alcohol. One of the problems with non-alcoholic beer has been the unwanted but hitherto seemingly inevitable loss in taste which is a result of the heat which is applied to the mixture during distillation. Stroh's method applies a lower temperature more briefly. Stroh is adamant that the result is a better tasting product. Membrane separation is still considered one of the best methods of production. The process does not rely on heat: instead, it pushes the brewing mixture through a semi-permeable membrane to remove water and alcohol from the beer solids. The mixture is then diluted with de-aerated, carbonated water to attain the desired alcohol level in the finished beer. As membrane technology is constantly being perfected, many people in the industry believe it represents the shape of the future. 'Membrane technology will become more important,' says Hugo Patino, director of brewing research and development for Coors. 'Of course, the real goal is to have a membrane that would be selective only for alcohol, but that's hard.' One important variation upon the membrane technique is what is known as a 'dialysis system'. After separating the alcohol and water from the beer mixture through the membrane, the alcohol and water go through a distillation column which removes the alcohol alone. The same water is then put back into the beer mixture. The idea behind the dialysis system is that many of the 'taste' molecules which are flushed out with the alcohol would be replaced with the old water at the end of the process. However, this technique is largely experimental, and has not yet been embraced by any of the large manufacturers. The main problem with membrane technology is its high cost. Membrane technology requires heavy initial investment in plant. Only the largest brewer in the US, Anheuser-Busch, which accounts for 44 per cent of total US beer sales, uses the membrane method for its non-alcoholic product. Switching to membrane technology would be feasible for most of the other larger brewers - the cost of making the beer is, after all, not so high compared with the cost of marketing. For smaller brewers, however, it is out of the question. One popular lower-cost method is to control fermentation. Several variations on the technique exist. One is to use selective yeasts which do not produce as much alcohol; another is to keep the brew at a very low temperature in order to arrest fermentation. Coors and Miller both use this method for the production of their non-alcholic brands. During the last few years, small breweries in the US have been enjoying something of a comeback. For them, many of the new technologies are too costly to seriously consider. One new method, though, is gaining in popularity. To produce a non-alcoholic beer, many of these small-time brewers are simply producing a very concentrated malt mixture, which is later diluted with carbonated water. Some analysts are enthusiastic about this new process. 'Using this method,' said Mr Siebel, 'it is possible to vary your color levels and bittering in the finished beer.' Others are not so sure. 'It doesn't taste that much different than pouring beer into a glass at home and adding carbonated water to it,' says Mr Patino of Coors. Non-alcoholic beer is proving too important a market for US brewers to ignore it, whatever the cost issues may be in the short term. The big beer companies can be expected to continue their quest for the perfect non-alcoholic beer, and with the new technologies, the final product is constantly improving. Yet for all the investment in new methods, the market has not yet achieved a non-alcoholic beer that tastes exactly like the real thing.</p>

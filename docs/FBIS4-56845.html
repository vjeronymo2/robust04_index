			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 May (NA) -- Today, Vice Foreign  Minister Fernando Petrella warned that Argentina "cannot  maintain a rigid position" regarding the draft Pharmaceutical  Patents Law, at least "on the basis of the current situation."  He made it clear that his evaluation is "entirely personal."    Petrella told a radio station that Brazil reached "an  agreement, which has yet to be formalized, with U.S. authorities  with an eye to making its position more flexible." He added:  "This topic must be decided by the incoming Brazilian  Government."    Regarding "concrete points," Petrella warned that "the  interests of local laboratories must be taken into account as  they have been operating in accordance with a modus vivendi that  is permitted by the current law. The interests of the consumer  have also been considered." He ratified his "confidence" that  the Argentine Congress "will come up with a law that will  harmonize all interests."    Referring to Argentina not being included on the list of  nations to be sanctioned, Petrella stressed that the U.S.  Government "made an important political gesture that reveals its  good relations and rapport" with Argentina.    He said: "This is an important topic, but it is not  extremely  important," while emphasizing that "these excellent relations  must not be impaired, especially at this time when they are  based on strategic viewpoints that are much more difficult to  achieve." He added: "These are small steps that Argentina can  take to attenuate the situation."    The vice foreign minister stressed that our country "has a  well-defined position" regarding the conflict over the  continental glaciers, adding that "the idea of arbitration" has  reached Chile. "From what I know and from Argentina's  viewpoint, there have been no feelers regarding this new  possibility," Petrella said.    Finally, regarding the sending of Argentine Border Police to  the former Yugoslavia, Petrella said: "There are a number of UN  demands of which Argentines can be very proud, especially the  Armed Forces."</p>

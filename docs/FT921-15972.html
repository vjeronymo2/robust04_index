			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Beijing reformers keep anxious eye on Moscow: How China, like Russia and Ukraine, is facing some difficult economic choices CHINA is anxiously watching reaction in Russia and Ukraine to the shock therapy of freeing prices from state control, one of the main pillars of centralised communist economic planning. There has been little official comment here but media coverage has emphasised Moscow's empty shelves and desperate queues, contrasting them with reports of mid-winter plenty in Beijing and images of the city's well-stocked stores and street stalls. Fear of civil unrest in the old Soviet empire spilling over its borders is a major worry for China, which has hastened to establish diplomatic relations with Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine and Tajikistan. Full diplomatic relations with Kirgizia were established on Sunday, giving it formal ties with all the former Soviet republics on China's border. However, Beijing's concerns go beyond that. Economic reformers in the government are uncomfortably aware of the need to bite harder on the bullet of economic reform and so run the risk themselves of adverse reaction and civil unrest. Economic reform in China has gone much further than under the communists in the old Soviet Union, especially in the agricultural sector. Moscow is only now putting forward serious proposals to give Russian farmers freedom to work the land for themselves and the incentive of private profit, while China ended the collectivisation of agriculture some 10 years ago. Freed to work their own piece of land and eager to get rich, the peasants ensured that food flowed on to the market in sufficient quantities to keep the gap between free market prices and state prices narrow. There was little opportunity for black-marketeers to buy out state stocks to resell at outrageously inflated prices on the free market, as has happened in Russia and Ukraine. More than 52 per cent of prices for Chinese farm produce are now market regulated. Even prices for grain and edible oil, heavily subsidised by the state, have been raised. Fears that the move would bring civil unrest proved groundless but further cuts in subsidies, on housing as well as staple foods, could mean trouble. The official news agency, Xinhua, argued recently that prices should reflect market supply and demand. Price stability did not mean prices would never change and people were beginning to accept that, the agency claimed. Paradoxically the privatisation of state-run agriculture, by boosting food supplies has helped shore up communist power. By contrast the state-run industrial sector, the backbone of China's socialist system, is in a parlous state. It cries out for reform decisions as drastic, and as risky, as those just taken in Moscow and Kiev. Government officials here make no secret of the desperate state of the bulk of China's 10,000 state-owned industrial enterprises. Heavily overmanned and producing goods no-one wants to buy, they have built up huge stockpiles and massive debts. Every year they eat up billions of dollars in state subsidies  -more than goes to education or the military. One third of them are losing money. Communist party leader, Jiang Zemin, said recently the revival of the state sector was vital economically and to the 'status of the public ownership economy and the solidity of the entire socialist system.' Some economists say the patient is so sick there is no hope of recovery. Last year for the first time in more than 40 years, less than half industrial output (45.6 per cent) came from the state sector. Kickbacks, malpractice, corruption, embezzlement, expensive favours to retired cadres and lavish wining and dining by those still in the job, compound hefty losses. The semi-official China News Service candidly reported no lack of criminal cases of swindling public institutions out of several hundred thousand or even several million yuan. To talk of reforming this rotting system, the main source of state financial revenues and the biggest employer of industrial labour, is one thing. Implementing reform is another, very risky business. State industrial workers enjoy lifetime employment. Housing, free health care, kindergartens, schools, leisure facilities and subsidised rice all come with the job. Profits and productivity come second to basic welfare, in a system designed to ensure quiescent workers and political stability. Beijing wants every province in China to commit itself to closing 10 of its large, loss-making operations. No province has yet complied, fearing factory closures will lead to unrest from laid-off workers. Bankruptcy was first allowed by law in China in 1988, but it has so far taken its toll of only a handful of small collectives. Some provinces are experimenting with giving enterprises hire and fire rights. In some cases the state is guaranteeing to buy only half a factory's output or supply half its raw material, leaving the management to fight for a place in the market by making goods which will sell, or go under. If the state sector continues to ail while private business continues to prosper and grow, what will remain of socialism in China? Like Russia and Ukraine, China is also faced with a choice: economic growth or continued subsidies to a bankrupt and unworkable system.</p>

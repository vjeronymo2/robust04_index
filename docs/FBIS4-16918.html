			<p>BFN     [Text] Initially scheduled for Thursday [21 April] in  Krasnodar, a meeting of North Caucasian and Abkhazi leaders has  been postponed indefinitely. As Interfax has learned from the  Krasnodar- based organizing committee, the meeting was put off  because of the Russian Foreign Ministry's insistence on getting  the Georgian leadership's consent for such an assembly first.    Meanwhile, as an Interfax correspondent reports, at a  conference in Krasnodar on April 16-17, the working groups of  experts drafted for the upcoming meeting a political statement  on the mechanism for the functioning of peacekeepers in Abkhazia.</p>

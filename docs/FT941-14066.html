			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei continues to rise as Bangkok retreats 4.2% Receding uncertainty over the passage of the political reform bill through the upper house encouraged investors, and share prices gained ground in active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 144.52 up at 19,183.92 after a day's low of 19,025.70 and high of 19,341.73. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 9.64 at 1,550.79 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.40 higher at 1,283.99. Although the Nikkei index temporarily lost momentum in the morning, the upper house committee vote supported sentiment. Yesterday's approval by the committee set the bill up for a vote in the upper house, indicating that the government is one step closer to moving on to making economic decisions. European investors bought actively during the morning session, triggering small-lot buying by domestic investors. 'Buying by foreigners was probably this year's most active,' said an analyst. Traders said some funds were flowing into the stock market from the sluggish bond market. Afternoon sales by Japanese dealers were countered by overseas demand. 'Japanese investors are cautiously choosing individual stocks,' said Mr Yutaka Nakai at Daiwa Securities. He said corporate selling ahead of the March book closing would remain small while share prices were advancing. Volume amounted to 550m shares, rising above the 500m level for the first time since December 10. Advances led declines by 537 to 486, with 164 issues unchanged. Banking shares were bought by overseas investors underweight in the sector. Sumitomo Bank rose Y70 to Y2,170 and Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y100 at Y3,070. Other financial stocks were also strong, with Nikko Securities up Y20 to Y1,220 and Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance adding Y30 at Y1,260. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, rising Y11,000 to Y855,000, posted its 16th consecutive gain, while foreign investors supported East Japan Railway, which moved up Y8,000 to Y491,000. Nippon Kayaku jumped Y68 to Y812 and Takara Shuzo rose Y50 to Y790 on speculation that the companies' immunosuppressant drug will be marketed in Europe. Hanwa, the steel trader whose stock was suspended on Wednesday after an announcement of the resignation of its president and large investment losses, was left untraded due to a lack of buyers. The stock remained offered at Y677, down by its daily limit of Y100. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 89.54 to 21,003.56 in volume of 68m shares. Roundup Many of the region's markets fell back yesterday. BANGKOK dropped by 4.21 per cent as institutions sold finance and property shares. The SET index lost 61.44 to 1,398.3 in turnover of BT13.4bn. Sentiment was affected by worries about tighter liquidity following the rise in the overnight interbank rate.

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sheriff at Pounds 312,000 Sheriff Holdings, the USM-quoted plant hire group, is cutting its dividend from 5.1p to 1.5p, a move which Mr Richard Dunn, chairman, said reflected current performance, prevailing market conditions, and longer term requirements. Pre-tax profit in the year to September 30 dived from Pounds 1.08m to Pounds 312,000, and Mr Dunn said he did not anticipate any overall increase in hire activity for another 12 or 18 months. Turnover fell to Pounds 9.15m (Pounds 10.1m). Revenue from the hire of equipment, the core business, was maintained at 99 per cent of the previous year's level of activity, but revenue from sales diminished substantially. Earnings per share came to 3.4p (11.3p). The final dividend is 0.75p (3.2p).</p>

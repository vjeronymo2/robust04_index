			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> D.C. MAN IS EXPECTED TO TESTIFY THAT BARRY USED CRACK IN 1988  </P> <P> District of Columbia employee James L. McWilliams has reached an agreement with  federal prosecutors and is expected to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor  drug offense and tell a grand jury that he was present at the Ramada Inn when  Mayor Marion Barry smoked crack cocaine, sources have told the Washington Post.  </P> <P> The agreement, which could pave the way for perjury and other felony charges  against the mayor, was concluded Monday at the office of U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Jay B. Stephens, the sources said.  </P> <P> Barry, who was arrested on a drug charge Jan. 19, previously denied to a  federal grand jury that he had used crack with Charles Lewis during visits to  the Ramada Inn in December, 1988. The mayor's office declined to comment late  Monday.  </P> <P> McWilliams, 57, a former assistant attorney general of the Virgin Islands and  longtime friend of Lewis, was present with Lewis and Barry at the Ramada the  night of Dec. 19, 1988, and has long been considered a potentially crucial  witness against Barry.  </P> <P> McWilliams is prepared to tell the grand jury that he was present in Lewis'  hotel room when Barry arrived, and that he saw Barry and Lewis enter the  bathroom together, according to sources. From the context of their  conversation, McWilliams told prosecutors, it was clear that Barry and Lewis  had entered the bathroom to smoke crack -- which McWilliams knew Lewis had  obtained for the mayor's use. McWilliams said that he was watching TV while the  two were smoking the drugs, the sources said.  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / London United claims rising Claims on the insurance subsidiaries of London United Investments, the financial conglomerate which crashed four years ago, could climb to Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 6.9bn), according to the companies' administrators. Insurance liabilities faced by the subsidiaries - known as the KWELM companies - have increased to Dollars 6.2bn, compared with Dollars 4.7bn a year ago. An additional reserve - a so-called 'special margin'  - has also been increased by Dollars 900m to Dollars 4.6bn. The insolvency of the KWELM companies is regarded as the biggest in the history of the insurance industry. The companies underwrote relatively high risk liability business, specialising in the insurance of North American companies and professionals against legal awards. Most of the business was written through HS Weavers (Underwriting) Agencies between 1972 and 1990. Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, administrators of the insolvency scheme, said 'recent developments in the US liability market' were responsible for the higher losses. The companies had been hit by legal awards against the manufacturers of silicon breast implants and against accountants, as well as by asbestos and pollution-related actions, said Mr Hughes. Despite the increased liabilities, the administrators expect eventually to be able to pay 40 cents for each dollar claimed, the same percentage payout estimated a year ago. 'We have collected some Dollars 90m more cash than we forecast last year, reflecting good progress with reinsurers,' explained Mr Hughes. The administrators have set aside Dollars 563m as a first payment to creditors. Payments will be made by September 30. Claimants on policies sold by Kingscroft Insurance and El Paso Insurance will receive 8 cents in the dollar. Those on Lime Street will receive 9 cents, on Walbrook 4 cents and on Mutual Reinsurance 5 cents.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPTIMISM PUSHES TOKYO STOCKS TO 3RD RECORD CLOSE  </P> <P> Share prices rose to a record close for the third consecutive day Wednesday on  continued optimism at the start of a new imperial era.  </P> <P> The Nikkei index rose 136.94, or 0.44%, to 31,143.45. It surged 328.12 to the  previous record close of 31,006.51 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Nikkei has already put on 933.91 points, or 3.09%, this week.  </P> <P> "At the moment there is no doubt the market is very infused with the new era  and that all sorts of stocks are going up," said Michael Cutbill, a fund  manager at Bank of Tokyo Touche Remnant Asset Management Ltd.  </P> <P> "We've got a major bull market on hand," he said.  </P> <P> Emperor Hirohito died Saturday, and the new imperial era began the next day.  </P> <P> Volume was a strong 1.4 billion shares against 1.5 billion the day before, and  buying was broad-based, with winners outpacing losers 9 to 5.  </P> <P> Securities house, pharmaceutical, bank, non-life insurance, railway and bus,  rubber, service, electrical, retail and mining shares led the gains.  </P> <P> Oil, gas, credit and lease, rolling stock, real estate, communications,  electric power, shipping, construction and non-ferrous metal stock led the  declines.  </P> <P> "People are thinking brokers will come out with new sales campaigns for the new  era," said Jeff Bahrenburg, a market strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.  </P> <P> "That will give the market, over the next month, an upward bias of about 10%,"  he said.  </P> <P> The sudden surge brought in some profit takers this morning, bringing the index  down 102.63 to the day's low of 30,903.88.  </P></p>

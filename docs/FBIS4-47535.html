Zabotina </F> et al; Scientific Research Institute of Biotechnology, Moscow,  Oncological Scientific Center, Russian Academy of Medical  Sciences, Moscow UDC 578.7 4 [Signed to press 4 Apr 93]    [Abstract] The aim of the study was production of  monoclonal antibodies and their fragments against Thym-1 antigen  in order to develop, on their base, a diagnosticum, for  immunohistological study of tumors of the peripheral nervous  system, to produce a preparation for visualization of these  tumors and to explain the role of this antigen in proliferative  processes. Highly purified antibody ICO-10 IgM class against the  Thy-1 antigen of thymocytes was produced and descri bed. The  yield from 1 ml of of ascite was 5.3 + or - 1.6 mg. Hydrolysis  of the monoclonal antibody by pepsin produced a fragment of  molecular class 150-250 KD with 20 percent yield. Fragments were  stable and preserved antigen-binding activity after  modifications. Hydrolysis of the monoclonal antibody by trypsin  produced fragments with molecular mass of 400 and 600 KDa with  50 percent yield. IgM fragments were tested on cells by  cytofluorimetry. The antigen determined by ICO-10 was expressed  by 5 percent on hyman thymocytes, by 45 percent on mouse  thymocytes and by 35 percent on EL-4 cells.

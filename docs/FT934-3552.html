			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wellman incurs loss of Pounds 527,000 Wellman, the specialist engineer, swung from profits of Pounds 321,000 to losses of Pounds 527,000 pre-tax for the six months to the end of September. The deficit took account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 253,000, being directors' compensation for loss of office. A 26 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 9.87m resulted from the timing of contract deliveries at the furnace and process engineering companies. The directors said second half sales would be higher as large contracts fell due for delivery. Margins, however, would be lower. The order book at Pounds 17.5m was Pounds 6.5m higher than a year earlier. Losses per share emerged at 1.8p, compared with earnings of 0.5p. As an indication of confidence in future profitability the interim dividend is held at 0.3p.</p>

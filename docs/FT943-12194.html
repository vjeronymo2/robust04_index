			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switch benefits Wellcome Pharmaceutical group Wellcome rose 10 to 644p as it responded to firm US buying with investors said to be switching out of UK sector leader Glaxo. The move was seen as a response to the positive underlying tone of the most recent interim trading report from Wellcome and the legal problems which bedevil Glaxo. Wellcome last week reported sales of its best-selling drug, the anti-herpes treatment Zovirax, ahead 15 per cent in the 10 months to the end of June. However, there had been confusion over the figures as the company had changed its accounting period to a calendar year end and the shares had been initially marked down. Subsequent press comment suggested that, if Wellcome failed to exploit the over-the-counter market for Zovirax, other cash-rich groups might see it as a plausible takeover target. Glaxo faces the threat of generic competition to its Zantac ulcer drug. The shares fell 6 to 568p in the wake of Friday's legal claims and counter claims over the plan by Novopharm of Canada to sell generic Zantac pills based on Form 1 of the medicine.</p>

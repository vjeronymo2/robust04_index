			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has asked  Strobe Talbott, U.S. assistant secretary of state, for his  country's assistance in fighting corruption, given this struggle  cannot be waged within the limits of Venezuela alone and  requires the support of major countries to efficiently combat  it. Corruption at home sometimes has implications abroad, the  official has said.    Will the extradition of those who have committed offenses be  discussed? a reporter asked. It is still too early to talk  about that, but I congratulate you for your imagination, Escovar  replied during the departure of the U.S. retinue of top  officials comprising Joan Spero, assistant secretary of state  for economic affairs, and Alexander Watson, assistant secretary  of state for inter-American affairs, and Ambassador Jeffrey  Davidow.    The interior minister also discussed with them certain  topics  related to the problem of the governability of Venezuela and  Latin America, because in Venezuela, in his words, we have a  demonstration of what an ungovernable democracy is. "I told them  that we did not have an economic crisis in Venezuela but,  rather, the floundering of institutions, the floundering of  governability, and that is the challenge this government is  facing."    Increasing cooperation with the United States is  indispensable. We face common challenges, Escovar said,  regarding the defense of democracy, in addition to something  that is very important: the need for major countries'  cooperation in fighting corruption. We need international  cooperation, because we want to chase certain crimes of  corruption out from Venezuelan borders, hence the support we are  requesting from the international community.    U.S. official Talbott talked to reporters about the positive  results of the meeting with the interior minister. [passage  omitted].</p>

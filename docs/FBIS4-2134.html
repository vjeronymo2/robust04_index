			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China's prisons and  reform-through-labor camps maintained good order last year, and  the number of infringements committed by inmates was the lowest  on record since 1984, an official of the Ministry of Justice  said today.    "Only 1.4 per thousand inmates escaped last year," said Jia  Jingping, the spokesman for the ministry, adding that the figure  was one of the lowest in the past 45 years.    Jia said the country's judicial bodies made remarkable  contributions last year in the aspects of reforming criminals to  become useful persons to society and maintaining social  stability.    He stated that "our ultimate goal is to convert criminals by  combining punishment and reform."    China had more than 1,244,000 prisoners by the end of 1993,  with 247,000 of them having their terms reduced on account of  their good behavior in prison. Some 33,000 prisoners were  released on probation in the same period.    Another 34,000 of them were released on bail to receive  medical treatment, he said. More than 301,000 prisoners were  set free in 1993 after they had finished their prison terms.    Jia said China's education-through-labor centers have also  strengthened their work in educating, persuading, and saving  inmates. The inmates are considered to have committed  comparatively less serious offences. The spokesman said China  had 153,000 such inmates, including prostitutes and  drug-addicts, by the end of last year. Some 75,900 of this  category of offenders were set free after they had finished  their terms, and 55,800 had their terms reduced for good  behavior.</p>

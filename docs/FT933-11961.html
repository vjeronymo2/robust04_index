			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Union Discount Union Discount is living proof that financial institutions are at their best when capital is scarce. Having made an ill-judged move into leasing during the bountiful years of the late 1980s, it is now setting a fine example. Cost-cutting, the introduction of a sharper trading style in the money markets and the search for fee income amount to a more convincing strategy than empire-building. It is a shame, then, that the hangover will take time to shake off. With capital still tied up in leasing, the discount house has been unable to take full advantage of favourable money market conditions. Yet selling the rump of leasing assets could result in further losses. Disposing of the Winterflood market-making business earlier this year released capital as well as bringing in cash. That should allow Union to pursue its ambitions in bond arbitrage and futures trading. Fee-based activities such as asset management and consultancy do not require much capital backing, but building these businesses from a small base promises to be an incremental process. If Union can prove its more adventurous trading style will turn in steady profits - and support a dividend - the shares should rise from the current discount to net assets. But its future lies more as a collection of niche businesses than the grand City institution its name implies.</p>

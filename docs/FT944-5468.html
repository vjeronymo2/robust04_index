			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Piech intends to beat five-year plan targets Volkswagen yesterday said it intended to exceed the conservative performance targets in its five-year plan. This contained profit projections which were much lower than many analyst had forecast. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the German motor group, said the plan was based on a much more cautious set of assumptions than VW's previous plans and this was especially true for market share and volume forecasts. He told analysts the figures in its internal plan represented a level which could also be achieved under difficult circumstances. 'Of course, it is our intention to exceed this planning in reality.' VW has not said what the plan contains. The report of the internal figures, believed to contain a pre-tax profit projection for 1995 of about DM890m (Dollars 567m) which was well below market expectations, depressed the share price and led analysts to wonder if the company was playing down the extent of the recovery from heavy losses. This could help create the right climate for more cost-cutting and for government financial inducements to encourage the trading in of old cars. The VW planning document reportedly said the 1995 result could be up to DM200m higher or lower than in the plan, and sales would rise only modestly next year with price rises being difficult to implement. The 1998 turnover target of DM104bn was believed to have been revised to DM100bn in 1999. In 1993, VW made a DM1.94bn net loss on sales of DM76.5bn. Mr Piech said although VW had performed well in the first 10 months, with world sales up by 7 per cent to 2.75m vehicles, a lasting car market upturn was not in sight. This was shown by the way markets had developed in the second half of 1994. He said VW was starting its reconstruction, with only 20 per cent of the intended improvements achieved. Progress had been made in cutting costs and improving quality, but much work lay ahead before VW would be in the forefront of world competition.</p>

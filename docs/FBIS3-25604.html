Radio-Tele Liberte was destroyed early yesterday  morning by the Armed Forces, which stormed the radio station  located at Terre-Nouvelle. After Radio-Tele Liberte was  destroyed, opposition supporters retaliated by killing (Jean  Kamougue-Komo), a member of the Gabonese Democratic Party [PDG].    The government daily L'UNION has reported the death of an  unidentified person at Yayi crossroads, who was killed as the  security forces were destroying a barricade.

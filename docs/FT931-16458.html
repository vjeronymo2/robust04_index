			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Mondeo is unveiled as Ford's first 'world car' FORD unveils today the Mondeo, a large family car, designed to be the US carmaker's first 'world car'. The Mondeo, which will be produced in Europe and North America, has been developed at a cost of around Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.86bn) in Ford's most ambitious programme so far. It will replace the Sierra in Europe, where it goes on sale in March, and the Ford Tempo/ Mercury Topaz in North America, where it will be launched in the first half of 1994. The Mondeo is being positioned in one of the most fiercely contested segments of the European new car market, where it will compete with General Motors' Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, the Volkswagen Passat and the Peugeot 405. This is the segment targeted by Japanese carmakers for their first European-built cars. Nissan, Toyota and Honda are all now producing the Mondeo's competitors at their new UK plants. At the same time, Citroen, the French carmaker, is launching its new Xantia range soon, to replace the BX in this segment and Renault will also replace its ageing Renault 21 model. In Europe the Mondeo will be built at Ford's Genk plant in Belgium, which has a capacity to produce around 440,000 a year. Ford claims the front-wheel-drive Mondeo will be the first car in its class to offer features such as electronic traction control to eliminate wheel spin and adaptive suspension damping to improve ride and handling.

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Ambulance union backs off UNION representatives of ambulance crews yesterday decided not to pursue industrial action over their 1.5 per cent pay offer in spite of a narrow vote in favour of disruption short of a strike. Ms Margaret Dunn of Unison, the chief negotiator, said the turnout in the ballot was just 40 per cent of the 16,000 workers. She said it would be 'irresponsible' to press ahead with industrial action.</p>

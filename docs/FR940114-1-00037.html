			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Provisions for program evaluation, beginning at the planning stage and carrying through implementation and final evaluation, essentially using the same types of data that were used in developing the programs implemented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Managing Traffic Records <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should have an organizational structure in place for effective administration of its traffic records program, at a minimum consisting of the following components: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A permanent Traffic Records Committee, representing the principal users and custodians of the data in the State, that provides administrative and technical guidance. The Committee should be responsible for adopting requirements for file structure and linkage, assessing capabilities and resources, establishing goals for improving the traffic records program, evaluating the program, continuously developing cooperation and support from State and local agencies as well as the private sector, and ensuring that high quality and timely data are available to authorized persons or agencies for appropriate use; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A single state agency with responsibility for coordinating the traffic safety-related data aspects of the various State information systems. This would include ensuring that the necessary data were available for use in safety and analyses; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Professional staff with analytical expertise to perform data analysis for program planning and evaluation, including a basic understanding of data processing as it relates to the use of personal computers (PCs) and the ability to use PC software application packages to perform problem identification and program evaluation tasks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Highway Safety Program Guideline <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 11 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emergency Medical Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should ensure that persons incurring traffic injuries (or other trauma) receive prompt emergency medical care under the range of emergency conditions encountered. Each of the component parts of a system should be equally committed to its role in the system and ultimately to the care of the patient. At a minimum, the EMS program should be made up of the components detailed in this chapter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Regulation and Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should embody comprehensive enabling legislation, regulations, and operational policies and procedures to provide an effective system of emergency medical and trauma care. This legal framework should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Establish the program and designate a lead agency; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outline the lead agency's basic responsibilities, including licensure and certification; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Require comprehensive planning and coordination; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designate EMS and trauma system funding sources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Require data collection and evaluation; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide authority to establish minimum standards and identify penalties for noncompliance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each of these components, which are discussed in different sections of this guideline, are critical to the effectiveness of legislation that is the legal foundation for a statewide EMS system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Resource Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should establish a central lead agency at the State level to identify, categorize, and coordinate resources necessary for overall system implementation and operation. The lead agency should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Maintain a coordinated response and ensure that resources are used appropriately throughout the State; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide equal access to basic emergency care for all victims of medical or traumatic emergencies; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide adequate triage and transport of all victims by appropriately certified personnel (at a minimum, trained to the emergency medical technician [EMT] basic level) in properly licensed, equipped, and maintained ambulances; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide transport to a facility that is appropriately equipped, staffed, and ready to administer to the needs of the patient (section 4: Transportation); and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appoint an advisory council to provide a forum for cooperative action and maximum use of resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Human Resources and Training <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each State should ensure that its EMS system has essential trained human resources to perform required tasks. These personnel include: first responders (e.g., police and fire), prehospital providers (e.g., emergency medical technicians and paramedics), communications specialists, physicians, nurses, hospital administrators, and planners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each State should provide a comprehensive statewide plan for stable and consistent EMS training programs with effective local and regional support. The State agency should: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Ensure sufficient availability of adequately trained EMS personnel; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establish EMT-Basic as the state minimum level of training for all transporting EMS personnel; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Routinely monitor training programs to ensure uniformity and quality control; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

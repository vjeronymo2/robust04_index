			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Honda and Rover heal rift over sale to BMW Honda, the Japanese carmaker, and Rover, the UK subsidiary of BMW of Germany, are to continue collaboration on the development of future car models well into the next decade. The two carmakers announced yesterday that they had signed a series of contracts, which confounded earlier fears that the 15-year alliance between Rover and Honda would be brought to an end by the Pounds 800m takeover by BMW of the leading UK carmaker from British Aerospace earlier this year. Honda will still go ahead with its withdrawal from its 20 per cent equity holding in Rover - expected to be completed next month - but it has agreed to continue long-term co-operation. Honda was initially angry with BAe's sale of Rover to BMW, announced at the end of January, and at the apparent betrayal of the close working relationship that had developed between the two groups. This led to widespread concerns that the move could jeopardise continued Japanese investment in Britain. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said healing the rift was 'good news for the companies, for the UK and for Japanese firms based in this country'. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chief executive and chairman of Rover, said all current supplier and licensing agreements between Honda and Rover would remain intact. Mr Pischetsrieder said work on cars in development would also be completed. This covers the replacements for the current Honda Concerto and Rover 200/400. Mr John Towers, chief executive of Rover, said collaboration would go into other new model generations. It is understood that this could also include the future replacements for the Rover 600 and Honda Accord cars. Mr Towers said that the new agreements 'could take us well to 2006. The way we work together in the future will not be very different to how it has been in the last two to three years'. He said one of the Japanese carmaker's chief concerns had been the access that BMW might gain to Honda technology. This concern had been met by the new agreements with Honda. 'There will be confidentiality walls around what we do with Honda, which will be clearly visible,' said Mr Towers. 'What is sensitive is Honda's intellectual property rights and expertise. It is easy to organise ourselves so that a particular set of products will be confidential to Honda and ourselves. In another sector we may be collaborating with BMW.' Honda is moving towards ensuring its UK production could eventually stand alone, if necessary. It said it was planning to invest in its own 'limited' sheet metal pressing facility at its plant at Swindon. At present, virtually all its sheet metal pressings are supplied by Rover's separate stamping plant at Swindon.

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS ON LEGALIZATION OF SOLIDARITY, POLAND'S FUTURE TO OPEN ON FEB. 6  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Poland's Communist rulers agreed on Friday to  start formal talks on Feb. 6 on the country's future and legalizing the banned  union.  </P> <P> A Solidarity spokesman said the date for "round-table" talks in Warsaw was  worked out at secret discussions Walesa held with Interior Minister Czeslaw  Kiszczak.  </P> <P> "It was agreed that the first meeting of the round-table will take place on  Feb. 6 in Warsaw," spokesman Jacek Ambroziak, a legal adviser to the Roman  Catholic church, told reporters outside the church's headquarters.  </P> <P> "I am happy and very tired," Walesa said after more than 11 hours of talks with  Kiszczak at a government villa in the village of Magdalenka, about 12 miles  south of Warsaw.  </P> <P> They met to make the final preparations for the round-table talks that the  Communist government hopes will forge a national coalition with the opposition  to pull Poland out of economic crisis.  </P> <P> The government offered the talks to Walesa, Roman Catholic church officials and  independent public figures in August during the worst labor unrest since  Solidarity was banned under martial law in 1981.  </P> <P> But Walesa refused to attend unless authorities promised to consider restoring  his banned union, which challenged Communist rule during its 16-month legal  existence.  </P></p>

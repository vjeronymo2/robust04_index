The government is also  forging comprehensive measures for economic advancement into  China, including expansion of trade, promotion of investment and  strengthening of industrial cooperation.    During the president's visit, the first joint committee for  industrial cooperation will meet to discuss the fundamental  principles of industrial cooperation and ways to push ahead with  priority cooperation projects, according to the Ministry.    The top projects will include automobiles, airplanes, time  division exchange (TDX), a type of electronic telephone  exchange, and technology market plans, Ministry officials said.    The government will also increase financial support for the  deferred payment export fund of the Export-Import Bank of Korea,  designed to aid export businesses here, and ease conditions of  such support to expand bilateral trade with China.    Within this year, the Ministry will designate the types of  industries which can benefit from the government's financial and  administrative support when they invest in China, officials said.    The Ministry is also studying establishment of trade offices  in the Chinese cities of Dalian and Chongqing in addition to the  current offices in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as prudent  management of the adjustment tariff and anti-dumping tariff  systems to remove possible sources of trade friction.    South Korea's exports to China increased 165 percent in 1992  and 90 percent last year, and China has become an important  trade partner.    China is now attracting the most South Korean investment,  recording 1 billion U.S. dollars as of last year's end,  officials said.</p>

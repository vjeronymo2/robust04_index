			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch industrial production Industrial production in the Netherlands rose a seasonally adjusted 2.1 per cent in September from a year earlier, according to official figures. Uncorrected output rose 1.8 per cent. However, the seasonally adjusted data indicate a slight month-on-month decline of 0.3 per cent to an index of 119.2 in September from 119.6 in the previous month, due largely to relatively low production in the food, tobacco, alcohol and petroleum sectors. EU industrial production was up in August for the seventh consecutive month, the Eurostat statistical office said yesterday. The production index, adjusted for working days, was up 6.5 per cent compared to the same month a year earlier. Prices of consumer goods and service in Poland rose by 2.9 per cent in October against the previous month, bringing inflation in the first 10 months to 32.4 per cent. The government has been predicting a 32 per cent rise over the year, compared with 35 per cent in 1993.</p>

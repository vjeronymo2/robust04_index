			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Gibbs Mew ahead to Pounds 1.6m as cask ale sales jump 25% Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based brewer and commercial property company, has built upon the revival shown in last time's second half. The USM-quoted group yesterday reported a marked improvement in profits and earnings per share and its first increase in the level of interim dividend since 1990. Profits before tax for the six months to October 2 amounted to Pounds 1.6m, against Pounds 317,000 in the corresponding period and Pounds 1.17m for the last full year. Comparisons were restated for FRS 3. Mr Tom Hedderson, appointed non-executive chairman in October following the death of Mr Peter Gibbs, who had headed the company since 1967, said the group had 'produced real growth and profit despite economic and trading conditions that remain extremely fragile and exceptionally competitive'. The increase, he said, reflected the integration of UK D and the move away from high volume low margin business. Turnover totalled Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 11.8m); adjusted for UK D sales, however, the figure fell by some Pounds 1.5m. The brewery division was the main engine of growth with volume sales of cask-conditioned ales ahead by some 25 per cent. The interim dividend is raised 25 per cent to 3.75p (3p), payable from fully diluted earnings of 16.99p (2.44p).</p>

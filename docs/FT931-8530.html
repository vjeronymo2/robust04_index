			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Mexico reacts defensively to US charges THE Mexican government has reacted defensively to charges by Mr Richard Gephardt, majority leader in the US House of Representatives, that it is financing US companies to move to Mexico, writes Damian Fraser. Mr Gephardt had complained in a letter to President Salinas that the Mexican government development bank, Nafinsa, has taken a 25 per cent stake in a company, Amerimex Maquiladora Fund, that is buying up US companies to move them to Mexico. So far, Amerimex has bought one textile company, and moved 40 per cent of its production to Merida, Mexico. Critics of the proposed Nafta argue that American jobs will be lost, as companies move from the US to Mexico in search of cheap labour.</p>

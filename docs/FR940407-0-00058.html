			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program revisions addressed by Colorado's final application include the first, second, and third third land disposal restrictions, mining waste exclusions, revisions to the Toxicity Characteristic, standards for incinerators, tanks and miscellaneous units, and ground water monitoring. Certain of the land disposal restriction provisions are not delegable to states. EPA is not authorizing Colorado for these non-delegable provisions, which include 40 CFR 268.5; 268.6; 268.42(b); and 268.44. Federal regulations allow exemptions to certain of the land disposal restrictions for certain wastes that are disposed of in injection wells. Since Colorado does not allow the disposal of hazardous waste in injection wells, their program is more stringent that the federal program for these provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the federal land disposal restrictions imposed time-limited prohibitions against land disposal of certain wastes. Since Colorado's date of adoption of these regulatory provisions in many cases was after the time-limited prohibition expired, the Colorado regulations do not include these prohibitions or impose a later effective date for the prohibition than the date set forth in the corresponding federal regulation. These differing dates do not affect the equivalency of Colorado's program, since prior violations of these prohibitions remains enforceable by EPA under federal regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado has not requested hazardous waste program authority on Indian Country. EPA retains all hazardous waste authority under RCRA which applies to Indian Country in Colorado. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I conclude that Colorado's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Colorado is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. Colorado also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Colorado has agreed to submit a draft application for remaining provisions from Non-HSWA Clusters III&hyph;VI, HSWA Clusters I and II, and RCRA Cluster I and partial Cluster II in April 1994. The final application will be submitted within 60 working days of receipt of EPA's comments on the draft application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain federal regulations in favor of Colorado's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 271 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information, Hazardous materials transportation, Hazardous waste, Indian lands, Intergovernmental relations, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water pollution control, Water supply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002(a), 3006, and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, 6974(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jack McGraw,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Regional Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8353 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

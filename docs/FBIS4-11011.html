			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] A few minutes ago COPAZ [National Commission for the  Consolidation of Peace] representatives presented proposals,  already delivered to the Legislative Assembly, for the  constitutional reforms recommended in the peace agreements.  Marcos Balladares, National Conciliation Party representative  to COPAZ, disclosed the result of the consensus COPAZ had  reached to send this proposal to the Legislative Assembly within  the framework of the implementation of constitutional reforms in  our country.    [Begin recording] [Balladares] There are three areas. The  first is in the Judicial Branch. A consensus has been reached  to deliver to the honorable Legislative Assembly that which  concerns judicial issues. That is: the Supreme Court of Justice  should not appoint and dismiss the magistrates and the judges in  the diverse institutions of the Judicial Branch.    Second, the National Council of the Judiciary should be in  charge of making these appointments and these dismissals.    The third point is to review in a bit more detail the  mechanisms of the National Council of the Judiciary's  integration and its duties. This should be done in view of the  new duties that the very National Council of the Judiciary may  be awarded within these constitutional reforms. This is in  relation to the the Judicial Branch, specifically concerning  judges and magistrates. These are the agreements reached by  consensus in COPAZ that have already been delivered to the  Legislative Assembly.    There has also been consensus with regard to the attorneys.  In this regard COPAZ agreed that it should definitely not be  the Supreme Court of Justice that authorizes or suspends  attorneys. This is an issue broadly debated in the diverse  forums of our nation, and COPAZ has basically resolved that it  should not be the Supreme Court of Justice that authorizes or  suspends the attorneys.    On this point, however, COPAZ's proposal goes even further  and is much more practical [words indistinct] indicating that  this is a function equal to the medical profession's oversight  board. This is another issue that has even been analyzed in  other forums and by other institutions, given that the National  Council of the Judiciary's, through its seven oversight boards,  has been very effective in its operation and in its oversight of  the associations. COPAZ considers this should be something  similar to an oversight board that exists in the medical  profession that should have those specific duties with regard to  the attorneys.    As far as due process is concerned, there are some  resolutions that COPAZ had taken that basically consist in  reducing administrative detention provided for in [word  indistinct] second, Article 13, from 62 to 48 hours. As you  know when someone is detained by the administrative authorities,  they have a maximum of 62 hours to be remanded over to the  court. This is what is provided for in the Constitution. That  is, administrative authorities have a maximum of 62 hours for  this. Well, COPAZ's proposal is aimed at reducing this maximum  of 62 hours to a maximum of 48 hours before being handed over to  the court. This is also a resolution made by consensus that we  think will help speed up the administration of justice in our  country.    In another point related to due process in Article 14,  administrative authorities no longer will have the power to  impose sanctions, or [word indistinct] detentions against  individuals. Currently... [pauses] here is a little background.  In the previous Constitution the administrative authority could  impose sanctions -- of course after due process, before a  procedure, and the handing down of a sentence. The  administrative authority previously could order up to 30 days'  detention. The 1983 Constitution reduced this period to 15  days. Therefore, the current Constitution provides that the  administrative authority can impose detentions of up to 15 days.  Well, COPAZ's proposal, through consensus, is that the  administrative authorities can no longer issue any detention  orders.    On this point, COPAZ has been specific and clear that there  is an exception in this regard. This has also been communicated  to the Legislative Assembly. That is, it is proposed that  administrative authorities should not be able to issue detention  orders except in the case of military jurisdiction and in the  case of the National Civilian Police, when internal regulations  are violated in those two institutions.

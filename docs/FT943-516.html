			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japanese exports likely to record another rise Japanese vehicle exports are likely to record a rise again in September, having seen a temporary decline in August, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Jama) said vehicle exports fell 8.8 per cent from a year earlier to 325,174 units in August. In July they edged up 0.3 per cent from a year earlier to 405,578 vehicles, the first year-on-year gain in 15 months. Last month's decline was partly due to higher exports of new Honda Accords to the US in August 1993, Jama said. 'August posted a short-lived decline. Exports in and after September are likely to mark a year-on-year increase again, said Mr Hiroshi Suemasa, a senior analyst at Kankaku Research Institute. However, Nissan reported that August exports marked the first year-on-year decline in three months, due to poor demand in Europe where domestic carmakers boosted their sales by providing incentives. Nissan's vehicle exports fell 11.7 per cent from a year earlier to 45,364 units.</p>

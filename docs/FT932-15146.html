			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Industry beats off radical plans: Tackling market power of dominant companies THE government's decision to do little more than tinker with the present legislation for tackling abuse of market power by dominant companies represents a significant victory for the industry lobby. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, was quick to deny yesterday there had been a government climbdown. It had not 'caved in to industry', he said. But the decision will come as a severe disappointment to businesses used to competing with a dominant player in the market to consumer organisations and to competition lawyers who had all argued for radical reform. But in general industry will welcome yesterday's announcement. The Confederation of British Industry, after extensive consultation with its members, strongly opposed radical change. It told the Department of Trade and Industry: 'If-it-ain't-bust-don't-fix-it.' Radical change was unnecessary and would be very costly for industry, it argued. In the November green paper the government canvassed three options for reform: To retain the existing case-by-case approach under the 1973 Fair Trading Act and the 1980 Competition Act for dealing with anti-competitive practices. Under this option the Office of Fair Trading would have been given stronger investigatory powers and businesses would be made liable for damages and possible civil penalties for continuing abuse. To introduce a general prohibition on abuse of market power based on Article 86 of the Rome Treaty backed by tough investigatory powers for the OFT and fines on companies of up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover. To introduce a general prohibition backed up by fines of up to 10 per cent of worldwide turnover and give the OFT tough investigatory powers, but retain the existing Fair Trading Act provisions for investigating monopolies. At the time of publication the government was thought to prefer option three, seen as the best chance of an effective deterrent while retaining the breadth and flexibility of the existing legislation. Mr Hamilton said yesterday the government had approached the issue with an open mind. There had been no consensus among respondents to the green paper and the government had 'concluded that the regulatory costs which would have arisen from options two and three would have been disproportionate to the gains to consumers.' The government now proposes to strengthen legislation in four ways: wider powers of investigation for the Office of Fair Trading allowing it to search and seize documents in certain circumstances; additional scope for companies to give undertakings to the OFT which can be enforced through the courts; power for the director-general of fair trading to make interim orders prohibiting any further anti-competitive behaviour; and extension of the law to cover some property rights, such as rights of access. The government, however, has dropped the proposal to make companies liable for penalties and damages for continuing abuse. Mr Hamilton said a number of respondents had argued this would be unjust and might lead a company to abandon a practice that was later found not to be against the public interest.</p>

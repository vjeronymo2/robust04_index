			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Educating the patient: The pharmaceutical industry In the sixth century BC Heraclitus said: 'Nothing endures but change.' This is certainly true of the prescription pharmaceutical industry. Today we are witnessing the development of a consumer-led business in prescription medicines. This is a radical transformation from what previously had been a supplier-led business. Thirty years ago, the world of prescription medicines was simple. The pharmaceutical company invented the medicine, the doctor prescribed it, the insurer or the government paid for it. In the 1960s and 1970s, the main markets came, quite rightly, to be regulated by licensing requirements for safety and efficacy. But in a real sense, the industry proposed and the doctor disposed. In those days, once pharmaceutical companies had demonstrated the usefulness, efficacy and safety of a product to the medical community, they were home free. On the whole, patients and payers were passive. Companies talked to the doctors, the doctors talked to the patients and government and third-party providers were content to be silent partners. They were content because the pharmaceutical industry could be depended on to deliver breakthrough after breakthrough. In the 1940s, it was penicillin 6 and streptomycin. In the 1950s, corticosteroids, tetracyclines and anti-depressants. In the 1960s, it was diuretics and the polio vaccine. In the 1970s, beta blockers, H-2 antagonists and calcium channel blockers. In the 1980s, ACE inhibitors, anti-virals and interferon. But breakthroughs are no longer enough. Doctors, patients, governments and third-party providers are no longer content. Their discontent is in spite of the fact that pharmaceutical companies invest 10 years and more than Pounds 100m in every compound they bring to market and are willing to re-invest, on average, 17 per cent of turnover in research and development. What has changed? The answer is simple. Health care costs have exploded from a range of 3 per cent to 6 per cent in 1960, to a high today in the US of 11 per cent of gross national product. As a result, there is a new activism among formerly passive patients and payers to reduce costs - costs that affect them either in direct out-of-pocket expense or increased upward pressure on taxes. The pharmaceutical industry must now demonstrate in no uncertain terms that it provides extraordinary value for health care money spent on medicines. But how does one define value? Clearly, the effective use of prescription medicines generates an obvious and measurable economic value when it keeps people out of hospital and out of the operating room. But the other benefits of drug therapy - enhanced productivity, lower costs to employers, improved quality of life for patients and reduced pressure on health care organisations - are less easy to quantify. But quantify them we must if we are to present a full picture of the value that the pharmaceutical industry provides. Its self-presentation skills are growing. Companies have already begun to develop new ways of communicating with the public both in America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. These include press conferences, media tours, media coverage of symposia, video news releases and discussions with the investment community about new medicines under development. In the US, direct-to-consumer advertising is becoming increasingly common - both in print and on television - with the objective of increasing awareness about disease. There is evidence that this type of advertising works. Direct-to-consumer advertising helps to meet the greater demand for health information prompted by the consumer's increasing awareness of the impact of the cost of care. It alerts consumers to new treatments, especially for conditions that were not previously treatable. It encourages people to seek medical attention. And ultimately it results in a more informed public. This changing environment and these changing needs are not always perceived. There are points here to consider when one looks at the EC's draft directive on advertising for pharmaceuticals. This, in its present form, could prohibit the pharmaceutical industry from reaching European consumers directly through public media for the educative purposes I advocate. I am not suggesting that Europe's airwaves should immediately be filled with brand-name advertisements for prescription medicines. I still have my doubts about brand-name advertising for prescription medicines because I believe that promotional efforts, whatever they may be, must never attempt to interfere with the physician-patient relationship. Rather, communications should encourage the patient to consult a physician about appropriate medical treatment. Educational campaigns in the US - such as Glaxo's on peptic ulcer disease and Pfizer's 'partners in health care' series - have demonstrated their ability to do so. In the new health care environment, education processes must take account of the value and the crucial public good that the pharmaceutical industry provides. Whether those processes are provided through public media or in other ways, the message must reflect the new realities of the pharmaceutical market place. A recent Johns Hopkins University study showed that although well-informed patients were perceived as annoying by most doctors, it was those same patients who received the best care. In the new health care environment, the pharmaceutical industry must realise that part of its job is to educate every patient. If this challenge is met, treatment will improve, compliance will improve and, moreover, the industry's ability to provide the cures that people need and demand will continue to be as strong as it is today.

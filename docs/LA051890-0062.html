			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN FALTERS AGAINST HAWAII PACIFIC IN NAIA AREA 1 BASEBALL PLAYOFF  OPENER, 5-2  </P> <P> A late-inning breakdown proved disastrous for Cal Lutheran in the first game of  the NAIA Area 1 baseball playoffs Thursday.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran was tied with Hawaii Pacific going into the eighth inning but  surrendered three runs in the final two innings to drop a 5-2 decision at the  University of Portland's Farley Field.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 2-2, and one out in the eighth, CLU starter Mike Clark hit  two batters. Reliever Mike Rooney entered and gave up a run-scoring double and  run-scoring single. Rooney gave up another RBI double in the ninth, but Clark  (6-3) got the loss.  </P> <P> "Clark goes 0-2 on two guys trying to bunt, and he hits both of them, and  that's the game," CLU Coach Rich Hill said.  </P> <P> CLU (32-15) put two men on with two out in the ninth, but Hawaii Pacific  (24-19) escaped when the next batter struck out. The Kingsmen scored a run in  the second, when Leonard Matsumoto came home on a throwing error, and in the  sixth, when Blake Babki scored Dave Leonhardt with a two-out single.  </P> <P> CLU will play Whitworth (19-18) of Spokane, Wash., a 4-0 loser to Lewis &amp;  Clark in another first-round game, today at 10 a.m. The Kingsmen must win four  consecutive games to win the championship Saturday. After losing their first  game in the District 3 playoffs last weekend, the Kingsmen rebounded to win the  next four and the title.  </P></p>

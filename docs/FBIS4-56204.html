			<p>BFN     [Text] With Commander in Chief Fidel Castro present, the  morning session of the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP] debated measures by which to correct the  economic situation. Deputy Lazaro Barrero stressed to the plenum  the need for a monetary reform that should include the  confiscation of illegally obtained money, a change in currency,  and the freezing of excessively large bank accounts.    Otto Rivero Torres, president of the Federation of  University  Students, stressed to the ANPP plenum the importance of  increasing control and standards in universities.    Other deputies emphasized greater state control over  enterprises providing essential services to the people, to  prevent the deviation of essential resources required by the  people.    Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers  Federation, saluted Cuban workers in his address to the ANPP  special session that began this morning at the Convention  Palace. Ross stressed that we are observing 1 May by working and  seeking appropriate solutions to the current crisis. Ross went  on to say that in the last two months Cuba has lived a great  event in the realm of labor, the Parliaments in the Workplace.  Ross explained that the matter of correcting the economic  situation was very much present in the debates that took place  in these meetings of workers, which once more demonstrated the  workers' unconquerable faith in the Revolution.    Cuba's economic imbalance, manifested by the 11.636 billion  pesos in excess currency, is the reason that proposals for  correcting the economy are being evaluated.    Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez gave an  address detailing some of the proposals and measures under  study, among them an increase in the prices of certain  nonessential products such as cigarettes and alcoholic  beverages. In the case of cigarettes, the changes will not  affect the present categories of distribution. The new prices  will be two pesos for a regulated pack, six pesos for extra  packs, and 10 pesos for unregulated packs. This will require an  adjustment in production. With reference to alcoholic beverages,  the proposal is to establish differentiated prices according to  their type and category.    The proposals of the minister of finance and prices to the  ANPP special session included a selective increase in prices and  rates for public services. In that sector, to raise the price of  electricity could be an effective method of increasing the  revenues to the government's budget. The study conducted and  presented to the ANPP by Jose Luis Rodriguez proposes charging  nine cents per kilowatt to consumers who do not exceed 100 kw  monthly. The consumers who use between 100 and 300 kw monthly  will pay 20 cents per kilowatt. Consumers who use more than this  amount will be charged 20 cents extra.    Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez explained  that the measures under study to correct the economic crisis  will constantly make allowances for the lower income sector of  the population. The elimination of subsidies to various products  and the allocation of these subsidies to the people in the  lowest income brackets is also under consideration, in order to  enable them to cope with the selective increase of prices in  various sectors. The proposals under study in the ANPP special  session include increasing the current rates for telephones,  postal services, and automotive fuel; the latter could mean  doubling or tripling the present cost per liter. Under  consideration is the possibility of charging entry fees to  specified cultural and sports events, which could convey over 8  million pesos to the national budget.    Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez explained  that, with the objective of covering the costs of workers'  dining halls, one proposal includes a decentralized setting of  prices that would be easily adjusted to the conditions and  quality being offered. Rodriguez added that one proposal is to  charge boarding school students for lunches; a minimum fee of 35  cents could produce an annual revenue of 29 million pesos.  Rodriguez pointed out that the proposals, including lowering  subsidies to students, exclude the low income sector of the  population.    The ANPP special session is also discussing measures such as  taxes on personal income, documents, properties, and water  service. The proposed cost for water service is one peso a month  per person.    The address by the finance and prices minister mentions the  possible change of the currency for a convertible peso. Changing  the Cuban peso was described as feasible and it was announced  that several alternatives have been studied toward this end.  Likewise, the possibility of strengthening the value of the peso  by gradually increasing the quality of goods and services was  described. Regarding the state, the Finance and Prices Ministry  proposal includes the reduction of subsidies that resulted in  losses of 1.3 billion pesos this year; this will make it  possible to reduce the fiscal budget by 24 percent. The  possibility of selling personal insurance is also under  consideration, as are diverse means to stimulate bank savings  accounts in order to remove from circulation the largest  possible amount of currency.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- Metallgesellschaft [a  major German metals and mining group], which was threatened with  bankruptcy and has a work force of 58,000, has been saved at the  last minute. The company announced in Frankfurt am Main this  evening that representatives of the 120 or so creditor banks  agreed to a modified rescue package with a few reservations  after over 10 hours of negotiations. Under the agreement,  Metallgesellschaft will receive new equity capital totalling  around 2.7 billion German marks [DM] and credits worth DM700  million.    Kajo Neukirchen, the chairman of the managing board of  Metallgesellschaft, said that with the support of the banks,  Metallgesellschaft was now in a position for new horizons to be  opened for the company. "We are now able to devote ourselves  fully to the tasks before us," he said.    Up until yesterday the shareholding banks Deutsche Bank and  Dresdner Bank had been unable to obtain approval for the rescue  package from the other banks. The rescue plan for  Metallgesellschaft, which was submitted last week, provided for  total aid worth DM3.4 billion. The company went into the red as  a result of risky oil deals and mismanagement. French and  American banks had previously rejected the plan and called for  greater involvement by Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Daimler  Benz, Kuwait, and Allianz, the five principle shareholders. The  latter are evidently now prepared to raise their previous share  of 68 percent of the financial aid being offered.</p>

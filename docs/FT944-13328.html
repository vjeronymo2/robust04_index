			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / BA plans early start at Orly TAT European Airlines, an affiliate of British Airways, announced yesterday that it would start services between Orly airport in Paris and Toulouse and between Orly and Marseilles before the end of December. The French government, which was ordered on Wednesday to open the lucrative routes has said that services could not start before January 1995. The routes are currently operated by Air Inter, the state-owned airline, which has a monopoly on many French domestic routes. The European Commission said the two routes must be opened immediately following Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice to reject an appeal by the French government which was seeking to delay liberalisation of the routes. The Commission said that the French government could have begun the procedure of selecting carriers six months ago when it was originally ordered to open the routes to competition. TAT, which is 49.5 per cent owned by British Airways and which filed the original suit demanding access to the routes described the selection process sought by the transport ministry as a 'another stalling tactic' and threatened legal action against the French government unless its bid to operate the routes was not approved within 24 hours. The latest clash follows the so-called 'battle of Orly' earlier this year in which TAT, British Airways and other UK carriers threatened to fly to Orly from London despite the refusal of the French government to grant landing permission.</p>

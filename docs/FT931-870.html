			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Advanced dividend payments Due to the tax changes announced in the Budget the following companies have issued revised dividend information: Anglia Television paying a second interim of 6.4p in lieu of the already reported final. Blick is paying an increased interim of 3.3p (3p) earlier than the usual June announcement and September payment. Brake Brothers is making its dividend announcement for 1992 early, paying an second interim of 4.35p in lieu of a final for a total of 6.2p (5.75p). SR Gent has brought forward the payment of its already reported interim dividend of 0.75p. Grampian Holdings is announcing its 1992 dividend early with a second interim of 3.8p making an unchanged total of 5.5p. John Haggas has brought forward the payment of its interim dividend of 1p. Town Centre Securities has replaced its announced interim dividend of 1.1p with a special payment of 1.1p with an earlier pay date. Meanwhile Erskine House is expecting to pay only a nominal final in addition to the interim of 2.3p already paid. Maintaining the payment would have resulted in further unrelieved ACT and the board has decided to conserve cash to reduce borrowings.</p>

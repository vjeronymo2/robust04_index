			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WILL DAVIS SAY TO HIS NEW COACH, 'JUST DO OK, BABY'?  </P> <P> Regardless of anyone's opinion of Al Davis, he is again to be commended for the  ability to follow his own conscious, rather than maintain status quo.  </P> <P> When he felt his franchise could reap economic benefits by moving from Oakland  to Los Angeles, he proceeded despite opposition from the NFL hierarchy.  </P> <P> When he felt the Raiders straying from the traditional path known as Raider  football, he had the courage to make a change during the course of the regular  season. More important, he drew upon a gem, Hall of Famer Art Shell, to  resurrect the "pride and poise" that we have known as Raider football.  </P> <P> As a footnote, the qualified person chosen happens to be black. Considering the  significance of the event, it's great to feel that this factor had minimal  importance, rather than being the motivation.  </P> <P> ERIC GORDON, West Covina  </P></p>

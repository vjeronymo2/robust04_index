			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- In reply to the question from a UNIAN  correspondent, "What will you do if you find out that you have  been elected president of Ukraine or that you have gone through  to the second round," Leonid Kravchuk said: "If I am at home at  the time, I will have a glass of cognac. If I am at work, I  think I may do the same, and then I will get on with ordinary  matters." According to Leonid Kravchuk, the question "What will  you do if you find out you have been elected president" is a  problem for the other candidates for president. For all his  brilliant imaginings about the presidency, another candidate  does not know what steps to take, while Kravchuk has been taking  these first steps for two and a half years; therefore, he does  not have this problem, he says.    Leonid Kravchuk sees his priority actions in the event of  his  election to president of Ukraine as implementing his program,  while making use of all of the best points from the programs of  the other candidates for this post, and also the formation of a  government.    Leonid Kravchuk considers his cooperation with Vitaliy  Masol,  Ukraine's prime minister, to be "normal," observing that Masol  is not a "closed book" to him, because they once worked  together. "Of all the contenders for the post of president of  Ukraine, only I know him, and therefore I do not have a 'Masol  problem.' If someone else is elected, however, then he will  have this problem," Leonid Kravchuk said.</p>

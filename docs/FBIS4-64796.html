			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The appointment of General Gabriel  Espirito Santo as Army quartermaster general and the Lajes base  agreement were subjects of discussion in the Portuguese press.  <H5>  Quartermaster General </H5>   According to "I.G.T." writing in the 15 April Lisbon weekly  O  INDEPENDENTE, General Espirito Santo, presently chief of the  Portuguese mission to NATO, will be the next Army quartermaster  general. His appointment, which will become effective at the  beginning of May, caused surprise in Army ranks, since it was  expected that he would be nominated to head the Institute for  Higher Military Studies or the Army's operational command.  "I.G.T." noted that the quartermaster general post is considered  a stepping stone to the position of chief of the Armed Forces  general staff. This expectation will probably apply to Gen.  Espirito Santos as well, "I.G.T." writes, as he enjoys "great  prestige and the sympathies of the political powers that be."  <H5>  Lajes Agreement Update </H5>   The resolution of possible labor conflicts is the last  hurdle  before signing a Lajes base agreement between the United States  and Portugal, writes Jose Vegar in the 23 April Lisbon weekly  SEMANARIO. A meeting of the two sides at the end of April in  Washington will attempt to reach a consensus on a labor  agreement for the Lajes base, including eventual indemnification  to dismissed workers, a burden Washington does not want to  assume alone. "Strangely," according to Jose Vegar, no date has  been scheduled yet for the signing of the agreement, with both  sides awaiting a "propitious date."</p>

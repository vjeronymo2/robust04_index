			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Institutions may choose to have either the auditor who prepares its financial statement audit or the auditor who prepares its title IV, HEA program compliance audit certify to the accuracy of its computations under the 85 percent rule, and the auditor must submit that certification as part of that audit report. If the auditor determines that the institution did not accurately calculate whether it satisfied the 85 percent rule, the auditor must include in the audit the correct amount of title IV, HEA program funds and revenues the institution received in the fiscal year, and the correct ratio under &sect;600.5(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposed in &sect;600.5(d)(2)(v) that title IV, HEA program funds will be presumed to be used to satisfy tuition, fees and other institutional charges unless these charges were satisfied with grant funds provided by sources independent of the institution. This provision is changed so that the presumption would also not apply to institutional charges that were satisfied with money provided through job training contracts under Federal, State, and local training programs described in &sect;600.7(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When these regulations become effective on July 1, 1994, a proprietary institution must determine whether it qualifies as an eligible proprietary institution for award year 1994&hyph;95 under the 85 percent rule. The Secretary has developed special rules for this initial determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an institution's latest complete fiscal year ended during the period of October 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994, the institution shall use that fiscal year to determine whether the institution satisfies the 85 percent rule. Such an institution must notify the Secretary no later than September 30, 1994 if it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule, and if the institution fails to satisfy that rule, it becomes ineligible on June 30, 1994. Therefore, as a general matter, it will be liable for all title IV, HEA program funds it disbursed to its students for award year 1994&hyph;95.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an institution's latest complete fiscal year ends before October 1, 1993, the institution shall use the fiscal year that ends between July 1, 1994 and September 30, 1994 as its latest fiscal year to determine whether the institution satisfies the 85 percent rule. The institution must notify the Secretary if it fails to satisfy the 85 percent rule within 90 days following the end of that fiscal year, and if it fails to satisfy that rule, it becomes ineligible on the last day of its fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.7&blank;Conditions of Institutional Ineligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to qualify as an eligible institution, starting in award year 1994&hyph;95, an institution must not,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , be in violation of the limitations set forth in &sect;600.7. The provisions in that section implement the provisions in sections 481(a)(3) and 481(a)(4) of the HEA. The former section was effective on October 1, 1992 while the latter section was effective on July 23, 1992. Accordingly, institutions were subject to those provisions as of those dates. Until July 1, 1994, the Secretary will view an institution as not violating those statutory limitations if the institution can demonstrate, under a plausible interpretation of those statutory provisions, that it did not violate those limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.7 becomes effective on July 1, 1994, and &sect;600.7(a)(1)(i) implements section 481(a)(3). Under &sect;600.7(a)(1)(i), the Secretary evaluates an institution's eligibility on the basis of the institution's actions over the latest complete award year. Accordingly, as of July 1, 1994, the latest complete award year is the 1993&hyph;94 award year. Thus, for determining whether an institution qualifies as an eligible institution during award year 1994&hyph;95, the institution will use award year 1993&hyph;94 for purposes of determining whether more than 50 percent of its courses were correspondence courses, whether 50 percent or more of its enrolled regular students were enrolled in correspondence courses, whether 25 percent or more of its enrolled regular students were incarcerated, and whether 50 percent or more of its enrolled regular students had neither a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waivers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An institution loses its eligibility if more than 50 percent of its regular students are enrolled in correspondence courses. However, an institution that offers a 2-year associate-degree or 4-year bachelor's-degree program may receive a waiver of that limitation for ``good cause.'' To receive a waiver, an institution can demonstrate ``good cause'' if the students enrolled in the institution's correspondence courses receive no more than five (5) percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by all the students at that institution during its latest award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An institution loses its eligibility if more than 50 percent of its regular students do not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent (ability to benefit [ATB] students). However, a nonprofit institution may receive a waiver of this limitation if its enrollment of ATB students exceeded 50 percent of its total enrollment because it served a substantial number of ATB students through contracts with Federal, State, or local government agencies during its latest complete award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To receive a waiver, the contract must provide job training for low-income individuals who are in need of that training. An example of such a contract is a job training contract under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, an institution may receive a waiver only if no more than 40 percent of its enrollment of regular students consists of ATB students who are not being served under the above-described contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under &sect;600.7, the waiver will extend indefinitely provided that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year. If an institution fails to satisfy the waiver requirements for an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that award year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.9&blank;Written Agreements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

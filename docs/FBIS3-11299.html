The unofficial office of the Senate (?wants) the  parliamentary plan to be sent to them so they can look into it.  The following is a report by Daly Valet:    [Begin recording, in Creole]    [Valet] Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Stanley Schrager spoke at  the  beginning of the week, saying that the parliamentary plan would  be voted on in the Senate this week. From 14 March through 17  March, the Senate situation has remained the same. Nothing has  changed. The days that pass at the Senate look like one  another: The Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP] senators  are meeting in camera; the Senate session room is empty; and  Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the legitimate office, has been  absent since the most recent clashes of last week. The problem  of two offices within the Senate has remained unchanged despite  negotiations and discussions underway among the ACP senators.  How can the parliamentary plan come to a vote in this situation  of confusion? We know the office presided over by Firmin  Jean-Louis has already received a copy of the resolution passed  in the Chamber of Deputies. But has Bernard Sansaricq's  unofficial office been informed of the parliamentary plan?    [Senator Osny Eugene] No, Daly, until now, we have not been  officially informed of the plan passed by the parliamentarians  in the lower chamber. We have heard about the plan through the  press. We expect the lower chamber to inform us of this plan so  we can look into it.    [Valet] This answer is the stand of Osny Eugene, quaestor of  the unofficial office, who will apparently continue to hear  about the plan in the press because it is the office presided  over by Firmin Jean-Louis that the Chamber of Deputies has  acknowledged for work on the issue. Eugene says he does not  give much importance to the parliamentary plan. According to  him, a plan signed in Washington does not deserve much  importance.    [Eugene] [passage omitted] We have nothing against the fact  that a plan was discussed in Washington but, as long as the plan  has not yet been concluded here in Haiti, it is very difficult  for us to give it importance. We think there are enough people  in this country. There are enough institutions to look into the  presentation of a plan. I see no reason for us to go as far as  Washington for a plan.    [Valet] As an 18 January parliamentarian, the quaestor of  the  unofficial office, has sworn hundreds of times that he will not  allow anybody to ask him to abstain so the parliamentary plan  can be voted on by the Senate.

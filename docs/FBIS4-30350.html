			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [SDPJ -- of Japan] and New Party Sakigake [Harbinger] will  weigh the possibility of issuing a joint appeal to form a new  government, officials of the two parties said Monday [27 June].    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Sakigake Chief Masayoshi  Takemura met in the Diet building for nearly an hour to discuss  what course of action their parties should take in launching a  new government to replace that of outgoing prime minister  Tsutomu Hata.    The two men agreed their parties will consider the joint  action, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Administration  Committee, and Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda told a  joint news conference.    Takemura told Murayama that his party will not participate  in  a new government if it is led by the new intraparliamentary  group Kaishin and Soka Gakkai-backed Komeito [Clean Government  Party].    Kaishin's members include Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New  Party and the Democratic Socialist Party.    Earlier Monday, the SDP, the second largest opposition  party,  and Sakigake agreed in principle on a blueprint for a fresh  administration that calls for among other things respect for the  Constitution.    Nosaka said the SDP and Sakigake, both former members of  the ruling coalition, should make further efforts to stabilize  Japan's political situation, give a sense of security to the  public and win the trust of other countries.    Sonoda told reporters that Takemura briefed Murayama on his  party's position of recommending the SDP chief as top candidate  for the premiership. Murayama, however, demurred, Sonoda said.    To form a "dovish" government, Nosaka said, the next prime  minister should be served by people who are sincere, courageous  and decisive.    The dovish nature of the government should be represented by  Japan's international contributions in nonmilitary fields,  Sonoda said.    Saying the SDP is awaiting Hata's reply to the SDP's call  for  a meeting between the premier and Murayama, Nosaka displayed his  readiness to further urge Hata to meet the SDP boss and discuss  the framework of the next administration.    Hata and his two-month-old cabinet resigned Saturday in the  face of a no-confidence motion.    The socialists formed the largest contingent in the previous  government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Takemura  served as chief cabinet secretary.    Meanwhile, the democrats, a faction within the SDP, agreed  Monday to oppose an intraparty move to create a coalition  government with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the  country's largest party now in opposition, faction officials  said.    The democrats, a policy study group, which comprises 23 SDP  legislators of the House of Representatives, also urged the SDP  leadership to resume talks with Hata's coalition to form yet  another coalition government, the officials said.    The decision was adopted at a plenary session of the  democrats, they said. The democrats have long thrown their  weight behind SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who is regarded  as a chief proponent of an alliance with the coalition.    Following the announcement Saturday of the premier's  intention to disband his entire cabinet, SDP ranks have been  divided over the wisdom of proposals to seek an alliance with  the LDP or return to the fold of the ruling coalition.</p>

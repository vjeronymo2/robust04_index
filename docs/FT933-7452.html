			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Homes Assured directors 'were fully in the picture' THE DIRECTORS of Homes Assured, the mortgage broker that collapsed in 1989, were fully aware of the company's financial difficulties nine months before it collapsed, a jury at Chichester Rents in London heard yesterday. In his summing up Judge John Rogers QC recalled a letter from the Royal Bank of Scotland in November 1988 expressing 'extreme concern' about the accounts of Homes Assured Midlands. It listed 440 cheques that had bounced in the previous two months and said: 'We can tolerate this situation no longer.' There were also substantial sums owing to the Inland Revenue on behalf of Homes Assured customers. 'You must ask yourselves whether it was right for the management to run a company incurring debts with money they know is not their own,' the judge said. He cited comments from Mr Douglas Dunkley, an accountant at Homes Assured, who said in November 1988 that he had been 'worried for some time about the unreal optimism in the company'. The judge said: 'In retrospect, Mr Dunkley was dead right. All those involved in the day-to-day running of the company were put fully in the picture by a man whose accounting skills have never been called into question.' The judge reminded the jury of a letter from Stoy Hayward, Homes Assured auditor, in November 1988 warning of 'major cash difficulties' and reminding the directors of their responsibilities. He added: 'One wonders whether (the directors) were wanting to receive the message that was quite clearly being spelt out to them.' He also mentioned a report commissioned by Commercial Union from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in March 1989 showing current liabilities of Pounds 6.25m in December 1988. 'It seems that the warnings were coming thick and fast from every possible direction,' he told the jury. He stressed that the defendants - none of whom gave evidence - argued that they believed money to allow the company to continue to trade would be forthcoming. Once they realised salvation would not be possible - in August 1989 - they ceased trading. Mr Anthony Dobson, Mr Keith Woodward and Mr Michael Robinson all deny a joint charge of fraudulent trading from November 1988 to August 1989. Mr Dobson also denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception and Mr Woodward one of furnishing false information. The judge will conclude his summing up on Monday.</p>

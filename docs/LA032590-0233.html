			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELUS LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROLISH PITCHES A NO-HITTER, STRIKING OUT 18, FOR SERVITE  </P> <P> Chad Rolish of Servite High School pitched a no-hitter and struck out 18 in the  Friars' 4-0 victory over Bishop Montgomery in an Angelus League game Saturday  at Anaheim.  </P> <P> The senior left-hander, relying on his breaking ball, walked three but had  two-strike counts on each of the three batters he didn't strike out. Two  grounded to short and the other popped out.  </P> <P> Rolish (2-0) has struck out 30 in 14 innings this season. He played for  Servite's junior varsity team last year after transferring from Orange  Lutheran.  </P> <P> Servite (7-3, 1-1 in league) scored its runs in the fifth inning. Rolish came  in on a squeeze by Ed Crippen. Steve Sandoval's bases-loaded single drove in  two, and the final run scored on a passed ball.  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery is 2-5-2, 0-2.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat 3, Mater Dei 0 -- Right-hander Eric White allowed three hits and  struck out six to lead host Bishop Amat (6-4, 2-1) past Mater Dei for the fifth  consecutive year on its home field in La Puente.  </P> <P> Mater Dei (8-3, 2-1) had only two runners reach third base and had its best  scoring opportunity in the sixth, when it loaded the bases.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat broke a scoreless tie in the sixth inning off relief pitcher Colin  Galronski. Juan Hernandez hit a two-out single to right to drive in a run and  another scored when right fielder Frank Setera misplayed Hernandez's hit.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat increased its lead to 3-0 when Ted Persell lined a single down the  left-field line, scoring Hernandez. Bishop Amat got only two hits off starter  Jason Dietrich, but the Lancers got four singles off Galronski in the sixth.  </P> <P> Rick Ellis, Mater Dei's leadoff hitter, had two of the three hits off White and  stole a base. Mater Dei stole five bases, including two by catcher Cale Carter.  </P> <P> "We don't ever seem to come here mentally prepared to play," Mater Dei Coach  Bob Ickes said. "White didn't overpower us, but he threw strikes and we didn't  hit the ball." TOM HAMILTON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shihadah Abu-Baqar] </F>   [Excerpt] Amman, PETRA--Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali has stated that Jordan's rejection of a unilateral  peace deal is not the outcome of a state of weakness. Rather,  it is the outcome of faith and strong Jordanian convictions that  a unilateral deal cannot produce a durable peace. Worse still,  a unilateral peace deal poses more danger than a state of no  peace at all.    The prime minister added: Hence the firm Jordanian position  and determination that the solution must be comprehensive, just,  and durable. Besides, the solution must enjoy the support of  all concerned Arab sides.    During a meeting with representatives of publications issued  by political parties, Dr. al-Majali went on to say: The only  viable and sustainable option is the peaceful solution that we  are striving to achieve. Any other solution would remain  vulnerable and pose greater threats. He indicated that Jordan  has long been opposed to unilateral deals. That is why it has  come under various kinds of pressure to make it abandon its  principled stand toward the issue.    In this regard, the prime minister reaffirmed that Jordan's  steadfastness in the face of pressures and its firm positions in  this regard have earned it the respect of all, although its  position might not necessarily be in the interest of all parties.    Answering a question on the successive Israeli Government  attempts to export its crises; that is, on whether there is a  link between the Israeli attempts to brand Jordan as a terrorist  state and the blockade enforced against the Port of al-'Aqabah,  the prime minister said: First, we would like to say that  Israel's attempts to export its crises are unacceptable.  However, as is well known, many world parties pursue this  approach. But the important question in this regard is the  following: Should we succumb to the Israelis' wishes regarding  resolving their crises at our expense?    The prime minister answered this question, saying: We are  completely opposed to this. This may be connected to the  blockade enforced against al-'Aqabah, particularly if one is to  relate interconnected developments. In general, Israel has  nothing to do with the blockade enforced against al-'Aqabah.  However, a connection might be found between the two if one is  to employ a long-term perspective.    In the course of his answers to the questions posed by  reporters, the prime minister noted that the al-'Aqabah siege is  part of the Gulf war. The Gulf war elicited the blockade. This  is how we see things at present. We have withstood the blockade  enforced against al-'Aqabah for the past three years. If we are  to make an estimate of the losses we have sustained as a result  of this, we would say that this blockade has cost us almost $1.2  billion, a large amount in Jordanian market calculations. It is  not a trivial matter that can be underrated.    The prime minister added: For our part, we have continued  our efforts to explain this state of affairs through our  contacts with various world states, such as Britain, France, and  other states. Our purpose in this regard has been to explain the  dangers that could be created by this state of affairs. In this  regard, we have also held intensive contacts with the U.S.  Administration and the UN Security Council's Sanctions  Committee. We explained to them the magnitude of our sufferings  under the blockade. We hope to reach a solution to this problem  soon.    In reply to a question on the progress made in these  contacts, Dr. al-Majali said: It is widely known that ship  inspections are currently conducted in high seas. The  inspection process has something to do with numerous procedures  regarding the storage of commodities inside ships. Because of  the complications entailed in this, we have lost 24 shipping  lines. Thanks to the contacts I have just noted, we have  received an offer from Lloyds Register, a nonpolitical and  non-profit international corporation, according to which its  officials will be stationed in al-'Aqabah. When customs  officials open cargo containers, Lloyds Register officials could  examine the cargo to ensure that there are no violations of the  sanctions. In other words, this would not be a full-blown  inspection. Besides, such measures would not undermine national  sovereignty. Of course, they [not further identified] sought to  bring navy officers and personnel to the port to conduct the  inspections there. This is unacceptable. We have read reports  that the government abandoned sovereignty over al-'Aqabah.  Indeed, this is a regrettable development, because we cannot  accept anything of the sort.    Responding to a question on inter-Arab coordination, and  whether there is a unified Arab position regarding the next  phases of the peace process to be conveyed to the U.S. secretary  of state during his upcoming tour of the region, the prime  minister said: It is truly regrettable that the events and  crises which should have made the Arabs more tolerant and more  cohesive have failed to do so. We feel that the Arab negotiator  would have been in much a better position had the Arab stands  been concerted and united.    Dr. al-Majali said: Jordan's position is constant. During  the past and current crisis, Jordan's stand has remained the  same. This stand will not be changed by any future crises. We  absolutely believe in the importance of a comprehensive solution  and of coordination. We work toward that end. But if  coordination is not realized, this will not be our fault. We  always offer coordination with our brothers--Palestinians,  Syrians, Lebanese, and other Arab brothers. Our objective is to  end the estrangement so that the Arabs have a stronger  negotiating position and so that we can attain our rights. We  constantly offer coordination, but we do not have the strength  or might which would enable us to lead others in this direction.    In response to a question on his assessment of  Jordanian-Palestinian relations, Dr. al-Majali said: Certainly,  those relations are special, both morally and practically. But  it is known that the other side has various factions with  various political orientations. Naturally, our relations should  be with a specific side. It is unreasonable that relations be  established with various and different sides. Therefore, we  have decided that our relations will be with the PLO, which is  recognized by the Palestinian and Arab people and most world  states. We exclusively deal with the PLO [among other  Palestinian factions], exactly as we deal with any other  sisterly Arab state.    The prime minister said: We support the PLO in whatever  would make it capable of fully restoring its rights. Therefore,  we hope that the political organization will enter the  Palestinian territory and that a Palestinian entity will be  established over the Palestinian territory. We hope that the  Palestinian people will attain their right to  self-determination, so that they will be able to decide on  whatever type of relationship that they would like to have with  us. Even in the name of patriotism, it is unacceptable that any  formula for any future relationship be imposed on the  Palestinian people while they are still under occupation. Just  like us, they must be given the chance so that we together can  decide on the formula of this relationship. This is especially  true since past Arab unity experiences have ended in failure  because they were imposed from above and were isolated from the  grassroots.    The prime minister continued: Here in Jordan, we are  sincerely open toward any kind of relationship with the  Palestinian brothers and other Arab brothers in general. We are  open to any kind of relationship. We also always seek to have  strong relations with our brothers. Therefore, we believe that  under the current circumstances, it is in the interest of the  brother Palestinians and the Arab-Israeli negotiations in  general that the Arabs raise the level of coordination among  them. Otherwise, the future will be more serious than the past.    In this vein, Dr. al-Majali said: Apathy, disagreement, and  disunity mean that the Arab nation will eventually find itself  in a situation imposed upon it by others. On the other hand,  accord, concerted stands, and closed ranks are the real  guarantor of the Arab nation's interests. They provide the  means with which the dangers of the designs that are being  concocted against the Arab nation and its coming generations can  be thwarted.    Regarding the issue of Jerusalem within the framework of  the peace process, Dr. al-Majali said: The brothers in the PLO  agreed to discuss the issue of Jerusalem in the second phase. I  believe that Jerusalem is the major problem and, given the  current state of Arab fragmentation, the results would not  satisfy people. Hence, I sincerely call for abandoning these  differences at the present stage because there can be no peace  without Jerusalem. Arab reconciliation and unity of ranks are  needed now.    Answering a question on the PLO's representation of the  Palestinian people, the prime minister said: The PLO is 30  years old now. All Palestinians -- opposition and others -- now  agree that the PLO represents the Palestinian persona; it is  like any other government. The Palestinian issue is a major one  and the Palestinian people exist inside and outside the occupied  territory. Since it is difficult to hold elections so as to  elect a Palestinian leadership, it would be in the general  interest of the Palestinians to postpone differences. Following  the establishment of a Palestinian entity the Palestinian  brothers will be able to elect whoever they want.    Answering a question on the recent events aimed at  undermining Jordan's stability and the sides that stand behind  them, the prime minister said: External sides gave instructions  or tried to convince certain people that the situation in Jordan  is not right and that religious duty calls for changing this  situation.    Dr. al-Majali said: Some of those who tried to carry out  acts that are detrimental to the country's security were trained  abroad to use arms. Some others are naive people, because the  person who blows himself up while trying to plant a bomb  somewhere is a naive person. He said: Those people exploited  the fact that many sides want to see instability in Jordan for  many purposes.    Asked why the views of the opposition are not highlighted in  the official media, the prime minister said: The Jordanian  Government takes into consideration both views. The government  has its official media and you have your media, and I do not  believe we intervene in your affairs.    To reiterate the government's faith and endeavors to  highlight conflicting views, the prime minister said that the  government is determined to work continuously to listen to other  opinions and even to open the official radio to it.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri,  the representative of the vali-e faqih [vice-regent of the  Supreme Jusrisconsult] and the supervisor of the Iranian  pilgrimage, set off for Saudi Arabia this evening. He was seen  off by Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Golpayegani, a  representative of the exalted leader; Mr. Mo'ayeri, a  representative of the president; and several of our country's  political and religious personalities.    In an interview with our correspondent before his departure,  he referred to the exalted leadership's stress on the need for  the realization of the principles delineated for Iranian  pilgrims to the House of God by the great leader of the Islamic  revolution [Khomeyni], and called upon pilgrims to concentrate  all their efforts on the exaltation of the principles of pure  Mohammadan Islam and the bond among Muslims.    He expressed the hope that cooperation by the Saudi Arabian  Government results in the better implementation of the envisaged  programs for the Iranian pilgrims during the holy period of hajj.    Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri called on  Iranian pilgrims to observe discipline and regulations and  actively participate in the ceremonies and rites, and warned  them to avoid any act that might mar the unity of Muslims.    He stressed that during this year's hajj rites, Iranian  pilgrims will perform their religious and divine duties, headed  by the ceremony of disavowal of infidels.</p>

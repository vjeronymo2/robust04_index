			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MARATHON MEETING HELD ON SEWAGE SUIT  </P> <P> Representatives of city, state and federal agencies met for five hours Monday  evening but failed to reach a settlement in the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency's lawsuit against the city of San Diego over sewage treatment standards.  </P> <P> The negotiators, 23 from half a dozen agencies, huddled in Mayor Maureen  O'Connor's office during the marathon session. A formal settlement conference  before U.S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez was scheduled for today.  </P> <P> The negotiators also were discussing millions of dollars in proposed fines  against the city for past sewage spills into San Diego waterways.  </P> <P> "I think everybody left in a rather amicable mood," E. Miles Harvey, chairman  of Metropolitan Sewage Task Force, said after Monday meeting. "I think several  issues have been narrowed."  </P> <P> Harvey said the two sides moved closer on the key question of a timetable for  upgrading the city's sewage treatment system to so-called secondary standards,  as required by federal law. He said further discussions will be held today.  </P> <P> O'Connor, who opened the session at 4:30 p.m., had said she did not expect a  settlement Monday night. She said that simply bringing all sides to the  negotiating table Monday was a significant accomplishment.  </P> <P> City Councilman Bob Filner, an opponent of the costly upgrading of treatment  standards, criticized the mayor for failing to notify the council of the  meeting.  </P> <P> "I just find it incredible that we have people in there, and we don't know  anything about this," Filner said.  </P> <P> If a settlement is not reached, the city and the federal government are to  square off in court Dec. 5 on the suit, which the EPA filed in July, 1988,  contending that the city failed to comply with the federal Clean Water Act and  repeatedly spilled raw sewage into San Diego waterways.  </P> <P> Under the act, all U.S. cities were required to install "secondary" sewage  treatment systems, which remove 85% to 90% of solids from sewage, by July 1,  1988, a deadline the city could not meet.  </P> <P> City planners and their hired consultants are designing a sewage treatment and  water reclamation system that would cost an estimated $2.6 billion to $2.86  billion, the largest public works project in city history.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Sewage Task Force, which advises the City  Council, urged it for the first time to delay improving the sewage system at  the city's Point Loma plant until 2015. That recommendation was based on  testimony from scientists who believe that the current 190-million-gallon daily  flow of effluent from the Point Loma plant is not harming the ocean.  </P> <P> The city's current "advanced primary" system removes about 75% of solids from  sewage.  </P> <P> The city had abandoned plans for a secondary system in 1981, when it concluded  -- mistakenly -- that the EPA would give it a permanent exemption from the  standards. In 1986, the EPA tentatively denied the exemption and, in 1987, the  city gave up fighting for one.  </P></p>

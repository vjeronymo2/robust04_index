			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Nepal PM sworn in today Nepal's Communist party leader Man Mohan Adhikary said yesterday that King Birendra had appointed him as the Himalayan nation's prime minister. 'I will be sworn in tomorrow,' Mr Adhikary said as he left a meeting with the king. Mr Adhikary's Communist Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party won a majority in general elections earlier this month and staked a claim to form a minority government. UML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said the party would announce the new cabinet today. Mr Adhikary arrived at the palace in Kathmandu in an old Toyota car which he had used during the general election campaign, and departed in a black Mercedes.</p>

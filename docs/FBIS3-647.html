The convoy of cars and  bakkies [pickup trucks] were each occupied by at least four or  five khaki-clad men.    According to SA Police manning the roadblock at Rooigrond,  about 20km from Mmabatho, the convoy was re-routed to Buhrmons  Drift.    According to police, the road through Buhmorns Drift did  offer access to Mmbatho. As no law had been broken, the convoy  was allowed to proceed.    [Johannesburg SAPA in English on 11 March at 0745 GMT  reports  that "the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging [Resistance Movement --  AWB] has between 4,000 and 5,000 men in Mmabatho, AWB Gen Steven  Meninger told journalists on Friday morning. The men had made  the Bophuthatswana Air Force base their headquarters and they  were deployed all over town, he said. AWB leader Eugene  Terreblanche is also said to be in Mmabatho to take charge of  his men."]</p>

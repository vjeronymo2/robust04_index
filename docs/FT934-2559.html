			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Voters reveal a weariness with politics Lenin killed off Russia's last attempt at democracy when he sent sailors to dissolve the 1918 Constituent Assembly, saying the 'guard is tired'. In Sunday's election, it was the voters who told Russia's democratically-minded politicians of their weariness. This, at least, is the message behind the crushing electoral victory of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader who promises to restore Russia as a great power, to end crime and corruption among selfish officials, and to give every citizen of Russia guarantees of economic well-being. Rather than an indication of Russians being a nation of war-mongering extremists, the result is a snapshot of a sharply divided society with real grievances that need addressing, if not with deeds at least with words. It shows a society split among the losers and winners of reforms conducted so far - or at least between those who have already lost faith in them and those who are still patiently awaiting their fruits. Some of the new categories of society, such as entrepreneurs, are more clearly in a single camp than others. But interviews with dozens of Mr Zhirinovsky's supporters over the past few days show little support for his talk of invading neighbouring countries and reabsorbing former Soviet republics. Most frequently they express a longing for law and order, panic over Russia's economic crisis, a feeling of national humiliation as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse, and a belief that their interests are not being pursued by officialdom. They range from soldiers and simple-minded workers with low levels of education to educated professionals, such as engineers at defence enterprises, drawn by Mr Zhirinovsky's promises to restore their previous importance to the economy. One distinct constituency for Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats has been the military. Freed of the Communist era obligation to vote as their commanders told them, the army has been strongly attracted by promises to make Russia great again and to give each homeless officer a flat. For some of the more educated, supporting Mr Zhirinovsky was a calculated protest vote against the ruling authorities. 'I know Zhirinovsky means war,' says Mr Yuri Bolshakov, the courteous and educated chief designer at a major shipyard. 'But only Zhirinovsky will provide genuine opposition which Yeltsin needs.' Some, probably a minority, are motivated by a more distilled chauvinism, like Vladimir, a prosperous waiter at St Petersburg's plush Astoria Hotel which caters mainly to even richer foreigners. He said he believed Mr Zhirinovsky would restore Russians' prestige in their own country. Nikolai, a visiting officer in the Ukrainian army, even said he was happy about Mr Zhirinovsky's success because it might mean Ukraine would be reabsorbed by Russia. For the pro-reform elite, which once considered Mr Zhirinovsky a joke or a nightmare, the result is a direct threat to their aspirations - but also a sign of the need to defend them better. 'It is no doubt a sign of people's lack of education that people believed in Zhirinovsky's simplistic solutions,' said Mr Mikhail Vinchel, a consultant who has invested in privatised Russian enterprises. 'But at least now the democrats will have a powerful stimulus to unite.' Mr Andrei Chuguevsky, a Russian entrepreneur, said: 'We get what we deserve as a society. . . . Big reforms are always difficult, especially when conducted in the absence of political culture. This means society can be manipulated however you like.' As Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister responsible for privatisation said: 'We thought our work would speak for itself.' Not a single reformist leader held a television debate with Mr Zhirinovsky to point out to voters the flaws in his arguments. Nor did TV journalists fill that gap. The result was that Mr Zhirinovsky's assertions went totally unchallenged and he is now reaping the benefits of a brilliant campaign of systematic, consistent, clear, disciplined and entertaining manipulation. For a nation so professedly weary of politicians, the fact that so many people were sufficiently credulous to believe in Mr Zhirinovsky's promises is also a sign of the heritage of seven decades of communism. Mr Yuri Vdovin, one of the defeated Russia's Choice candidates in St Petersburg, puts his finger on the reasons for this paradox: 'We have been brought up to believe in things like Stalin, communism, and the party - but not to understand them'.</p>

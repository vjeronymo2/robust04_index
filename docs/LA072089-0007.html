			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVE THE TREASURE  </P> <P> To listen to Bush Administration officials, the unwary would think that the  only thing standing between the United States and a new energy crisis is the  obstinacy of elitist Californians who refuse to let the oil companies drill in  their coastal waters for the plentiful oil that will make the nation energy  independent.  </P> <P> The record is to the contrary. The misleading argument clouds the  Administration's commendable efforts to develop a truly balanced national  energy policy. It overlooks decades of California offshore oil production and  implies that California is being all but unpatriotic if it does not provide as  much energy as the state consumes. California is No. 4 among the states in oil  production, meeting nearly 60% of its own needs. There are promising portions  of the California outercontinental shelf that can and should be drilled, but  federal officials have shunned reasonable compromise proposals from California  congressional leaders in recent years. Still, there is not enough oil off the  California coast, by anyone's estimates, to make a significant dent in foreign  imports.  </P> <P> Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and Energy Secretary James D. Watkins  picked California this week to attack a proposed one-year moratorium on  offshore oil leasing. The proposal, given momentum by the Exxon Valdez accident  in Alaska, has passed the House of Representatives and is pending in the  Senate. Both men insist they do not want to permit drilling in a manner that  puts the environment at risk. But both left the impression that efforts to free  the nation from the yoke of Middle Eastern imports were doomed if exploration  off the coast were delayed for any reason.  </P> <P> Their campaign ignores history. During 1963-1984, the Department of the  Interior offered 10 million acres of California coast for lease. Oil companies  bid on, and leased, 2.8 million acres of that. Many leases have lapsed because  the firms chose not to drill on them, but nearly 800,000 acres remain available  for drilling. There are 21 working oil platforms in federal waters from Orange  County to San Luis Obispo. The firms have drilled 633 wells, producing nearly  400 million barrels of crude. Production has increased about three-fold since  1980, but exploration has declined because of depressed oil prices. Since  prices have increased recently, firms are focusing on foreign areas because of  the the prospects for bigger discoveries.  </P> <P> The Administration claims the moratorium leaders are pursuing the wrong target  because offshore drilling is safe while the culprits of recent spills have been  tankers. Refusal to drill off the U.S. coast will only require more foreign  imports that are brought in by tankers, they claim. But Sen. Pete Wilson  (R-Calif.), a vigorous proponent of the moratorium, counters that oil from  remote oil rigs proposed in planned lease sales would be shipped by tanker and  not by pipeline as with most existing platforms. And he notes that the  potential oil available -- an estimated 155,000 barrels a day at full  production -- is not going to establish U.S. independence from imports. The  latest report of the Harvard Energy Project says that "there is no domestic  solution" to imports as long as the United States consumes 6 million barrels a  day more than it produces. Untapped oil reserves in Kern County could amount to  three times the offshore potential, a state energy commissioner has said.  </P> <P> There is more at risk than spills. Studies indicate drilling can have a major  impact on fishing and tourist industries. The air pollution from 10 new  platforms would equal that of 144,000 additional autos in the South Coast air  basin, according to studies by the Southern California Assn. of Governments for  Los Angeles and Orange counties. Yet federal officials have refused to yield to  local air pollution-control standards.  </P> <P> California must, and will, contribute its share of national energy needs. But  in doing so, it must not be forced to subject its irreplaceable coastal  environment, a true national treasure, to unnecessary risk.  </P></p>

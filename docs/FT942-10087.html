			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Observer: Gravy train in the air 'Me, travel business class?' Chad's Pierre Moussa, not to be confused with the former Paribas chairman, is the longest-serving executive director at the African Development Bank and scoffs at the very suggestion. He has always travelled first class; his reputation depends on it. Absolutely. Unfazed by last year's fuss over Jacques Attali's free-spending ways at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the AfDB is the only multilateral development bank which still flies all its big cheeses in the very best seats. Downgrading to business class is a pretty feeble symbolic gesture, reckons Moussa, even for a bank ministering to the the world's poorest continent. Never mind the AfDB's mounting arrears - owed by bankrupt African governments - and suspected internal mismanagement. Still, the AfDB gravy train could be endangered. In the kind of radical gesture loved by indolent bureaucracies, some of the bank's richer donor nations may try to prevent AfDB directors flying to Paris for dental appointments on the bank's expenses. Moussa - on the board for 19 years - is rather irritated by proposals to limit board membership to two years. Such ideas, he says, are typical of the 'small civil servants' from western countries who occupy six of the 18 seats on the AfDB's executive board. 'He's a dinosaur,' responds one of the 'small civil servants'.</p>

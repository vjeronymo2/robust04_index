			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Citic Pacific buys 50% of Discovery Bay owner Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment company Citic, is to pay HKDollars 3.4bn (USDollars 440m) for a 50 per cent stake in Discovery Bay, a self-contained community on one of Hong Kong's outlying islands which is home to some 9,500 of the colony's local and expatriate citizens. The deal, which sees Citic buying up 50 per cent of Hong Kong Resort Company  -the group which owns and manages Discovery Bay, on the north-eastern coast of Lantau Island - from parent HKR International, gives further substance to Citic's already impressive portfolio. Other acquisitions include 12 per cent of Hongkong Telecom and 12 per cent of Cathay Pacific. An additional payment of up to HKDollars 150m will be paid by Citic to acquire the balance of assets in the holding company, after agreed assets have been stripped out. HKR International, which retains 50 per cent of Discovery Bay, will continue to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the development.</p>

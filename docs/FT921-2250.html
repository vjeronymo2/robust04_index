			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Bush administration urges Japanese businesses to ease trade antagonism The Bush administration yesterday sent a direct plea to Japanese businesses to ease antagonism over the trade imbalance by doing more to provide equal business opportunities to US companies, AP reports from Tokyo. The US ambassador, Mr Michael Armacost, warned a gathering of senior Japanese executives that tensions that have been exacerbated in recent weeks by negative commentary on both sides could grow worse if more is not done to counter Japan's surging trade surplus. 'It is the persistent imbalance in our economic and trade relationship mainly that fuels discord - and provokes misleading stereotypes on both sides,' Mr Armacost said. 'There's got to be some kind of rough equality in business opportunities.' Mr Armacost urged Japan to relax its ban on rice imports, further deregulate its financial markets and more openly publicise government regulations and guidelines.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Ovcharenko and Sergey Postanogov: </F> "President Has Visited Intelligence Service"]    [Text] Yesterday was a holiday for our intelligence  agents: For the first time in the entire history of the foreign  intelligence service's existence the valiant "knights of the  cloak and dagger" were visited by the Russian president himself,  who addressed the collective in an 800-seat auditorium at the  foreign intelligence service headquarters. Actually, the  audience was far bigger because his speech was transmitted on  the radio communication system.    According to our information what particularly pleased the  intelligence agents was the specific nature of the president's  speech and his extensive acquaintance with a whole series of the  foreign intelligence service's specific problems.    What was the thrust of the speech? Unemployment obviously  does not threaten the foreign intelligence service staffers. As  the president said, "under conditions where military budgets are  being reduced, intelligence becomes a very important guarantee  of security and that means that the role of the intelligence  service must and will grow." "The supreme function of the  foreign intelligence service," the Russian leader stressed, "is  to serve Russia's national and state interests."    The president admitted that the foreign intelligence service  has a high reputation in the system of Russian state power. "I  believe that your operational information, analytical  conclusions, and recommendations will receive only high  assessments," he noted. The guest stressed that Russia will  strengthen the intelligence service -- that is the authorities'  intention and, which is even more interesting, the president's  personal understanding of this issue.    So is Yeltsin's visit to the foreign intelligence service an  attempt to improve our intelligence agents' morale or an attempt  to render them their due for their work? Most likely both. And  it is irrelevant whether Ames was a Russian special services  agent. Probably now even if you are not a specialist in the  affairs of the foreign intelligence services you can imagine  that the situation over Bosnia and the trouble spots in the  former USSR republics require close attention and strenuous work  from the intelligence service.    Concluding his speech the Russian president had a one on one  meeting with the leader of the foreign intelligence service.    It is not out of the question that meetings like yesterday's  will become traditional. To spite our enemies?!</p>

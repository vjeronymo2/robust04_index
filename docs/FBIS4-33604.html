			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Cesar Gaviria, the Colombian  president and OAS secretary general-elect, believes the best way  to propitiate a change in Cuba is to maintain an open dialogue  with Fidel Castro's regime. In an interview published today,  Sunday, in the Spanish daily LA VANGUARDIA, Gaviria says that he  does not believe it is convenient "to pressure" the Cuban  Government and that it is best to help the Caribbean country  change its economy.    "What we can look into as a possibility--but I do not know  if  Castro will go along with it--is to work along the lines  followed by Spain, Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico in the past,  keeping open the channels for dialogue and technical  cooperation," he said. "We have to assess the situation to see  if we can help Cuba change its economy," "with technical support  and without subsidies or attempts to alleviate its economic  situation," the Colombian president explained.    The Colombian president believes Cuba has progressed in the  economic sector during the past months "in a direction that  could be described as correct." He said, however, the  international community "is a bit impatient and would like  political changes to take place more swiftly." Asked if he  believed Cuba could achieve democracy with Castro in power,  Gaviria replied: "As long as changes in Cuba continue in an  orderly manner, the possibilities that will allow for a gradual  change are important."    Regarding the scheduled Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena  de  Indias on 14 and 15 June, Gaviria said it will basically be  geared toward the exchange of economic, commercial, and  investment experiences, bearing in mind the ongoing processes of  integration. As in previous summits, the one in Cartagena will  serve, according to the Colombian president, to strengthen  cultural, linguistic, and economic ties between Latin America  and Spain and Portugal. "Relations with Spain and Portugal have  helped us extend an important bridge to the European Union,"  Gaviria told the Barcelonan newspaper. According to Gaviria,  Ibero-American summits are very useful to the Cuban Government,  because it listens to the experiences of the rest of the Latin  American countries at those meetings and gathers "useful  teachings."    Gaviria said that with the death of drug trafficker Pablo  Escobar, Colombia has left behind "the worst part of  narcoterrorism" and shown that no criminal organization,  regardless of how powerful it is, can challenge the state. The  Colombia president attributes the violence in Colombia to the  traditional weakness of the government and the administration of  justice. "Violence comes from the past century. We have always  had very high levels of violence," he said. "The main factor is  not only poverty and the lack of policemen, but also inadequate  justice," he added.</p>

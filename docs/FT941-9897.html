			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slides on program sales, policy worries Wall Street US stocks tumbled yesterday under the weight of program selling and mounting concern over US monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 36.58 lower at 3,895.34, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.83 at 468.94. The American SE composite shed 1.46 to 479.13 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 3.11 to 783.42. New York SE volume, at 327.2m shares, was heavy. Falls outnumbered advances by 1,306 to 811. Stocks opened on a mixed note in spite of the overnight improvement in Tokyo. The morning's economic news, though favourable, was largely shrugged off. The Labor Department said claims for unemployment benefit had fallen by 47,000 last week, in line with expectations. Meanwhile, cautiousness prevailed in the bond market, in spite of the success of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn in new 30-year bonds. Prices across the yield curve retreated as traders prepared for unfavourable readings on inflation and retail sales tomorrow. By mid-morning, a clear direction for equities was established when a computerised sell order was activated. The broad-based downturn soon accelerated as investors became nervous once again about the implications of the Federal Reserve's move last week to lift short-term interest rates for the first time in five years. Until now, the mood had been sanguine, in view of the market's solid recovery from Friday's 96-point rout. Automobile stocks were hit hard for a second day running. General Motors, a Dow Industrial component, retreated Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 on 7.7m shares traded when its announcement of net income of Dollars 1.28 a share failed to satisfy investors. Ford Motor, whose strong results disappointed Wall Street in the previous session, shed a further Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 66. Chrysler, down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 59 3/4 , also fell out of favour. Among the blue chips, Procter &amp; Gamble receded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 5/8 and Philip Morris Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 . Cyclical issues were not spared: Caterpillar fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 106 1/8 , Alcoa Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 and Du Pont Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 54. Brazil Brazilian equities surged 11.1 per cent, boosted by heavy foreign buying and a perception that a widely expected market correction might not take place. A redenominated Bovespa index closed 1,002 up at 10,009. Turnover was Cr331bn. Canada After a mildly firmer morning session, the Toronto market turned down sharply, succumbing to the Wall Street weakness. The TSE 300 index ended 21.2 off at 4,442.0 and declines led rises by 460 to 343 after volume of 91.2m shares.</p>

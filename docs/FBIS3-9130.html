			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are internal debates within the Democratic  Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK]. The reporter is  Szilveszter Varga.    [Varga] One week before the VMDK conference for the  reelection of officials, there is a danger of a rift in the  organization. This is what the two deputy chairmen, Janos Vekas  and Sandor Hodi, have told the Novi Sad paper MAGYAR SZO.    According to Vekas, although the internal differences do  exist, none of the trends that have emerged within the VMDK have  turned against the autonomy demand itself. For this reason,  according to Vekas, there is a chance that the dominant idea  relating to the justification for the autonomy concept will hold  the VMDK together.    Sandor Hodi is also saying that even after the 27 March  general meeting for the election of officials, the Hungarians in  Vojvodina will be left to their own devices. In his opinion,  here too the same question in essence will have to be decided as  at the Hungarian elections in May -- whether the VMDK should  keep to the right, the left, or straight ahead. According to  Hodi, a left-wing faction has evolved within the VMDK leadership  which is openly striving for the expropriation of power and for  a showdown with those who think in a different way.    However, an even bigger problem is posed by the fact that  [VMDK Chairman] Andras Agoston, at the head of this group,  considers that the time has come for an understanding, or even  an appeasement, with the powers that be, which could endanger  the autonomy endeavors of the Hungarians of Vojvodina, Sandor  Hodi asserts in the Novi Sad paper MAGYAR SZO.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladivostok, Russia, June 23 KYODO -- Russia and  Japan inked an agreement Thursday [23 June] to build a disposal  plant for liquid nuclear waste near Vladivostok in the Russian  far east, Japanese officials said.    Both sides agreed to put up the construction of the plant  for  international bidding. The facility, which will filter  radioactive substances from the liquid waste, is expected to be  completed within this year.    In the coming years Russia will dismantle some 60 nuclear  submarines. Several storage ships including a 2,000-ton tanker  fully loaded with nuclear waste are currently mooring off  Vladivostok.    The hazardous cargo could pose a serious threat to the  environment as most of the vessels are worn out, although no  leakage has so far been reported.    For lack of storage and treatment facilities, the former  Soviet Union and Russia have dumped thousands of tons of nuclear  waste in the Sea of Japan and other waters off its coast.    The disclosure of the decades-long nuclear dumping has  sparked international protests and calls for a rapid solution to  the storage crisis.    Tokyo said earlier this month the plant will be funded from  a  70 million dollar Japanese grant for the dismantling of Russian  nuclear weapons and nuclear waste disposal.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Ecuador shows lead in international anti-corruption drive ECUADOR is expected to become the first government to sign a new international anti-corruption code of conduct and restrict the award of official contracts to local and foreign companies which have made the same pledge. The move has been initiated by Transparency International, the anti-corruption organisation launched in Berlin yesterday. Transparency International officials hope that three or four other countries will also soon form what are termed ''islands of integrity' as part of the campaign against corruption. Mr Alberto Dahik, vice president of Ecuador, told a conference attended by more than 60 government officials, businessmen and development experts that corruption was as great a threat to economic growth in developing countries as Aids. A substantial proportion of Ecuador's Dollars 13bn debt had been wasted on unnecessary contracts and projects and accompanying kickbacks. Examples from Ecuador's own experience, he said, included the purchase of nine locomotives and two aircraft worth Dollars 120m. Mr Peter Eigen, chairman of Transparency International, said the organisation would help 'erode the taboo' that surrounds public discussion of corruption, and lead a coalition spanning governments, development agencies, the business community and citizens in the fight against it. 'The creation of Transparency International reflects the intense frustration and anger among government and business leaders in many countries about the impact of corruption,' said Mr Eigen, a former World Bank official. 'The concern is global in origin and nature. The crisis of corruption is not the exclusive domain of international development, but has reached critical proportions in the so-called developing world as well.' The business community has generally been cautious over Transparency International's request for moral and practical support, partly from concern that committing themselves to the code of conduct would leave them at a commercial disadvantage over rivals which dismiss the code.</p>

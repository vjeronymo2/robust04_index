			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department reviews and evaluates these affirmative marketing plans submitted on Form HUD&hyph;935.2 (see attachment) as part of an applicant's request for funding under a number of single-family and multifamily mortgage insurance and subsidy programs. These reviews and evaluations, as well as the monitoring of the implementation of these Affirmative Marketing Plans, are conducted under procedures outlined in HUD Handbook 8025.1 REV&hyph;2, Implementation of Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Requirements. The Department also conducts compliance-related activities under the regulations at 24 CFR Part 108, Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Compliance Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of evaluations of both the administration of affirmative fair housing marketing and the underlying objectives of the policy conducted since 1974 have raised questions about AFHM's effectiveness and results, especially in terms of its effects on racial housing patterns within housing market areas. These evaluations and recent assessments of how the review of Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing (AFHM) Plans fits into the overall workload of the Field Office FHEO Divisions and Program Operations Divisions in the Regional Offices have also raised questions about the overall cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the review process itself. The 1990 evaluation of AFHM performed by the Office of Program Standards and Evaluation recommended that the Department pilot test the use of a third party to accept applications, check references, and provide an applicant a list of all available housing opportunities under HUD-assisted and insured single-family and multifamily programs. The evaluation also recommended that the Department conduct studies of the manner in which various groups search for rental and sales housing and the costs and benefits of various marketing techniques. The activities described in this NOFA address these recommendations in large part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Allocation Amounts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For FY 1993, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 (approved October 6, 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;389), (93 Appropriations Act) appropriated $10.6 million for the FHIP program. Of this amount, $1 million of Education and Outreach Initiative funds is made available under this NOFA to carry out an affirmative fair housing marketing ``lab'' experiment. The balance of $9.6 million in FY 1993 funds was made available in a NOFA published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 68000) and amended on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9235).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department estimates that the affirmative fair housing marketing lab project will function approximately 18 months at a cost to the federal government not to exceed $1.0 million dollars. The final cost will depend upon submissions from eligible applicants. In no case will the cost to the federal government for implementing the project under this NOFA exceed $1.0 million dollars. The continuing operation of the clearinghouse following completion of the lab will depend entirely on the income generated from fees and other funding sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Project Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a means of implementing the Department's strong commitment to administer its programs affirmatively to further fair housing, the Department seeks to implement an affirmative fair housing marketing lab. This lab will test an areawide affirmative marketing approach intended to expand affordable housing opportunities for those persons identified as least likely to apply for the housing because of where it is located. The specific objectives of this lab are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To promote greater awareness and acceptance on the part of housing providers and the entire community of the need to market assisted housing on a nondiscriminatory basis throughout the metropolitan area to increase housing choice and advance equal housing opportunity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To develop a model for the use of metropolitan areawide affirmative marketing as an effective tool to affirmatively further fair housing and provide greater affordable housing choice and opportunity throughout a metropolitan area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To determine whether use of a clearinghouse is an effective method over the long-term for assisted and insured multifamily housing providers and builders and developers of HUD-insured single-family housing to carry out their responsibilities under the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To test ways for metropolitan areawide affirmative marketing clearinghouses to become and remain financially self-supporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following entities, either individually or in combination, are eligible to apply for funding under this NOFA: Non-profit civil rights and housing organizations; organizations representing segments of the housing or mortgage lending industries; higher education institutions with expertise in civil rights and housing. While location within the Chicago metropolitan area would be highly desirable, it is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

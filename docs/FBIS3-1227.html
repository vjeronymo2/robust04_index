The pamphlet, a  copy of which was sent to SAPA on Tuesday [22 March], reads:  "Whiteman, with your lying tongue you stole our land, enslaved  us, jailed us, tortured us, killed us. Now the time has come  for us to take revenge. You will now cry tears of blood for  your past actions".    Another pamphlet being distributed under Azapo's name reads:  "Whiteman! We don't care who you are, who you work for, what  party you belong to, you are the people's enemy. You must die!  Viva Azapo viva".    Azapo said in a statement on Tuesday it rejected the  pamphlets "with the contempt it deserves. Azapo distances  itself from the pamphlet because it does not emanate from the  organisation nor any of its formations. The bogus nature of the  pamphlet is thereby proving that this is the dirty tricks and  work of sinister forces who want to create an excuse for  attacking Azapo members because of the organisation's unwavering  commitment to expose and fight against a sell-out political  settlement."    The organisation was alerted to the distribution of the  pamphlet by the South African Rail Commuter Corporation.</p>

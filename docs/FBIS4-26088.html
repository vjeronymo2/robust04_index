			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 16 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said here today that the U.S. would be willing to reopen  negotiations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK) if the DPRK cooperates with the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    Clinton said at a White House press conference today that  there are reports that the DPRK may have offered new steps to  resolve its nuclear dispute with the U.S. and the IAEA.    In discussions with U.S. former President Jimmy Carter who  is  in Pyongyang for a private visit, DPRK leaders said that IAEA's  inspectors and monitoring equipment would be left in place,  according to Clinton.    The DPRK also "desires to replace its present nuclear  program  with a new light water reactor technology that is more resistant  to nuclear proliferation," Clinton said.    Clinton said he is interested in hearing more about the  DPRK's offer and described the latest development as a promising  one.    "If today's development mean that North Korea is genuinely  and verifiably prepared to freeze its nuclear program while  talks go on," Clinton said, "then we would be willing to resume  high-level talks."    But in the meantime, the United States will continue to  pursue its consultations on sanction against the DPRK at the  United Nations, Clinton added.    "We are hopeful that this development today will be  positive,  and we are awaiting further evidence," Clinton said.    Before Clinton made the remarks, the White House issued a  statement, saying that "the United States welcomes indications  given to President Carter [as received] that North Korea desires  to find a constructive solution to the very serious issues  between North Korea and the international community."    "After confirming this meaning of the message from North  Korea in diplomatic channels, we would be prepared to go to a  third round of talks," Assistant Secretary of State Robert  Gallucci said in the statement.    "The point today, I think, for you is that there may be in  this message a basis for returning to talks with the North  Koreans," Gallucci said.</p>

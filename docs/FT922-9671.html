			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Kraft plans to shed 1,000 jobs KRAFT General Foods, the large food subsidiary belonging to Philip Morris, has announced plans to shed 1,000 jobs. Kraft employs about 72,000 people in North America. The food manufacturer said that the cuts would take effect over the next few months and that it aimed to secure the reductions by an early retirement offer and natural wastage. It added that if enough workers did not accept this offer, it would make lay-offs. The reductions will come at the Kraft General Foods USA, Kraft USA and Kraft General Foods Frozen Products units. Philip Morris's food businesses have tended to lag the performance of its tobacco operations recently.</p>

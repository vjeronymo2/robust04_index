			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- An increasing number of  railway sections are switched over to electric traction in the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The project for the electrification of the Hoeryong-Haksong  section in the northern tip of the country has begun recently.    In the project they have to erect thousands of electric  poles, extend electric wires and communications line, lower the  tunnel ground and build transformer substations and other  structures in the 168 km section.    The nation's railway electrification started in 1948. More  than 850 kilometres of sections were switched over to electric  traction in 1960s, more than 3,000 kilometres in 1970s and the  middle of 1980s and 800 kilometres in the period of the third  seven-year plan (1987-1993). Thus, the main trunk-line  electrification has been completed in the main.    The rate of haulage by electric locomotive has reached over  90 percent in freight transport, with the result that the  transit capacity and transport capacity of railways have further  increased and the demand of the national economy for transport  is met fully. This year, the DPRK Government envisages  increasing investment in the railway transport domain in the  state budget 3 percent compared with last year.</p>

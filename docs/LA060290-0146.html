			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES TO USE RECLAIMED WATER  </P> <P> Newport Beach will join a program that allows cities to buy treated sewer water  from the county to use for parks, golf courses and landscaping.  </P> <P> The program will save Newport Beach about 487 million gallons of water  annually, about 11% of the city's yearly demand, according to utilities  director Robert Dixon.  </P> <P> Under the Green Acres program, the Orange County Water District will expand one  of its sewage treatment plants. Once the waste water has received a tertiary  treatment, it will be piped to delivery points for use on large areas of turf  or landscaping.  </P> <P> The cities of Fountain Valley, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa are now participating  in the reclaimed water project. Already the cities have decided on about 50  different locations where the reclaimed water will be used. These sites include  the Costa Mesa golf course, the Fountain Valley Recreation Center, Mile Square  Park and a number of area nurseries.  </P> <P> The water will be available to those three cities by the fall of 1991, when the  necessary pipelines and the treatment facility are scheduled for completion,  Fountain Valley Public Works Director Wayne Osborne said. Newport Beach will  have access to the system near the end of 1993, deputy utilities director Jeff  Staneart said.  </P> <P> Once the city is hooked up to the Green Acres network, private companies and  landowners -- such as country clubs -- can buy the reclaimed water from the  city. Big Canyon Golf Course and the Newport Beach Country Club golf course  will be the first city sites to receive the reclaimed water, Staneart said.  </P> <P> Tuesday's action by the City Council sets in motion the process of negotiations  between Newport Beach staff members and the Orange County Water District. A  skeleton agreement calls for a 25-year commitment to the project. The project  will be completely funded by the water district, though the delivery of water  to Newport Beach users will be managed by the city. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / North shows fall in confidence BUSINESS confidence in the north of England fell sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the latest Business Survey North, published yesterday. Only 16 per cent of the 582 north-eastern and Cumbrian companies surveyed expected an improvement in business conditions in the first quarter of this year and 27.9 per cent expected them to worsen. That contrasts strongly with the third-quarter Business Survey North, issued in October, when 36.7 per cent expected an improvement and only 13.6 per cent a decline, stimulating hopes that the region was moving out of recession. In the latest survey, 55 per cent of companies expected an increase in turnover this year and 19.4 per cent a drop. But 25 per cent expected profits to fall, reflecting growing pressure on margins. During the fourth quarter, sales at home and abroad rose slightly and profits improved, but investment remained weak and export orders fell. The proportion of companies working at more than 90 per cent capacity dropped from 24.6 per cent to 20.3 per cent. The survey, covering manufacturing, service and primary industries, is undertaken quarterly by the Northern Development Company and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside Chambers of Commerce and Training and Enterprise Councils. The report partly attributes the decline in confidence to worries over rising costs.</p>

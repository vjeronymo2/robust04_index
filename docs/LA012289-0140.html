			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REDSHIRT LOGAN PRAGMATIC IN DECISION NOT TO BOYCOTT  </P> <P> Kevin Logan hopes that when he returns to his San Jose State dorm tonight, his  estranged teammates can sympathize. Like an employee who crossed the picket  line during a strike, Logan is banking on a little understanding.  </P> <P> He is not necessarily expecting it.  </P> <P> "I just hope it can be normal again," Logan said. "I have no bad feelings  toward them, and I hope they have none toward me. It was their choice -- and  they chose their consequences."  </P> <P> Logan, a 1988 graduate of Westlake High, was 1 of 4 players on the San Jose  State basketball team who decided not to participate in a player walkout last  week. Ten of Logan's teammates, citing what they said was the increasingly  abrasive behavior of Coach Bill Berry, announced a boycott of all future games  unless Berry is removed from his duties as coach.  </P> <P> Logan and 3 teammates, including roommates Dwain Daniels and Tom Desiano --  both juniors -- pulled an about-face Tuesday after a meeting with Berry in  which the walkout was announced. The full roster of 14 players had entered a  verbal agreement to stick together, Logan said, but after some soul searching,  the 6-foot, 6 1/2-inch freshman decided to remain with the team. San Jose  State, using several players from the school's football team, fell to Cal State  Fullerton, 82-60, Friday, its sixth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Logan says he believes that the boycotting players are standing on firm ground  regarding Berry's gruff behavior and that he agrees in principle with the  grievances of the 10 who left. It was their method of protest -- walking away  for the rest of the season -- he said, that was unacceptable.  </P> <P> "Their complaints are true," Logan said. "I think they've just blown it out of  proportion."  </P> <P> Said Dave Logan, Kevin's father: "What (the 10 who left) are saying definitely  has merit. The way they went about changing things was foolish, though. If they  had gone through the proper channels, they wouldn't have destroyed themselves.  They wouldn't have destroyed the coach."  </P> <P> Logan was redshirting and agreed that Berry probably didn't demand as much from  him in practice as from other players. "I probably wasn't quite as pressured,"  he said.  </P> <P> Kevin Logan added, however, that Berry's practices often became unbearable for  many players. Sean Davis, a sophomore and a 1987 graduate of El Camino Real  High, said Friday that he was "even scared about shooting and scared to dribble  the ball." Damon Greer, a freshman point guard from Cleveland High who also  joined the walkout, said that the team's "confidence is totally shot."  </P> <P> Logan said he reasoned that Berry's behavior was like that of most coaches and  that sticking with the program through the lean times was all part of  fulfilling his obligations as a student on athletic scholarship.  </P> <P> "He's my first college coach," Logan said. "I pretty much thought, 'This is the  way it is,' since I had nothing to compare him to. It got pretty bad at times,  but I accepted it as part of being a college basketball player."  </P> <P> Logan said that other players were simply unable to put Berry's criticism  aside.  </P> <P> "I think it's just his way of coaching," he said. "When he'd scream at me, I'd  think about what he said, what he wanted from me. But I wouldn't carry it  around with me. It's the only way to deal with that kind of criticism."  </P> <P> Logan said no single incident triggered the walkout and that he believes player  frustration is probably the motive for the boycott. San Jose State is 5-12 and  1-7 in Big West Conference play.  </P> <P> "The big thing is that we were just losing," Logan said. "Everyone was upset  and depressed. If we'd been 15-2, you can bet this never would have happened."  </P> <P> Logan said that Daniels and Desiano decided to remain in the program because  they felt interest from other Division I schools would be nonexistent if they  tried to transfer since they each have only 1 year of eligibility remaining.  Logan said senior center-forward Jan Svoboda, a Glendale High graduate and the  only starter to remain with the team, told Logan that he decided to stay  because he wanted to finish his schoolwork and complete his senior season.  </P> <P> The 5 seniors who left the team will have no eligibility remaining unless they  return, National Collegiate Athletic Assn. representative Rick Evrard said  Friday. Evrard added that the magnitude of the boycott may be unmatched.  </P> <P> "Collectively, I've never seen or heard of a walkout similar to this," said  Evrard, a director of legislative services. "Individually it happens all the  time, but not at this scale."  </P> <P> Evrard said that players with eligibility remaining may transfer to another  school and sit out a season to satisfy the NCAA residency requirement, then  resume playing. If San Jose State chooses to revoke the scholarships of the  boycotting players, it may not refill the scholarships until next season,  Evrard said.  </P> <P> "They're non-transferable," Evrard said. "They'll have to play with whoever  they can find."  </P> <P> The boycotting players have hired the firm of San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli  to represent them. Anassociate of Belli said Friday that the players will sue  if their scholarships are revoked.  </P> <P> Dave Logan said that Berry and school athletic department officials indicated  after the Fullerton game Friday that the scholarships of the boycotting players  will be rescinded, perhaps before Thursday when the spring semester begins.  </P> <P> "They said the only guys they were even slightly interested in keeping were  Greer and David Hollaway," Dave Logan said. "The other guys are history. They  said they don't want them around anymore."  </P> <P> Dave Logan said he believes that the walkout stemmed from Berry's inability to  coach players without using critical and disparaging remarks and that Berry's  old-school philosophy was difficult for players to relate to. The boycotting  players equated Berry's coaching style to "mental cruelty" and said that  previous complaints to school administrators were ignored.  </P> <P> "I really feel sorry for Berry," the elder Logan said. "He has the best  interests of the kids at heart. In his own way he gives a lot, but the kids  don't see it.  </P> <P> "I think if he had a little better sense of humor, he might have gotten over  the hump."  </P> <P> Berry, in his 10th season, will remain as coach for the rest of the season,  athletic department officials said last week.  </P> <P> The elder Logan, who before the walkout last week advised his son to "go along  with whatever the rest of the team did," said he nonetheless supports Kevin's  decision.  </P> <P> "It would have meant wasting a year of eligibility," Dave Logan said. "It has  become a meaningless season."  </P> <P> Logan and his father met with Berry after the Fullerton game and decided that  Kevin, who did not play in the Fullerton game, will continue to redshirt.  </P></p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strategists ponder prospects for Swedish shares Several capitals were on holiday for Assumption Day. Activity in working bourses reflected this, and the hiatus between last week's interest rate increases and this week's FOMC and Bundesbank meetings, writes Our Markets Staff. Currency weakness after the Swedish and Italian rate rises led Mr Sushil Wadhwani, a senior strategist at Goldman Sachs, to expect Stockholm and Milan to underperform Europe in the short term, adding the rider that Swedish equities were 'already significantly undervalued on a medium term sense'. His counterpart at Lehman Brothers, Mr Joe Rooney, was less reserved, increasing his weighting in Sweden from 3 per cent to 4.4 per cent. There was precedent, said Mr Rooney, for expecting equity performance from Sweden after the initial increase in interest rates. He called Stockholm: 'A well managed, growth market which is cheap, and where the flow of earnings is not dependent on the domestic economy.' FRANKFURT pounced delightedly on reports, confirmed by the company, that Hoechst had found a way to transform ozone into oxygen using a synthetic agent. The shares rose DM8.50 to DM356 as the Dax index moved ahead 14.16 to 2,138.44. Mr Jorg Blattermann, a trader at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, said that the story was tailormade for Hesse, which has just brought in an ozone alarm that involves reducing speed limits when the ozone level rises above specific targets. He added that Hesse had had six days of ozone alarms in the recent hot spell. Turnover fell from DM7.7bn to DM5.1bn, Hoechst accounting for DM330m of that, against DM217m last Friday. In the post bourse, Daimler reflected futures based selling, falling from an official close of DM806 to DM799.40, down DM8 at the end of the day. AMSTERDAM took a breather following last week's heavy round of results and ahead of another batch scheduled over the next few days. The AEX index finished 0.75 easier at 415.18, after seeing a session's high of 416.31. There were slight gains in a number of the international stocks which reported last week, including Royal Dutch, up 30 cents at Fl 193.03, and Unilever, 60 cents ahead at Fl 196.50. Both Nedlloyd, the transport and shipping group, up 90 cents at Fl 70.70, and Hunter Douglas, the manufacturer of venetian blinds, outperforming the market with a gain of Fl 2.00 at Fl 85.00, are due to report half-year figures today. Hoare Govett, in a forecast of Hunter Douglas published at the end of last week, said that it expected the company to announce higher sales and earnings for the first six months of 1994, due to a good performance in North America and the Pacific. Analysts also expect a positive set of results from Nedlloyd, helped by a strong contribution from the shipping division. ZURICH waited for the US FOMC and the SMI index eased 7.8 to 2,572.7 in thin trading. Ciba-Geigy bearers rose SFr9 to SFr827 on a buy recommendation. General interest rate worries left CS Holding SFr8 lower at SFr523, but SBC held its ground at SFr394, both ahead of half-year results due this week. STOCKHOLM suffered an interrupted session owing to technical problems in the exchange's automated trading system. After a brief half- hour's resumption in the afternoon, the session was later abandoned with the Affarsvarlden general index having lost 15.70 to 1,400.60. COPENHAGEN moved lower following a disappointing half-year result from ISS, the cleaning group. The KFX index dipped 0.34 to 100.45. ISS, which posted an increased DKr235m pre-tax profit for the first half, just lower than market expectations, fell a net DKr22 to DKr197 after testing DKr190. HELSINKI weakened as many investors took stock of last week's turbulence in the money and debt markets. The HEX index receded 15.00 to 1,807.10. ISTANBUL advanced 4.4 per cent, helped by weakness in the bond market. The composite index gained 1,076.72 at 25,515.63, having risen more than 10 per cent last week. TEL AVIV had begun its week looking for trouble, the Mishtanim index falling 5.15, or 2.7 per cent, to 187.60 on Sunday in advance of Israel's monthly inflation figures. Similar apprehension yesterday took the index 0.46 lower again, to 187.14. The July consumer price index, released after trading ended, showed a rise of 1.1 per cent - a figure which, said analysts, was indeed higher than expected.

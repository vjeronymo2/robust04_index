			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within this framework, the Department is supporting the development of a nationwide system of One-Stop Career Centers through a program of grant awards, beginning with fiscal year 1994. The Department believes it is crucial to invest in developing a new National-State-Local One-Stop system, and to not just randomly fund different entities at State and substate levels. The Department believes that all levels of involvement are necessary if we are to build a system to respond to our changing global economy. Accordingly, ETA is focusing its funding strategy on awarding grants for statewide development and implementation of One-Stop Career Center systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Department also recognizes that the One-Stop system will be built on a community-by-community basis and that a number of communities have already moved forward to implement innovative One-Stop centers. The goals of this solicitation are to involve these local communities in the building of the One-Stop system from the ``bottom up'' and utilize their front-line leadership, innovation and initiative. The Department is proposing to capitalize on these innovative efforts by using them as learning laboratories for wide-spread system development. These local sites can offer lessons for the rest of the system; provide technical assistance and guidance to States and communities; and serve as test sites to guide design, development and innovation throughout the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the interest of insuring that these local sites fit into the broader national strategy, the local One-Stop design must be able to achieve the same broad outcome objectives which guided the Department's investment decisions for statewide One-Stop Career Center systems. The broad outcome objectives that ETA believes should guide all State and local One-Stop systems are described in Part II. In addressing these outcomes in the application, applicants need to refer to Part II. G. STATEMENT OF WORK/GRANT APPLICATION, Section 1. (a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part II. Application Process_All Information Required To Submit a Proposal Is Contained in This Announcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This competition is open to all local entities. For the purposes of this solicitation, a ``local entity'' is any public agency or consortium of agencies (both public and private) for a geographic area which contains a local One-Stop Career Center system as described in Part I. Only one local entity may make an application on behalf of a geographic area, which shall not be smaller than a Service Delivery Area (SDA). In the case of single SDA States, more than one sub-State application may be submitted provided that the applications are from distant geographic areas of the State. The application must be transmitted by the Chief Elected Official(s) that represent(s) the geographic area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grant application must be reviewed by the appropriate State and local officials who currently participate in this local One-Stop Career Center system or who will be a participant as the local system becomes part of a larger statewide system. At the State level, the Governor, or the Governor's designated representative, must review, and have the opportunity to comment on and indicate, by signature, that the opportunity for review has been provided. Note that approval of the application by the Governor is not required, except for States that received one-stop implementation grants. Since these States have been funded to implement a statewide one-stop system, the Governor or his/her designated representative must indicate support for the proposal as being consistent with the statewide one-stop system. Appropriate State agency heads (e.g., JTPA and Employment Security Officials) or the State's Human Resource Council or similar body, if such body exists, should also have the opportunity to review and comment on the grant application and demonstrate by appropriate signature level that such opportunity for review has been provided. Comments received from the Governor or from State agencies should be included as an attachment to the proposal. In addition, employee organizations representing affected workers must be given the opportunity to review and comment on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the local level, participating program/agency heads must have the opportunity to review the proposal. Evidence of this review opportunity of the grant application by participating organization and/or agency heads, and PIC chairs must be included with the application. Letters of support may be included as examples of evidence of concurrence by both State and local entities who have reviewed the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Grant Awards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has allocated $3.5 million for these grants for up to 10 grants. The funding period is 15 months from the date of award. Funding for subsequent years may be available, contingent upon the continued availability of funds, the activity funded, and upon satisfactory performance in the prior year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Use of Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Funds received under this grant are intended to support implementation of specific new features of the local One-Stop system, to evaluate the effectiveness of these new approaches, to offset the expenses involved in providing technical assistance to other States and localities, and in disseminating information. These funds may not be used to support on-going, existing activities or new construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Use of Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will utilize the information contained in the proposals submitted to further document progress and approaches of State and local areas in building One-Stop and Labor Market Information (LMI) systems. The data submitted will be analyzed and used for two primary purposes: (1) To share innovations and successes with the public; and (2) to bolster our request to Federal policymakers and funders by utilizing the best facts available regarding the One-Stop system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

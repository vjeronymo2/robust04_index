			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Growth pains After Friday's 53-point fall, the UK equity market has at least been spared any further unpleasant surprises over the long holiday weekend. The US was also closed yesterday, but continental European markets regained some of their composure. German equities were somewhat lower, but bond markets there and in France recovered part of the lost ground. Maybe bargain hunters will appear in London, too, but equities still do not appear to enjoy solid support. For a start, there is today's MO number to worry about. Second, the recovery increasingly appears to be gathering strength despite April's tax increases. Gilts can hardly relish worries about base rates when the government still has a heavy borrowing programme to complete.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: The island where inquiries reach a dead end - All roads in the Polly Peck scandal lead to Cyprus. Asil Nadir brought much investment to the eastern Mediterranean island but millions from his international empire also drained away there THE BATTERED remains of Mr Asil Nadir's once high-flying business empire lie in a dusty corner of the Mediterranean, tucked close to the Turkish mainland. An unseemly squabble has been under way in northern Cyprus for more than two years over the last scraps of the carcass of Polly Peck International, a group whose activities at its height ranged from fresh fruit to hotels and electronics. So far the wrangle has produced no cash, just frustration for the army of lawyers and accountants trying to recover the Pounds 1bn that Polly Peck owed to its creditors. For serious students of Polly Peck, all roads have always led to northern Cyprus, Nadir's birthplace. The self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot republic remained his home throughout the period that he built Polly Peck from an East End clothing company to a disparate group with operations around the world. Thanks to the investment he brought to the island - much of it financed by Polly Peck's creditors - Mr Nadir has enjoyed the status of a local hero. Northern Cyprus was also the drain down which Polly Peck's wealth eventually disappeared. Some Pounds 500m of the group's cash was sucked into the republic. Investigators trying to find out where it went next have found the trail difficult to follow. Much of that money is alleged to have been routed back from Cyprus into banks in London, to buy shares in Polly Peck as part of an illegal operation to support the company's share price in the late 1980s. Mr Nadir personally borrowed millions of pounds more from banks to finance further share purchases in a move which was to push him deep into debt and eventually, when Polly Peck collapsed, into bankruptcy. Much of the money routed to Cyprus has not been traced at all. More than Pounds 200m was supposedly used to buy development land in the republic. However, Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, in charge of the Polly Peck administration, said yesterday no leases on the land were ever granted, and the property remains in the possession of the government of the republic. Where the cash went is not known. The breakaway republic has presented countless other problems for Polly Peck's bankers and other creditors. Lawyers have fought to establish their claims over Polly Peck assets on the island, a process which has been hampered by the fact that the republic is not recognised by the UK (or any other country except Turkey). Attempts to sue the Central Bank of Turkish Cyprus, and against Mr Mentes Aziz, the lawyer against whom charges were brought and later dropped by the Serious Fraud Office, have all come to nothing. A settlement was agreed last week with the central bank, and a settlement to the claim against Mr Aziz has also been negotiated, Mr Jordan said yesterday. He added said that he had received assurances from Mr Aziz yesterday that Mr Nadir's departure for northern Cyprus would not interfere with the sale of Polly Peck's businesses on the island, which include hotels and fruit processing and packaging plants. The pressure being put on the Turkish Cypriot government for Mr Nadir to return for trial, though, suggests that relations could take another turn for the worse. It is all a long way from the late 1980s, when Mr Nadir's Polly Peck had appeared to secure itself a special position among the many wonder-stocks produced during that decade. The company's share price had jumped more than a thousand-fold in ten years as it climbed into the list of the top 100 UK-based groups, making it the best-performing stock of the decade. Its operations included the Del Monte fresh fruit business, since sold by the administrators, and Sansui, the Japanese electronics company. The trappings of wealth assembled by Mr Nadir during the rise of Polly Peck  -the racehorse, the paintings, the country estate - were all to be stripped away later by bankruptcy. Mr Neil Cooper, a partner with accountants Robson Rhodes, who is trustee in bankruptcy to Mr Nadir, said: 'I am still hopeful that Mr Nadir might find he is able to put together an offer to his creditors that might be acceptable. Otherwise he will be an undischarged bankrupt all his life. I believe he would prefer to return to London where he has chosen to live.' However, Mr David Pollock of accountants Touche Ross, who is working on the recovery of assets for the administration, said that if the Serious Fraud Office decided to drop criminal action against Mr Nadir, that could speed up civil action under which the administrators are trying to recover Pounds 370m from Mr Nadir. 'We will continue our investigations. I assume it won't get any easier,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> We were in our jazz phase the other day at home. Shucked our identity, rolled  it up and threw it in the back of the closet.  </P> <P> Put it back on later. We were going to coast for a while.  </P> <P> We slid on the Ray Bans.  </P> <P> Our walk was slow and purposeful. The voice was mellow. Throaty.  </P> <P> The Formidable Companion called us by name. We didn't answer.  </P> <P> "Call us Buddy or Red or Miles or Coleman or Lester or Thelonious," we said,  finally.  </P> <P> "Hush Mouth is more like it," she said.  </P> <P> Hush Mouth. We liked that. This woman had potential.  </P> <P> She watched us for a few minutes make a fool of ourselves playing air saxophone  to the record player, then told us that versatile reed man Buddy Collette would  be leading a quintet in an evening of jazz at the Beverly Hills Library on  Saturday at 8 p.m. Vocalist Cheryl Conley would also be on the bill. Admission  would be $15. Would we want to go?  </P> <P> "Solid," we said.  </P> <P> "Idiot," she replied. R. D.  </P></p>

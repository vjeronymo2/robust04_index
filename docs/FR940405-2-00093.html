This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on February 23, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.05%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $2,845,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 10.5% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.05%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 10.74% to 5.35%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regulation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  24 CFR 811.107(a)(2), 811.107(b), 811.108(a)(1), 811.108(a)(2), 811.108(a)(3), 811.114(b)(3), 811.114(d), 811.115(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project/Activity: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Memphis, Tennessee HA refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Southwood Townhouses Apartments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature of Requirement: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Granted By: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Nicolas P.

This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on March 2, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.07%.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Hu Xiaoguang </F> (5170 2556 0342)]    [Text] Bishkek, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and  Kyrgyz Republic President Askar Akayev held 150-minute talks at  the Government Building this morning, during which they had an  in-depth exchange of views on relations between the two  countries and on regional issues. The talks proceeded in a  cordial and friendly [qin qie you hao 6024 0434 0645 1170]  atmosphere.    President Akayev first warmly welcomed Premier Li Peng to  the  Kyrgyz Republic. Akayev said emphatically: In his important  speech in Tashkent, Premier Li Peng set forth China's clear-cut  principles for developing good-neighborly and friendly relations  with Central Asian nations. These principles are of great  significance to peace and stability in Kyrgyzstan and in the  entire Central Asian region. He maintained that China, as a  permanent member of the UN Security Council, plays a special  positive role in international affairs.    Akayev noted: As a young country that became independent not  long ago, Kyrgyzstan needs to learn from China's experiences,  including those in international activities. He expressed the  hope that diplomats from the two countries would maintain  consultations and strengthen cooperation in international  organizations.    Premier Li Peng first conveyed President Jiang Zemin's  cordial greetings to President Akayev. Li Peng said: China and  Kyrgyzstan share a common border and a traditional friendship.  Relations between the two countries have developed smoothly  since Kyrgyzstan became independent. For its part, China is  willing to work hard to deepen this friendship continuously.  Akayev asked Li Peng to convey his regards to President Jiang  Zemin, as well as his invitation to the latter to visit  Kyrgyzstan.    Akayev said: Strengthening cooperation with China in various  fields -- political, economic, scientific and technological, and  cultural -- is in the paramount interests of the Kyrgyz nation;  it also represents a priority in Kyrgyzstan's foreign policy.  President Akayev agreed with the idea proposed by Premier Li  Peng for building a new silk road. He said: Kyrgyzstan will  work toward this goal so that the new silk road will become a  path of cooperation and friendship. He noted: Kyrgyzstan will  always see China as a friendly neighbor of Central Asian  nations, as well as a cooperative partner that inspires mutual  trust.    On the Sino-Kyrgyz border issue, the two sides maintained  unanimously: At present, it is necessary to expeditiously turn  previously concluded agreements into a legal form and implement  them accordingly. Meanwhile, friendly negotiations on some  remaining issues should be continued. In light of sincerity on  both sides, it is believed that the border issue between the two  countries will be successfully resolved in the not-too-distant  future. Li Peng said: Reaching a border agreement at an early  date will be of great significance to strengthening Sino-Kyrgyz  relations. It is hoped that the border between the two  countries will become a bond of peace and friendship, as well as  a bridge leading to economic prosperity.    Akayev said: Economic cooperation and trade between the two  countries have shown strong momentum. China has become an  important trade partner of Kyrgyzstan's. Kyrgyzstan hopes to  raise economic relations and trade between the two countries to  a new level. Chinese enterprises are welcome to invest in  Kyrgyzstan. He noted: Some of the joint ventures that  Kyrgyzstan set up along with China's Xinjiang region have  yielded positive results; there is still vast potential in this  regard. Akayev also spoke highly of fruitful cooperation  between scientific and technological personnel from the two  countries.    Li Peng said: China and Kyrgyzstan should strengthen  cooperation in such fields as economics, trade, science and  technology, and culture. He noted: "Since Kyrgyzstan became  independent, trade between the two countries, border trade in  particular, has grown substantially. I agree that economic  relations and trade should be further expanded on the basis of  equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese Government adopts a  positive attitude toward investment by Chinese entrepreneurs in  Kyrgyzstan."    Premier Li Peng added: China supports the maintenance of  friendly relations among Central Asian nations and between  Central Asian nations and Russia. President Akayev said: The  relations between Central Asian nations and Russia have been  formed over the years, and it is very important to maintain good  relations with each other.    The two leaders also had an in-depth exchange of views on  some regional issues.</p>

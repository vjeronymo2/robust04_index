			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cluff Resources gold loan CLUFF RESOURCES, the mining and minerals group, is negotiating a 20,000 ounce gold loan to finance mining development in Zimbabwe. Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that the company would borrow the gold from a bullion house at an interest rate of between 5 and 6 per cent, repayable over three years. The loan would eliminate costly Zimbabwe bank loans and permit development of the Freda Rebecca mine where underground production is expected to be 5,000 ounces this year. Cluff is also buying a 70 per cent interest in Aberfoyle Holdings, a private company with operations and assets in Zimbabwe, for about Pounds 800,000. The acquisition is being financed partly by the sale of Pounds 670,000 worth of shares in Cluff Resources Pacific, an Australian associate.</p>

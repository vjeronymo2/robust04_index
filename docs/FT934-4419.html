			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dresdner defends record earnings Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank, yesterday delivered a pungent defence of the German banking sector's right to make record profits amid the country's worst recession since the second world war. Speaking as Dresdner, Germany's second biggest bank after Deutsche Bank, unveiled operating profits up by 16.2 per cent to DM1.6bn (Dollars 932m) for the first 10 months of 1993, Mr Sarrazin contended that banks' profitability served to limit the extent of the crisis in the German economy. 'Now is just the right time for banks to show their strength as a frail financial sector would push the economy as a whole deeper into crisis,' Mr Sarrazin said Despite sharply increased provisions against bad and doubtful debts, buoyant securities markets seem set to ensure that German banks will enjoy another record year this year. Last week Commerzbank - Germany's third largest bank - reported profits up 52 per cent at the 10-month stage and next week Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, is also likely to report a further acceleration in profits growth. As at other banks, the impetus for Dresdner's profits growth came from securities trading: the contribution from the bank's own-account trading activities more than doubled to DM536.1m after DM234.5m in the comparable period last year. Commission income grew by 15.9 per cent to DM2.37bn, again reflecting buoyant currency, equity, fixed-income and derivatives markets. Net interest income - the profit on mainstream lending business - climbed by a more modest 6.8 per cent to DM5.11bn. Risks provisions rose 23.8 per cent to DM1.25bn, reflecting the malaise of the bank's corporate clients. Mr Sarrazin said the dividend would probably be raised by DM1 to DM13. The decision would be taken on the basis of full-year results.</p>

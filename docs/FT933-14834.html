			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Government to clamp down on West End ticket agencies TICKET agencies which exploit West End theatregoers, especially tourists, are to be curbed by the government. Some buyers have ended up paying Pounds 45 for a Pounds 7 balcony seat at Miss Saigon. Resellers of tickets for theatres, concerts and similar events will be forced to tell the customer the standard of the seat being offered, including its face value. Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday: 'Unless they buy directly from the box office, consumers can often pay Pounds 50 or more for a ticket whose face value is much lower, say Pounds 6. People may not find this out until they collect the ticket just before the performance.' Ms Susan Whiddington, development officer of the Society of West End Theatre, said: 'This is the best news we could possibly have.' Her organisation receives up to 30 complaints a week from disgruntled tourists and has long pushed for a change in the law. The new legislation is not aimed specifically at ticket touts. The feeling is that someone who buys a ticket in the street does not deserve protection. The main problem is the 130 or so ticket agencies that have sprung up throughout the West End and which have an aura of respectability. They extract exorbitant sums from theatregoers, give them a voucher and then arrange for a low-price ticket to be collected at the theatre. Although most of the trade is in tickets for the handful of popular, sold-out shows such as Phantom of the Opera and Crazy for You, the agencies also take advantage of the ignorance of visitors by selling them tickets for plays that are easy to get into. One recent complaint came from an out-of-town holidaymaker who paid Pounds 25 for a Pounds 14 ticket for The Mousetrap, which has been running for more than 40 years. Many of the 50 theatres in the West End have tickets readily available for most weekday performances this summer. The recession has reduced audiences by 3 per cent on last year's level. Half-price tickets to some shows are sold from an official booth in Leicester Square, and other two-for-one schemes exist. Specialist agencies, such as Ticket Master, First Call and Edwards &amp; Edwards, invariably tell their customers that they are charging a premium of up to 25 per cent on the face value of their tickets.

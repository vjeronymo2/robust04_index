			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Nadav Shragay] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres and U.S. President Bill Clinton held a meeting yesterday.  Following the meeting, President Clinton said that "the coming  year is the right time for introducing a change in the Middle  East; the United States and I myself are willing to exert great  efforts to help create a new situation in the region."    The President added that Peres' ideas regarding a regional  framework for security and peace are appropriate, and that he  recognizes the logic behind them and wants to encourage their  promotion "through an attentive and helpful administration."    In the meeting it was agreed that the United States will  undertake to create a "superstructure on a higher level than the  multilateral negotiations framework." Peres said that the new  structure, which will be similar to the CSCE, will include  "three baskets": Security (arms control), economic (a regional  market), and human rights. Israel will work out the plan  together with the State Department. Peres assesses that Middle  East countries which so far have refrained from active  participation in the multilateral track will take part in the  new initiative.    According to Peres, the Americans believe the Oman, Qatar,  and Tunisia multilateral conferences played an important role.  He divulged that these conferences were preceded by secret  meetings between himself and the foreign ministers of Qatar and  Oman in Cairo. Peres added that two more Arab countries will  host multilateral meetings.    Yesterday Peres told U.S. congressmen that the sending of  U.S. troops to the Golan Heights does not top Israel's list of  requests. He said Israel will refrain from requesting to send  U.S. soldiers to defend its citizens, "in order not to worry  American mothers."    Despite Prime Minister Rabin's remarks downplaying the  significance of 'Arafat's comments, Peres and Secretary of State  Christopher yesterday demanded that 'Arafat reaffirm his  commitment to the peace process. Christopher said: "It would  be very helpful if 'Arafat once again stated his desire for  peace. Commitments were made, and it is important that they be  honored. We need an atmosphere in which we can work with mutual  confidence."    Peres demanded that the PLO leader issue a "clear statement"  reaffirming three points: his adherence to the Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington on mutual recognition between  the PLO and Israel; "denouncing all forms of terror and  violence"; and promising that "all differences of opinion  regarding the agreement be settled through diplomacy and in  peaceful ways."    Speaking yesterday at the Carnegie Institute, Peres said  that  Israel and the PLO have not worked out a secret agreement  regarding the holy sites in Jerusalem. According to Peres the  Jerusalem issue "remains open religiously, but is closed  politically. In due course Jordan will play a role in any  agreement regarding Jerusalem, and will have an important role  in safeguarding the holy sites."    Prior to his meeting with Peres, Christopher said that for  the benefit of the bilateral talks, it is preferable not to  convene all four tracks in Washington at the same time, adding  that some of the tracks should be conducted in the region. He  also said that no date has been determined for the resumption of  the Washington talks. Earlier, Peres said that the Palestinians  prefer to hold the autonomy talks on the rest of the West Bank  in our region. [passage omitted]</p>

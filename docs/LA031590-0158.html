			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL SUPPORTS VALLEY LIGHT-RAIL  LINE  </P> <P> The three-member Los Angeles City Council Transportation Committee agreed  Wednesday to endorse a San Fernando Valley rail line over two other proposed  lines elsewhere in the county.  </P> <P> The three council members, each of whom had previously declared their support  for extending the downtown Metro Rail subway 5.6 miles west from North  Hollywood, voted to recommend that the full council adopt the same position  next week.  </P> <P> Rival projects are a downtown-to-Pasadena light-rail line and a northward  extension of the Century Freeway light-rail line from El Segundo to Marina del  Rey.  </P> <P> Councilman Nate Holden, the committee chairman, predicted that the full council  will "easily pass" the Valley plan and send it on to the Los Angeles County  Transportation Commission, which has the final say.  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Burden of fuel tax on Northern Ireland Sir, Samuel Brittan (December 8) maintains that the imposition of the standard rate of VAT on fuel would not have been detrimental for low-income households since 'this would have been more than offset by the benefits package'. This assertion may be true for the average low-income household in the United Kingdom but not for those in Northern Ireland. Average fuel expenditure in the province according to the 1992 Family Expenditure Survey was Pounds 15.24 a week compared with Pounds 13.02 for the UK as a whole. If the 1992 survey is used (as this is the most recent one available at the level of individual household) then the net change from the imposition of VAT on fuel for households in the lowest quintile is a loss of about Pounds 1.20 per week. (The estimate assumes that the 1992 consumption pattern does not alter in the face of the tax rise.) Now, a loss of Pounds 1.20 may be considered of little consequence to the average citizen, but when average gross incomes are Pounds 82 the concern is understandably more acute. The MPs from Northern Ireland all voted against extension of VAT in a refreshing display of solidarity. In the light of the above I hope that Mr Samuel Brittan was not including them among the 'unprincipled small parties'. The threat of losing the vote prompted a proposal from the government to extend the compensation scheme - we would assert that the countering of the threat was the only principle that motivated the government.

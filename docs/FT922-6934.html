			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: House products group tumbles 28% TOYO Sash, Japan's top maker of aluminium housing products, revealed a 14.6 per cent drop to Y32.5bn (Dollars 244.36m) in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to end-March. Net profits also fell sharply, by 28.6 per cent to Y14.8bn, although sales climbed a modest 4 per cent to Y481bn. A sharp drop in demand in the second half - reflecting the nation's stock market troubles - and a private sector spending downturn were behind the profit retreat, the company said. Sales of housing sashes, which account for over half of company sales, grew 1.1 per cent to Y280bn. Building sash sales grew 10.6 per cent to Y148bn, due largely to new products for high-rise structures. Turnover of housing equipment and other products also gained 11.5 per cent to Y14bn. However, construction material sales were off 0.2 per cent to Y38.7bn. Toyo Sash, which sells all of its products domestically, is planning to change its name to Tostem after July 1, to reflect a shift to more diversified housing products manufacturing. The company said the outlook for the current year for another official discount rate cut was unlikely to push housing investment sharply higher and spark a rebound in its results. Toyo Sash expects a 6 per cent gain in sales to Y510bn. Pre-tax profits are expected to rise 1.5 per cent to Y33,000bn, and net profits 11 per cent to Y16,500bn.</p>

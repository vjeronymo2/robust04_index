			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed answer to reader's letter: "They Would Seem </F> Not To Be There. But They Are Shooting" -- first paragraph is  reader's letter]    [Text] Is it true that Afghan mojahedin are taking part in  the war between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan? [signed] I.  Kirillov, Moscow.    Recently the 20-year-old Afghan mojahedin Bakhtlyar  Verballakh Baberzaid [name as transliterated], was captured by  the Karabakh side in Azerbaijan's Fizulinskiy Rayon. The young  captive, who comes from the Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, told  an INTERFAX correspondent that in his opinion there are  2,000-2,500 Afghan mojahedin permanently in the Azerbaijan army.  He said that up to 250 mojahedin are fighting on the  Fizulinskiy Rayon salient alone, where he was in command of a  detachment of 20 men.    The prisoner also reported that in Azerbaijan he was  promised  remuneration of up to $5,000 a month. For the first two months  -- a trial period -- he was paid in local currency, 1,000 manats.    He said that the Afghan mojahedin are mostly used in the  infantry, in the assault detachments since most of them have  rich experience of warfare in mountain conditions and have an  excellent mastery of all types of firearms, mainly  Soviet-produced ones.</p>

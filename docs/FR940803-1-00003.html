			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its collection efforts, the committee has requested delinquent handlers to promptly submit assessment payments. However, such requests have not substantially decreased the frequency of delinquent payments. To facilitate the collection of assessments needed for the maintenance and functioning of the committee, the committee recommended that a late payment charge of five (5) percent of the unpaid assessment balance be applied to any handler account more than thirty days overdue, and an interest charge of one (1) percent per month be applied to any assessment balance, plus the late payment charge, remaining unpaid after sixty days. The interest charge added to the bill after 60 days would be compounded monthly until the delinquent handler's assessment plus late payment charge and unpaid interest charges have been paid in full. The committee believes these charges are high enough to encourage timely payment of assessments, and are within the interest range customarily charged by banks on commercial accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal is intended to encourage handlers to pay their assessments when due, thereby eliminating potential inequities. The committee believes that the recommended action is the only alternative available to ensure timely payments. The proposal is expected to reduce the need for Department involvement with compliance efforts and thereby reduce the costs for the government to administer the marketing order program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1988 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection requirements that are contained in this proposal have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0112.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. A 15-day comment period is considered appropriate because any changes to the regulations, if adopted, should be in effect as soon as possible to encourage timely payments. All comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 947  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Potatoes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 947 is proposed to be amended as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

In the event the handler fails to pay the delinquent assessment amount, plus the late payment charge, within 60 days following the billing date, an additional one percent interest charge shall be applied monthly thereafter to the unpaid balance, including any accumulated interest.

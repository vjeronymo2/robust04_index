The storage products and microcomputer-products units  will have their own manufacturing operations.  </P> <P> Chairman Roger W. Johnson said the moves will allow "closer coordination with  our customers from design through production." Some manufacturing functions,  including large-scale integration for certain chip products and the development  of new technology, will remain centralized.  </P></p>

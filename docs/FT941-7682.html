			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Dresdner Bank anger at tax raids Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank, is set to lodge a formal complaint with the constitutional court over the conduct of tax authorities in a series of recent raids at the bank's main branches in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf. The bank said yesterday it had been advised the raids were unconstitutional. Up to 40 investigators have been involved in the tax probe, which focuses on allegations that Dresdner bank employees have helped customers evade tax by transferring money to Luxembourg. With court approval the tax authorities have also confiscated mail sent from Luxembourg to Dresdner's Dusseldorf branch. The probe has sent shock-waves through the German banking community. Wealthy Germans have transferred tens of billions of D-Marks to Luxembourg in recent years to evade taxes but German financial institutions are prohibited from actively promoting such business. The law was toughened last year to oblige banks to check the identification and tax position of people making large cash deposits. The tax authorities alleged that Dresdner employees deliberately left off details of customers, names and addresses from forms transferring money from Germany to the Grand Duchy. Dresdner says this is in itself not illegal and claims that the authorities have abused the constitution.</p>

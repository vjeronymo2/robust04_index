			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / MPs to probe capacity in steel industry An influential committee of MPs is to probe the British steel industry in a move timed to coincide with the announcement of a package of capacity cuts by European Union steel producers. The Commons trade and industry committee will focus on the consequences of the EU initiative for domestic steel-makers. It aims to complete its report by December. Mr Richard Caborn, committee chairman, said there was 'great concern across the whole of the British steel industry' about the EU package. 'Yet again we potentially have to take cuts in our steel industry when we have already restructured and made Britain the most efficient steel producer in the world,' he added. He called for 'far better policing of capacity cuts and financial restructurings than is in place at the moment'. Non-subsidised steelmakers have been given until November to finalise a package of cuts, which need to be agreed before the European Commission will approve an Ecu240m (Pounds 189m) aid package. British Steel is not offering any cuts. The extended deadline for the cuts, agreed earlier this year between industry chiefs and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, averted a collapse in relations between the commission and unsubsidised EU steel producers. These companies have been reluctant to offer the full amount of capacity cuts required by the commission because they do not believe the commission has taken a tough enough line on curbing subsidies to some producers, mainly in Germany, Italy and Spain. The European Court recently confirmed it was to investigate a complaint from British Steel about subsidies received by Ilva of Italy and CSI of Spain. The two companies received the lion's share of Ecu7bn of aid approved by EU industry ministers in December and authorised by the commission in April. Under the chairmanship of Mr Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, the trade and industry committee has developed a reputation for delivering timely and hard-hitting reports on controversial subjects, including the coal industry, the Post Office and optical-fibre networks.</p>

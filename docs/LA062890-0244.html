			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MARCOS, KHASHOGGI ASSAILED  </P> <P> Imelda Marcos and Adnan Khashoggi heard themselves described as willing  participants in a complex scheme of fraud and deception as government  prosecutors wrapped up their case against the pair.  </P> <P> Asst. U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella delivered a final, stinging rebuttal to the  defense today.  </P> <P> He stacked packs of Philippine pesos on the rail of the jury box to dramatize  his claim that Marcos knew her husband, the late President Ferdinand Marcos,  was enriching himself by stealing millions from his country's treasury.  </P> <P> And he charged that Khashoggi knew a U.S. federal court injunction had frozen  the Marcoses' U.S. assets before he agreed in 1986 to backdate documents to  show that he, not they, owned four New York buildings and some paintings.  </P> <P> "When you look at all the evidence you will be convinced beyond a reasonable  doubt that Imelda Marcos is guilty and that Adnan Khashoggi also is guilty,"  LaBella told the jurors.  </P> <P> Today, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan instructed the jurors on the law in  the case. The jurors, who will be sequestered at the close of his charge, were  to begin deliberations in the afternoon.  </P></p>

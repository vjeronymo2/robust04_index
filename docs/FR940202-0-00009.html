			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that the Board define the 15-month rolling period in the quantitative test with reference to the time parties enter into a master agreement, not the time of the first transaction under that agreement. In the absence of a master agreement, the commenter suggested that the period be measured with reference to a particular netting transaction. In practice, to determine whether a party meets the quantitative test, the 15-month period will date back from the day a party enters into a netting contract, whether or not that netting contract is a master agreement. Thus, on a particular day (``Day X''), a party meets the quantitative test if its financial contracts, as defined in the rule, met one of the rule's threshold levels on any day during the previous 15 months. Assuming the party qualifies as a financial institution and enters into a netting contract, as defined in the Act, on Day X, &sect;231.3(b) of the rule provides that the netting contract will be covered by the Act's provisions regardless of whether the party ceases to qualify as a financial institution on a subsequent day. If the netting contract that the party enters into on Day X is a master agreement, e.g., an agreement to net specified types of underlying transactions that the counterparties may enter into in the future, &sect;231.3(b) would provide that netting under that master agreement would continue to be protected under the Act even though the party enters into individual underlying transactions after it ceases to qualify as a financial institution. The Act's provisions would not extend to netting under any new master agreement entered into after the party ceases to qualify as a financial institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Board List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters requested that the Board keep a list of entities that have declared themselves to be financial institutions. The Board believes that the commenters' concerns about lack of certainty are largely addressed by allowing counterparties to rely on an institution's representation that it will act as a market intermediary and creating an incentive for institutions to publish volume threshold information to establish that they meet the quantitative test. Thus, the Board does not believe an ``official'' list is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Automatic Stays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 405 of the Act provides that no injunction or similar order issued by a court or agency will interfere with the application of netting. One commenter believed that section 405 could be interpreted so as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to override provisions for automatic stays in bankruptcy under federal or state law. The commenter asked that the Board indicate its view on this matter. Although the Board cannot authoritatively interpret the provisions of the Act, the Board believes the intent of the Act is to override the automatic statutory bankruptcy stays for valid netting contracts. Sections 403 and 404 of the Act explicitly provide that netting is effective ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' The Board believes that section 405 was included to clarify that the netting provisions override court or agency actions in addition to overriding statutory law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> CFTC Comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) noted that it can exempt certain contracts between ``appropriate persons'' from the Commodity Exchange Act's (CEA's) exchange-trading requirement and has done so for certain swaps, hybrid instruments, and energy contracts. The CFTC may also exempt appropriate multilateral netting arrangements, in which case the arrangement may not meet the Act's definition of clearing organization, which refers to an organization that ``performs clearing functions for a contract market designated pursuant to the CEA.'' The CFTC stated that it would like to work with the Board to ensure that a clearing organization exempted by the CFTC would be covered by the Act's netting provisions. The Board is willing to work with the CFTC in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Under the new electoral law, parliament members are directly  elected from the country's 450 constituencies and a candidate  must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win.    The new parliament will retain its original name of "Supreme  Soviet" and the term of office will be four years instead of the  former five.    Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, casting his ballot late  this morning, said he hoped that professionals who favored  market economic reform and democracy would enter the new  parliament.    Earlier, parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch predicted that the  new parliament "might not necessarily turn out on March 27," but  he was confident that the second round of election on April 10  would be successful.    A voter turnout of more than 50 percent is required by the  law for the validity of election and at least 300 members are  needed for a quorum.    The latest official statistics show 62 percent of the 5,833  registered candidates in the election run as independents or  represent collectives.    More than one quarter of the candidates have political party  affiliations though only 11 percent represent parties.    Among the 18 parties taking part in the election, the  Ukrainian Communist Party, the Nationalist Rukh Party and the  Socialist Party have the most candidates.    The election has drawn worldwide attention with 50 countries  and 11 international organizations having sent their observers  to Ukraine.    Witnesses have reported a smooth ongoing of the polls in  several constituencies. Initial results are yet to come out.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHDIOCESE TO OFFER HELP IN OVERCOMING POST-ABORTION GUILT  </P> <P> Disputing the U.S. surgeon general's view that conclusive evidence is lacking  for post-abortion syndrome, Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony announced the  formation Wednesday of a Los Angeles archdiocese project to counsel women,  especially Catholics, said to be suffering emotional stress after an abortion.  </P> <P> Mahony estimated that as many as 45,000 Catholics are among the 113,000 women  reported to have abortions each year within the Los Angeles archdiocese, which  covers Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.  </P> <P> "I have women come to me who have had abortions 10, 15 years ago who say  something is very wrong," the archbishop added. "Guilt is the seed, because  they know they have taken a life," he said, referring to the Catholic tenet  that human life begins at conception.  </P> <P> "We've been amazed at the number of Hispanic women, most of whom are Catholic,"  who have had abortions, Mahony said in response to a question at his news  conference. "Many never have heard or been told that it is against church  teaching."  </P> <P> Mahony took issue with U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who said on Jan. 9  that "Scientific studies do not provide conclusive data about the health  effects of abortion on women." In declining to write a long-awaited study, Koop  told President Reagan that almost 250 studies "do not support the premise that  abortion does or does not cause or contribute to psychological problems."  </P> <P> By contrast, Mahony contended that research shows that 90% of women experience  moderate to severe emotional stress after abortion.  </P> <P> Mahony indicated that the knowledge that the church prohibits abortion can  cause anguish for Catholic women who voluntarily end their pregnancies. "For  Catholics, the pain of abortion is intensified by a sense of alienation from  God and church, and the majority of Catholic women who have had abortions do  not return either to the sacraments or to the church," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeks Reconciliation  </P> <P> Project Rachel, patterned after programs in other Catholic dioceses, seeks to  reconcile remorseful women with the church after "reviving and refashioning  their vision of right and wrong," he said.  </P> <P> Frequently, around the Jan. 23 anniversary of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court  ruling permitting abortions, Catholic and conservative Protestant leaders issue  renewed statements of condemnation and often take part in anti-abortion  rallies.  </P> <P> Mahony said in an interview that this year he was limiting his "focus" to a  special Mass Sunday night at St. Andrew's Catholic Church in Pasadena where 100  priests, sisters, deacons, counselors and lay people will be commissioned as  Project Rachel volunteers.  </P> <P> He has expressed "prayerful support" for a Southern California Pastors' Rescue  rally to be held Saturday evening at St. Pancratius Catholic Church in  Lakewood, he said. But it is "not something that I or any of the other bishops  (in Los Angeles) will be involved in," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demonstration Planned  </P> <P> Father Al Howard, a rally spokesman and director of a Long Beach home for unwed  mothers, said the group on Feb. 12 will conduct the first large demonstration  in Southern California attempting to block the entrance to one or more abortion  clinics.  </P> <P> The pastors' group is unaffiliated with the nationwide Operation Rescue in  which thousands of protesters were arrested during 1988 for blocking abortion  clinic entrances, Howard said. About 650 Operation Rescue demonstrators were  arrested Jan. 14 in New York City, and the next day Cardinal John O'Connor  likened the protest to the nonviolent civil rights movement of the late Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> The emphasis in the Los Angeles archdiocese program is on "a loving, forgiving  church," a brochure says. Although it does not play down the moral gravity of  abortion, Roman Catholic canon law, revised four years ago, does not regard  those who have participated in abortion as excommunicated.  </P></p>

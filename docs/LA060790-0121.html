			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIHANOUK ACCUSES THAILAND OF AIDING PHNOM PENH REGIME  </P> <P> Prince Norodom Sihanouk, nominal head of Cambodia's three-party resistance  coalition, condemned Thailand today for allegedly working to support the  Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen government in Phnom Penh.  </P> <P> In a middle-of-the night interview with selected reporters, Sihanouk denounced  Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan and Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit  Yongchaiyudh for scrapping an agreement that the Khmer Rouge -- one of his two  coalition partners -- was prepared to accept and substituting a new formula for  peace that the Communist Khmer Rouge rejected in a two-day conference here  ending Tuesday.  </P> <P> The prince, who was ousted as Cambodia's head of state in a 1970 coup, blamed  three political advisers of Chatchai for persuading the Thai government to  scrap a cease-fire agreement that Chavalit had drawn up earlier. That agreement  was initialed in Bangkok a month ago.  </P> <P> In its place, Sihanouk charged, Chavalit presented in Tokyo a "more complicated  document" that Thailand knew the Khmer Rouge would not accept although the  essential points in both drafts were the same.  </P> <P> The three Thai advisers favor the Hun Sen government and want to stop the Khmer  Rouge guerrillas, the biggest of the resistance armies, from seizing more  territory in Cambodia by enforcing an early cease-fire, Sihanouk contended.  </P> <P> In the interview, Sihanouk roundly criticized the Tokyo agreement that he  signed Tuesday with Cambodian Premier Hun Sen. The accord calls for a  cease-fire and the convening next month of a Supreme National Council for  Cambodia.  </P> <P> "If you really want peace in Cambodia, you should do nothing to give the Khmer  Rouge a pretext to withdraw from the peace process," he said.  </P> <P> Despite his criticism of the Tokyo agreement, Sihanouk said he signed it  because it originated in Thailand.  </P> <P> "We depend on Thailand (for arms and supplies)," he said. " . . . I cannot  resist Thailand."  </P> <P> Earlier Wednesday night, Premier Hun Sen, in a news conference, also singled  out Thailand's position as one of the most significant developments to emerge  from the Tokyo conference.  </P> <P> "The Khmer Rouge could never exist without assistance from China and transit  through Thailand," he said.  </P> <P> Hun Sen said he is encouraged that Thailand now "clearly wants an early  cease-fire in Cambodia."  </P> <P> He denied that his government is trying to persuade Sihanouk and Son Sann,  leader of the third group in the resistance coalition, to join him against the  Khmer Rouge, who are blamed for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians  during their 1975-78 rule. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December, 1978, to oust  the Khmer Rouge and install the government now headed by Hun Sen.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said he favors a resolution adopted last month by the five permanent  members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Soviet Union, China,  France and Britain -- as the best hope for peace in Cambodia. That document  recognizes the four warring factions as equals, while the Tokyo agreement gives  the Hun Sen government equal standing with the three resistance factions  combined.  </P></p>

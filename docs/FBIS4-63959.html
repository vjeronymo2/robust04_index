			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Undated "Statement by the Press Service of Ukraine's </F> Ministry of Defense"]    [Text] The Russian mass media continue disseminating  gossip [plitky] on the concentration of Ukrainian troops in the  areas of Sevastopol and Simferopol. Open lies are carried with  references to Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation  Pavel Grachev and this, mildly speaking, gives rise to surprise.  It only remains to wonder whether this is yet another political  trick on the part of the Russian military ministry or its habit  to rely upon dubious information sources.    Moreover, General Grachev makes statements whose content  indicates that the Black Sea Fleet is commanded by the Defense  Ministry of the Russian Federation. Besides, the fleet receives  orders and directives from the Russian military department.  Recently, Pavel Grachev ordered to decisively "counter all  provocative actions with regard to the Black Sea Fleet  facilities...."    The Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense is  authorized to state that the interference by the Ministry of  Defense of the Russian Federation into the affairs of the united  Black Sea Fleet, which, in accordance with the Yalta accord, is  directly subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia,  impedes a civilized resolution of the problem of dividing the  fleet and creates a dangerous tension in the Crimea.</p>

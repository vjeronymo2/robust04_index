			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Liquidator sets up probe into affairs of Bristol-based bank THE ACCOUNTS of Deacon Hoare &amp; Co, a small Bristol-based bank which went into liquidation last week, are being investigated for possible irregularities, its liquidator said yesterday. Mr Peter Rilett, the liquidator appointed by the court from Peat Marwick's Bristol office, confirmed last night that he was examining movements of money from the bank into other companies which shared some directors. 'There are matters which require to be investigated but until the investigation is complete, I cannot say more,' said Mr Rilett. 'Among the matters to be investigated are transactions with related parties, some with related companies, a number of which are now in liquidation.' Three smaller companies with related directorships are also now in liquidation or receivership. They include Regent Leasing and Mistral Finance. Deacon Hoare's main directors were listed in its most recent accounts as Mr Peter Garner of Bath and Mr Peter Tucker of Churt in Surrey. Mr Garner, whose wife Anne is a former director of the company, owned 86 per cent of Deacon Hoare's shares in 1990, with Mr Tucker owning most of the remainder. Deacon Hoare, one of the smallest UK institutions with a banking licence, applied for voluntary liquidation after its directors were informed that its liabilities exceeded its assets. It is understood that the Bank of England is aware of the position at Deacon Hoare. The bank provided leasing finance for offices and motor vehicles, a line of business which has been badly hit by the recession. A series of defaults on leasing agreements was blamed when it decided to go into liquidation. Deacon Hoare had fewer than 10 staff and around 200 depositors. Most balances are believed to be below Pounds 20,000, the ceiling for eligibility to recover up to 75 per cent of savings under the Deposit Protection Board scheme. Deacon Hoare offered unusually high interest rates to savers. According to league tables prepared by Blay's Guides, a financial research company followed throughout the industry - and published in magazines and newspapers including the Financial Times - it offered the highest rate on Tax Exempt Special Saver Accounts (Tessas) in the months following their introduction last year. On February 9 1991, for example, Deacon Hoare's Tessa offered 15.87 per cent. The next highest rate, out of more than 110 accounts on offer, was 15.5 per cent. The average was below 14 per cent. Representatives of at least one large life assurance company guided clients towards Deacon Hoare on the basis of these high rates in spite of warnings from consumer groups that unusually high interest rates usually reflect greater risk. An individual who invested the permitted maximum in a Deacon Hoare Tessa in the first two years would have put in Pounds 4,800, not including accrued interest.</p>

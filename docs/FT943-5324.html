			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Beirut strike More than 2,000 travelers bound for Europe, North Africa and Gulf states were straded at Beirut international airport on Friday when flight crews of Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, went on strike Friday demanding a pay increase. The open-ended strike by 300 pilots and flight engineers grounded at least 10 MEA aircraft. The strike was launched at the height of Lebanon's annual summer travel season. Aviation officials said negotiations were under way between the strikers and management of the state-owned airline.</p>

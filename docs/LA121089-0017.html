			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. BOGGS  </P> <P> I read with interest "The Rise and Fall of Dr. Boggs," by Doug Smith (Oct. 29),  and was not wholly surprised at the response from some of his former patients.  It amazes me that the public continues to revere the physician as some sort of  abstract God; unfortunately, many physicians also view themselves thusly. As  someone who works with MDs on a daily basis, I adhere to the belief that these  are moral men and women who run the gamut of ethical agendas and technical  expertise; corrupt individuals can be seen operating in the same forum as those  whose respect and admiration is well-deserved.  </P> <P> When choosing a physician, as when dealing with any consumer issue, it would be  advisable not to trust blindly, and remember that no allegiance to any  individual need be permanent.  </P> <P> CHERYL BROWN, R.N., San Dimas  </P></p>

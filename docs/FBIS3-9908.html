			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Let's go to another issue.  One that is, of course, also very important. We know you are  all waiting eagerly for this information. We are referring to  the situation in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, where the  peace and reconciliation talks are being held. The usual news  conference was not held after the fifth day of talks today.  During this week, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho,  Subcommander Marcos on behalf of the EZLN [Zapatist National  Liberation Army], and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, as mediator in this  conflict, held a daily news conference to give an update of the  talks to reporters at approximately 1800 to 1830.    Good evening, Jose Luis Sarmiento in San Cristobal de las  Casas. Can you tell us what happened? Why was there no news  conference?    [Sarmiento] As you said, there will be no statements to the  press on advances in the peace and reconciliation talks in  Chiapas. Francisco de los Santos, the official spokesman of the  San Cristobal de las Casas bishopric, reported there will be no  reports on the talks between Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho  Solis and the EZLN delegates until further notice. This is all  we were told. We were also told the EZLN list of demands  received positive responses.    [Announcer] We understood from the information you reported  to the first edition of the ACIR Radio News newscast at 1300  that Subcommander Marcos met with reporters who write for  newspapers in Mexican states and told them there is still a long  road to traverse to achieve peace with dignity, although  important advances had been made and significant points  resolved, 50 percent of them positively. He also said the talks  are now entering a more difficult stage.    [Sarmiento] Correct. As you reported Subcommander Marcos  said this morning the most difficult part of the talks for peace  and reconciliation in Chiapas had begun. He said peace will not  come out of San Cristobal de las Casas, only the mechanisms to  reach it. He said, as you already stated, although there have  been favorable responses to problems--especially those dealing  with health, housing, education, among others--in the Chiapas  Indian communities, those are local demands. They now also  expect a positive response to their national demands, such as  justice, land, liberty, and self- government for all the Indian  communities in the country.    [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] The points that have  yet to be discussed are the most difficult ones. We decided to  start with the points that were apparently easier to resolve, so  as to advance. The most difficult, controversial points are  the ones that follow. The talks will become more difficult,  because now we will discuss demands the companeros have asked,  not for themselves, rather, for the country. [Words indistinct]  respect for the Indians, [words indistinct] self-government  program, reform of the Fourth Article, guaranteed  self-government, and other measures [words indistinct] [end  recording]    [Sarmiento] Subcommander Marcos and the 18 EZLN delegates  who  are participating in the talks, as you said, met with  representatives of the provincial newspapers in Mexico this  morning.    In addition, the seven bishops who comprise the  Reconciliation Commission, which is presided by Adolfo Suarez  Rivera, visited the Chiapas highlands for the third time. They  said they have already seen encouraging signs in favor of peace;  nevertheless, they called on Mexican society not to close their  hearts to the just demands of the communities. Tapachula  Chiapas Bishop Felipe Arizmendi stated:    [Begin Arizmendi recording] I hope we do not close our minds  and hearts to hear the community's just demands. From the  start, the three Chiapas bishops have stated we do not agree  with the armed action, but it should serve as a warning, because  violence will erupt at any time and in any manner if margined  groups are neglected. [end recording]    [Sarmiento] All the domestic and foreign reporters who are  here in San Cristobal de las Casas are still attentive to the  peace and reconciliation talks.</p>

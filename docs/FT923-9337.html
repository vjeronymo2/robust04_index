			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Minister halts Pounds 500m development plans for Kent THE government has rejected plans for a Pounds 500m package of commercial and residential developments in an unemployment blackspot in north-east Kent. Citibank, the large US bank, and Touche Ross, the accountancy firm - the promoters of the development - had estimated that the scheme would have generated about 9,000 jobs on and around the Isle of Sheppey. The region, for which Swale Borough Council is seeking assisted area status, has an unemployment rate of more than 12 per cent. This compares with a national average of 9.6 per cent and a south-east England average of 9.2 per cent. The development plan included provision for a privately financed road tunnel linking Sheppey to the mainland, the expansion of Sheerness Dock and the construction of 3,300 homes and more than 1m sq metres of industrial and business space. Plans for the tunnel were welcomed in 1989 by the Department of Transport, which said it would be bringing forward road improvements in anticipation of the tunnel's development. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, rejecting four separate planning applications, said that he recognised the economic problems of the island but these had to be balanced against other factors. According to Mr Howard the plans would have harmed a broad range of nature conservation interests and would have meant the loss of an internationally important feeding area for migrating birds. The scale of the developments also exceeded those proposed in the area structure plan and would have led to a significant increase in traffic congestion. Citibank is estimated to have spent more than Pounds 1m financing the planning applications after Lionhope, the developer which is part of the Tudor Grange group of companies, went into administrative receivership in 1989. Touche Ross, the receiver to Lionhope, said yesterday: 'Without the second crossing of the Swale, to be paid for by Lionhope, the future development of Sheppey will suffer. In view of the high unemployment in the area it is particularly unfortunate. We must now carefully review our options.' Officials at Swale Borough Council, which covers Sheppey, Sittingbourne and Faversham, said yesterday that the government had failed to recognise the serious economic problems in the region. The four sites where developments were proposed were: Ridham on the south bank of the Swale, where the existing port was to be expanded and 220 hectares of industrial, business and warehouse space developed. Lappel Bank, where 100 hectares of land was to be reclaimed for the expansion of Sheerness Dock. Queenborough, where 300 homes were to be built alongside a marina. Minster, where 3,000 homes were planned along with schools, medical facilities, a golf course and some parkland. The government's rejection of the plans coincided with last week's decision by the European Commission to drop legal objections to five UK building projects, including the M3 motorway extension at Twyford Down, Hampshire. The EC had opposed the schemes on the grounds that environmental impact studies had not been carried out. The Nature Conservancy Council had claimed that an environmental impact study had not been carried out for the Queenborough development proposals on Sheppey.</p>

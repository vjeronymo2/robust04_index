			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORDS, ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> WUORINEN: Works for Violin and Piano (1969-1983). Benjamin Hudson, violin;  Garrick Ohlsson, piano with members of Speculum Musicae.  </P> <P> Bridge BCD 9008 (compact disc). Wuorinen, the ultimate maximalist even when  writing for solo piano ("Blue Bamboula"), solo violin ("The Long and the  Short") or the two together ("Six Pieces," "Spinoff" and "Fantasia"), composes  music that is dense in notes and allusion. He demands much of performers -- the  two here are outstanding -- and listeners, far more than most of the latter  will think is worth the effort. William Ratliff  </P></p>

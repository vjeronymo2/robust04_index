			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIRCHILD FALSIFIED TESTS ON AIRCRAFT PARTS, SUIT CLAIMS  </P> <P> Fairchild Industries is being sued for more than $200 million by three former  employees who allege that the firm's Voi-Shan unit in Chatsworth falsified test  results on nuts, bolts and rivets used in military and commercial aircraft, The  Times has learned.  </P> <P> The civil suit, which is under seal in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, was  the impetus for a separate criminal investigation of Voi-Shan that led two  weeks ago to a 48-hour search of the company's Chatsworth facility by federal  agents.  </P> <P> Both the civil suit and federal investigators allege that workers at Voi-Shan  falsified the results of required safety tests, including those measuring the  stress durability and fatigue of fasteners such as nuts and bolts.  </P> <P> Last week, Fairchild said it has sent its own team of investigators to  Chatsworth to look into the charges. The company employs more than 400 people  in Chatsworth.  </P> <P> Fairchild's annual report claims its fasteners "are installed on almost every  military and commercial aircraft. Eighty percent of the products are used in  the airframe and 20% in engines. Sixty percent of the volume is on commercial  aircraft."  </P> <P> The civil case brought against Voi-Shan was filed May 19 under the False Claims  Act, which allows individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government and  share in the recovery of any damages. The law also provides that the Justice  Department can join a False Claims suit as a plaintiff. So far, the government  has not decided what position it will take in the Voi-Shan case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Material Amount'  </P> <P> False Claims actions are sealed temporarily to give the government time to  decide whether to join a case. At that point, the suits usually are unsealed,  and defendants usually then learn about it for the first time.  </P> <P> Fairchild spokeswoman Deborah Tucker said officials at the Chantilly, Va.,  company have not seen the civil suit or "been served any notice" of it.  </P> <P> Analysts said that even if the plaintiffs win their suit, it is highly unlikely  that they will win the $200 million in damages being sought.  </P> <P> "Obviously, $200 million would be a very material amount," said Wolfgang  Demisch, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York. "That would exceed the  current market value of all of Fairchild common stock."  </P> <P> Carlyle Group, an investment group based in Washington that has a pending  $230-million bid for Fairchild, said last week that it was reconsidering the  merger attempt because of the criminal investigation into Voi-Shan.  </P> <P> Those seeking damages from Fairchild are Tom Runion, a Voi-Shan laboratory  technician from April, 1981, to June, 1988, and two unidentified former  employees.  </P> <P> Federal investigators were told that large quantities of parts passing through  Voi-Shan's facility were sold to various aerospace manufacturers, including  Boeing, Pratt &amp; Whitney, General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, General  Electric and Lockheed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Investigative Teams  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered Boeing and McDonnell Douglas to  check whether they used allegedly untested fasteners. The parts may have been  sold as early as 1980, according to an affidavit the FBI filed in early  February.  </P> <P> The affidavit was filed so the FBI and other agencies could go through the  Chatsworth plant. The investigation is being run out of the U.S. attorney's  office in Seattle and is being conducted by agents of the FBI, Internal Revenue  Service and the investigative arms of the Defense Department, Navy and Air  Force.  </P> <P> "We cannot say there is no safety problem here," said Mitch Barker, an FAA  spokesman. "That is what we are trying to find out right now."  </P> <P> At least one unidentified aerospace company has quietly launched a recall,  according to the affidavit. "A major supplier of aircraft to the Department of  Defense has had to recall delivered aircraft in a safety alert," the affidavit  said.  </P> <P> Boeing said late last week that it believes that some allegedly untested  Voi-Shan parts are on its planes but that there is no evidence they are faulty.  It also said the company has not launched a recall in connection with Voi-Shan  parts. "Boeing does not believe that either the safety or performance of its  products has been compromised," said Paul Binder, a Boeing spokesman.  </P> <P> The Seattle Times reported on Sunday that Boeing, in a cost-cutting move, may  have curtailed its own testing of Voi-Shan nuts and bolts just as federal  investigators began looking into fraud in the aerospace industry. The newspaper  said the nuts are bolts were destined for the new Air Force B-2 stealth bomber.  </P> <P> At least one Voi-Shan employee told federal investigators that faulty parts  were sent to aerospace manufacturers. For instance, parts failing saltwater  tests were "sometimes shipped for use on the F-18 military aircraft," the  employee told investigators.  </P> <P> Among the things seized by the FBI in its search of Voi-Shan's facility was a  letter dated March 18, 1983, from McDonnell Douglas that complained about rusty  bolts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Inspector 11'  </P> <P> According to the affidavit, employees at Voi-Shan used an approval stamp by an  allegedly nonexistent "Inspector 11" to falsify test results. "It is kind of  like the tag you get in a pair of new pants that says it was inspected by No.  11. Well, in this case, there was no No. 11," an FBI agent said.  </P> <P> The affidavit also said that employees would recycle test forms, white out old  numbers and then write in new, phony ones.  </P> <P> Sometimes, according to both federal investigators and the civil suit, Voi-Shan  employees were told to approve bad parts. For instance, if a sample of bolts  failed to pass a test, workers would test other samples until they could pass  the entire batch, the suit and investigators allege. Ordinarily, a company  would destroy the entire batch of bolts if the first sample failed the tests.  </P> <P> The alleged falsifications were written because "necessary testing equipment  was inoperative, the tests could not be accomplished in the available time due  to backlogs or because parts from a particular lot failed a test and it was  decided by management to approve the parts anyway," according to the affidavit.  </P> <P> The $200-million damage figure was arrived at by assuming that 10% to 20% of  the cost of the fasteners results from testing requirements, Ramsey said. Since  Voi-Shan sells $40 million to $60 million of fasteners to the government  annually and the law allows damage claims to go back seven years, actual  damages amount to roughly $35 million to $70 million, Ramsey said. Under the  law, those can be tripled.  </P> <P> In addition, the False Claims Act provides that each false certification can  result in a $5,000 to $10,000 penalty. Ramsey said there are "tens of thousands  of false statements" at issue.  </P> <P> Voi-Shan said in a sales brochure given to customers that it is the world's  largest manufacturer of fasteners. "We're making fasteners to hold the world  together, and we make sure they're the best," the brochure said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. PROBES OF VALLEY PARTS COMPANIES  </P> <P> Voi-Shan of Chatsworth is the latest San Fernando Valley area firm to be  investigated by federal authorities for allegedly selling bogus aerospace parts  or falsifying testing documents for parts installed in planes and space  equipment. Here is a list of the others:  </P> <P> A.O. Sammons: The one-man Canoga Park firm headed by Arthur O. Sammons pleaded  guilty in December to federal charges of falsifying documents showing that nuts  and bolts installed in a space laboratory had passed required safety tests.  </P> <P> Sammons was given six months to get out of the aerospace fastener business and  fined $62,150. NASA has spent more than $1 million to dismantle the space lab  so it can remove Sammons fasteners.  </P> <P> Alliance Bearing Industries: The Van Nuys company was raided last October by  the FBI as part of a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office. The  company sold more than 2,000 allegedly counterfeit ball bearings installed in  Boeing-made commercial jets.  </P> <P> Lee Aerospace: The Simi Valley company is currently under investigation by the  Inspector General's office of NASA for selling allegedly defective bolts  installed in the space shuttle Discovery.  </P> <P> Lawrence Engineering &amp; Supply: The Defense Department's Defense Criminal  Investigative Service is investigating the Burbank company for allegedly  falsifying documents that said its bolts met government safety standards. NASA  had to replace 357 potentially substandard bolts in the space shuttle Discovery  prior to its successful launch last September.  </P> <P> New Hampshire Ball Bearings: The U.S. Customs Service in Los Angeles seized  more than 4 million ball bearings made by the Chatsworth firm to investigate  whether the parts are counterfeit or defective. New Hampshire Ball Bearings  says the agency's action was "a mistake."  </P></p>

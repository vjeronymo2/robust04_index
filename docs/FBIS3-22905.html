			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riyad 'Alam-al-Din in Beirut and Nayil Mukhaybar </F> in Paris]    [Text] A few days ago several western European intelligence  agencies received a top secret report warning of armed squads  arriving in some countries and preparing to carry out armed  operations in coordination with fundamentalist cells and  underground organizations supervised and financed by Iran. The  report urged the countries concerned to adopt the most stringent  precautionary measures in anticipation of an international plot  with many scenarios that could be implemented by citizens of  different nationalities and cover a large number of European  states, headed by Germany and France.    The report noted that crucial meetings were held several  weeks ago in Tehran for this purpose at the Iranian foreign  intelligence headquarters in Firuzi Palace. The meetings were  attended by representatives of the world's most dangerous armed  factions and movements, including the Fatah-Revolutionary  Council led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna]; the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Japanese Red  Army; the Irish Republican Army; the Armenian Secret Army  represented by a woman close to its leader, Hakopian, who was  assassinated in Athens in 1986; the Lebanese Revolutionary  Organization established by Murshid Shabu; and the Lebanese  Hizballah.    These organizations were represented by senior officials who  were responding to an invitation by a high-ranking Iranian  authority eager to gather in Tehran an assortment of the world's  most prominent armed networks. It has been learned that Mohsen  Reza'i, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards  (Pasdaran); Mohammad Musavi, the information official at the  Iranian Embassy in Beirut; other leaders of the Iranian hardline  trend; and coordinators of international armed squads  participated in these meetings.  <H5>  A Unified Command and Commandos </H5>   The report, abridged copies of which were received by  several  western European intelligence agencies that follow Iranian moves  closely, revealed that the meetings focused on the establishment  of a unified command by Iran for these factions and the  preparation of a plan to disperse these networks in most  countries of the world, where they would be ready to strike at  U.S. and European interests and assassinate politicians and  diplomats upon receiving a codeword from Iran. This would  happen if Iran were to be exposed to any attack or international  blockade or threats seeking to tighten the stranglehold on it,  increase its political and economic isolation, and provoke  disturbances and internal strife that endanger its security and  order.    In fact, many intelligence agencies had been following  Iranian secret moves with great concern since the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho accord in Washington on 13 September. Since that  time, these agencies have noticed suspicious activities by  international networks, Palestinian factions, and fundamentalist  organizations and movements opposed to the accord. The thread  of all these activities led to Iran. Then the meetings and  visits began to intensify. At these meetings, hosted by Tehran,  plans were drawn up to establish a front opposed to the  Gaza-Jericho accord that would seek to thwart the accord by  force. Information indicates that a reward of several million  dollars was set for anyone who would assassinate Abu-'Ammar  [Yasir 'Arafat] and that Iran utilized all its ties and contacts  with the international networks to have them participate in a  plot starting at the Arab level and ending at the international  level. Even mercenaries of various nationalities were recruited  to facilitate this mission and divert suspicion.    In recent weeks European intelligence organs have become  convinced that armed operations will be carried out at a growing  pace. These organs received information that acts of opposition  to the Palestinian-Israeli accord, which have begun in the  occupied territories, will gradually evolve into operations  covering the entire Palestinian arena, then Lebanon, and later  will shift to other locations in the world, specifically Europe.    This information adds that Iran has opened its army camps,  especially (Karnaji) near Qom, to commandos from the General  Command, Hizballah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. They received  special training by Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers. At  the same time, Tehran has asked Sudan to open its camps for  training special units of "Afghan Arabs" and fundamentalist  exiles living in European countries. In Lebanon, increasing  activity has been observed in Hizballah camps in the western  al-Biqa' where Iranian military advisers have been training  fundamentalist elements who arrived recently from several Arab  states in guerrilla warfare, the use of explosives, and car  bombings. Intelligence reports have emphasized the presence of  elements from the Japanese Red Army in al-Biqa' and Beirut.  Those elements have been dispersed in Popular Front-General  Command centers and camps in al-Biqa'. These reports say that  the Japanese Red Army elements entered Lebanon with the  assistance of the Iranian Embassy and under the supervision of  "N.N." who works in the foreign operations branch of the Iranian  foreign intelligence service, headed by 'Ali Fallahian.  Meanwhile, Asadollah Reza 'Asaker, the Revolutionary Guard  official in Lebanon, has intensified his secret meetings with  the commanders of Hizballah's internal and external operations  units.  <H5>  Activating the European Networks </H5>   About two weeks ago Western intelligence organs that  coordinate anti-terrorist operations within the framework of a  special secret plan codenamed "Kilowatt," which covers more than  20 Western countries, received reports from their agents in the  Middle East -- who work in full coordination with their  counterparts in the region -- urging them to forestall  derailment of the peace process. Those reports stated that the  codeword was sent out at the recent meeting in Firuzi Palace and  that the dispersal of armed networks' elements throughout the  world had begun, accompanied by "important orders." Apparently,  the uncovering of a plot prepared by a group affiliated with the  Abu-Nidal Organization to assassinate an Arab official during  his participation at the Nonaligned summit in India in the  middle of this month is part of the international terrorist  conspiracy hatched in Tehran. The disclosure of the arrival in  India at the end of last month of Fatah-Revolutionary Council  groups induced most Western countries, which received  information about the Tehran mobilization meetings of armed  fundamentalist, radical, leftist, and separatist movements from  different countries, to declare a state of maximum alert in  their security and intelligence organs. In fact, reports from  several European countries, including France and Germany,  indicated that suspicious movements by radical networks and  elements had been observed in their territory and that work had  begun to reorganize, revive, and activate existing Iranian  networks in preparation for implementing fresh missions and  operations.    It has been learned that al-Haj "'A.J.," who is Lebanese and  a Hizballah security official, moved three weeks ago to Iran and  held intensive meetings with Iranian security officials aimed at  forming and organizing terrorist networks in a number of  European countries, especially Germany, a country that is  well-known to him and in which he had participated in organizing  several operations. Many meetings have reportedly been held in  Tehran between this security official and 'Imad Maghniyah, one  of Hizballah's most prominent elements, whose name was mentioned  in the kidnapping of Western hostages in Beirut alongside that  of "'A.J."    It is common knowledge that Maghniyah lives in Tehran and  holds an Iranian diplomatic passport. Western intelligence  reports mention him as general coordinator of the recently  reorganized networks in Europe.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: GATT director-general calls trade and labour conditions meeting Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has called a meeting of trade envoys to discuss a dispute between the US and developing countries over trade and labour conditions, a spokesman said yesterday, report Reuter in Geneva and David Goodhart, Labour Editor, in London. The spokesman said Mr Sutherland was in intense consultations on the problem, that has overshadowed a gathering of ministers from 121 countries in Marrakesh next week to sign new Gatt world trade accords. He said Mr Sutherland would report to the ambassadors to Gatt on his consultations 'and see if there were a possibility of some kind of accommodation'. The US, backed by France, wants a ministerial declaration in Marrakesh to accept that a new World Trade Organisation, to replace the Gatt next year, would deal with the link between trade and labour. Developing countries fear this would open the door to new tariffs on their goods to compensate for the fact that they are produced with cheaper labour, and have refused to consider any reference to the issue in the Marrakesh declaration. The European Parliament might also refuse to ratify the Gatt deal early in May if the Marrakesh meeting later this month produces no commitment to examine the link between trade and workers' rights. Mr Michael Hindley, leader of the majority socialist group on the European Parliament's external trade committee, said yesterday that the socialist group may refuse to ratify the treaty.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Union faces court battle with deposed president: The man who was elected president of the GPMU print union is to take his executive to the High Court for declaring the election invalid. Documents in the possession of the Financial Times chronicle the extraordinary events that led to his rejection Mr Doug Douglas, a member of the GPMU print union's London region and an outspoken critic of the national leadership, wants the High Court to overrule the union executive which has deprived him of victory in the election for the presidency. He will go to court next week to challenge its decision to invalidate the election result. The poll showed Mr Douglas winning by 19,906 to 18,590 on the seventh count in a single transferable vote ballot over Mr Ray Williams, a leftwinger from Merseyside. The government-appointed Commissioner for Trade Union Rights is meeting all Mr Douglas's legal costs in what is the first action of its kind under the new labour laws. The union's London region leadership is also backing him strongly. The executive's decision to deprive Mr Douglas of the presidency and call for a fresh election because of alleged breach of union rules follows an inquiry carried out for the executive by Mrs Anne Hock, general manager of the independent Unity Security Balloting Services, a subsidiary of Unity Trust Bank. Her report concluded that union rules had been breached during the election by the circulation of branch newsletters and by two articles about the election that appeared in national newspapers. However, Mrs Hock had previously certified the conduct of the original ballot, which she also supervised. The executive actually endorsed Mr Douglas as president at a union conference, in the union journal and in a circular sent to all branches. Mr Tony Dubbins, the union's general secretary, discussed with Mr Douglas his salary and when he would start work. However, only four days before he was due to take up the presidency on June 1, Mr Douglas was told his election was invalid and a fresh ballot would have to be held. Union leaders were unavailable for comment yesterday. A union spokesman said the High Court hearings to start on December 13 would provide the opportunity for the union to explain its case. The executive's refusal to accept Mr Douglas's election victory is seen by its critics inside the union as an attempt to prevent a well known opponent of the leadership gaining access to the upper reaches of the union. In his election manifesto Mr Douglas criticised what he called 'excessive pay-offs exceeding Pounds 100,000' provided for former national officers. He accused the leadership of 'an arrogant attitude towards members' democratic decisions'. Mr Douglas promised if elected 'to prevent further ridiculous extravagancies' under the union rules which provide the president with the power 'to exercise a general supervision of the affairs of the union'. In her first report certifying Mr Douglas's victory, Mrs Hock wrote: 'There are no reasonable grounds for believing there was any contravention of a requirement imposed by or under an enactment in relation to the ballot.' She said no security breaches had occurred over production, storage, distribution, return or handling of the voting papers. She concluded: 'We have been able to carry out our functions as scrutineer without interference which would make it unreasonable for any person to call our independence in relation to the union in question.' In fact, on the eve of the ballot in late March Mr Dubbins had had to deal with complaints that Mr Williams's leftwing supporters had been canvassing in breach of rules. Mr Douglas told the London Evening Standard at the time: 'I am confident justice will be done for all the candidates and the membership.' There were also allegations that newsletters had been circulated contrary to the rules. But then the union executive had decided there were insufficient grounds to conduct an investigation and decided to let the ballot proceed, with Mr Williams insisting on no delay. Mrs Hock's report was endorsed by the executive and Mr Douglas was declared president at the union's conference on April 18. On April 26 Mr Dubbins agreed Mr Douglas would take over as president on June 1. However, by May 3 the executive, while backing Mr Douglas, also decided to ask Mrs Hock for a second report inquiring into allegations over the conduct of the election. On this occasion Mrs Hock found rules had been breached over the very issues the executive had examined in March. She wrote: 'Any information, statement or document contained in anything other than the election address or official journal would be in my opinion a breach of rule. 'Publication of articles in newspapers or journals is obviously a matter largely outside the control of any union and its members. However in my opinion commenting on the ballot for quotation in a press article by a candidate would be clearly a breach of rule. 'In the circumstances, therefore, I believe there is a likelihood the result of the election may have been influenced by these events, in particular the press articles and branch newsletters. I recommend the executive should set aside the ballot and run a fresh election.' The executive backed the report amid a storm of protest. The London regional council denounced the executive for 'an unprecedented and unjustified interference in the democratic process' while Mr Derek Benton, London member of the executive, resigned, saying the decision 'defied belief'. However, the union executive remains confident it has not broken the union rules. Next week in the High Court both sides will present their positions.</p>

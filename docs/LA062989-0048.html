			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE OKS MONEY FOR LAKE AT HANSEN DAM  </P> <P> The House of Representatives approved a $780,000 expenditure Wednesday to help  restore the lake at Hansen Dam Recreation Area.  </P> <P> Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) included the money in the Energy and  Water Appropriations Bill of 1989, which passed the House and was sent to the  Senate. If passed by the Senate, the bill must be signed by President Bush  before any money could actually be released to the Los Angeles Department of  Recreation and Parks.  </P> <P> The lake, once a center for boating, swimming, fishing and water skiing in the  northeast San Fernando Valley, filled with silt and debris during floods in  1969 and 1981.  </P> <P> Money included in Wednesday's bill comes from a fund generated by fees paid by  Bill Blomgren, who has a contract to harvest gravel left behind by the floods.  Berman sponsored a bill in May, 1988, to earmark those royalty payments for the  park revitalization and lake restoration.  </P> <P> Also, the $49.4-billion state budget approved Wednesday by the Assembly and  sent to the state Senate contains $500,000 for the lake and surrounding  recreation area. Those funds were sought by Assemblyman Richard Katz  (D-Sylmar), Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) and Sen. Alan  Robbins (D-Tarzana).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Master Plan  </P> <P> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the land around the dam and leases  it to the city, is developing a master plan for the area. That plan, paid for  with $200,000 from the gravel trust fund, is expected in November.  </P> <P> In announcing release of that $200,000 last year, Berman vowed that a 20-acre  lake would be completed by the end of 1988.  </P> <P> However, on Wednesday, Berman aide Marc Litchman said 1991 would be a better  estimate. The lake will cost about $1 million to build, he said.  </P> <P> "We were being too optimistic, but I think we're being realistic now," Litchman  said. "We've got to go through this master plan process by law. It all takes  time."  </P> <P> A pond created during the gravel removal has been declared a community hazard  by the Corps of Engineers because its walls are too steep. Twice, most recently  in April, corps officials have called for it to be filled in with sand.  </P> <P> City Councilman Ernani Bernardi is fighting that order because he believes that  the pond is at least a start on a larger lake.  </P></p>

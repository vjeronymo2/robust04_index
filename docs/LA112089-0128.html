			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FYI, CHARACTER ON 'MURPHY BROWN' IS NO TED BAXTER CLONE  </P> <P> "Murphy Brown" has been compared to the old and great "Mary Tyler Moore Show"  by the critics and viewers. Some have taken the comparison further, comparing  Joe Regalbuto's character of Frank to Gavin MacLeod's Murray and labeling  Charles Kimbrough's Jim Dial as the series Ted Baxter, which was played by Ted  Knight.  </P> <P> If you want to see Charles Kimbrough get a rise, make this comparison to his  face. He is thoroughly justified in his annoyance. Ted Baxter was a buffoon,  even as brilliantly played as he was by Ted Knight.  </P> <P> Jim Dial, on the other hand, is a veteran newsman and anchor on "FYI" who has  probably worked with some of the heavyweights in the field. In fact tonight's  episode (which airs at 9 p.m. on CBS and guest stars Walter Cronkite) shows  Dial being roasted for his 25 years with the network.  </P> <P> Kimbrough's own description of his character is probably the best and the most  accurate.  </P> <P> "Jim Dial is full of surprises. He is a professional who does the job and does  it fully. Mythically speaking, Jim sees himself as a laconic Hemingway hero.  He's buttoned up but highly emotional inside. He thinks he is secure in his  armor-clad business suit, but he's wary of those closing in on him. He has an  actor's vanity."  </P> <P> Kimbrough admitted "Murphy Brown" came into his life at a time when he needed  it most. Not that he wasn't working. In fact, he was working all the time but  mostly on the Broadway stage. Gradually, he found that he was playing  variations on the same role. "Luckily for me 'Murphy Brown' came my way and I  thought this might do it."  </P> <P> Kimbrough recalls the night the cast gathered at exec-producer/creator Diane  English's house to read the script. The chemistry was there right from the  start.  </P> <P> "I knew at that point we had a chance of making it work. Candice was the big  surprise. The critics fell all over themselves with praise. Candice thirsted  for comedy. She craved to play a character who was funny and this was her first  big opportunity."  </P></p>

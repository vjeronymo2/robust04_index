			<p>BFN     [Text] L'Isle-Jourdain, France, April 5 (AFP) -- Militant  farmers have given home-grown cannabis to French Agriculture  Minister Jean Puech, saying cultivating the drug was the only  way they had of making a living.    The gift was "produced by a French farmer" as his "only way  of feeding his family," said a communique released in this  southwestern French town, headquarters of the activist group  Rural Coordination.    In Paris, Puech denied receiving a parcel of cannabis from  the farmers. "If such a parcel reached me, I would immediately  hand it over to the police."    Criticising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the  farmers' communique said low world prices had forced Third World  farmers to produce drugs.    "By accepting the ratification of GATT, Mr. Puech has opted  for a world of unemployment, violence and drugs. Farmers will  adapt their crops to this," the communique said.    The gift of cannabis was made to mark the end of Puech's  first year as minister, the communique said.    More than 120 countries will sign the new GATT in Marrakesh,  Morocco, on April 12-15.</p>

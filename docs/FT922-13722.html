			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Manila comes to terms with its workersabroad SOME 220 Filipino domestic servants are detained at the Philippine embassy in Kuwait, awaiting repatriation after fleeing employers whom they had accused of maltreatment. The Philippines government has expressed surprise, however, not at complaints of abuse, but that the women are in Kuwait - the government outlawed the sending of servants there in 1989 and plans to investigate how they got jobs in Kuwait illegally. Illegal employment is just one of many problems that have accompanied the increase in Filipinos working abroad. Despite the problems they have to contend with, including rape, physical abuse, non-payment of wages, infidelity of spouses left behind and even racial discrimination, Philippine workers still go abroad in droves, in search of jobs which their economy cannot provide. Overseas workers send home more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) a year, according to official estimates, although other informal remittances could amount to another Dollars 500m. These revenues exceed earnings of the country's leading merchandise exports, such as garments at Dollars 2.2bn and semiconductors' Dollars 1.5bn. Throughout the Middle East, Europe, US and Asia, an estimated 1.2m Filipinos work as construction workers, seamen, hospital staff, domestic servants or entertainers. A teacher can earn six times as much as a servant in Hong Kong as in a public school in Manila. A report by the Central Bank said that increased remittances helped offset a Dollars 3.2bn trade deficit last year and contributed to a Dollars 1.4bn surplus in the balance-of-payments position. The overseas workers' contribution to the economy is expected to expand further in the coming years, according to Mr Jose Sarmiento, head of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). Overseas employment will remain an attractive option as long as Philippine economic growth remains slow. Last year, about 2.4m people, or 9.5 per cent of the work force of 25.58m, had no job and an estimated 750,000 young people join the labour force each year. Employment of workers abroad increased last year, with POEA-approved departures reaching 615,019, an increase of 38 per cent from 1990, with a further increase expected this year. While the Middle East will remain 'a healthy market', he said, POEA is looking at Japan and South Korea, where serious labour shortages are already curtailing industrial expansion. Representatives from Japanese companies have already called on the POEA chief and expressed interest in hiring Filipino workers even though they are awaiting Japanese government policy allowing the entry of foreign workers. When that happens, Mr Sarmiento said, the Philippines should enjoy a head-start. Whether the government can cope with the corresponding increase in social problems related to overseas employment is another matter, however. Embassies' response to cases involving Filipino expatriates have been tentative - bordering on indifference, according to some employers. Meanwhile, a company belonging to Philippines businessman Mr Joseph Noel Ducat has set up a foundation, with financial help from foreign partners, that aims to give help to Filipino migrant workers in case of emergencies and to establish ties with employers to prevent abuse. Mr Ducat was captured, with two American companions, by Iraqi troops along the Iraq-Kuwait border during the Gulf war. He says attempts to assist him were snubbed by embassy staff and Foreign Ministry officials in Manila. Mr Sarmiento believes that Philippine diplomats, particularly in countries that hire big numbers of Filipino workers, 'should now look at labour as a principal function'. For instance, in the Middle East, the POEA chief notes, 'practically all the oilfields are manned by Filipino workers. Most of the households of the royal families are staffed by Filipino domestics. So are hospitals, airports, and even the bureaucracy.' On the basis of these 'strategic positions', he says, 'we should develop a new diplomacy consistent with this reality.' Domestic-help diplomacy could be unfolding in the Philippines.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By TASS-CRIME correspondent Yuriy Shcherban] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- The military collegium of Russia's  Supreme Court has confirmed to an ITAR-CRIME correspondent that  it has received a petition from Valentin Varennikov in which he  refuses to have the State Duma's amnesty decision applied with  regard to himself. The collegium does not, however, know if any  of the other accused in the State Committee for the State of  Emergency [SCSE] trial have communicated similar wishes.    As a TASS-CRIME correspondent learned, the formal accusation  of high treason levelled at Varennikov and the other accused  continues to remain in force, despite the amnesty, in so far as  the procuracy general of the Russian Federation has not  withdrawn it and, after protesting against the decision of Judge  Ukolov at the Presidium of Russia's Supreme Court, has sought to  bring the criminal case back to the military collegium for a  final decision to be made.    At present, the "SCSE case" is "being examined" by Viktor  Yaskin, military collegium judge of the Russian Federation and  major general of the judiciary. By law, the continuation or  cessation of legal proceedings depends on his decision alone.  Since Varennikov has rejected the amnesty, there is a strong  possibility that legal proceedings will be continued against him  personally (this does not apply to those of the accused who  declare their acceptance of the amnesty).</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The recent municipal elections have been  the subject of reporting and commentary in the Portuguese press.  <H5>  Gains, Losses Discussed </H5>   Commentator Vasco Pulido Valente lists losers and winners of  the December municipal elections in the 17 December Lisbon  weekly O INDEPENDENTE. The most important loser was the  conservative Social Democratic Center party (CDS), he writes,  which failed to make an impression even among its traditional  rightist electorate. The CDS's political "sickness" is  incurable, according to Pulido Valente. As it has become  progressively weaker it has lost the trust of the electorate, a  loss which in turn increases its weakness.    The Communist Party (PCP) succeeded in preserving most of  its  "small patrimony" of votes and municipalities. However, the PC  failed to grow despite the unemployment problem and the economic  recession, Pulido Valente continues. Mere survival, he  concludes, proves that the party is a "tenacious relic" of the  political past.    According to Pulido Valente, the Socialist Party, which  increased its mayoral representation, handled its success  "melancholically." The PS needed to inflict a "ringing defeat"  on the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD) and to win over  at least a third of the PCP electorate, Pulido Valente contends.  Neither goal materialized, and PS leader Antonio Guterres cannot  claim to be a "giant-slayer." Guterres now faces a "terrible"  problem, because the PSD's unexpected show of strength and the  CDS's effective disappearance has convinced some PS officials of  the need for an alliance with the PCP, Pulido Valente reports.  He adds, however, that he personally rejects this option, since  the PCP exists because its differences with the PS are greater  and more essential than the difference between the PS and the  PSD, making impossible a "common program" or a compromise.  Moreover, because of the distrust that three-fourths of the  electorate feel toward the communists, any PS initiative to  create a leftist alliance will cost the PS a considerable share  of the moderate vote.    The PSD derived a number of benefits from the election,  Pulido Valente writes. The party did well enough to sustain its  position until the parliamentary elections in 1995. In addition,  the CDS's losses eliminate any danger from the Right. The PDS  will benefit in the parliamentary elections from a united vote  against the Left, Pulido Valente concludes.  <H5>  Consequences of Elections </H5>   PSD luminary and commentator Miguel Jose Judice weighs the  consequences of the municipal elections in the 17 December O  INDEPENDENTE. Inconclusive results, the small gap between the  two major parties, and the lack of a massive electoral turn to  socialism mean there will be no early dissolution of the  National Assembly by President Mario Soares, Judice writes.  Prime Minister Cavaco Silva strengthened his position in the  PSD. A PSD victory in 1995 now appears more likely, Judice  continues, since the difference in votes between the PS and the  PSD is insufficient to overcome the prime minister's personal  popularity--the "Cavaco effect." Unless the recession deepens  and the Left unites for the next parliamentary election, the PSD  might well achieve another absolute majority, Judice maintains.  The PS could receive the support of leftist voters in many  districts provided there is a common presidential candidate for  the left or at least a promise of postelectoral cooperation by  the leftist parties. Thus Judice sees the municipal elections as  the beginning of a campaign to promote the candidacy of Lisbon  mayor and PS luminary Jorge Sampaio for president. The CDS, in  Judice's view, has become more fragile, losing the rural vote  without winning over the urban electorate. Judice praises the  voters for their sense of civic-mindedness in starting to punish  the corrupt and the incompetent at the ballot box.    Writing in the 17 December Lisbon daily PUBLICO, Miguel  Sousa  Tavares comments on the electoral results, noting that while the  PS won "arithmetically," it did not do so "psychologically." Low  voter turnout was chiefly responsible for the PS victories,  rather than the party winning support of voters on its right and  its left. The PS failed to smash the PCP and thus become the  sole representative of the Left, and, writes Tavares, it failed  to move centrist PSD voters to the left as well. The municipal  elections were not a "general rehearsal" for 1995, when the Left  hopes to put an end to a decade of Center-Right PSD government.  The socialists kept a number of important mayoralties and won  some new ones, but nothing in the municipal votes shows that the  electorate is ready to abandon Prime Minister Cavaco Silva,  Tavares contends.</p>

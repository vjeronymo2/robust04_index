			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Baltica to shed staff in insurance reorganisation BALTICA, Denmark's biggest insurance group, plans to change its structure to focus more on core activities which will enable it to reduce staff by 10 per cent over the next two to three years and cut its costs, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. The company will merge the staff, computer and finance departments of the holding company with those of the banking, finance and insurance divisions. It will also cut back on its involvement in the construction sector where it has backed a number of large projects. The changes, from September 1, will leave general and life insurance as the group's core areas. Finance will be a secondary activity but Baltica Bank will remain a separate business. Baltica reported a first-quarter net profit of DKr27m (Dollars 4.48m) against DKr558m a year earlier and said higher loss provisions for building projects and property purchases could affect the full-year result.</p>

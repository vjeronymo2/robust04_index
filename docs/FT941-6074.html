			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Wider Europe Enlargement of the European Union to the east and the north has come closer after Tuesday's accord in Brussels on entry terms for Sweden, Finland and Austria. The deals still have to be approved by the European Parliament and by national referendums later this year. Whether or not agreement can be reached for Norway, the fourth applicant from the European Free Trade Association, will depend on next week's haggling over fishing rights. If these four states join on January 1 1995, the Union's population and gross domestic product will increase respectively by 7.5 per cent and 9.5 per cent, but its gains in economic resources and political values will be greater. These small but wealthy economies will bring net contributions to the EU's budget. More important, the new members will spread the Union's commitment to liberal democracy to the borders of the former communist bloc, preparing the ground for the crucial next stage of enlargement towards central and east Europe. The Efta applicants, already part of the free trade arrangements of the European Economic Area, want EU membership to gain a political stake in Europe's development. However, in view of their electorates' scepticism about the benefits, entry comes with a price tag. Reflecting this week's agreements to offset the impact of reductions in Efta farm prices, the newcomers' budgetary contributions will be phased in, and even by 1998 will be around Ecu2bn less than earlier foreseen. This act of compensation requires creative adjustment to EU financing rules. Yet, provided these concessions secure Yes votes in the referendums, the price will be worth paying. Tuesday's agreement does, however, raise larger questions about the much greater amounts of money at stake in the next phase of enlargement. The German government can be expected to make extending membership to Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland a centrepiece of its six-month presidency of the Union that starts in July. Further enlargement, perhaps by the year 2000, is highly desirable for political reasons. But the accession of members with, at present, GDP per capita of less than 30 per cent of the EU average cannot be contemplated without large changes in financial mechanisms governing agricultural support and structural fund payments to poorer regions. Prof Richard Baldwin, in a book to be presented at the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London next month, calculates that, on unchanged policies, membership by the most advanced eastern European economies would add a net Ecu58bn to the EU budget by 1999. This would require a 60 per cent increase in 1999 budget contributions - a condition that could be met neither by Germany, the largest contributor to the EU, which is already complaining about its rising net payments, nor by Britain or France, the other two main net contributors. To increase the effectiveness of decision-making among a larger membership, the EU needs to push through institutional changes that go beyond the modest adjustments in voting procedures currently under discussion in Brussels. However, assembling a majority for cuts in the EU's budgetary largesse for present beneficiaries from 1999 onwards may prove impossible, in view of the strong vested interests of farmers and the poorer southern countries. The road to a wider Europe is now open. Yet, if the destination is to be reached, the EU must find answers to questions of institutional and financial reform that so far have barely been raised.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Israel debates new stance on Palestinians: Peace talks initiative ISRAEL is hammering out a new formula to present to the Palestinians to unblock the Middle East peace process, Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said yesterday. In an interview in Jerusalem Mr Peres said the government was moving towards a compromise package which would seek to sidestep the two thorny issues blocking the 21-month-old peace talks - territorial control over Arab East Jerusalem and legal jurisdiction over settlers in the occupied territories during an interim period of Palestinian self-government. Mr Peres said among the incentives Israel could offer the Palestinians in return for acceptance of such a package were: greater economic assistance in the occupied territories; a commitment in principle by Israel that the final status of a Palestinian entity will be confederation with Jordan; and the so-called 'Gaza first' option - handing over control of the occupied Gaza strip to a Palestinian authority immediately, leaving the status of the occupied West Bank to later negotiations. After 10 rounds of talks, the foreign minister said, both sides had become bogged down by definitions and difficulties of convincing their constituencies that they had not given anything away. 'We are trying to meet the problems and build a package both sides can accept,' Mr Peres said. 'Let us sign what we agree on now and leave the rest to later,' he said. Mr Peres said the advantage of the 'Gaza first' option was that it avoided the problem of control of Arab East Jerusalem and the problem of Jewish settlers - most of whom live in the occupied West Bank. He also said the idea of confederation was a good compromise to all sides because it 'calmed' Israeli fears of an aggressive independent Palestinian state and 'calmed' Palestinian fears because it committed Israel to giving back occupied land. But he said a final accord on confederation could not be negotiated now because that would need an agreement on borders which could only be drawn up after an interim period of confidence building. 'We can talk about final status now without defining it,' he said. Mr Peres restated that the government would not offer any new compromise over Arab East Jerusalem. He also said the visit of Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, to the region soon was meant to keep the talks alive. On peace talks with Syria the veteran Labour politician said the government was still waiting for a Syrian commitment to full peace before specifying how far it was prepared to withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights. However, he said he believed President Hafez al-Assad was preparing the Syrian public for full peace.</p>

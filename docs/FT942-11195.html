			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Philips agrees to buy AEG lighting unit Philips, the Dutch electronics manufacturer which and the world's largest producer of light bulbs, has agreed to buy AEG Lichttechnik, a lighting engineering company, from AEG of Germany. The Dutch company declined to reveal the purchase price, but said AEG Lichttechnik was profitable and had generated sales of nearly DM300m (Dollars 174m) last year. 'Philips Lighting considers the acquisition essential for its position in Scandinavia and in the main European lighting market, Germany,' it said. The transaction reflects the desire of AEG, part of the Daimler-Benz group, to concentrate on its core electronics activities. AEG Lichttechnik, which focuses mainly on professional lighting equipment, has a plant near Hanover in Germany and a subsidiary in Finland, Idman Oy, which operates a factory in Mantsala. The company has a total workforce of 1,200. Philips said the AEG business would continue to use its own brand names and would operate in parallel with the Dutch company's own lighting sector. Lighting is Philips' most profitable business. The sector posted an operating profit margin of 13 per cent in the 1994 first quarter.</p>

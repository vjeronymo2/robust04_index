			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> BEATHARD MIGHT SIGN HENDRICKSON  </P> <P> General Manager Bobby Beathard said Tuesday the Chargers will add former San  Francisco linebacker Steve Hendrickson to the roster if Billy Ray Smith is  placed on injured reserve today.  </P> <P> "It's not done yet, but I think that's what is going to happen," Beathard said.  </P> <P> Team doctors have recommended at least four weeks of rest for Smith, who  suffers from strained stomach muscles.  </P> <P> Outside linebacker Henry Rolling will take Smith's place in the starting  lineup, and will be backed up by inside linebacker Cedric Figaro. If  Hendrickson joins the club, he will assume Rolling's special teams duties.  </P> <P> The Chargers took a look at wide receiver/punt returner and former Lincoln High  School player Lew Barnes Tuesday.  </P> <P> Barnes was released earlier this year by Buffalo.  </P> <P> The fans may have booed him on introduction Sunday, but Lynn said it won't be  long before first-round pick Junior Seau turns the jeers into cheers.  </P> <P> "He will be an impact player by the end of this season if he continues to  develop," Lynn said. "There's no doubt in my mind that he's going to be a great  player in this league."  </P> <P> Lynn also told reporters that he's heard rumors out of Cleveland that Bernie  Kosar might be replaced by Mike Pagel Sunday as the Browns' starting  quarterback.  </P> <P> The Browns said Tuesday, that although Kosar has been sacked 10 times in the  first two games this season, he will start against the Chargers.

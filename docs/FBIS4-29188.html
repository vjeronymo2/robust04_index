			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Siti Rahil] </F>   [Text] Singapore, June 15 KYODO -- The United States has  formally informed Japan it opposes the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) plan for an East Asian Economic Caucus  (EAEC), official Japanese and ASEAN sources said Wednesday [15  June].    The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo conveyed Washington's opposition  to  the EAEC proposal to the Japanese Government June 7, saying the  caucus would have a negative effect on the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum.    It marks the first time that the administration of President  Bill Clinton, which has taken a wait-and-see attitude on the  EAEC, has explicitly opposed the proposal.    The embassy also told Japanese officials that Thailand,  which  is the current chairman of ASEAN, and Brunei, as the ASEAN  chairman of the U.S.-ASEAN dialogue this year, will be informed  about Washington's stance.    The declaration of U.S. opposition to the caucus comes soon  after ASEAN officials briefed the U.S. Government during the  u.S.-ASEAN dialogue meeting in Washington in may on the details  of the EAEC as formulated by ASEAN in a blueprint on the EAEC  concept.    According to the blueprint, the EAEC is not "a subsidiary  organ of APEC but would function independently of it."    It points out that even though ASEAN agreed last year that  the EAEC would function as a caucus within APEC, it is not a  caucus "of" APEC.    The blueprint also says "the caucus would determine its own  agenda" and "the results of the caucus' discussions need not be  reported to APEC meetings unless deemed necessary."    At the Washington meeting, ASEAN officials assured the U.S.  Government that the EAEC would not be confrontational and would  be compatible with the U.S.-favored APEC forum. U.S. Assistant  Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord did not  give a response at the time.    The administration of former President George Bush had  bitterly opposed the plan for the EAEC, which would exclude the  U.S. because of worries that it would become a confrontational  economic weapon of Asian economies against the developed world.  But the Clinton administration initially appeared to move  toward a softer stance.    Washington's latest opposition makes it more difficult for  Japan to accept ASEAN's invitation to join the EAEC. So far,  Japan has remained cool toward the issue because of fear of  antagonizing the U.S.    The absence of Japan, Asia's economic powerhouse, from the  EAEC would put the proposal in a quandary and analysts say ASEAN  may now have no choice but to make further changes to the EAEC  concept.</p>

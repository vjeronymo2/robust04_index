			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Kuwait tells banks to build up capital base KUWAIT said yesterday its banks must either merge or raise their capital to international levels after the government clears them of some Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11bn) worth of bad debts, Reuter reports. 'Although the solution to the problem of difficult debts will ease burdens. . . this on its own will not be sufficient to achieve reform in the banking and financial system,' said Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Saud al-Sabah, central bank governor. 'Merging appears to be necessary. . . units that do not favour merging will only have the option of increasing their capital base to required levels in conformity to international requirements,' Kuwaiti News Agency quoted him saying. Emirate economists said the eight commercial banks would have to merge because most were undercapitalised before the Iraqi invasion.</p>

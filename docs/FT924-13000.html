			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Protection for Names BROKERS and underwriters at Lloyd's have negotiated a continuation of the insurance policy which protects the estates of Lloyd's Names, who are liable for losses even after death. Record losses of the Lloyd's market had threatened the survival of the Estate Protection Plan, which meets all claims which would otherwise fall on the families and heirs of Names. During the summer the reinsurers paid out Pounds 33m to 1,452 estates but premiums amounted to only Pounds 10m. Michael Wade, of brokers Holman Wade said earlier this month that 'renewal of the contract had proved challenging.' However under new arrangements negotiated by Wade, an EPP initially underwritten by Centrewrite, a reinsurance company owned by Lloyd's, is to be made available to Names. Premiums range from Pounds 350 for a Name aged 45 or under to Pounds 950 per year for Names aged 61 or over. Even with the policy the estates of Names are liable to pay a substantial part of any loss. For example a Name who died in 1993, for example, would be liable to pay an excess equal to 2 per cent of allocated premium income for the 1990, 1991 and 1992 years. In addition the estate would also pay an amount equal to 50 per cent of allocated premium income for any 1989 account and prior year run-off syndicates. The Lloyd's Names Personal Protection Plan, launched last week, is an entirely separate insurance policy which provides limited cover (up to 150 per cent of a Names' underwriting limit) but carries no excess. The policy offered by Merrett Life syndicate 332 through brokers Colburn, French and Kneen is designed to be written under trust. In the event of death, the sum assured will be paid directly to the trustees and will not form part of the deceased's estate.</p>

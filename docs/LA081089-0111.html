			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Energy Department delayed efforts to stop radioactive wastes from  contaminating ground water near its Hanford, Wash., nuclear weapons plant so  that production could continue, a congressional study found. The report from  the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, disputed  Energy Department assertions that the leakage of an estimated 750,000 gallons  of toxic wastes from the plant's underground storage tanks would have little  impact on the nearby Columbia River. The GAO said although it was learned in  1956 that some single-walled tanks at Hanford might be leaking, those tanks  were still being used in 1980. DOE officials said that liquids were kept below  the leaky spots.  </P></p>

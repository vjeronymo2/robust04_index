Kohl assured Clinton of German  support for the position of the alliance, aimed at threatening  the Serbs with air strikes and at continuing talks among the  warring parties in Geneva. Kohl talked with Clinton about the  statement that the president issued shortly afterward, in which  he mentioned the two goals. As became known in Bonn, possible  forms of indirect German participation in military operations  were not discussed.    Foreign Minister Kinkel announced on Thursday that nobody  has  approached Germany so far. He added: "We will do what we can  from a legal viewpoint, and if we receive any requests, we will  comply if we can." Kinkel mentioned considerations concerning  logistic aid. "We cannot support the alliance partners morally  and refuse to comply with requests that we can actually fulfill  from a legal viewpoint." Germany will try to ensure that.  Military participation is not possible because of the German  constitution.    Kinkel pointed out Germany's political efforts to come  closer  to a negotiated result on the basis of the Juppe-Kinkel plan.  This concept is still being pursued. "Germany is not merely a  passive spectator." In view of Germany's size and  responsibility, Germans are participating in observer missions  of the European Union. German pilots are taking part in the  airlift for Sarajevo and the supply of other Bosnian towns by  air. Also, the Bundeswehr is involved in AWACS surveillance  flights. However, these flights will not be affected by  "possible air strikes."    Kinkel also mentioned the participation of the Federal Navy  in monitoring the Adriatic Sea and the involvement of German  customs officials in ensuring the observance of the embargo  against Serbia-Montenegro on the Danube. Germany has so far  paid 612 million German marks for humanitarian purposes, which  is more than any other European country has provided. Nearly  400,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina have been accepted by  Germany -- twice as many as all the other Europeans states put  together.    On Wednesday, Kinkel spoke several times on the telephone to  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. Tarnoff, Christopher's  under secretary, and Redman, the U.S. observer at the Geneva  negotiations, visited London, Paris, and Bonn. A change in the  cool U.S. attitude so far adopted toward the Geneva negotiations  became apparent. According to Kinkel, the talks focused on how  the "political process" might be revived through cooperation  between the European Union and the United States on the NATO  decisions.    Bonn officials noted that Washington wants to assume a "more  active role" and "participate in the political procedures." The  "European plan of action" might serve as a basis. The "overall  concept of the Europeans" includes the demilitarization of  Sarajevo and its protection by the United Nations. German  diplomacy will try to implement this concept together with  Washington.    Kinkel stated that Russia should be involved "as much as  possible." The foreign minister called on the Serbs, Croats,  and Muslims to contribute to "achieving a peaceful settlement"  at the Geneva negotiations which resumed on Thursday. This is  not possible without the parties to the conflict, he added.  Kinkel expressed the hope that this time the cease-fire for  Sarajevo agreed on Wednesday morning will hold. "It is in the  interest of all of us that the decisions of the NATO Council and  of the foreign ministers of the European Union do not have to be  implemented." If the parties to the conflict take the warning  seriously, what the NATO Council demanded might be achieved  without air strikes. "If not, all those involved must know that  NATO is serious this time."    Kinkel stressed that UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali  approved the decisions that evening in a telephone conversation  with NATO Secretary General Woerner. The European members of  the Security Council, England and France, did not consider any  new decisions by the Security Council necessary. They believe  that Resolutions 824 and 836 and the decision by the NATO  Council are sufficient as a basis for action. A spokesman for  the secretary general, who stated that a new Security Council  resolution is required, has meanwhile announced that he did not  have enough information.    Kinkel described possible future developments as follows:  "If it is considered necessary after the 10-day period on 20  February, the UN secretary general will make a decision and  issue the combat order. If Sarajevo should continue to be  shelled, measures will be taken on the spot by the UN commander  in chief in cooperation with NATO." If Serbian guns "should  reappear" after an air strike, "a second operation might be  needed." Yet the foreign minister expressed the hope that the  U.S. attitude and the NATO decision might form the basis of a  political settlement.    Besides Sarajevo, other towns are also hard pressed.  However, the capital has a symbolic function. If the situation  should deteriorate in other towns after an improvement in  Sarajevo, "new considerations and new decisions" will be  required. Kinkel hinted that he will hold talks and try to find  out whether a meeting of the foreign ministers of the "troika"  of the European Union -- Belgium, Germany, and Greece -- should  be arranged next week. There were reports about plans that the  three foreign ministers wanted to hold talks with Russian  Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Athens next week. It has now become  known that Kozyrev's participation is "rather unlikely."</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP-RATED CALIFORNIA SEEKS NINTH NCAA WATER POLO CHAMPIONSHIP  </P> <P> California begins its quest for an unprecedented ninth NCAA water polo title  today at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The top-ranked Golden Bears (26-1) open the three-day tournament by playing No.  13 Brown (20-9) at 3 p.m., followed by second-ranked Stanford (24-5) against  No. 10 Air Force (19-6) at 4:30 p.m. and No. 3 UC Santa Barbara (22-7) against  12th-ranked Navy (24-5) at 6.  </P> <P> The best matchup of the first round, however, is expected to be at 7:30 p.m.  between fourth-ranked UCLA (22-7) and No. 5 Pepperdine (21-8). The Waves, who  have won 15 of their last 16 matches, handed Cal its only loss, 12-11, in  Berkeley and also won one of three meetings against the Bruins.  </P> <P> Cal, Stanford, Santa Barbara and UCLA have combined to win 18 of the previous  22 national titles. Navy, Air Force, Brown and Pepperdine have never won.  </P> <P> Said Pepperdine Coach Terry Schroeder: "There are probably five teams that have  a real legitimate chance at winning the NCAA title, but California is the  favorite."  </P> <P> Consolation and championship matches continue Saturday and Sunday, with the  title match scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Sunday.

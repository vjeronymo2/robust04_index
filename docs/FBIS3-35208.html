			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>   [Text] Kabul, Feb 20 (AFP) -- A special commission of  Afghan cabinet members announced proposals Sunday to establish a  permanent peace among the warring Afghan factions in Kabul,  including a new assembly to pick a new president.    The proposals centre on the establishment of a special  committee which will have two tasks: securing a compromise  agreement between the factions, and organising a Loya Jirga, or  grand assembly, to elect a new president and cabinet.    A four-day ceasefire, which ended Friday, followed 45 days  of  nonstop fighting in the capital, but this ceasefire has yet to  be extended to formalise the uneasy and unofficial truce  currently enjoyed in Kabul.    The proposal for a Loya Jirga is a throwback to December  1992  when President Borhanoddin Rabbani was elected in a  controversial assembly called the Shoora Ahl-i-Hal va Aqd, the  legality of which was challenged by some rival factions.    Whether called a Loyal Jirga or Shoora Ahl-i-Hal va Aqd, the  idea is for a group to vote for the nation's leader.    The cabinet commission proposes that the Loya Jirga be  convened within the next five months, that is, by the end of  Rabbani's current tenure as president.    Delegates elected to the Loya Jirga are to be respected  personalities, including Muslim theologians, and political and  social experts.    Whether former communists will be eligible to participate  was  not explained.    Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar is allied with the ex-  communist forces of Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam, who tried  unsuccessfully to unseat Rabbani in the coup of January 1994.    Hekmatyar's successful military challenge to Rabbani's 1992  election as president won him the prime ministerial nomination  in March 1993.    Rabbani's declaration of a holy war against Dostam may prove  to be a sticking point for acceptance of the cabinet peace  package if it means Dostam will be excluded. The four-day Kabul  ceasefire was similarly flawed by the exclusion of Dostam's  forces, giving all factions a convenient excuse to blame daily  violations on the Uzbeks.    Saturday night's two- to three-hour exchange of heavy  artillery and light weapons' fire was an indication of the  latent tension between the warring factions, regardless of their  willingness to extend the expired ceasefire.    Up to 20 heavy calibre shells crashed into the former  diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan shortly after midday  Sunday, underscoring the fragile nature of security in the  Afghan capital.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Northern building societies to merge: Merger makes Northern Rock the 10th largest society with assets of Pounds 8.8bn Northern Rock, the UK's 11th largest building society, is to merge with a smaller, neighbouring society, North of England, to create a combined organisation with assets of Pounds 8.8bn. The move takes Northern Rock - as the new organisation will be called - to a position as the 10th largest society, overtaking Bristol &amp; West. Lloyds Bank offered Pounds 1.8bn for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society last month. Northern Rock has been at pains to emphasise its merger would bring a dual benefit to North of England members. It said they would receive a bonus as a result of the merger - though not on the scale of the payments offered to C&amp;G members - while remaining in a position to reap benefits. North of England has less than one-quarter of Northern Rock's 1.3m members, including both both savers and borrowers. Members of both societies will be asked to agree the merger in August, and if they approve it will take effect in October. Mr Chris Sharp, Northern Rock managing director, conceded that some investors in his society might be disgruntled they will get no bonus while North of England investors will. This was because of the differing level of reserves. 'This is a traditional building society merger about traditional building society values, two strong north-east societies coming together because, I have not the slightest doubt, their future will be longer and stronger than if they stayed apart.' The new society will have joint reserves of about Pounds 400m; two headquarters buildings - at Newcastle upon Tyne and at Doxford in Sunderland; and about 170 branches. Mr Sharp insisted there would be no compulsory redundancies. Mr Sharp will continue as managing director, while Mr Bob Linden, North of England chief executive, will take early retirement, and Mr Ron Shiel will stand down as North of England chairman. IBCA, the European rating agency, affirmed its credit rating of Northern Rock (long-term A, short-term A1). Mr Robert Dickinson, Northern Rock chairman, said he had a dream of forming 'a Great North building society encompassing the whole region', and hoped the agreement would act as a catalyst for further mergers in the north-east. The north-east's third largest building society, in 25th place nationally with assets of Pounds 1.2bn, is Newcastle building society. Mr Bill Midgley, its chief executive, said yesterday he did not see the merger as a threat to the Newcastle. Traditional society, Page 28</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Malyshkov, vice mayor of the Moscow </F> government, director of the Department of the Consumer Market  and Consumer Services: "Stores Have Become Private"]    [Text] Privatization of commerce has opened the door for  the development of market relations in the country. Government  divestment should be seen as a process of transition to variety  in forms of property, to new management forms and to  entrepreneurship as a means of creating a dynamic economy by  increasing the stimulus to work.    Why has commerce moved to the forefront of privatization,  where it must be acted upon decisively? The reason is that no  movement toward the market is possible until the system of  bureaucratic distribution of the produced product is broken. For  long years a great deal of concern was expressed about how to  "correctly" distribute, whom to take away from, and whom to give  to. This system of distributing everything is one of the  supporting members of the command system and its supplementary  underground economy.    Time has shown that government trade is basically unable to  create a real stimulus for the producer, to enliven turnover  between the city and the village or to stimulate goods  procurement operations. The economy was built on laws of direct  distribution, without effective reverse ties along all of the  parameters of the national economy. However, product quality,  abundance of goods, and conscientiousness in trade -- all of  this cannot be subject to dictates but develops out of economic  conditions. The consumer-purchaser has one eternal and  inalienable right -- the right to make choices in the market,  "voting" with his wallet. This is an important feature of an  individual's political freedom.    At the same time, the distribution system turned out to be a  very costly operation because of the need to support a huge  apparatus for goods distribution at all levels and in all  systems (in planning organs, in ministries, in soviets of all  levels, and so forth). It would be appropriate to note that from  the very beginning the distribution system was predisposed to  abuses, speculation, and corruption. Speculation itself is the  own child of the government monopoly in consumer goods  production and trade. It is also exceptionally important that  the market economy allows the country to become an integral part  of the world economy and to make use of the advantages of such a  division of labor. To do this we must have general business  laws, the freedom to trade goods, a stable currency and, most  importantly, a legally-based civil society.    Privatization of commerce, together with other measures, is  being called upon to radically alter the situation -- to remove  the administrative superstructure, to open the way to  competition, and to eliminate ongoing shortages, which were  artificially created even when they did not exist. The  distribution system -- the government monopoly in production,  distribution and trade, is to be replaced by a social-market  mechanism and free trade capable of balancing supply and demand  in the market. This is not a goal but a means. The social role  of commerce is being strengthened. Protecting the interests of  the buyer is a strategic path towards the development of trade.  Trade is the branch in which we can expect the most rapid and  radical changes in property relations and a high level of  privatization.    In Moscow over 90 percent of stores, public nutrition  enterprises and consumer service enterprises have been  privatized. This is a large number, considerably more than in  any other region in the country. The process of "small"  privatization has become irreversible and evidently will be  completed, for all practical purposes, in the near future.    As we know, Moscow took the initiative in privatizing  enterprises in the service sphere from the very beginning, when  a normative base did not yet exist. A considerable amount has  been accomplished. Things are always difficult for the first to  do something. Everyone criticizes Moscow-style "small"  privatization for being carried out in haste, for the things  that have not yet been done, and for the things that have  already been completed.    Were mistakes made? Yes, they were, and some of them were  extensive and basic. But not all the criticism that continues to  this day is conclusive, well-grounded or convincing. Much of the  criticism is slander and intrigue. People write and say things  that assume that privatization has not yielded anything, that  trade points are "growing fat," and that services to the  population have deteriorated.    Everything becomes known by drawing comparisons. Let us  recall the fall of 1991 -- the complete breakdown of the market,  empty stores, demeaning lines, and a sense of helplessness.  There were many predictions of hunger, cold, and revolts. These  predictions did not materialize; the market is being  reestablished. It is a truism that to properly understand what  occurred and is occurring in trade, to make a well-grounded  assessment of privatization, one should use as a basis the fact  that the apple (trade) does not fall far from the tree  (economy). Trade is a slice of the condition of society, its  barometer. There is no reason to hope for a "good" barometer  reading when the weather is miserable. In trade the diseases of  the past and the mistakes of the present are manifest as nowhere  else.    Today we can finally say that there is a light at the end of  the tunnel. The main character in the market is His Highness  Goods. The shortage of consumer goods was the "birthmark" of our  entire history during the existence of the  command-administrative system. As theoretical and practical  weapons we had the dogma that consumer demand must gradually  outstrip goods production and the supply of these goods to the  population. In other words, under socialism demand could never  be satisfied, and the tormenting word "deficit" was ours for  eternity.    The concept of "real income" long ago became relative,  because it is impossible to name a product group for which  demand would be fully met. According to orienting figures,  during successful 1970 (some sigh about it even now), 20  percent, and in 1978 -- already 53 percent of growth in savings  were the result of unsatisfied demand.    The pumping in of money unsupported by goods became a flood  that drowned trade completely in subsequent years. The hope that  a consumer could purchase inexpensive goods, even if he had to  wait in line, was less and less justified. Not everything could  be bought by far, but the population was wittingly issued  depreciated money.    The monetary income of citizens systematically outstripped  increases in the total volume of commodity turnover and paid  services. At the same time there was a concealed growth in  government retail prices, and the quality of goods decreased  while prices remained the same. This entire shortage of goods  was not due to the country's poverty; after all, it was inferior  to none in military strength. It was the fruit of certain  choices and ideologies, i.e., the realization of the postulate  that in contrast to capitalism, our demand must outstrip the  production of goods and push it forward, and this, they said,  was the advantage of our state. The crisis within the system led  right to the collapse of production, and the shortage became  most urgent.    A year or two ago the shelves of many stores were totally  empty. Today, although not everywhere, most shelves are filled  with goods of the kind the consumer hardly ever saw on the open  market even during the best of times. Enterprises have appeared  that are not inferior to the best contemporary models in terms  of both quantity of products as well as of commercial technology  and organization and services to the consumer. The most  characteristic features include complete economic independence  of enterprises, their direct ties with suppliers, rejection of  the practice of state funding with its accompanying trail of  paperwork and misappropriation of assets and time from a large  number of workers, and finally, the appearance of new stores on  the level of world standards.    Take GUM [Government department store], for example, which  recently celebrated its centennial. Its collective is pursuing  the goal of creating a world-class store. No, this is not at all  an attempt to "sell GUM to foreigners lock, stock and barrel,"  as some "specialists" claim. The goal is a different one:  stockholders are looking for and finding partners who are  multiplying their efforts to organize the most modern trade  enterprise. Large wholesale trading associations such as  Master-Lider, Olbi, Roditi, Ofis-Klub and many others are making  themselves known. The trade enterprises of many countries,  including Moskva-Makdonalds, Moskovskaya Pishcha, the Russian  French MOS-Danon SP [Specialized enterprise], the Russian-German  Taki-Moskva SP, and others, are operating successfully in the  capital. The old MacDonald's restaurant and its two younger  brothers are especially popular. The interest in expanding joint  commercial operations is evident not only in the capital, but in  other countries as well. The fruits of cooperation include  better quality services and the introduction of new technologies  that are naturally based on mutual interests and advantages.    Would you like to see with your own eyes stores in the  capital that are commercial jewels in the fullest sense of the  word? Then visit the Novoarbat or the Tverskoy food stores. They  have a wide variety of fresh products. The stores belong to  stockholders and do without middlemen. For this reason, the  proportion of trading costs in the price of the product at the  Tverskoy store, for example, is a little over 11 percent, which  is considerably lower than in any other. Having begun 4 years  ago with a lease, the enterprise is increasing turnover, having  now reached the billion-ruble-per-month mark. The bank joined  the food store as co-owner. And another feature: Suppliers from  near and faraway places abroad trust their goods to the store.  About 30 percent of goods turnover involves products that are  sold on consignment, i.e., with payment going to the supplier  after the goods are sold to the population.    There is a considerable number of such stores.  Unfortunately,  however, there are many more that one is grieved to look at,  where the operating principle is "I do whatever I want" and  where trade rules are flouted. Intoxicated by the newly-received  freedom and by the opportunity to make quick and large profits,  such trade "points" are moving towards abuse without concern for  their own development. Every second buyer in such enterprises is  cheated in the weighing of the product or during the payment  transaction. Often the items for sale are of poor quality, and  sometimes they are downright dangerous to one's health. These,  however, are remnants, and we will bring order here.    However, let us return to privatization. If Moscow were not  in a hurry to complete this work, and had it continued to  receive goods according to "plan," and allocated from "funds,"  the picture today would be lamentable. Government deliveries  planned last year and at the beginning of this year, have fallen  through completely. The capital has received and today is  receiving fewer than half of the promised deliveries. About 55  percent of the food products consumed by Muscovites were  procured and delivered by new entrepreneurial structures. For  some industrial goods almost 100 percent of goods are supplied  in this manner. These are the first fruits of rejuvenated  trading and its contribution to supplying a city of many  millions of people.    Let us explore another aspect of the question -- the social  structure of goods turnover. In terms of forms of property this  structure is changing rapidly and quite considerably. For the  first time, Russian consumers put less money into state trade  than into non-government trade. Today the share of the former  already comprises only 46 percent. The proportion of private  trading is 40 percent and of consumer cooperatives -- about 14  percent.    In terms of privatization pace, retail trade is the leader  within the domestic economy - 40,000 stores, halls, cafeterias  and cafes are in private hands today. This is only 8 percent,  which does not seem to be a large number. Nevertheless, this  small proportion of privatized enterprises sells as much as the  entire state trade, and if we also consider turnover in consumer  cooperatives this figure is even greater.    The state store is inferior not only in goods turnover but  in  profitability as well -- in private "points" it is higher by a  factor of 1.5, and in terms of effectiveness of expenditures  (the relationship of profits to circulation expenses) -- by a  factor of 2.    Of course, retail prices are higher by a factor of 1.5 in  private shops than in state stores. However, an enormous  distribution apparatus associated with the practice of funding,  the writing of orders to receive goods, and so forth, has been  liquidated. As a result, total volume of goods turnover in 1993  exceeded the preceding year by 4 percent. Note that there was an  increase and not a decrease. The natural use of basic foodstuffs  -- meat and meat products, eggs, potatoes, vegetables, sugar and  confectionery items -- also increased.    But let us be fair. Some problems are solved, others remain  and new ones are developing. Former state and municipal  enterprises were usually privatized in the capital in the form  of property of labor collectives. Today only 30 percent of them  have purchase-sales contracts and attestations of the right to  ownership. This means that almost two-thirds of privatized  enterprises have "become stuck" between earth and sky -- between  private and state. Practically not a single one of them has, as  of yet, a legally formulated document related to the right to  land use (place where the trade object is located).    Thus, on the one hand, most stores are considered owners; on  the other hand, strictly speaking their collectives occupy the  role of hired labor. Such "owners" naturally do not take the  risk of investing assets to expand goods turnover and to develop  their material base. They are interested in transforming profits  into their own personal wages as quickly as possible.    Normative documents allow for only two forms of selling --  at  auction or according to "strict" competition in the form of  closed bidding. But world practice includes other, more  effective methods. For example, there is special-purpose selling  not to the one who pays the most but to the one who proposes the  best conditions for utilizing the trade object. In our opinion,  a new concept should be included in the government privatization  program -- open trading with set conditions. This will become a  serious hindrance to those who love behind-the-scenes deals. It  can be said that the most effective forms of selling still fall  outside the sphere of our activities.    Incidentally, we should remember that in the relatively  successful East Germany plants often were sold at the standard  price of 1 mark, with the obligation that investments be made.  The federal government spent tens of billions of marks to  improve enterprises that were being sold instead of submitting  to enticing dreams about some sort of fantastic income from the  sale of their own losses.    An analysis of data on the course of commercial  privatization  convincingly shows that enterprises of the former state trade  are making the transition more and more to collective-share  ownership by labor collectives. This includes the largest  department stores, restaurants, trade centers, and wholesale  bases. Many of them, despite the short period of work following  privatization, have proven that they have managed successfully  as owners and are able to compete with private owners and  commercial structures, maintain specialization of enterprises,  increase sales volume and raise the level of social guarantees  for workers.    We should also stop to consider the figures that reflect the  selection of a particular method of privatization. Auctions,  despite their support by an unceasing propaganda campaign, have  not become significantly widespread. Even today, preference is  given to the practice of buying out leased property, especially  within the sphere of retail trade. On the one hand, this is a  concession to the interest of labor collectives. On the other  hand, it is a verification of fact -- there is an absence of  real competition in the commercial property market. It turns out  that it is not easy to find other owners willing to invest their  money in primitive counters, tumbledown structures, and  equipment that became obsolete long ago. We cannot but  acknowledge the sad fact that there has been a sharp downturn in  the development of the branch's material-technical base.    The auction is the most widespread, but not the only, form  of  selling. We foresee the possibility of carrying out contest  sales. The advantages of holding a contest are apparent. We are  referring to the interests of the population first and foremost.  One owner will replace the bakery with a disco-bar; another will  open a bakery within a "Khleb" [bread] store. Moreover, a  mandatory condition in a contest is the preservation of  specialization (commercial profile, sales level, services) for a  period of 3 years. These stipulations must be included in  contracts during the subsequent changing of hands of the object,  if this occurs before the completion of the 3-year period.    Unfortunately, there are problems even with "small"  privatization. The profits achieved by commercial enterprises do  not assure their financial security. According to various  calculations, deductions decrease possible profits by half, and  subsequent payments into the budget, the payment of numerous  taxes and dues curtail the remaining half by this same amount.  The remainder, which as we know, is not always "sweet," is very  small; it is even insufficient to purchase goods. The federal  budget does not earmark assets to maintain commercial  enterprises. All hope lies in local organs of authority. The  need for commercial investment is enormous. After all, a  calamitous reduction in its material-technical base is  occurring. In 1992, for example, the number of stores decreased  by almost one-fourth.    During the period of transition to market relations it is  vitally important to have government support, especially  initially. In Poland, for example, beginning commercial traders  do not pay a turnover or income tax for 2 years and 1 year  respectively if they are selling industrial goods.    Let us summarize what has been said. Commercial  privatization  in Russia, including Moscow, is unprecedented in scale and  cannot be compared to the experience of any other country in the  world, even if we take into account the great technical  difficulties involving its form, the voucher system and the  valuation of objects being privatized and their property. The  privatization program passed by the Russian Supreme Soviet  provides unjustifiably large incentives to labor collectives.  Evidently, it is hardly reasonable to change privatization rules  while privatization is in progress, and to thus risk provoking  large social conflicts. Evidently, the current stage of  privatization must be completed and rules must be changed  gradually. This must be done according to mutual agreements and  not according to the dictates of a particular side.    The main difficulty is that property has already been  divided  up, and active control over it on the part of the new owners is  absent. Here the administration as well as the labor collective  must play an increased role. This is why it is our task to  develop effective owners, to formulate rules and procedures for  redistributing property, and to create a system that will  withstand any attempts to squander it. It is important to move  from a system of almost free distribution of property to one in  which property is sold, from unconditional privatization to  privatization based on supplementary investment, and to  conditions that protect the interests and rights of consumers.    No less important today is the need to strengthen the  responsibility of those who buy privatized enterprises. Here we  must adhere strictly to purchase-sale conditions. With this  goal, contracts must foresee all of the essential conditions for  providing model services to the population. For our part, we  must foresee effective forms of control over adherence to such  conditions and severe sanctions for violations of these  conditions.    The role of commerce is not limited to the sale of goods. A  no less important task is to provide exemplary services to the  consumer. The higher calling of commerce is to serve man, and  that is the whole point of commercial privatization.</p>

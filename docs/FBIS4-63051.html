			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of the State Duma has instructed the  Duma legal department to turn to the media court of arbitration  following a complaint by the Liberal-Democratic faction about a  news analyst of Russian television Nikolay Svanidze. This was  disclosed to Interfax by the deputy speaker of the Duma Mikhail  Mityukov.    In a TV show on May 13 Svanidze said that according to his  knowledge the leader of Liberal-Democrats Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  paid each member of his faction 500 U.S. dollars for supporting  the draft of the federal budget at the first reading.    In an interview with Interfax Alexey Mitrofanov of the  Liberal- Democratic faction said the council did not make a  final decision on the suggestion of the faction to temporarily  ban Svanidze from appearing on television. Mitrofanov said that  faction members are going to sue Svanidze for misinformation.</p>

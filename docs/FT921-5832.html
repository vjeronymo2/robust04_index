			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Delors clad in shining armour: Europe Unless a miracle turns up, the Socialist administration of French President Francois Mitterrand seems doomed to go down the tube in 1993. Next month's regional elections are virtually certain to pass a damning verdict of rejection; and the sentence of dismissal will be carried out a year later in the general elections of 1993. Curiously, quite a few people seem to think there could be a miracle waiting just over the horizon, in the shape of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Last summer he began to emerge in the opinion polls as everybody's favourite politician; his popularity has now reached the level of apotheosis, and some commentators apparently believe that he will be cast in a starring role in a last-minute rescue drama. The common prediction is that he will be appointed prime minister, replacing Mrs Edith Cresson, shortly after next month's regional elections. His international stature and his identification with solid social-democrat values should enable him to reverse the calamitous decline in the government's popularity. Even if he cannot avoid ultimate defeat in 1993, he might limit the damage. In scene two, Mr Delors goes on to succeed President Mitterrand. After his spectacular re-entry to the French political scene, he would be well placed to win the presidential elections in 1995. He would then call new general elections, which would bring the Socialists back to power. QED, or (as the French say) CQFD. A variant of this scenario has a go-faster script. In November, President Mitterrand holds a referendum to shorten the presidential term from seven to five years. He announces that he will apply this constitutional reform to himself. This precipitates an early presidential poll, before the scheduled parliamentary elections; Mr Delors is triumphantly elected president, and the Socialists sweep back into power on his coat-tails. All this smacks of wishful thinking. After 11 years in power, it would be hard for the Socialist party to make a winning come-back. It has largely run out of political credit, and too many of its politicians are stained by the charges of corruption that used to stick to the conservatives. Mr Delors is popular partly because he has been out of French politics since 1985; but it is not clear how he could resuscitate the party's reputation. Opinion polls say Mr Delors would be the strongest Socialist candidate in a presidential election, able to beat any plausible candidate from the conservative opposition. The trouble is that Mr Michel Rocard got there first: he is already the party's 'virtual' presidential candidate, and even if the back-stairs agreement endorsing his candidacy is not formally binding, he will almost certainly run. If Mr Delors decided to stand against him, he would split the Socialist party, with possibly damaging effects on the outcome. Mr Delors says he is far too busy to think about French politics: he intends to stay in Brussels until his contract runs out at the end of the year, and he might stay longer if asked. Yet it is widely believed that, if President Mitterrand were to send for him, he would obey the call of duty. A prudent man would stay where he is for as long as possible. His most sensible strategy would be a waiting game, until the situation becomes clearer: the only summons that would serve his interests would be a call from the Socialist party, since that would mean that Mr Rocard was prepared to stand down. As it happens, he might well have the option of staying at the Commission for a two-year extension, which would take him conveniently up to the eve of the 1995 presidential elections. These speculative games are fun to play, and all French commentators love playing them. But the fascinating complexity of the possibilities of political manipulation should not be allowed to obscure aspects of deeper significance. First, the unstated assumption behind these games is the extent of the powers monopolised by the president: he and he alone pulls all the strings, and he chooses when to pull them. These powers are not spelled out in the constitution; but custom and precedent give the president great latitude. President Mitterrand has taken full advantage of his opportunities; and the consequence is that, when things go wrong, it is the president who is held responsible. Second, there must be a lesson to be drawn from the fact that the French people's preferred white knight is Mr Jacques Delors. Clean, intelligent, competent, successful - he is all these things; but it is not enough to explain his standing in the polls. Only one thing sets him apart from most other contenders: he is a man with strong convictions. This cannot be said of the Socialist party, which abandoned a crude form of socialism nearly 10 years ago, and has since relapsed into stodgy respectability. The moderate conservative parties are just as dull. The only strong convictions today come from the protest parties, and it is working wonders for their voter appeal: between them, the ecologists and the extreme right-wing National Front should get more than 27 per cent in next month's regional elections. Presumably, French voters want Mr Delors because a man who has answers for Europe must surely have answers for France as well. Unfortunately, the logic is faulty. The nation state continues to be the main locus of political action; but the Community exists because the nation state no longer provides as many good answers as it used to. The biggest worry for the French is unemployment; but if the answer is faster growth, it cannot be delivered from Paris. Mr Delors knows all this better than anyone; but he probably still suffers from the national illusion - after all, he is French.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Beijing assails provinces' rush for growth China's provinces were accused yesterday of engaging in the 'blind pursuit' of higher growth at the expense of the fight against inflation, in a tough official commentary that appeared to foreshadow renewed pressure to curb spending. The official Xinhua news agency, in a dispatch that almost certainly reflects the views of senior leadership, charged that lack of spending restraint at local levels had 'exerted a negative impact on the central government's efforts to control inflation'. The strong wording suggests Beijing is losing patience with provinces continuing wilfully to ignore central government directives. It also indicates increasing concern in Beijing at the difficulty of combating inflation. The Xinhua dispatch reported some 9,000 new construction projects were begun in China in July and August, in defiance of attempts to slow the rate of growth in fixed-asset spending. 'The reason for the price rises since the beginning of this year is basically a result of expansion in construction investment and excessive consumption,' the commentary said. China's consumer prices rose 27.4 per cent in the 12 months to September. This was almost two percentage points up on August, and indicated that, despite a stiffening of price controls, the underlying inflation rate remained stubbornly high. China reported that, in the nine months to September, 'fixed asset' spending grew 43.9 per cent above the same period last year. This represented a slowing of such investment, but the authorities are clearly concerned that capital spending remains too high. The People's Bank, China's central bank, released figures this week which showed that the broader M2 measure of money supply grew 37.1 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter, compared with the annual target for this year of 24 per cent. People's Bank officials warned that stronger effort was required to combat inflation. They blamed lack of budgetary restraint, persistent demands by state enterprises for working capital, and excessive growth in wages and salaries, for current problems. Earlier this week, the State Council, or cabinet, cracked down on non-bank financial institutions in an effort to curb unauthorised lending outside the credit plan. Local co-operatives and trust and investment companies have been an alternative source of funding for construction projects in defiance of government efforts to rein in such spending. China last year introduced a 16-point stabilisation programme aimed at calming an overheating economy. While the measures have had some effect, the continuing high rates of inflation have obliged the authorities to take stronger remedial measures, including the reintroduction of price controls. The government announced in August that it was making the inflation fight its main priority for the rest of the year. Continent discovered, Page 15</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Fears over US rates DESPITE the announcement of better-than-expected April employment figures in Washington last week, the foreign exchange markets are still looking for clear signs of the long-awaited US economic recovery, writes James Blitz. On Friday, the dollar staged a small rally on the back of the rise in non farm payroll by 126,000. But uncertainty remains over whether the Federal Reserve may cut its Fed funds rate again, with analysts looking ahead to Wednesday's retail sales figures for any indication of movement. 'We can't rule out another interest rate cut if those retail sales figures are on the weak side,' says Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London. The market forecast is for a rise of 0.3 per cent. Another cut in US interest rates would undermine investor confidence in the dollar, not least because German short-term interest rates are six points higher. The recent strength of both sterling and the French franc against the D-Mark may also be tested by indicators in both countries this week. On Friday, the monthly UK Retail Prices Index is published, with the market expecting it to show a year-on-year rise in April of 4.4 per cent. Provisional consumer prices are published in France on the same day, with analysts forecasting a month-on-month rise of 0.3 per cent. If the figures overshoot in either country, the markets may question whether their respective governments were wise to engineer a half per cent cut in base rates last week. Trading in the yen may pick up again after the lull of recent days, which was mostly due to Japan's golden week holiday. Analysts have suggested that the yen could soon strengthen to Y130 to the dollar from its current position of around Y133.</p>

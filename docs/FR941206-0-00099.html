			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of the approximately 16,000 letters of comment received in response to the February 28, 1992 regulations, nearly 300 were in reference to the general QC requirements of subpart K. Over 25 percent of these commenters were opposed to allowing a laboratory to meet the CLIA QC requirements by following the manufacturer's FDA-cleared QC instructions. The majority of commenters indicated that all laboratories should be subject to the same QC requirements. Less than two percent of the commenters agreed with the provision. Approximately two percent of the commenters expressed concern that a laboratory may be penalized if the FDA does not complete the assessment of a manufacturer's QC instructions prior to the end of the phase-in period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We acknowledge the commenters' concerns. Having encountered difficulties in commencing the review of manufacturers' QC instructions, we are extending the effective date of &sect;493.1203, which contains the quality control requirements for moderate or high complexity testing, or both, from September 1, 1994 to September 1, 1996. In addition, we are extending the September 1, 1994 sunset date until September 1, 1996 of &sect;493.1202, which contains the quality control standards for moderate or high complexity testing, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Board Certification of a Laboratory Director With Doctoral Degree (&sect;493.1443(b)(3))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 493.1443(b)(3) provides that a director of a laboratory performing high complexity testing who has an earned doctoral degree in a chemical, physical, biological or clinical laboratory science from an accredited institution must, as of September 1, 1994, be certified by a board recognized by HHS. The 2-year phase-in was designed to allow HHS additional time to review requests for approval of certification programs and to ensure that a laboratory director with a doctoral degree had sufficient time to successfully complete the requirements for board certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters on the final rule suggested that board certification not be a mandatory requirement for currently employed individuals. In addition, CLIAC has suggested, and we are considering, development of alternative provisions to qualify currently employed individuals with a doctoral degree on the basis of laboratory training or experience, in lieu of requiring board certification. Furthermore, in at least one specialty, there is currently no board certification, but a program is being developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that doctoral degree training and education were sufficient without requiring board certification to qualify as a laboratory director. One commenter agreed with requiring board certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In reply to these comments and to the recommendations of CLIAC, we are allowing additional time to review the qualifications required to ensure that they are appropriate. We are extending the phase-in period in &sect;493.1443 from September 1, 1994, to September 1, 1996 to allow additional time for this evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the director be board certified in the specialty of testing that the laboratory performs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Frank Pig Says Hello - Theatre Frank Pig Says Hello at the Royal Court Upstairs represents a type of play increasing its popularity in studio venues: a tight, two-handed psychodrama which asks actors and designer to be versatile, and in order to make itself understood urges the audience to sever contact with the rational world. But this makes deadly, wearisome and stultifying theatre. Patrick McCabe's first play is an adaptation of his own fine novel, The Butcher Boy, midway between Patrick McGrath's Spider and Ian McEwan's The Cement Garden. It comes from the Gate Theatre, Dublin after winning  - inexplicably - a Dublin 'New Play' award last year. The stage action centres on the mental life of Francie 'Piglet' Brady, his daydreams and his psychoses. The play eschews plot, and opts for series of revisited and altered scenes from Brady's childhood intercut with episodes from later life. He turns out to be a sad child enslaved to fantasies from 1950s comics. He is disruptive at home and school, in league with a real-imaginary friend who becomes his alter ego in later life. His mother kills herself, his father dies and stays unburied in the parlour, while Brady takes a job in an abattoir. The verbal interplay between past and present is a technical triumph for actors David Gorry and Sean Rocks, who deliver quick-fire Irish banter, but it makes woeful dialogue on stage: 'I had news for Philip. Philip, I have news for you. News? Yes, News. For me? Yes.' This play fails because, despite director Joe O'Byrne's ingenuity in switching between scenes, the play makes no concerted impact. No one scene causes another one; the logic of psychosis means that anything can happen at any time, and that removes suspense. The narrative moves quickly, but by telling everything, it prevents tensions, affections and events from being shown and acted out. The appearance of a character with a red handkerchief is preceded by 'He had a red handkerchief in his pocket, and the crease on his trousers would cut your hand.' Elsewhere, the action leans on musical effects: Glen Miller's 'Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree' recurs periodically to punctuate the scenes, as does Brady's own song, 'I'm a little baby pig I'll have you all to know, with my little curly tale and my nose that turns up so.' The result is a confusing, difficult and annoying play which fosters a short attention span. Such works have altered the course of theatre. But this offers neither information nor moral challenge. It settles into an intellectual game. It makes its effect not in the situation which it creates for the characters, but in the smiles and scowls of the actors. It is a shame and a waste that the piece is so well acted. Royal Court Upstairs until April 3, then on a national tour through April and May</p>

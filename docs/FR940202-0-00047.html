Contract that does not have adequate stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1995, A sells B nonpublicly traded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property under a contract that calls for a $100,000 payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal on January 1, 2005, and 10 annual interest payments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $9,000 on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assume that the test rate of interest is 9.2 percent, compounded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually. The contract does not provide for adequate stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest because it does not provide for interest equal to 9.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, compounded annually. The present value of the deferred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments is $98,727.69. As a result, the contract has unstated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest of $1,272.31 ($100,000 ^ $98,727.69).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Contract that does not have adequate stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest; no interest for initial short period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On May 1, 1996,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A sells B nonpublicly traded property under a contract that calls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for B to make a principal payment of $200,000 on December 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1998, and semiannual interest payments of $9,000, payable on June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on December 31, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assume that the test rate of interest is 9 percent, compounded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannually. Even though the contract calls for a stated rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of interest no lower than the test rate of interest, the contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not provide for adequate stated interest because the stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of interest does not apply for the short period from May 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, through June 30, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. Potentially abusive situation_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially abusive situation, a contract for the sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonpublicly traded personal property calls for the issuance of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cash method debt instrument (as defined in section 1274A(c)(2))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a stated principal amount of $700,000, payable in 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No other consideration is given. The debt instrument calls for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual payments of interest over its entire term at a rate of 9.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, compounded annually (the test rate of interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the debt instrument). Thus, the present value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deferred payment and the interest payments is $700,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assume that the fair market value of the property is $500,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Amount of unstated interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A cash method debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument received in exchange for property in a potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abusive situation provides for adequate stated interest only if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sum of the deferred payments under the instrument does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed the fair market value of the property. Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferred payment ($700,000) exceeds the fair market value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property ($500,000), the debt instrument does not provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate stated interest. Therefore, the debt instrument has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unstated interest of $200,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Variable rate debt instrument with adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated interest; variable rate as of the issue date greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test rate_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A contract for the sale of nonpublicly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traded property calls for the issuance of a debt instrument in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the principal amount of $75,000 due in 10 years. The debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument calls for interest payable semiannually at a rate of 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage points above the yield on 6-month Treasury bills at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mid-point of the semiannual period immediately preceding each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest payment date. Assume that the interest rate is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified floating rate and that the debt instrument is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable rate debt instrument within the meaning of &sect;1.1275&hyph;5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Adequate stated interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under paragraph (b)(1) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section, rules similar to those in &sect;1.1274&hyph;2(f) apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether the debt instrument has adequate stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest. Assume that the test rate of interest applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument is 9 percent, compounded semiannually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assume also that the yield on 6-month Treasury bills on the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the sale is 8.89 percent, which is greater than the yield on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6-month Treasury bills on the first date on which there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under which the sale is consummated. Under &sect;1.1274&hyph;2(f), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument is tested for adequate stated interest as if it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for a stated rate of interest of 11.89 percent (3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent plus 8.89 percent), compounded semiannually, payable over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its entire term. Because the test rate of interest is 9 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounded semiannually, and the debt instrument is treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing for stated interest of 11.89 percent, compounded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannually, the debt instrument provides for adequate stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section applies to sales and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchanges that occur on or after April 4, 1994.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chilean Finance Minister-Designate Eduardo </F> Aninat by Carolina Garcia de la Huerta; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Garcia] He was taken aback by his appointment.  He had already pictured to himself that he and his family would  travel to Washington, where he would be in charge of Chile's  embassy in the United States. He had even practically finished  packing his suitcases.    But fate and [President-elect] Eduardo Frei decided  otherwise. He will be the successor to [Finance Minister  Alejandro] Foxley, as well as to [Copper Corporation Executive  President Designate Juan] Villarzu.    Eduardo Aninat, 45, is a Catholic University graduate in  economics. He has a PhD in economics from Harvard University.  He is well known in Chilean circles for his negotiating skills.  President Aylwin entrusted him with the task of negotiating  Chile's external debt in 1990. He is married to Teresita Sahli,  and has six children. He has always been linked to the private  sector and to economic affairs through his firm of management  consultants -- Aninat, Mendez, and Merino -- which will have to  lie dormant for several years.    At the president-elect's personal request he headed, until  recently, a special commission, also including Fernando Leniz  and Ramon Aboitiz, which was in charge of several aspects  pertaining to the handing over of power. Aninat explains that  the reason behind this is that the new administration wants to  commence its period of office by working, and to that effect a  seminar is to be held for the first time on the coming 13 March.  It will be addressed especially to leading figures from foreign  companies, who will have the chance to listen to presentations  made by the new government's team.    This tall man, with a clear gaze and prematurely gray beard,  speaks with great deliberation and in a reassuring tone. He  keeps toying with a pencil while he speaks. Nothing seems to  disturb him or, least of all, annoy him. He says that he does  not have any obsessions, and has but one pet dislike: "I do not  like people who bore you to tears by talking too much." Warm  and unaffected, he is now getting ready to leave his office,  located in one of the few houses left near El Bosque Street,  which is at present lined with high-rise buildings. As of March  he will occupy the best offices of the 12th floor at 120  Teatinos Street, right in downtown Santiago and only a step from  La Moneda -- precisely he who enjoys nature and ecology so much.  He says that when he leaves the Finance Ministry he will return  to Valdivia [where he has his ranch]. [passage omitted]    It seems that you are in the same situation Minister Foxley  was in. When he was installed as finance minister he commented  that it had fallen upon him to dance with the plain lady of the  cabinet. Do you hold the same views now?    [Aninat] No... I believe I am going to dance with one of the  gorgeous ladies, but the great challenge is to keep her  beautiful and prevent others from handling her roughly.    [Garcia] Are you concerned about this?    [Aninat] I have one very clear thing in mind... I would  rather lose my post as finance minister than put the stability  that cost us so dear in jeopardy, not even for a single minute.  [passage omitted]    [Garcia] You were associate coordinator for foreign policy  of  Frei's campaign management team... You accompanied him to his  meetings with [Mexican President Carlos] Salinas de Gortari,  prior to the signing of NAFTA. You have been adviser to  [Argentine Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo. After having been  involved in foreign affairs for such a long time, were you  disappointed with the fact that you were left without the  embassy in Washington?    [Aninat] That was a very interesting challenge which we came  to believe would become a reality. My wife Teresita and I were  ready to take that challenge, and were little by little planning  our lives to accommodate this new reality. We were to have left  in April. And yet by an odd quirk, and by virtue of the post I  am going to hold, I am not going to totally abandon this,  because undoubtedly the free trade agreement with the United  States must be handled by the Finance Ministry. Nevertheless,  now you will have me as minister and not as ambassador.    [Garcia] NAFTA became at one time Foxely's great banner.  Will you try to follow in Foxley's footsteps with regard to  that issue?    [Aninat] No, I think that there are many issues, and the  agenda ought to be more diversified, more flexible, more in  keeping with modern times! -- he says, rapping with his index  finger on the blue book on the table -- Frei's economic program.  There will be other issues; not the ones Foxley had to deal  with, but it goes without saying that NAFTA will be high on the  list of priorities, even though it will be one among many.    [Garcia] And what are you going to do with all the work you  have done, all the folders you prepared to take over as  ambassador?    [Aninat] I am going to give them to my dear friend and  fellow  party member, [Foreign] Minister [-designate] Carlos Figueroa  Serrano, next week. [passage omitted]    [Garcia] It has been said that there is a marked resemblance  between you and Foxley, and that because of this one should  expect "more of the same thing." Is that correct?    [Aninat] I would venture to say that we will now take  strides  while ensuring continuity, but there will also be a greater  variety and complexity of issues.    [Garcia] Do you uphold your criticism of the economic team,  namely that it lacked boldness in moving forward more quickly?    [Aninat] I do. I think that after a difficult first year,  1990, the period 1991-93 was characterized by some favorable  objective conditions that would have enabled some areas to be  streamlined more speedily.    [Garcia] Such as?    [Aninat] The modernization of the whole apparatus of  government itself and an earlier incursion into capital markets,  even though a good bill has been submitted to Congress.    [Garcia] The same one that has been sitting there for a  year,  and has not yet been passed?    [Aninat] Yes, but one must bear in mind that the executive  branch is not entirely to blame for that.    [Garcia] Chile has been rated internationally as Plus Triple  B concerning investment risks. Many people wonder what the use  of this classification is, if there are not a greater number of  companies that can invest abroad, if the AFP's [Pension Fund  Managing Companies] are limited, if banks are unable to invest  abroad... if there are also so many restrictions to bringing in  and remitting capital abroad.    [Aninat] That area, which is quite complex, is one of my  favorite subjects, because what Foxley and I tried to do with  the famous Eurobonds was to fully place Chile's name on  voluntary financial markets.    [Garcia] And that has been accomplished.    [Aninat] But it was properly accomplished, thanks to that  first signal at that time. We have therefore indeed derived  benefits from something that you omitted -- the perception, the  classification of risk country has not only improved with regard  to how foreigners assess us, but also as to how Chilean  businessmen themselves and local agents view our country. I  deem that the domestic investment rate would not have been as  high as it currently is if we had not managed to attain that  favorable reinsertion abroad.    [Garcia] But we continue to talk at the level of perception.  We have a country of a quality that very few in Latin America  can dream about. Can we take better advantage of this situation?    [Aninat] Progress must be made. I would like to coordinate  my work with other members of the cabinet, and especially with  the Central Bank, to continue to make progress on what you are  talking about. We need a greater presence abroad for the  Chilean AFP [Pension Fund Administration Boards], and the  gradual participation of first class (he emphasized this)  Chilean banks abroad. I feel the same way about the insurance  companies and the investment funds. In other words, continue to  internationalize our financial market further to integrate it  with the rest of the world. This does not mean taking on  anything and in any order.    [Garcia] Where is the limit?    [Aninat] The idea is not to be liberal just for the sake of  being liberal; things should be done scientifically. And  sometimes the private sector, or part of it, either because it's  the fashion or the passion, tend to jump in with both feet  without evaluating all of the risks.    [Garcia] How can you pretend to be moving faster on the  internationalization of the Chilean economy if you said that the  Chilean Central Bank "is excellent but conservative?"    [Aninat] It seems that all the central banks around the  world  are conservative, and in this sense they are an interesting  counterbalance for many pressures. But I am lucky, excuse me  for speaking in the first person, to know the five current bank  members very well. Therefore, I believe the issue of  coordination and communication with the Central Bank will go  well... At least that is my intention.    [Garcia] You said you want to work to motivate all Chileans.  If when you take over the ministry there are 4 million poor  people, how many fewer will there be six years from now?    [Aninat] I would not dare to establish a goal in figures  now,  because I am just now -- as some people say -- reading the  specific tasks ahead. What is clear is that Chile has the  moral, ethical, political, and social obligation to drastically  reduce the number of Chileans affected by poverty. And in  particular, it has the obligation to improve the situation of  the 1.2 million people who live in extreme poverty.    [Garcia] Will an important part of the resources be  appropriated to them?    [Aninat] An important part of the administration will be  dedicated to them. And this goes beyond resources. It means  evaluation, costs, benefits, and the rational use and greater  sophistication of the many social programs.    [Garcia] What does that mean? Is that a criticism of the  effectiveness of social spending over the last four years?    [Aninat] It is not a criticism. But if on the one hand one  studies what has been done in the different types of programs in  health, housing, social security, and on the other studies the  requirements of the new times, it can be seen that some of these  programs were created more than two decades ago. I believe the  time has come to review whether the type of development,  administration, and management involved in social spending is  appropriate for 1994.    [Garcia] But does that mean the same amount of resources,  the  same amount of taxes?    [Aninat] There is a legislative mandate that must be  respected. The tax debate is already over, and therefore the key  issue here is growth. We must have growth in order to continue  to improve equity and increase social spending. This is  essential.    [Garcia] Are you afraid of the threat posed by the  international recession which is still hanging over our country?    [Aninat] I am not afraid of it, but rather concerned about  it. I believe we should put it clearly. With Germany  registering a negative growth rate this year, and France and  Italy a zero growth rate, and in the Group of Seven only the  United States beginning to recuperate, we must necessarily  behave with extreme cautiousness.    [Garcia] What does that mean?    [Aninat] It means that the level of spending in our economy  should be entirely consistent with its level of income and with  its potential productivity.    [Garcia] Based on that, would you support reducing the  current level of spending? The 1994 budget provides for  expenditures surpassing the growth rate of the economy...    [Aninat] I cannot yet draw such a specific conclusion, but I  would say that as far as making income consistent with spending  is concerned, what we have begun to do is to examine the final  figures of the economy in the last quarter of 1993, to see  whether there is actual consistency or whether supplementary  measures must be enforced.    [Garcia] What is your perception of what might occur in the  world economy in 1994?    [Aninat] I believe the world economy will very slowly begin  to recuperate. It will be a slow, partial, and unequal  recuperation, with several countries still remaining stagnant.    [Garcia] Could 1994 be even more complex for Chile?    [Aninat] It might eventually turn out to be more complex.    [Garcia] The balance of trade is expected to register a  deficit that will be considerably higher than the one registered  this year, which will be at approximately $900 million.    [Aninat] Our current account deficit remains within limits  that we can manage easily. Therefore, what we and the Central  Bank should do is carefully evaluate, as a whole, the evolution  of the terms of exchange, the balance of trade performance, and  the current account deficit.    [Garcia] You have said that you do not yet want to set any  targets. Do you believe Chile can expect a one-digit inflation  rate for 1997, as Villarzu stated?    [Aninat] As I have already told you, I cannot make  categorical, specific statements now. But what I can promise  all Chileans is that the target of continuing to gradually  reduce inflation will remain a priority for the Finance  Ministry. [passage omitted]    [Garcia] Your slogan has been "not hasty, but in-depth  privatization." What would be your first suggestion for  privatization?    [Aninat] I would like to carefully study the list of  enterprises that are currently run by Corfo [Production  Development Corporation], and which are of various types. There  are enterprises in the areas of shipping, transport, water  supply, and sewage, there are agriculture undertakings, etc.    [Garcia] What would you suggest be done with them?    [Aninat] As I am saying, I believe it is high time that the  list be very carefully studied in order to establish targets and  priorities on a careful timetable, so as to make progress in a  determined manner toward the private sector in those areas.  [passage omitted]    [Garcia] What are your plans for Codelco [Copper  Corporation]?    [Aninat] I believe we need a sophisticated, comprehensive  view of large-scale mining. First, because Chile has a  comparative and also absolute advantage in the area and,  therefore, cannot mortgage this sector. Consequently, from the  viewpoint of the country, it is necessary to continue promoting  investment in the mining sector.    [Garcia] The point is how to do it, with a privately-owned  or  state-run Codelco?    [Aninat] We have a state management problem in the sector.  We have therefore thought about creating a holding with  branches managed by independent corporations run by standard  regulations. What is a necessary step. Creating self-supporting  branches with responsible management. [passage omitted]    [Garcia] Did you participate in the design of the economic  program?    [Aninat] I did in various parts, especially and very deeply  in the foreign policy chapter.    [Garcia] Don't you think your own perceptions are bolder  than  those of the program in terms of liberalization and  privatization?    [Aninat] I would say perceptions are the same, with some  differences in rate or speed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 1 (CTK) -- Forty-five percent of  Czechs believe that parliament should consist of the Chamber of  Deputies alone, according to a survey of 946 people carried out  by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM) at the end  of April and the beginning of May. In November 1993 this figure  was 42 percent, and this February it was 43 percent.    Meanwhile, support for a two-chamber parliament to include a  senate is down to 18 percent, having stood at 23 percent in  November and 24 percent in February. Those who did not know  formed 37 percent (earlier 35 and 33 percent).    People who did not want a Senate were more likely to be  Czech  Social Democratic Party (CSSD) supporters, although they  included also many Civic Democratic Party (ODS) supporters.    The IVVM also asked respondents if they would take part in  elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Senate and local  authorities if such elections were to be held now. 71 percent  said they would definitely or probably take part in Chamber of  Deputies elections and 76 percent in local elections, but only  45 percent would take part in elections to the Senate.  Willingness to participate in all three types of elections grew  with the level of education reached.</p>

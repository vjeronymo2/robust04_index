			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Luftfartsverket (LFV), which is the airworthiness authority for Sweden, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Saab Aircraft AB Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. The LFV advises that, when the pilot of a Model SAAB SF340B series airplane disengaged the autopilot during approach for landing, the elevators required additional force in order to be operated correctly. Investigation revealed that delamination had occurred between the composite structure and the aluminum foil on the elevator cove. When water entered the delaminated area and froze, the aluminum foil was raised further, causing contact with the elevator. The design of the aileron cove is similar to that of the elevator cove on Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. The design consists of a composite structure with a conductive layer, which is composed of aluminum foil, conductive paint, or expanded aluminum foil (stretched metal_aluminum net). Delamination and freezing of trapped water in the aileron or elevator could lead to jamming of these parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Saab has issued Service Bulletin 340&hyph;51&hyph;012, dated November 10, 1993, that describes procedures for an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to verify the type of antistatic protection (black conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil (an aluminum net)) applied to the coves. For coves that are found without conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil, the service bulletin describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to detect aluminum foil delamination on the coves; and either a temporary repair and repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests of the coves, or a permanent repair of the coves. The temporary repair involves applying aluminum tape or conductive paint to the delaminated area, and accomplishing repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests of the cove. The permanent repair entails either applying conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil (stretched metal_aluminum net) to the cove. Accomplishment of the permanent repair would terminate the repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests. The LFV classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Swedish Airworthiness Directive No. 1&hyph;060, dated November 15, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Sweden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LFV has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LFV, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to verify the type of antistatic protection applied to the coves. For coves that are found without conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil, the proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to detect aluminum foil delamination on the coves; and either a temporary repair and repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests of the coves, or a permanent repair of the coves. Accomplishment of the permanent repair would terminate the repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 152 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 20 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $167,200, or $1,100 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

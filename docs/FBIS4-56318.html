			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange  yesterday asked Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma for two  months' leave without pay after the leave permit he is currently  enjoying expires. Minister Perez accepted the request.    This information was disclosed by the Defense Ministry in a  brief communique of four and a half lines.    General Stange will thus remain outside the Carabineros  institution for another 60 days after his leave permit is over.    It should be recalled that Defense Minister Perez Yoma had  stated in Concepcion that Stange's vacation was for an  "indefinite" period of time.    Carabineros Deputy Director Fernando Cordero Rusque is  currently carrying out Stange's duties in his place.    Stange went on leave after special Judge Milton Juica  condemned 16 Carabineros officers and one civilian to sentences  ranging from 61 days to life imprisonment for the abduction and  murder of communist leaders Jose Manuel Parada, Manuel Guerrero,  and Santiago Natino, for the abduction of several leaders of the  former Agech [Chilean Educators Association], for the abduction  of Ramon Arriagada, the wounding of professor Leopoldo Munoz de  la Parra with a bullet, and for the unlawful association for  terrorist purposes, among other crimes.    After Judge Juica's ruling was disclosed, President Eduardo  Frei met on 5 April with Stange at La Moneda Palace. Frei  allegedly asked Stange to resign, but at the end of the meeting  the Carabineros director said: "I am not resigning."    On 8 April Stange went on leave, which prompted a polemic  between the Carabineros and the government. According to the  Carabineros, Stange was taking a regular 30 day vacation, while  the government maintained he would be on leave for an  "indefinite" period of time. [passage omitted]</p>

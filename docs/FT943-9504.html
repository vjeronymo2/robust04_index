			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / CDU/FDP coalition 'possible' For the first time since the start of Germany's election campaign, an opinion poll suggests that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union might be able to form a majority government with its present Free Democratic party allies. The two parties would poll a combined 50.2 per cent of the vote if October's election were held next Sunday, the Allensbach Institute reported. While the CDU's popularity is rising, more important has been a recovery in the fortunes of the FDP who have seen their support grow since June. The latest poll, conducted in August, puts the CDU on 40.9 per cent and the FDP on 9.3 per cent. The gains were made at the expense of the opposition Social Democratic party, which the poll gives 32.7 per cent of the vote, and the left-wing Greens/Bundnis 90 party 10.1 per cent. The former communists, the PDS, would poll 3.7 per cent.</p>

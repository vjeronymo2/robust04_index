			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nicholas Bethell report: "Scientist Says Russians Still </F> Defy Chemical Weapons Ban"]    [Text] Vil Mirzayanov, who became Russia's first  post-Soviet political prisoner for revealing Russia's continuing  chemical weapons programme, has spoken of "barbaric conditions"  in the prison from which he was released last month.    Dr. Mirzayanov was told that the case against him, on  charges  carrying up to eight years in prison, has been dropped for lack  of evidence. At his flat in Moscow he said: "I was called to  the Ministry of Justice by Lev Baranov, the prosecutor in my  case. It was a five-minute conversation. He apologised to me  on behalf of A. N. Ilyushenko, Prosecutor-General of the Russian  Federation. I told him that I would be taking the `new KGB' to  court for the great moral and material damage they caused me  these past 18 months."    Dr. Mirzayanov, 58, said that men were held at the  Matrosskaya Tishina jail, sometimes for years, while their cases  were investigated, with no visits permitted from friends or  family. He described having to stand with 50 other prisoners,  all naked because of the heat, in a cell infested with rats,  cockroaches, bedbugs and lice, and so small that no one could  lie down or sit.    Dr. Mirzayanov worked for more than 25 years in a large  military chemical research institute on Enthusiasts' Avenue in  Moscow. In 1990 he was one of the first to resign from the  Communist Party to join the democratic movement. In October  1992 he blew the whistle on his old firm, revealing that  Russia's chemical warfare industry, despite the 1989  Bush-Gorbachev agreement to destroy all chemical weapons and end  production, was producing a new binary substance in Volgograd  eight times more poisonous than anything possessed by the  Americans. He was immediately arrested.    In early 1992, he said, field trials of the new gas were  held  on the Ustyurt plateau in what was by then the independent state  of Uzbekistan, without the knowledge of President Karimov, the  Uzbek leader.    "In other words, we pulled the wool over the Americans' eyes  good and proper," he said. When the Americans found out later  that year what was happening, they said nothing for fear of  making Mr. Bush look foolish in the run-up to the presidential  election.    Dr. Mirzayanov talked of past years in the Soviet military  chemical establishment in Chapayevsk, where soldiers who were  thought by the authorities to be of poor quality were put to  work pouring lewisite, a deadly poisonous arsine derivative,  from buckets and teapots into artillery shells. Many of them  died. Then there was the great "white sea" accident when tons  of poison were discharged into the Volga river, turning it white  with the bellies of dead fish.    Russian scientists and generals, he says, continue their  terrible work on chemical warfare even today. Accidents are  frequent. They carry on working because it is the only trade  they know and because chemical warfare has no possibility of  "conversion" into peaceful work.    The Russian authorities have decided that the poisons to be  destroyed under the Bush-Gorbachev agreement should be dealt  with by those who made them. This is being done, he says, by  burning the poisons in remote Russian localities, with  disastrous results for the environment.    It is estimated by Dr. Mirzayanov that up to 50 per cent of  those in Russian labour camps may be innocent of the charges on  which they were convicted. He attributes his own escape from a  long prison term to "pressure by Amnesty International, the  European Parliament, the American Academy of Sciences and the  Russian democratic movement".    Those who have no such friends are still wrongly convicted  in  large numbers. Aleksey Smirnov, the former Soviet dissident who  is now chairman of the Centre for Human Rights in Moscow, said:  "You must not imagine, just because the Soviet Union has gone,  that Russia is now a country with monitors. We need observers.  We need Western non-governmental organisations with staff and  equipment. We need a civilised parliament. Then maybe we can  make progress."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Three projects -- in  Henan, Hunan and Shanxi provinces -- were given awards here  yesterday as outstanding contributions to the elimination of  poverty in China.    At the same awards giving ceremony, 75 technologists were  presented with the service award of the Zhenhua poverty relief  by technology fund.    The fund has been donated by Hong Kong academic circles.    A leading official of the State Science and Technology  Commission (SSTC) said at the ceremony that the fund was of  great importance, because the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong are  jointly promoting the work of poverty elimination through  technology.    Sponsored by the society of Hong Kong Scholars (SHS), the  fund aims to encourage and support technological and  professional personnel to go to poverty-stricken areas to help  citizens there to escape poverty.    Elimination of poverty and common prosperity are considered  as the basic requirement of socialism and a reflection of the  advantages of a socialist system in China.    At the national conference on poverty elimination held last  month, China promulgated an ambitious seven-year plan to wipe  out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing  shortages for the remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens.    The official said that the key to the goal lies in the  advancement of science and technology and improvement of  knowledge and skills of farmers.    Since 1986, the state commission for science and technology  has given 8.5 million yuan of special funds for poverty  elimination, and 200 million yuan in loans.    Furthermore, it helped poverty-stricken areas to bring in  more than 400 poverty elimination projects and 2,700 suitable  techniques, which made direct profits of 800 million yuan for  the poor.    Most of the below-poverty-line citizens live in rural areas  of 699 counties in the central and western parts of China.</p>

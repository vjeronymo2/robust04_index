			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / India cuts interest rates again INDIA yesterday cut interest rates in an attempt to reverse a two-year slowdown in economic growth. The government believes that, without more signs of growth, Indians could become disenchanted with its programme to modernise and open up the economy. Industrialists last night welcomed the interest rate cuts but said the government would have to do more to stimulate the economy. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, cut the commercial banks' minimum lending rate by one percentage point to 15 per cent and the maximum deposit rate by the same margin to 10 per cent. They were the fourth cuts since the central bank started easing rates from a peak of 19 per cent last autumn. The reductions are designed to promote steady growth following a sharp monetary squeeze in 1991-92, when rates were raised to curb inflation and to help defuse a balance of payments crisis by choking off demand for imports. Inflation has since fallen from a peak of 16.3 per cent to 6.2 per cent and the country's balance of payments position has improved markedly thanks to a recovery in exports and an inflow of savings from Indians living abroad. Foreign exchange reserves have soared fourfold to Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.86bn). The reserve bank had signalled its intention to cut interest rates in mid-October but brought forward the reduction because of slack demand for funds from industry. Industrialists are responding to the government's economic reforms with corporate restructuring, talks with potential foreign partners and the announcement of investment plans. But they have so far been reluctant to commit themselves to spending money. Growth in industrial output could fall short of the government's forecast of 6-7 per cent for the year to the end of March next year because demand for steel, machinery and other capital goods is still weak, despite export growth in some industries, notably textiles. Exports in the first three months of the financial year rose 27 per cent. The Confederation of Indian Industry argues that minimum lending rates should be no more than 3 per cent above the rate of inflation, or about 9-10 per cent. This would be difficult to achieve without extensive financial reform, including abolition of rules which force banks to direct cheap credit to priority borrowers such as state industry. Also, the government is struggling to control its own borrowing. It promised to cut the fiscal deficit from 6.5 per cent in 1991-92 to 5 per cent last year and 4 per cent in 1993-94. In fact, last year's figure was 5.7 per cent.</p>

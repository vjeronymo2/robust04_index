			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report in the "Scandal" column: </F> "Yeltsin's Order on Military Bases in Latvia Does Not Exist.  Andrey Kozyrev: `We Are Being Tested for Firmness'"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] A highly placed Russian  diplomat told SEGODNYA that the Foreign Affairs Ministry did not  learn about the existence of the document on the Russian bases  until the Russian ambassador in Riga was summoned to the Latvian  Foreign Ministry for explanation. The copy of the paper in  possession of the Russian delegation has been received from the  Latvian Embassy in Moscow and has all the requisites except for  Yeltsin's signature. The text says: "Agree with the proposal by  the Russian Defense Ministry on creating on the territories of  the CIS member states and the Latvian Republic of military bases  of the Russian Federation Armed Forces to ensure the security of  the Russian Federation and said states and also to test new arms  and military equipment. The Russian Foreign Ministry, jointly  with the Russian Defense Ministry and other Russian Federation  departments concerned, are to hold talks on this question with  the CIS member states and the Latvian Republic and to formalize  the accords reached by corresponding documents." The paper,  which, in the expression of a Russian diplomat, was "slipped in  for signing" to the president, bears number 175-RP and is dated  5 April. [passage omitted]</p>

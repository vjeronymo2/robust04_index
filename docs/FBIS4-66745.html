			<p>U.S.   <F P=102>   94AS0266C Karachi JANG in Urdu 16 Apr 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0266C </F> <F P=104>  Karachi JANG </F> <F P=105>  Urdu </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Altaf Hasan Qureshi: "Announcement About Secret </F> Talks"]    [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott visited  India and Pakistan and after going through his long agenda has  left glorious hopes of establishing peace and stability not only  in South Asia but in the whole world. He told news reporters  that he considered his visit to be extremely successful and gave  the good news to Secretary of State Christopher on the phone  that Pakistan has promised to consider even those proposals that  are not fully acceptable to it. The most important development  is that the United States and Pakistan have announced that they  will follow "silent diplomacy" in the future. Perhaps that is  the reason why the Pakistani foreign minister had refused to  answer reporters' questions and Mr. Talbott used mostly prepared  diplomatic statements.    The United States is looking for markets and places to build  military bases to protect its interests in southern, central,  and western Asia because of the geographical, military, and  economic importance of these regions. Its main goals is to stop  China's progress and to create a powerful bloc to counter it. It  considers India as the most appropriate partner in this game.  The United States is tolerating its whims and coquetry and  appears to be willing to bear its aggressive diplomacy also. The  Indian leadership adopted a contemptuous attitude towards Mr.  Talbott. The prime minister did not give him an appointment and  the foreign minister also kept his distance. The farewell press  conference was also cancelled at the last minute. This was in  response to the U.S. deputy secretary's flattery, praise, and  commendations that he had lavished on India while ignoring all  the facts. He said that India's leadership in this region and  outside of it is well established, and its leadership is strong  like that of Germany and Japan. Despite this humble sycophancy,  India refused to discuss its missile and nuclear program and  scornfully rejected the idea of a multi-national conference. Mr.  Talbott returned after losing face.    A whole new world was waiting to meet him when he arrived  here. Our Foreign Secretary Najamuldin Sheikh welcomed him. The  photograph of the welcome ceremony that was published in The  DAWN relates a strange story. Mr. Talbott was looking into Mr.  Sheikh's eyes as if a hunter was ready to snare its prey.  Pakistan did its duty as a host more than necessary. The  president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and other  high-ranking officials hovered around him as if he were an  emperor and a red carpet was rolled out for him. General Abdul  Waheed, our commander in chief, had already established a frank  tone about our nuclear program in Washington. The opposition  leaders interpreted our nation's wishes the same way and said  that we will not roll back the nuclear program and change our  position on Kashmir. Benazir also repeated the issue of our  national security clearly. Thus the whole nation was speaking  with one voice. The U.S. deputy secretary could not be  successful in his goals in the presence of such strong feelings  among the people. Thus, a joint announcement to follow "silent  diplomacy" was made.    The joint communique issued at the time of Mr. Talbott's  departure has some aspects that cause major concerns. However,  the people here are mostly concerned about the "silent  diplomacy." The meaning of this term is to conduct secret deals.  Benazir had decided to cap the nuclear program in 1989 without  taking the nation into confidence using this "silent diplomacy."  Information about it was first given by the caretaker Prime  Minister Moeen Qureshi four years later and Benazir had admitted  to it a few months later. This means that the United States can  prepare Pakistan for opening up its nuclear installations for  inspection through some secret agreement. All kind of attractive  suggestions are being made about this "inspection." One is to  let them take some photographs from a satellite and the U.S.  President will use these photographs to issue a certificate to  the U.S. Congress assuring it that Pakistan does not have  nuclear capability. Later, F-16s will also be delivered and  economic and military aid will be reinstated. All kind of  deceptions will be used at every step. They will say, this one  point is a little vague and it needs to be looked at. This will  start a never-ending series [of negotiations] and we will meet  the same fate as Iraq did.    Whenever the United States has used the pressure of secret  negotiations in Muslim regions, it has hurt Muslim interests. In  the PLO-Israel secret negotiations, it sold the freedom of  Palestinian people very cheaply. Before this, the Camp David  Agreement, which also was signed after secret negotiations, was  used to sell the national pride and ambitions of the Egyptians.  A great nation was forced to bow down to Israel and became a  slave to the U.S. interests. This "silent diplomacy" of the  United States had prompted Saddam Hussein to suddenly invade  Kuwait.    The question is: If Pakistan's stand on nuclear program and  Kashmir is exactly according to international principles and it  has a strong logic behind it, then what is the meaning of  holding talks behind thousands of screens? This means only one  thing: A powerful superpower wants to quietly dominate Pakistan  so that no one is aware of it. The foundation of this great  tragedy has been laid in the joint communique. This high-handed  and quiet diplomacy can be countered only by the power of the  people. The United States have always been defeated by the  unbreakable determination of the people as in Vietnam and  Somalia. The Pakistani people have only one alternative to  fulfill their goal. They should call a joint session of the  Parliament and provide a framework to this fundamental issue.  The government should not have the permission to get out of this  framework. A powerful committee composed of senior Parliament  Members, well-known retired generals, diplomats, experienced  journalists, and observers should be established. This committee  will monitor all negotiations and keep the nation informed. How  can we accept secret negotiations when our lives are involved?  The United States, instead of following principles and  practicing fairness, is seeing its interests as requirements for  world peace. Our governments did not feel any hesitancy in  compromising our national pride just to prolong their  terms.</p>

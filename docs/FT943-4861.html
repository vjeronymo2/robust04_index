			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Output of N Sea oil down 4.9% in month A change in the timing of North Sea maintenance work led to a monthly drop in oil and gas output in July which slightly depressed the overall production figures. The Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the output of the oil and gas sector fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.9 per cent between June and July. The production of the offshore oil sector alone fell by 4.9 per cent in this period. The fall came after several months of strong growth, resulting in a record level of North Sea output in June. Measured on a three-monthly basis - a figure regarded as a better guide to the trend - North Sea output rose 4.4 per cent in the three months to July compared with the previous three months, and was 30.1 per cent higher than the same period a year before. The main reason for the monthly fall, the CSO said, was North Sea maintenance work, which was carried out in July this year. In recent years most maintenance has been carried out in June, which has been correspondingly factored in the CSO's system of seasonal adjustment. However, recent changes in the petroleum revenue tax regime have reduced the incentive for oil companies to carry out their maintenance in June. The CSO said yesterday that it was seeking to adjust its seasonal adjustment series accordingly. However some analysts suggested that the timing problems may have exaggerated the rise in the production in June and suppressed it in July. Elsewhere, the drop in North Sea production in July was offset by a strong performance from the manufacturing sector. Within this sector the output of factories producing investment goods and intermediate goods - a category which provides the raw materials and fuel for industry - continued to perform better than consumer goods industries, suggesting that the recovery is becoming more broadly based. Measured on a three-monthly basis, the chemicals and basic metals sector each showed a healthy growth of 1.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively in the three months to July compared with the previous three months. The engineering sector grew slightly more slowly, with a 0.7 per cent rise in production in the three months to July compared with the previous three months. However, there were sharp discrepancies in this area, the CSO noted, with the IT and telecommunications areas continuing to outstrip other areas. The performance of the textile sector was also slightly slower in spite of a rise in the output of men's shirts and underwear, the CSO said. The textile sector grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months to July compared with the previous three months. The explosion at Texaco's Milford Haven refinery in July created a noticeable dent in the UK manufacturing data, and is expected to have an even larger impact on the following month's figures, the CSO said yesterday. Production at the refinery temporarily ceased after a lightning strike caused a 36-hour blaze. The loss of output from the plant resulted in a 7.4 per cent drop in production in the coke, petrol-refining and nuclear fuels sector between June and July. Although this sector is only a small part of overall output, the scale of the drop reduced the manufacturing index by 2 percentage points in July compared with June and the overall index of production by 1.7 percentage points. Partial production is expected to reopen this month. Nevertheless, the CSO warned that the explosion is also likely to affect August's data.</p>

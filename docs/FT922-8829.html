			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Row over US veto may delay Russia's IFC deal A ROW over the US's voting power in the International Finance Corp (IFC), the World Bank affiliate charged with promoting private sector investment in developing countries, threatens to delay further membership of the organisation by Russia and the other former Soviet republics. IFC board members have agreed in principle to approve the membership of the republics. They have also resolved an earlier problem by agreeing to recommend to their governments a selective capital increase to be subscribed to by the republics. But a meeting to conclude the membership package broke up abruptly last week over a proposal to change the IFC's rules to preserve the US's de facto veto over certain decisions. Some senior officials now worry that the wrangling could lead to damaging delays in the Washington-based organisation's efforts to start work in Russia and the other republics. The new shares to be issued to the republics would dilute the US's stake in the IFC below its current 24.08 per cent level, although the exact dilution will depend on whether Switzerland votes to join the corporation, along with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in a referendum on May 17. The US stake is in practice enough to block decisions such as capital increases, which require approval from members holding 75 per cent of the voting shares, or changes to the corporation's articles, which need 80 per cent approval. Most member countries appear ready to agree to preserve the US veto by increasing the number of votes required - probably to 80 per cent for capital increases and 85 per cent for changes to the articles. There seems little enthusiasm for the rule change, but it is seen as the price of winning speedy US acceptance of the Russian membership package. France and some Nordic countries, however, have criticised the proposal, both on the principle of preserving a US veto and on the grounds that the rule change would require parliamentary approval from many IFC member countries. This could delay still further the entry of the republics. One suggestion for bringing Russia and its fellow republics quickly into the IFC fold is for each republic to take only a single, symbolic share, until wrangling over the details of the capital increase has been concluded. This idea is supported by Russia and its sponsor in the IFC, the UK, as well as Ukraine. But it has angered many smaller IFC member countries, which have had to pay for their stakes in the corporation, but have yet to receive any IFC financing.

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAPITALS MAKE QUICK WORK OF PENGUINS, 8-0  </P> <P> In less than 7 minutes, the Washington Capitals put 7 games of frustration  against the Pittsburgh Penguins behind them.  </P> <P> The Capitals scored 5 goals, including 2 by Bengt Gustafsson, in a 6:56 span of  the second period and snapped a 7-game losing streak against Pittsburgh with an  8-0 victory Monday at Landover, Md.  </P> <P> "It's a good sign for us," said Geoff Courtnall of Washington's first victory  over the Penguins since Jan. 1, 1988. "It's a big win. We need to play this way  every time. To dominate like that was surprising. But it's just one game."  </P> <P> Dave Christian also had 2 goals for the Capitals, who held Mario Lemieux  scoreless for the first time in his last 15 games. Goalie Pete Peeters handed  Pittsburgh its first shutout of the season.  </P> <P> The Penguins had scored at least 2 goals in their previous 37 games.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh, with defensemen Paul Coffey and Zarley Zalapski injured and forward  Bob Errey out with the flu, was outshot, 45-14.  </P> <P> Lemieux, the league's leading scorer who had 32 points in his previous 9 games,  including 8 Saturday against New Jersey, had only 1 shot on goal.  </P> <P> "They (the Capitals) were at the top of their game, and we were at the bottom  of ours," Pittsburgh Coach Gene Ubriaco said. "They didn't give us a chance to  get unwound. (We) have to play better than (we) played."  </P> <P> The loss was the worst of the season for the Patrick Division leaders.  Pittsburgh had lost only once in 10 previous games and was 4-1-2 in its  previous 7 road games.  </P> <P> Capital Coach Bryan Murray said he saw it coming, predicting in a team meeting  that the team would get plenty of shots.  </P> <P> "It's one game in our building," he said. "I thought, watching the last few  games we had played, there would be some opportunity to shoot the puck. It was  a matter of taking advantage of our opportunities."  </P> <P> Washington extended its home unbeaten streak to 8 games, 6 of them victories,  and its 8 goals equaled a season high.  </P> <P> Edmonton 3, Minnesota 2 -- Esa Tikkanen's 24th goal of the season, 3:10 into  overtime, lifted the Oilers to a victory over the North Stars at Bloomington,  Minn.  </P> <P> Minnesota's Stewart Gavin tied the game, 2-2, with 4:34 left in the third  period on a feed from Bob Rouse after Charlie Huddy's power-play goal with 6:57  left gave the Oilers a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> The North Stars scored first on Neal Broten's goal 49 seconds into the second  period, and the Oilers got even on Jimmy Carson's 31st goal at 1:56 of the  third period.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 5, Hartford 4 -- David Shaw scored a pair of power-play goals,  including the go-ahead goal early in the third period, and the Rangers turned  back the Whalers at New York.  </P> <P> Former Whaler Carey Wilson, acquired in a 4-player trade just a week ago,  scored the tying goal for the Rangers before Shaw put them ahead, 4-3, with a  shot from the point at 7:28. Rookie Tony Granato clinched the victory on a  breakaway goal at 18:41.  </P> <P> The Rangers, who are 4-0-1 in their last 5 games, moved to within 2 points of  Pittsburgh in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> Boston 8, St. Louis 7 -- Rookie center Craig Janney, returning after missing 8  games with a groin injury, set up 4 goals to lead the Bruins past the Blues at  Boston.  </P> <P> Janney's 3 assists helped Boston to a 7-3 lead after three periods, and after  St. Louis rallied with 3 straight goals in the final period, Janney set up Bob  Joyce's goal that proved to be the game-winner.  </P> <P> The Bruins, who beat New Jersey, 6-2, on Thursday, won consecutive games for  the first time since late November.  </P></p>

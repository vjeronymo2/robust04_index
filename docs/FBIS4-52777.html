			<p>CSO     A number of domestic factors have slowed the growth rate of  Indonesian exports. Business circles warned the government of  this far in advance, but the classic problems that have emerged  in the form of a high-cost economy have not been corrected. The  problems appear in various forms, including illegal fees and  lack of transparency in government policies, such as in the  setting of quotas on textiles and textile products.    These were the views of people in Jakarta whom KOMPAS  contacted Monday, 7 March, to get reaction to the slow growth of  Indonesian non-oil-and-gas exports, primarily textiles and  textile products. Those contacted were Indonesian Textiles  Association (API) Secretary-General Benny Soetrisno and API  General Chairman Chamroel Djafri.    H. Mohamad "Bob" Hasan, general chairman of the Indonesian  Forestry Community (MPI), who was interviewed Monday after a  gathering for breaking the fast, also acknowledged a recent  sluggishness on international markets. "I do not think we can  avoid what is happening internationally. We cannot do very much  now, because other countries are having problems," Bob Hasan  explained.    Benny, who said he is "horrified" to see the declining  competitiveness of Indonesian textiles and textile products on  global markets, declared that all API directors have submitted  to the authorities their analyses of the textile industry's  future. Textiles are one of the four top exports.    During the term of the Fifth Development Cabinet, API  representatives called on Minister of Industry Hartarto; Junior  Minister of Industry Tunky Ariwibowo; Minister of Trade Arifin  Siregar; Junior Minister of Trade Soedradjad Djiwandono; Bank  Indonesia Governor Adrianus Mooy; Minister of Finance J.B.  Sumarlin; Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance,  Industry, and Development Control Radius Prawiro; and Minister  of State and State Secretary Murdiono.    "Those reports apparently did not get enough follow-up to  reassure members of the textile industry. They hoped at least  for measures to reduce loan interest rates more quickly, and  improve the investment climate. The macro economy does not  present a good picture, either. Meanwhile, foreign markets are  more `furious' in their competition, because they are supported  by various monetary factors and a much better climate," Benny  said.  <H5>  Explain Again </H5>   In view of this still disadvantageous situation, API  directors feel it is necessary to discuss further the problem  with officials in the Sixth Development Cabinet. Their  scientific explanations as well as concrete examples will at  least illustrate how concerned industrialists are, which will  also have an impact on national interests.    On that basis, then, the API submitted requests for direct  dialogues with Coordinating Minister of Industry and Trade  Hartarto; Coordinating Minister for Economics, Finance, and  Development Control Saleh Afiff; Minister of Industry Tunky  Ariwibowo; Minister of Trade S.B. Joedono; Minister of Finance  Mar'ie Muhammad; Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono;  Minister of State and State Secretary Murdiono; and SESDALOPBANG  [expansion not given] Tjuk Setyohadi.    Complete information has been presented to the officials,  but  it is not yet known what steps are to be taken to resolve the  problem. Moreover, there was recent word that at a meeting on  economics, finance, industry, trade and development control, the  government acknowledged that exports of Indonesian manufactures  have declined, rising only by 8.41 percent in 1993. From 1988 to  1992, however, national exports rose by an average of 15.8  percent.    "It is clear that we have made maximal efforts to defeat  market competition. Competition is keen, however, primarily from  new countries such as Vietnam, the PRC, and Turkey, which have  unbeatable quality. They can sell at low prices, however,  because their products are efficient. As for us, how can we be  efficient? From production to export, there are many outside  costs that have to be paid," Benny said.  <H5>  Ins and Outs of High Costs </H5>   The API secretary-general tried to describe frankly the ins  and outs of the problem. Indonesia's competitors can sell at  competitive prices because they are not excessively burdened by  a high-cost economy.    For the national textile industry, however, there is a  series  of fees that must be paid--from getting permits for imported  materials, importing them, processing them, to reexporting them.  These include unofficial fees paid along the roads, which are  quite large when all are totaled.    Receipts cannot be requested for any of these fees, because  none of the high-cost economy in field operations is found in  regulations. Automatically, then, no proof can be given of  having paid such fees.    As a result, these various fees automatically go into  computation of the production component without their being  recorded in books for auditing by accountants, although the  value of illegal fees are usually much larger than official  ones--15 to 20 percent of production costs.    This increased expense is naturally incorporated into  calculations of profit or other revenues, and the result is that  they are taxable. From this aspect alone, it means that  companies are hit twice. First, they are bashed by costs in the  field, and, second, they have to pay taxes.    "With conditions like this, how can we compete? From every  side, we are not competitive, although maximum efficiency goes  into the commodities," the industrialist said.  <H5>  Unfair Monetary Climate </H5>   Another thing that must be borne by industry, said Benny, is  the upside-down thinking on strengthening the financial  structure. In the monetary sector, an annual interest of 18 to  19 percent is imposed on working capital, whereas credit for  housing incurs only 16 percent.    Moreover, credit for housing does not consider whether the  credit is for luxury housing, where one person may own more than  one house, or for simple housing. Besides, that sector generally  spurs more inflation than the demands of working capital.    The blows do not end with the interest rate problem alone.  Tax restitution for exports is not paid for months and  represents dormant money that cannot be used. "Theoretically,  according to regulations, restitution should be paid no later  than one month after exporters complete all administrative  procedures, but in reality the quickest time is six months," he  said.    To resolve the restitution arrears, the director general for  taxes finally sent instructions to all regional tax offices in  the provinces to convert restitution into bank guaranties.  Nevertheless, in practice the implementation of the regulation  is yet at a standstill. "Is it because commissions are too  small, or are the exporters not prepared to complete all  administrative matters?"    "Our question is, has the problem been touched by the  deregulation measures the government has issued? If it has, why  have conditions not changed? It not, why is the situation not  corrected immediately? Thus, whatever the case may be, the basic  issue in this decline is whether the bureaucrats seriously care  about realities faced by members of industry. I think that is  the key to being able to go through the 'needle's eye' in this  export market struggle," Benny declared.    If there are indeed to be no changes, all parties must be  willing to watch the decline of this "prima donna" of  contributors to foreign exchange. This can be seen in the fact  that the TPT [textiles and textile products] continue to grow in  volume from year to year, while the value per kilogram declined  in 1993.    "That is a fact. What is to be done now is up to the  government. As far as efficiency is concerned, we have been  working on that from the beginning. Whether conditions change or  not, in principle we as industrialists will continue trying to  ensure that 'our bowl of rice' is not broken or smashed," he  said.  <H5>  Quota Distribution System </H5>   Chamroel Djafri said that besides the external factors there  are domestic factors that hinder TPT exports. They include, he  said, high interest rates that burden exporters and export  procedures that still do not move as smoothly as industrialists  hope.    In addition, he said, the present system for distributing  quotas does not support steady increases in textile exports. He  gave an example in which an industrialist obtained a TPT export  quota for 10 categories, whereas that industrialist did not  produce as many as 10 categories.    He said, too, that besides the fact that the quota  distribution system does not meet its targets, the system  remains closed, despite the commotion that has long existed.  Under the closed system, he said, an industrialist who is able  to make exports cannot do so because he has no quota. Meanwhile,  industrialists who receive quotas cannot fulfill their quotas.  "Therefore, the quota distribution system should be reviewed and  conducted transparently," he said.  <H5>  Through the Association </H5>   In connection with eliminating inefficiency, Bob Hasan said  that such improvement can be done only through association  upgrading. The point is, the association understands its members  and the problems they face.    Citing the case of plywood, Bob Hasan, who is also general  chairman of the Indonesian Wood Panel Association (APKINDO),  said that APKINDO members practically do not have a quota  problem any longer. A joint promotion team, in cooperation with  a price stabilization team, decides the distribution of quotas  for each member.    The joint promotion team itself is formed on the basis of  the  export goals of each member. The company with the most exports  to a specific country automatically becomes team chairman, while  the position of deputy chairman is filled by the company with  the second most exports to that country.    The joint promotion team then gets data on the capacities of  each member. "Quotas for the members are decided based on that  data. The results are then submitted to the Department of Trade,  which is the authority for distributing quotas to APKINDO  members," Bob Hasan explained.    According to the APKINDO general chairman, there has been  practically no dissatisfaction or deviation with regard to quota  distribution. "As general chairman, practically all I have to do  is wait for reports. I intervene only if there is disagreement.  In APKINDO, small companies do not have to be oppressed, for  they get the first opportunity when there are additional  quotas," Bob Hasan declared.</p>

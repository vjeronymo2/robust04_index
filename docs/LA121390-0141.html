			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> $1.6 MILLION MORE OKD TO REPAIR TRASH INCINERATOR  </P> <P> The Long Beach City Council has authorized another $1.6 million in repairs for  the city's trash-to-energy incinerator.  </P> <P> Several months ago, the council approved a $10-million loan to help repair the  plant, which has been dogged with problems since it opened in September, 1988.  </P> <P> The Southeast Resource Recovery Facility on Terminal Island burns 1,380 tons of  garbage a day from Long Beach, Lakewood and Signal Hill. Equipment malfunctions  have led to unsafe emissions of toxins from its smokestacks, however. They are  among a list of 88 problems that have kept the incinerator -- one of only two  in the county -- from being fully licensed by the South Coast Air Quality  Management District.  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Leading Article: Procter and guess what The financial news has acquired a distinctly gamey flavour of late. The Granite group of hedge funds disappears with Dollars 600m of investors' money; a top bond trader at US investment bank Kidder Peabody turns out to have invented Dollars 350m of phantom profits to swell his profit-related bonus; Bankers Trust sees its trading income collapse from Dollars 449m in the final quarter of 1993 to a mere Dollars 14m in the first quarter of this year and is under attack from Procter &amp; Gamble over advice on derivatives. Is this par for the course, nowadays, in high finance and banking? Or is something novel afoot? Whatever the details of the particular stories, the principles involved are not notably new. Granite owed its problems to a combination of excessive borrowing and poor financial control over complex investment strategies. Kidder Peabody has simply been the victim of old-fashioned fraud. As for Bankers Trust, it is one of many banks where trading profits have been hit by the fall in global bond markets. From the point of view of banking supervision, the accelerating rate of financial innovation may pose problems, but the nature of the risk involved is entirely familiar. In the main, new instruments like derivatives are designed to isolate or combine existing risks. In most cases that means market risk, credit risk or something akin to the risk in insurance underwriting. If there is a novel aspect in recent events, it may lie more in a change in the structure of the banking industry itself. Potential conflicts Over the past decade or so the proprietary trading activities of wholesale commercial and investment banks have come to account for a disproportionate amount of their activity and profit. After a realistic allocation of costs and provisions, it is in some cases a bigger contributor to profits than net interest income. Financial intermediation - the task of taking deposits and lending - has become less profitable and has been shrinking in importance. Part of the dealing is conducted on behalf of clients, though some consists of low-risk arbitrage. Yet while bankers tend to talk of their trading activity as though it is largely to do with servicing their clients, it appears increasingly to be about looking after themselves. The first-quarter reports of the US money centre banks have demonstrated the importance of proprietary trading. In effect, banks are becoming less like banks and more like marketmakers. As a result, their income must be declining vastly in quality. One implication is that banks are involved in potential conflicts of interest on a much greater scale than their clients have been used to. The extent of the conflict has probably not always been fully appreciated by the customers where, as in derivatives, the subject of the banks' advice is highly complex. And the conflict can be heightened where company financial executives are no match for much higher-paid, Harvard-educated whizz-kids from the investment banking fraternity. Better solution In wholesale markets, caveat emptor provides a better solution to the clients' problem than regulation. With derivatives, as with all financial innovation, there is a learning curve. The bank supervisors' problem may be another matter. For while the risks in derivatives may fall into familiar categories, the language and techniques do not. The old men who run the world's biggest banks do not understand vega and theta, kurtosis parameters and volatility smiles. Auditors cannot understand risk in over-the-counter instruments without a degree of co-operation from traders that flies in the face of the conventional arm's-length relationship with the audit client. The strength of the intermediate balance sheets in global markets that connect large numbers of parties to a given trade may not be known. There may well be systemic shocks. And the growth of trading activity tends to strengthen the case for dividing the banking system into a low-risk, low-return sector covered by deposit insurance and an uninsured higher risk sector for those who wish to deposit money with banks that have acquired a penchant for gambling. Taxpayers should not be forced to underwrite the high rollers of the banking system.</p>

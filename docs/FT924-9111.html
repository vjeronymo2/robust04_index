			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / New Portuguese foreign minister The Lisbon government has named Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, former secretary of state for foreign affairs and co-operation, as the country's new foreign minister. He replaces Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, who will be appointed a European Commissioner, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. Mr Durao Barroso, 36, has made a rapid ascendancy through the hierarchy of the centre-right Social Democratic government over the past seven years, distinguishing himself in 1991 as the chief architect of a peace settlement in Angola. A lawyer who belonged to an extreme-left Maoist party during his student days, his priority as foreign minister will be to join other international leaders in trying to bring Angola back from the brink of civil war. Portugal's existing EC Commissioner, Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, who has responsibility for energy and other portfolios, is being withdrawn to run the universal exhibition, Expo 98, in Lisbon.</p>

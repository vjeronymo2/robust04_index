			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL TAKES 1ST STEP TOWARD A BAN ON SEMIAUTOMATIC GUNS  </P> <P> Amid a rash of killings involving the AK-47 assault rifle, the Los Angeles City  Council on Tuesday moved to ban the sale and possession of military-style  semiautomatic weapons within the city.  </P> <P> The unanimous action gave the city attorney one week to draft a law. But even  its main sponsor, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, conceded that the ordinance may  be vulnerable to legal attack. Yaroslavsky added, however, that even if  unenforceable, the city ban will offer a symbolic boost to state efforts to  outlaw the high-powered rifles.  </P> <P> At the urging of Councilman Nate Holden, the council also called on President  Bush to order a ban on importing assault weapons and urged local gun dealers to  agree to stop selling such rifles as the AK-47, Uzi and AR-15.  </P> <P> In recent days, Holden and a Los Angeles radio station have offered up to $300  for each rifle turned over to police. So far, 68 have been collected, police  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tuesday's council votes came on the heels of several recent shootings in which  assault rifles were involved. The most prominent incident was a Jan. 17 tragedy  in which five Stockton schoolchildren were slain by an AK-47-toting gunman,  Patrick Edward Purdy, who later fatally shot himself. Twenty-nine other  students and a teacher were wounded in the hail of bullets.  </P> <P> An Uzi-toting man was shot to death Tuesday in Long Beach in what police  believe was a drug transaction. An armed man shot the unidentified 25-year-old  victim in the 6300 block of Long Beach Boulevard, police said. The victim  attempted to raise his Uzi to firing position but was unable to when the weapon  became entangled in his clothes, police said.  </P> <P> The City Council acted a day after two local lawmakers, state Sen. David A.  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), proposed  making it a felony to sell, manufacture, import or possess semiautomatic  weapons such as the AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi. Assemblyman Johan Klehs,  (D-San Leandro), meanwhile, proposed boosting the two-year minimum prison  sentence to life behind bars for a person convicted of assaulting anyone with a  military-style rifle.  </P> <P> Although the statewide anti-weapons measures have received initial support,  they are expected to face strong opposition from pro-gun advocates.  </P> <P> Referring to the likely legislative battle in Sacramento, Yaroslavsky said a  city ordinance could serve as a stopgap measure until the state acts. He said a  state law would be preferable because a local ban could not stop a Los Angeles  resident from buying a rifle in a nearby city.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky predicted that a local ban on such weapons might face legal  hurdles, however. While confident that a ban on sales of semiautomatic weapons  would fare well in the courts, he said an outright prohibition on possession of  such guns may be vulnerable to a legal challenge. That is because state law  would preempt any local ordinance on possession, he said.  </P> <P> "If we approve such an ordinance locally, let someone sue us," Yaroslavsky  said. "Let someone sue and say that the city of Los Angeles does not have the  right to protect the public health and welfare of its citizens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> He'll Take the Chance  </P> <P> "Let the (U.S.) Supreme Court say to the second largest city in the United  States that it does not have the right to ban the sale of weapons of war to its  citizens," Yaroslavsky added. "I'm willing to take my chances."  </P> <P> Kent DeChambeau, a Sacramento-based lobbyist for the 40,000-member California  Rifle and Pistol Assn., said that any Los Angeles ordinance banning possession  of semiautomatic weapons would be invalid on its face. He added, however, that  it is not clear whether the city can outlaw the sale of such assault rifles.  </P> <P> DeChambeau branded as "headline grabbing" the Los Angeles City Council action  and said the real battle should be conducted in the state capital, rather than  in individual cities. Compton has also moved to ban the sale of semiautomatic  weapons. DeChambeau added that the pro-gun group -- the California arm of the  300,000-member National Rifle Assn. -- has not decided whether it will actively  oppose the city's effort.  </P> <P> The prospect of a local weapons ban has already attracted opposition.  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson, a conservative Republican who until now has balked at  most gun-control moves, said he has received letters threatening political  retaliation if he supports a ban on semiautomatic weapons. Bernson said Tuesday  that he nevertheless will vote to outlaw military-style rifles such as the  AK-47.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Time to 'Speak Out'  </P> <P> "As one who has always supported the right of gun owners within reason, I feel  the time has come to speak out," Bernson said.  </P> <P> He said the assault rifles "go way beyond" the type of weaponry favored by  sportsmen.  </P> <P> Generally, a semiautomatic weapon is one that fires a round for each squeeze of  the trigger. Automatic weapons, which fire continuously with one pull of the  trigger, are already illegal.  </P> <P> Assistant Police Chief David Dotson told reporters that when Chief Daryl F.  Gates recently began speaking out against the sale and manufacture of  military-style semiautomatic rifles, there also was some strong public  reaction.  </P> <P> "Some of them blistered the phone lines pretty good," Dotson said.  </P></p>

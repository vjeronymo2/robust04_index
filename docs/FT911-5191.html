			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Technology: Inmos chip increases its range TWO YEARS ago, Inmos, a gifted British semiconductor company not much appreciated in its own country, was acquired by SGS-Thomson, which is ultimately owned by the French and Italian governments. Pasquale Pistorio, SGS-Thomson's president, visited Inmos's Bristol headquarters shortly after the acquisition and asked its executives: 'What would you like to do?' Yesterday, in London, Inmos unveiled one of the answers to that question: the T9000 transputer, an advanced version of the 'computer on a chip' for which it is best known. Earlier versions of the transputer could communicate with four other transputers, allowing different electronic operations to be carried out at the same time rather than having to be processed consecutively. A programmer could arrange for the older transputers to communicate with more than four other devices. Users of the T9000 do not need to make this adjustment. Paul Strzelecki, Inmos's marketing director, says that although the new transputer still has four communications channels, there is no limit to the number of other transputers or electronic devices with which it can work. The new product, which previously went under the code name H1, will be commercially available at the end of this year. Inmos would not reveal the price of the T9000, but it is initially likely to be sold for about Dollars 400. The company is expected to reduce the price as sales take off. Strzelecki said he expects the new transputer to be used by telecommunications manufacturers. It can also be used in products like laser printers and colour facsimile machines. Inmos yesterday produced colour photographs transmitted by a Sharp colour fax machine using the older T400 transputer. The high-resolution pictures were transmitted along ordinary phone lines, a process which took six minutes. The advanced T9000 will be able to transmit the pictures by fax in less than half a minute, Strzelecki said.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Domestic dollar bond issue in China A CHINESE trading corp-oration and China's leading underwriter are to launch China's first US dollar domestic bond issue since the 1949 revolution. The National Metallurgical Import and Export Corporation is offering Dollars 40m in bonds with one and two-year maturities at interest rates of 4.1 per cent and 4.6 per cent. The government-backed underwriter, China Securities Co, will help distribute the issue. Bonds will be tradeable through China's newly-established national electronic trading system. Mr Bai Baohua, general manager of NMIEC, said the funds would be used for raw materials imports and advanced technology for iron and steel enterprises. China is upgrading its iron and steel sector and aims to be producing 100m tonnes of steel by the year 2000, against the present 80m tonnes. Chinese organisations are also anxious to tap local foreign currency deposits. Chinese residents have salted away some Dollars 10bn in foreign currencies. China, meanwhile, has been struggling to sell yuan-denominated treasury bills, and has been obliged to extend the period for their sale at least twice. At the end of May only 28 per cent of a yuan 30bn (Dollars 7.7bn) issue had been sold. Provincial governments have been urged to re-double efforts to sell treasury bills. Institutional and private interest in the paper has slumped, partly because interest rates have fallen below inflation.</p>

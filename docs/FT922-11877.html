			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Fairfax adds detail to prospectus JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group, yesterday issued a supplementary prospectus for the flotation of 25 per cent of its shares in response to a claim for damages of ADollars 175m (USDollars 134m) from Independent Newspapers (INP), the Irish group controlled by Mr Tony O'Reilly. Mr Neville Miles, the Sydney stockbroker who is advising Fairfax on the flotation, said the board considered it would be 'prudent' to ensure investors were fully aware of INP's action. INP lost a bidding battle for Fairfax in December, when the group was acquired by a consortium led by the Daily Telegraph, the UK newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black. Fairfax says the action launched by INP is without foundation, and claims it is intended to disrupt the flotation, under which 173.25m shares are being offered for sale at ADollars 1.20, capitalising the group at about ADollars 830m. The supplementary prospectus says the extent of the damages claimed by INP had not been quantified when the prospectus for the flotation was issued last month. INP's solicitors now estimate the claim at ADollars 175m on the basis that ADollars 1.30 per share would constitute fair value for Fairfax shares. The flotation is the last stage in the Fairfax group's recovery from a 1988 buy-out of the former family shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax, then 28. The group was placed in receivership by its banks in 1990. The prospectus forecasts net profit of ADollars 57m for the year to June 1993, on revenue of ADollars 782m. Pre-tax profit is forecast to be ADollars 123m in the current year, and ADollars 165m in 1992-1993. Fairfax publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age in Melbourne, the Australian Financial Review and a number of other magazines and regional newspapers. It is the main competitor to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Australia's largest newspaper publishing group.</p>

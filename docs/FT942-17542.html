			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Buyer for M&amp;S - Directors' transactions As expected, the fall in the market has made it more attractive, and the number of buys by directors recorded over the week is higher that it has been for a while. Marks and Spencer is such a high quality stock that it forms a part of every portfolio. But the directors of M&amp;S most frequently appear on our listing when they exercise options and sell the consequent ordinaries. It is, therefore, interesting to note one director, Donald Trangmar, make such a sizeable purchase - 145,000 shares at 415p. The sale in Denman Electrical was made by Arnold Denman, its chairman and chief executive. While he raised some Pounds 460,000 with the deal, the transaction represents a very small proportion of his total holding of more than 2.2m shares. The sale in Osprey Communications also leaves that director with the body of his holding intact, with almost 2m shares. On March 19, we said that a director of Castings plc had sold 8,000 shares worth a total of Pounds 20,000. This was incorrect: the director exercised options over 8,000 shares but sold only 2,000.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                       Sector      Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Armitage Brothers                          8,500       18           1 Ashtead                       BCon        78,034      316           1* Camellia                      OthF           500       12           1 Clondalkin Group              PP&amp;P        10,000       33           1 Denman's Electrical           Dist        80,000      460           1 Eldridge Pope &amp; Co.

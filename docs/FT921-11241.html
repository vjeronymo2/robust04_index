			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Sport: Playing by the numbers - Soccer NEIL LANHAM does not look like Dr Frankenstein. He is short, with tidy grey hair and a clipped moustache. He dresses conservatively, and looks like a country auctioneer up in town on business - which is precisely what he is. His other business, as it is every Saturday afternoon, is 'soccer performance analyst' for Cambridge United. Only the glint in his eye when he talks about football suggests he has a mission. Like the fictional Dr Frankenstein he has tried to shine the light of science and reason into a world of tradition and superstition. And like the poor doctor, his reward is to see the teams he has helped build reviled as monstrosities. Critics of his methods say they destroy the artistry of soccer. Lanham qualified as a chartered surveyor 'which is all about measurement.' He now works as an auctioneer in Suffolk and lives in a village that was also home to Wing Commander Charles Reep, who brought a statists to soccer and advised Stan Cullis, manager of the successful Wolverhampton Wanderers side of the 1950s. Lanham caught the bug from Reep; he still has all the Wing Commander's statistics, and has built on the work. Reep believed that 'soccer is dominated by chance' - which does not mean that games are random. It means that every pass, shot, or tackle has an unpredictable result. A team can shoot 20 times in one game and not score, and shoot twice the next week and score both times. However, over the season, the ratio of shots to goals will be fairly constant. There are, says Lanham, 'patterns that occur and occur again. They apply to all teams, at all times.' One of his many mottoes is that 'figures do not cease to exist because they are not counted'. However, most teams do not count them, which means they will be at a disadvantage to those who do. That is where Lanham comes in. He watches games with pencil and paper in hand. He has, he says, 400 statistical categories to measure the game, but is reluctant to discuss most of them in case the competition works out what Cambridge are doing. Lanham started by watching soccer matches on his own. Then he wrote to clubs offering his analysis. Many did not reply, but Dave Basset, then manager of Wimbledon, phoned at once. In Lanham's spell at Wimbledon the team won promotion twice. He worked with Bassett again at Sheffield United, and won promotion twice. Under Steve Coppell, he helped Crystal Palace to win promotion, again twice. Finally, he joined John Beck at Cambridge. The club has since climbed from the fourth division to the upper reaches of the second and is challenging for a place in the Premier League. Coppell, Bassett and Beck are hardly Lanham's puppets. They built teams from richer club's unwanted parts, from rough diamonds and hard nuts dug up from non-league clubs. All coached teams fit enough, smart enough and committed enough to stick to a plan; a plan drawn, unmistakeably, to Lanham's blueprint. Those figures that Lanham is prepared to discuss reveal an overall view of how teams win games. He says figures show that most goals are scored from moves involving three passes or fewer - although, strangely, he includes goals from penalties, as 'no pass' goals - there is little point in trying to pass more often. The more often you pass, the more chance of an interception. This leads to a second theory: that it takes on average 182 possessions to score a goal. Lanham says this is a 'near constant figure' for all four divisions of the English league and the World Cup. His next point is a surprise: teams which manage to score on fewer possessions also concede goals less frequently, so the average in their games stays roughly the same. 'We attack to win and we attack to win the ball back,' says Lanham. 'Two thirds of goals come from possessions won in the final third of the field.' Teams which press in the last third of the field all the time are more likely to benefit from opponents' errors and less likely to suffer from their own. The cardinal soccer sin, says Lanham, is being tackled in possession. This often leads to goals because a team is caught shifting into attacking positions. That is why Lanham is not keen on players 'self-indulgently expressing themselves at the expense of team.' The products of his theories are teams which move the ball directly and quickly into the opposing half at the first opportunity: a tactic known disparagingly as 'route one'. Teams which has tenacious rather than skilful midfield players and, above all, teams which plays as a team. Lanham insists that it is entertaining. 'We take great risks to keep the ball with our attackers at all times. We believe that that is exciting football.' It is often exciting but rarely pretty. - But Lanham teams get results. They may be painting by numbers, their work may appear ugly beside the artistry of the games' old masters, but the trophy cabinet looks good at the end of the year. Not everyone is a Lanham fan. A glance at last Sunday's papers reveals the hatred many feel towards his methods. Last Saturday, Cambridge lost 3-0 to Swindown Town in the FA Cup. Swindon have become model of artistic football under two former international midfielders, first Osvaldo Ardiles and, latterly, Glenn Hoddle. 'Swindon slay the Cambridge beast,' gloated the headline in one of the quality papers. 'Long-ball bores cut down to size,' crowed a tabloid. 'Even better, Cambridge were thrashed . . . their sterile strategy discredited,' it continued. 'The kind of mindless, boring drivel produced by Cambridge and kindred spirits is a curse on the game.' There was similar bile in other papers. This weekly treatment makes the ability of Beck and his players to stick to their strategy all the more admirable. Lanham reads such reports. The jibe that irritates him is that Cambridge are mindless. 'That is one thing we are not, everything we do is thought out.' On the other hand, he knows that chance will average out over the whole season: Cambridge have already beaten Swindon twice in the league. Lanham says he knows why his approach is so unpopular. This is where his theory of soccer and his theory of life overlap. Football fans are not interested in facts or teams, they care about individuals and 'unfounded opinion.' 'As Howard Hughes said, 'I am interested in why the sun comes up tomorrow morning'. Most people are interested in their fellow men. Most people are interested in individuals, not teams. 'There is this thing called 'hype', man can only see individuals, not the team. Why do people watch Coronation Street, rather than, say, a factual programme on Mussolini?' Lanham says soccer attracts the opinionated. 'If I hear my mates talking football in the pub I can't join in. That would deny them their right to an opinion.' But then another of his mottoes, a quote from Lord Montgomery, runs: 'Unfounded opinion is valueless.' Lanham believes his analysis could be harnessed to different teams. He could, he says, work for a club such as Tottenham and help them get better results without abandoning their style. For all his 400 categories, his computer and his banks of files, the statistic that counts is the one on his letterhead: eight promotions. The press and many fans may think the team he has helped create is a monster, but if Beck and his players do not decide they want to be loved, Cambridge will continue to enjoy success beyond its modest means.</p>

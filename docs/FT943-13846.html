			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Pressure for Tecs in London to merge The government is seeking to trigger mergers among the nine training and enterprise councils in London, some of which are among the worst performers in the network of the 82 employer-led organisations according to government criteria. Tecs are responsible for delivering the government's main training programmes in England and Wales. Chairmen of the London Tecs have been told by Miss Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, to review their structures, including making proposals for mergers. Proposals could include slimming the existing network to four or five, with a central strategic body, or even one London Tec. Tecs in London have been striving to work together more closely, but achievements on programmes such as Business Links, the umbrella bodies for business advice, have been modest. A few Tecs have even held informal talks over mergers. Miss Widdecombe is understood not to approve of this because of its ad hoc nature. Mr David Hill, chairman of Aztec, a south London Tec, and the capital's representative on the Tec national council, said: 'The government has asked me as the regional Tec chairman for London to review, with other London chairmen, the structure of the nine Tecs.' It is understood that some London Tec chairmen, who will discuss the matter at a meeting tomorrow, do not share the minister's interest in structure. They would prefer any review to look strategically at London's needs and then consider what structure was most applicable. Ms Cay Stratton, of the charity Business in the Community, said: 'The important thing is not to start talking about boundaries but what are the pan-London and strategic issues.' Tec difficulties in London are a result of several factors. These include the complexity of the London labour market, which employs 16 per cent of the UK workforce, and a historic underfinancing of government-funded training schemes in the capital.

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DELAY SOUGHT IN ENFORCEMENT OF AIRPORT GROWTH LAW IN COUNTY;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: CITIES' PLANS FOR CONTROLLING BUILDING AROUND AIRPORTS ARE DUE  JUNE 30, 1991. A STATE SENATOR WANTS A SIX-MONTH MORATORIUM.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert G. Beverly is pressing for passage of a bill to temporarily exempt  cities in Los Angeles County from a potentially far-reaching new law to ensure  orderly growth around airports.  </P> <P> With the support of the League of California Cities, Beverly is seeking a  six-month moratorium on enforcement of the law that put teeth into statutes  aimed at ensuring that hotels, office buildings, industrial parks and other  projects are compatible with airports.  </P> <P> Beverly, a Republican from Manhattan Beach, described his bill as a stopgap  measure until he can help hammer out a permanent solution. Airports in Los  Angeles, Torrance, Long Beach, El Monte, Santa Monica, Compton, Hawthorne, La  Verne, Burbank and Palmdale are among those affected.  </P> <P> At issue is the application of a law, written last year by Sen. Marion Bergeson  (R-Newport Beach), designed to protect pilots from undue hazards around  airports and protect people who live and work around airports from noise and  safety hazards.  </P> <P> Bergeson sought the law because airport land-use plans required by the state  since 1970 had been completed for only about half the state's 269 airports. Los  Angeles County had not prepared a plan for any of its 16 airports.  </P> <P> In a letter to Beverly last week, Bergeson said: "I firmly believe that the  Legislature should not give Los Angeles County officials the ability to delay  even longer."  </P> <P> Under her law, which took effect Jan. 1, the plans are required to be completed  by June 30, 1991. It also requires that if an airport does not have a plan,  many building projects, some as far as two miles from airports, will need  approval from county airport land-use commissions as well as local governments.  </P> <P> Beverly's proposal would delay the effective date in Los Angeles County until  Jan. 1, 1992.  </P> <P> The Legislature has designated the Regional Planning Commission as the airport  planning agency in Los Angeles County. But some landowners and cities want to  avoid having the county conduct a project-by-project review.  </P> <P> "We want to retain local control of our planning cases," said Torrance Mayor  Katy Geissert, who has been lobbying for changes in the Bergeson legislation.  "The Regional Planning Commission is not set up or funded for this. . . . This  is sacred turf as far as local governments are concerned."  </P> <P> John Huttinger, a commission planner, said that since the Bergeson law took  effect, only San Dimas and Torrance have filed permits for airport-related  projects.  </P> <P> More important, he said, 10 cities have maintained that the law does not apply  to Los Angeles County. Huttinger said these cities are Long Beach, El Segundo,  Palos Verdes Estates, South El Monte, Arcadia, Rolling Hills Estates, Lomita,  San Fernando, Lancaster and Palmdale. He said the other 25 or so 29 cities near  airports, including Los Angeles, have not contacted his office.  </P> <P> It is going to take a lot of personnel "to process all local land use decisions  through the county . . . and there has been no additional money provided by the  state," Lomita City Atty. Robert Wadden said.  </P> <P> He also said that his reading of the "is that it specifically exempted counties  of more than 4 million population. That's Los Angeles County."  </P> <P> Hawthorne City Manager Kenneth Jue agreed, characterizing the original bill as  a "poor piece of legislation that sneaked through. So many of the cities did  not think Los Angeles County was included in this."  </P> <P> Now that the county has acknowledged that it must review planning cases within  two miles of an airport, city planners say they have been waiting for further  guidance.  </P> <P> "We've seen no guidance from them on how to submit these materials," Rodney  Kahn, Hawthorne assistant planner, said. "It kind of leaves us in an awkward  position."  </P> <P> Beverly inserted his proposal into a bill that was already in the Assembly.  Action by the Assembly on Beverly's bill could come as early as Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Mexico to loosen restrictions on labour The Mexican government is to reform the federal labour law in an effort to increase worker productivity. The new law would scrap the seniority clause that restricts the ability of some companies to promote workers. It would also speed resolution of disputes between management and unions by replacing the current labour conciliation and arbitration panel with more streamlined tribunals. The president has also sent Congress new laws to allow foreigners to operate trucks and buses in Mexico, and would permit foreign investment in maritime transport. The law also extends the maximum concession for private toll roads to 50 years. 'What we are seeing are the internal changes that are necessary to compete under the North American Free Trade Agreement,' says Mr Mario Dehesa, an economist with Grupo Financiero Serfin. 'We cannot compete with our hands tied behind our backs.' The labour reform proposals are likely to be sent to Congress by December 15.</p>

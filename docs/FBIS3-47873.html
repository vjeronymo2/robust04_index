			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 January Morning </F> Edition]    [Text] The government released the text of notes exchanged  between the Japanese and U.S. Governments on the bilateral  construction talks. It says that to monitor the extent of  foreign companies' participation in the Japanese construction  market, 10 items in six areas will be adopted as criteria. The  government believes that this criteria "will not develop into  numerical targets" (according to Shigeo Mochizuki,  administrative vice minister of construction).    These notes were exchanged on 19 January between Takakazu  Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, and Ronald Brown,  U.S. commerce secretary. Other criteria cited includes the  construction project clients' assessment of efforts by foreign  companies to win bids, and the number of registered foreign  companies. Regular bilateral consultations will be held once a  year beginning April 1995, when the government's "action  program" for reform of the bidding system will be fully  implemented, to make comprehensive assessments until the end of  1999.    With regard to the criteria, the Construction Ministry  maintains that: "These are for the purpose of assessing progress  made so far objectively; the United States had not even demanded  setting numerical targets." The government takes a similar  position in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks; it rejects  setting numerical targets. It asserts that "negotiations should  not be on a bilateral basis, but should be done at GATT"  (according to a Foreign Ministry source).    However, the U.S. construction industry and Congress are  still calling for setting a market share target. Depending on  the number of contracts U.S. companies can win from now on,  frictions may rekindle in the areas of design and consultancy,  where U.S. companies have a strong desire to make inroads into  the market.</p>

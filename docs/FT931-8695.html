			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Academic warns of inconsistencies in Accounting Standards Board INCONSISTENCIES are creeping into the Accounting Standards Board's new requirements and their implementation, an academic warned yesterday. Speaking at the launch of the latest annual survey of company accounts from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Mr Len Skerratt of the University of Manchester said 'cracks' were appearing in the new regime. 'The Accounting Standards Board has done a really good job,' he said. 'But it's a bit like a game of Scrabble. The first words are easy to fit in. The real problem is getting the last ones to be compatible.' From a sample of 300 companies, the survey shows wide variations in those allocating items such as foreign currency differences and revaluations between extraordinary items, exceptional items and reserve movements.

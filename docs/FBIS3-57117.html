			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] President Guntis Ulmanis received a delegation  headed by Alain Lamassoure, minister delegate of European  affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in his  residence at Jurmala yesterday.    Looking at the sea through a window of the meeting hall, Mr.  Lamassoure said that the seascape reminded him of the Atlantic  coast of France. There the sea is rough but the land tranquil.  Here the sea is calm but the land restless. Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur has therefore asked him to visit the Baltic  states in precisely this situation which has evolved after the  elections in Russia. The elections brought about insecurity, to  a certain extent even threats to the Baltic states, therefore,  (?the minister said), France expresses support for Latvia.    Speaking about relations with the European Union, Alain  Lamassoure stressed that France and Germany are in favor of  Latvia becoming an associate member of that organization. He  indicated that France fully supports Latvia's demand for the  unconditional withdrawal of the Russian army, because Latvia is  a sovereign state.    An acceptable timescale should be laid down for the  dismantling of the Skrunda radar station; this has nothing to do  with the Russian community in Latvia.    President Guntis Ulmanis emphasized the security issue in  Latvia and all the Baltic states, which has come to the fore due  to the events of recent days. (?Therefore), the cooperation  which has already started with France is of special significance  for strengthening the Latvian defense forces.    Alain Lamassoure reported that he will confer with the  French  defense minister within the next few days to prepare a document  for signing on cooperation between the two countries in the  sphere of defense.    Speaking about the NATO Partnership for Peace plan and  Latvia's involvement in this program, the minister noted that  for countries which are not NATO member states this offers the  possibility for obtaining new security guarantees.    Touching on the issue of minorities, the French minister  stressed that if the Latvian Government relies on  recommendations made by the CSCE, France will be able to render  more palpable support.    At the end of the meeting the president recalled that France  has not yet resolved the issue of the Latvian Embassy. The  minister replied that action would begin quite soon to get out  of the deadlock.    Alain Lamassoure handed to Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs a letter from French Prime Minister Eduard Balladur with  an invitation to visit the French capital in the near future.  During the talks Mr. Birkavs stressed that Latvian security has  become the main priority of state policy and expressed support  for the draft of the European stability pact worked out by the  French prime minister.

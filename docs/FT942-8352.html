			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Australian banks show improvement National Australia Bank and Westpac, two of Australia's largest commercial banks, yesterday reported interim figures which emphasised the continuing improvement in bad debt experience. They also demonstrated some pick-up in the business lending market. NAB, reckoned to be the strongest of Australia's big four banks, announced a profit of ADollars 868.8m (USDollars 634.2m) after tax for the six months until the end of March. This included a ADollars 63.8m abnormal item relating to a disposal, but still represented a sharp increase on last time's ADollars 507.3m, which also included a ADollars 32.9m abnormal surplus. NAB attributed the improvement to a higher level of business loan demand in Australia and New Zealand, a decline in operating expenses, and a further 'significant' reduction in the charge for bad and doubtful debts. The two biggest geographical divisions - Australian operations and businesses in the UK and Ireland (which include the Clydesdale, Northern, Yorkshire and National Irish banks) - posted net profits of ADollars 509.9m, against ADollars 325.9m last time, and ADollars 233.6m against ADollars 157.2m, respectively. The New Zealand group made ADollars 37.9m. Westpac reported a ADollars 320.9m profit after tax, against a loss of ADollars 204.6m a year earlier. In its case, the drop in the bad and doubtful debts charge was more marked, although the figure remains much higher than at NAB. The charge in the half-year was ADollars 379m compared with ADollars 799.7m. Westpac's gross problem assets stood at ADollars 5.5bn at the end of March, compared with ADollars 8.57bn a year earlier. Westpac said restructuring at the bank had helped to push its expense/income ratio down to 60 per cent in the six months. It said it was 'well-placed' to achieve its target of 58 per cent in the 1995 financial year. Westpac is increasing the interim dividend by 33 per cent to 8 cents a share. NAB has declared a full-franked interim dividend of 35 cents a share, up from 24 cents.</p>

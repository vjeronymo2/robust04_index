			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Berkeley Chamber of Commerce said that the City Council should be held  responsible for this month's riot on Telegraph Avenue. In a blunt statement,  the chamber blamed the council's "confrontational" attitude toward UC  Berkeley's growth plans, which include construction of a dormitory in People's  Park, for precipitating the violence. The outbreak, in which 28 stores were  looted or damaged and 20 people were hurt, followed a demonstration to  commemorate the 20-year-old struggle over People's Park, a piece of  university-owned land near Telegraph Avenue.  </P></p>

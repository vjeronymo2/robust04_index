			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Judge raises Maxwell insider dealing fears New evidence has emerged that Robert Maxwell was using share dealings with company pension schemes to earn profits for his private interests long before financial pressures threatened his empire. As a result, the pension schemes may have a higher claim on the assets of Maxwell Communication Corporation in liquidation than other creditors had believed. A High Court judge, meanwhile, has raised the possibility that Maxwell may have had inside information when he made the share dealings more than seven years ago. The events in 1986 and 1987 have only come to light after a dispute between the trustees to the Maxwell company pension schemes and Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC. High Court documents show that pension schemes controlled by Maxwell bought shares in Beecham, the drugs company, from Philip Hill Investment Trust (PHIT) in September 1986, a week before Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corporation (BPCC)  - as MCC was then known  - completed its agreed takeover of the trust. Less than two months later, after Maxwell had raised cash by selling other assets of PHIT, BPCC bought the shares back from the pension schemes for a short period during which Beecham's share price rose sharply. He sold them back to the pension schemes on March 2 1987, earning a Pounds 17.5m profit for BPCC. Mr Justice Vinelott, delivering a judgment on the matter last February, questioned whether Maxwell may have had inside information when he decided to keep the Beecham shares. Mr Justice Vinelott wrote: 'When all the facts are known, the conclusion may be that the sale to MCC on December 15 was made at a time when Mr Robert Maxwell had good reason to believe that the market price of the shares was likely to rise substantially and that the purpose of the purchase and resale was simply to ensure that the increase in price benefited MCC and not the pension funds.' The 12.46m Beecham shares were by far the largest single investment in the PHIT portfolio, according to the PHIT annual report for the year to the end of March 1986. The chairman of PHIT was Lord Keith of Castleacre, who was also chairman of Beecham. Beecham was engaged in a restructuring exercise which resulted in sharply improved earnings around the time of the share transactions. In the following year, it merged with SmithKline, the US-based pharmaceuticals company. Mr Justice Vinelott said in his judgment that, although the PHIT portfolio was liquidated by Goldman Sachs on behalf of MCC, 'Lord Keith was anxious that the shares of Beecham should not be placed on the market and exacted from Mr Robert Maxwell an undertaking or assurance that they would be retained as a long-term investment'. At the time, Goldman Sachs announced that it had sold the PHIT Beecham shares to pension fund investors, but did not disclose their connection to Maxwell. Lord Keith said this week that he had sought an assurance that the Beecham shares be placed in safe hands because 'my interest was to see to it that they were sold in an orderly fashion'. He added: 'What I didn't want was a great block of shares floating in the market.' Lord Keith said he strongly doubted that Maxwell had any inside information. Moreover, he said, he could not recall Maxwell ever asking him about affairs at Beecham on any of the very few occasions when the two met. 'He was just a punter,' Lord Keith said.</p>

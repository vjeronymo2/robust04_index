			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever Much time and thought went into Unilever's head office review as the Anglo-Dutch giant continued to wage war on bureaucracy. But it is perhaps surprising that the outcome was not more radical. Unilever has devolved greater management responsibility to the operating level. But it has preserved the cumbersome division and duplication of functions between London and Rotterdam. Reasons of tax and history make this a particularly knotty problem. But the incoming co-chairman, Mr Michael Perry, had a fine opportunity to remould Unilever in a far more inventive spirit. It is a pity he did not take it.</p>

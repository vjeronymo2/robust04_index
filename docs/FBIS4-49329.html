			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Luo Zheng (5012 2398)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 3 May (XINHUA) -- At a meeting of the  political affairs group of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC]  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Preparatory  Committee, the group agreed that the formation of the first  legislative council of the future Hong Kong SAR should be based  on the Basic Law and the relevant decisions made by the National  People's Congress and should reflect principles concerning  national sovereignty and smooth transition.    This was the first meeting of the PWC's political affairs  group since the PWC was founded last July. The two-day meeting  was concluded early this evening.    Liang Zhenying, a leader of the political affairs group,  said  to this reporter: At this meeting, we concentrated on further  discussions on the election and formation of the first  legislative council of the future Hong Kong SAR and related  issues. The participating members reached agreement on the  principles concerning the formation of the first legislative  council. He said: The formation of the first legislative  council should reflect the executive-led principle; the  principle that the executive and legislative organs should  cooperate with each other and balance and check each other, with  the emphasis on cooperation; the principle of balanced  participation by people from all strata in Hong Kong society;  and the principle of developing democracy in an orderly and  gradual process. All these are guiding principles.    Liang Zhenying said: As to several specific arrangements,  the members also reached a consensus. These arrangements  include: That the voting age in elections should be lowered to  18 and that, in terms of the functional constituency elections,  the existing methods of functional constituency elections that  have proved effective, as well as the current practices and  principles, shall be retained.    Xiao Weiyun, another leader of the political affairs group,  added: At the meeting, we also discussed the current situation  and, in particular, analyzed the report presented recently by  the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons of  the British Parliament. The members' views can be summarized  into the following two points: 1) Many of the things mentioned  in the report are inconsistent with the facts; 2) the report  reflects some change in the British Hong Kong authorities'  attitude and policy toward the Basic Law. Many members took  part in the drafting of the Basic Law and are very aware of  where the report does not agree with the Basic Law.    He revealed that the political affairs group will hold  another meeting in Beijing in June to discuss the report of the  third meeting of the PWC and the arrangements for work in the  second half of this year.</p>

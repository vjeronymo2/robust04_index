			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Textile chief's sentence overturned Taiwan's Supreme Court has overturned the conviction and 2 1/2 year prison sentence of flamboyant textile tycoon Oung Ta-ming in connection with a Dollars 22m (Pounds 14.6m) stock-trading scandal which led to the resignation of a cabinet minister, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei. Mr Oung is the de facto head of the Hualon group, which recently signed an agreement to establish a Pounds 157m textile plant in Northern Ireland, with British government backing. The case against him was thrown back to the country's high court for retrial as there was not enough evidence to support the earlier verdict, according to the deciding judge. Mr Oung was convicted in 1992 on breach of trust charges for selling, below market value, shares in an unlisted life insurance company to the daughter of the former minister of transport and communications. 'There is not enough evidence to prove that Oung sold the shares at lower prices than the actual value. The definition of high and low is very subjective,' a court spokesman said. The decision prevents Mr Oung being stripped of the parliamentary seat he won in December 1992. The Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of Mr Oung Yi-ming, a younger brother, for improperly enriching others in a land scandal. Sentencing was withheld in the case of another brother, Mr Oung You-ming, who was involved in the share scandal. He fled the island in 1991 and has not returned to face charges.</p>

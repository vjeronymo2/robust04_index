			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Trade News: Nissan in talks with Samsung on cars Nissan, the Japanese car maker, and Samsung, one of South Korea's largest industrial groups, are in talks about a possible tie-up which would provide Samsung Heavy Industries with Nissan's technology in manufacturing cars. Nissan said that it had been approached by Samsung about the possibility of transferring car manufacturing technology and that the two sides were still at the negotiating table. An alliance with Samsung would give Nissan a promising entry into the South Korean passenger car market, where the company has not been particularly active. The company already provides Samsung with truck manufacturing technology and will start volume production of left-hand-drive trucks from the middle of this year. Nissan has also had a tie-up since 1986 with Daewoo, through which it provides the Korean truck maker with technology for its commercial van, the Vannette. However, that tie-up will expire at the end of this year. South Korea now ranks as the world's sixth largest carmaker, after the United States, Japan, Germany, France and Canada. Negotiations with Samsung, which is making a bid to enter the passenger car market in South Korea, hinge on passenger cars.</p>

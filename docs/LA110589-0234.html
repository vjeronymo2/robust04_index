Mark Murray, 23, of San Luis Obispo was arrested in  the Tower of Hope, a building in the church complex by Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies shortly after 4 a.m. Murray had been sought by investigators  after Richard Roberts was found strangled in his Sweetzer Avenue apartment on  Oct. 31, Sheriff's Deputy Patrick Hunter said. Pastor Sandy Freud of the  Crystal Cathedral said he had advised Murray on Friday to surrender. He later  made arrangements for him to be turned over to deputies at the church.  </P></p>

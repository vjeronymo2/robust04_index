			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Unsafe as houses In the absence of high inflation, it was inevitable that the British housing market should suffer a hard landing after the giddy price spiral of the 1980s. Less easy to rationalise is the failure of the market to respond to economic recovery. Even after the recent increase, nominal interest rates are low by historic standards. The ratio of house prices to earnings looks similarly depressed. Yet the latest monthly survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests that prices and activity have remained stagnant at a time when a seasonal uplift might have been expected. The impact of the government's tax increases on personal incomes is an important factor, since mortgage lenders advance money on the basis of a multiple of post-tax income. Yet the more potent restraining influence is probably the state of the personal sector balance sheet. Whereas the corporate sector has paid down debt and returned to financial surplus since the trough of recession, the personal sector is still struggling with the burden of debt incurred in the 1980s and the subsequent plunge in house prices. Mortgage debt between 1988 and 1993 rose from 26 per cent of the equity in British homes to an unprecedented 46 per cent. Hardest hit are the million or so households with negative equity, where borrowers are trapped in their homes until they can save enough to repay debt, or find that inflation comes to their rescue. Since the average value per household of this negative equity is only Pounds 5,100, less than 10 per cent of the value of the average house, it would take only a small increase in prices to do the trick. Yet the gap may be harder to close than simple arithmetic suggests. For a start, the adjustment in the personal sector balance sheet is proving a slow and painful process. Young first time buyers who might normally have emerged at this point in the recovery are absent because they bought prematurely in the panic of 1988-89. And for those who are still able to borrow, the investment logic in housing looks less compelling. Interest rates may be historically low in nominal terms, but they are high in real terms, especially when the borrower is investing in an asset that is not keeping pace even with today's very subdued rate of inflation. In the long run things may look different. The demand for housing increases with rising earnings, while the supply of land is fixed. The poor scope for productivity growth in house building ensures a rising cost of housing relative to other goods. Against that, demographers expect a lower rate of household formation over the next 30 years as the population ages. This would reduce demand, unless older households turn out to want more valuable homes. For the moment, though, the dull state of the housing market looks like a symptom of a sustainable, non-inflationary recovery. Unfamiliar, perhaps even un-British, but long overdue.</p>

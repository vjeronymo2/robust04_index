			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Dehua (2621 1795 5478): "Quickening </F> High-Efficiency Development Is Very Key to Ensuring Xinjiang's  Long- Term Stability--An Interview With Abulaiti, the New  Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region"]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--"Quickening  the high-efficiency development of the economy is the very key  to ensuring Xinjiang's long-term stability," said Abulaiti, the  new chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region who was  attending the second session of the Eighth NPC as a nonvoting  member in Beijing, when he talked about the economy in an  interview with this staff reporter.    Chairman Abulaiti, 51, appeared to be ebullient as he  talked.  He said: Xinjiang accounts for one sixth of China's total  territory. It is approximately 16 times the size of Zhejiang or  is the size of the other four northwestern provinces and regions  together. It has a population of 16 million, of whom nearly 10  million are minority nationalities. Xinjiang's poverty-stricken  areas are mostly in the minority nationality-inhabited  prefectures and autonomous prefectures of Kashi, Hotan, Kizil,  and Aksu in southern Xinjiang. It is very rare across the  country that poverty-stricken areas are as concentrated as they  are.    Abulaiti clearly told this reporter: Last year, Xinjiang's  GNP increased by 4.5 percentage points less than the national  average and its industrial output value increased by 12  percentage points less than the national average. In recent  years, the gap of people's living standards between Xinjiang and  the national average has become increasingly wide. The main  reason is Xinjiang's poor infrastructure.    Despite State help to Xinjiang in various aspects over the  past 40 years or more, Xinjiang's infrastructural development  has long lagged behind, limited by various objective conditions.  In light of remarks made by Deng Xiaoping during his tour of  southern China, the State has formulated the policy of opening  up border areas. But due to Xinjiang's poor infrastructure,  problems regarding its development are still very prominent. On  an inspection tour in Xinjiang last year, State Council Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji remarked: "The Lanzhou-Xinjiang double-track  railway project, which is now being built, has come at least  five years later than it should have." His understanding has a  profound meaning.    Abulaiti said: In order to enable Xinjiang to reach a  comparatively comfortable standard with the rest of the country  by the end of this century, with State help Xinjiang's  infrastructural development has already grown some. In the  Eighth and Ninth Five- Year Plans, a number of key and  development projects will be completed and initiated. In the  meantime, Xinjiang also hopes that the Korla-Kashi extension  project on the southern Xinjiang railway and the project on  diverting water from northern Xinjiang to southern Xinjiang will  be initiated as soon as possible to guarantee that Xinjiang  makes headway in its national economy.    Abulaiti said frankly that without these infrastructural  projects as a guarantee, Xinjiang's advantage in resources  cannot be properly utilized nor can Xinjiang change the passive  situation in which it has to aid poverty-stricken areas every  year.    At present, Xinjiang is having increasingly closer ties with  the country's overall development, especially in petroleum, the  chemical industry, nonferrous metals, cotton, and other bulk  commodities, and is playing a more important role in the  country's economic field. As China is gaining in national  strength, it is extremely urgent that the State's strategy for  the development of western China be implemented as soon as  possible and that Xinjiang's infrastructural development be  further strengthened.    Abulaiti stressed that if development proceeds in this way,  the gap between Xinjiang and the mainland proper will naturally  narrow, and Xinjiang's contribution to the country will become  more outstanding, people will live and work contentedly, the  various nationalities will become much more united, and there  will be a guarantee for the long-term stability of society.</p>

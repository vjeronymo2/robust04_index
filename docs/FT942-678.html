			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Unilever hit by new allegations in its soap war with Procter Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch detergent giant, faced potentially damaging allegations from across Europe over its revolutionary new soap powder yesterday, as the soap war with US rival Procter &amp; Gamble appeared to tilt in Procter's favour. The Unilever powder, known as Persil Power and Omo Power, has been attacked by Procter as harming clothes. In separate developments yesterday: Unilever refused to comment on allegations in the Dutch weekend press that Unilever management had ignored advice from its own researchers that the product should only be used at low temperatures. Henkel, the German detergents giant, which owns the Persil brand name in Europe outside the UK and France, said its tests had confirmed Procter's claims of damage to clothes. The UK Consumers Association attacked Unilever for launching a modified version of the powder this week, which is being sold alongside the original version without distinguishing between the two. Unilever said it had 'no reaction' to an article in Saturday's edition of the Dutch daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad, claiming that the row over the new powder resulted from a 'lack of communication' between Unilever's research and marketing departments. However, an adviser to Unilever dismissed the allegation as untrue. 'This is uninformed gossip from junior research people,' he said. The Austrian subsidiary of Henkel claimed yesterday that tests carried out by itself and an independent research institute had confirmed that Omo Power damaged cotton textiles after 12 washes, with particular damage after 25 washes. Henkel has been at pains to point out that its powder has no connection with the Unilever version. In the UK, the assistant director of the Consumers Association, Mr Derek Prentice, criticised Unilever's failure to distinguish between its new 'rebalanced' version of the powder and the original version. Unilever said there was no reason to make a distinction as it stood by the original product. In Switzerland, the new version carries a recommendation that it should not be used on dark colours or lightly soiled clothes. According to Procter, it also contains only 10 per cent as much of the allegedly damaging manganese catalyst, though Unilever yesterday denied the reduction was so large. Unilever executives in London reaffirmed their commitment to the new powder, which they said had enabled them to overtake Procter in the UK detergents market in the space of six weeks from launch. Mr Andrew Seth, chief executive of UK detergents, said the new catalyst would be introduced into other Unilever detergent brands, such as Surf and Radion, in a matter of weeks.</p>

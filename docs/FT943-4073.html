			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Running scared again It would be nice to dismiss the violent market reaction to yesterday's US producer price data as simply Friday afternoon excess. Excluding food and energy, the August rise was only 0.4 per cent, but there are grounds for concern. First, there is growing evidence that inflationary pressures are building up. As productivity gains associated with the early stages of recovery subside, input price rises may become harder for companies to absorb and will thus feed through more easily to the retail level. Second, yesterday's market reaction shows that European bond markets have still failed to decouple from the US trend. That is bad for equities, which have managed to advance ahead of bond markets since mid-summer, leaving relative valuations looking stretched. In the UK, for example, equities trade at a small discount to index-linked gilt yields, while the gilt-equity yield ratio of around 2.3 times leaves little room for comfort. However good the recovery story, it will be difficult for European equity markets to ignore developments in bonds. Nor is it easy to see how the US bond market can calm down if inflationary pressures continue to surface even while the economy is cooling. That might require a more aggressive tightening than the Federal Reserve has so far undertaken, which would certainly choke off the recovery in a way that again risks undermining Wall Street equities. Until that uncertainty is resolved, other markets may be nervous too.</p>

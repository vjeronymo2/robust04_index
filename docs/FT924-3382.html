			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Deal set up to raise western equity capital for Russia A CANADIAN company and a UK securities house have set up the first attempt to raise western equity capital for investment in Russia. The deal, signed yesterday in London, creates a joint venture called PeterStar, which is to provide international telecommunications for St Petersburg. The shareholders are LenTel, the city's telephone company (with 40 per cent), the city authorities (10 per cent) and the Petersburg Long Distance Telephone Corporation, a stock market listed Canadian company which has changed its name from the NWE Capital Corporation. Smith New Court, the UK broker, is to place 3.3m shares in a secondary offering - the first time equity capital will be raised for investment in what is essentially a Russian enterprise. The company has secured as chairman Mr Gordon Owen, formerly group managing director of Cable and Wireless. Mr Owen was in charge of the restoration of telecommunication services in Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion. The main customers of the joint venture will be tourists, who are expected to use the hard currency telephone boxes now being set up in the city. Western businesses and hotels will also have access to the network, with local residents being offered the services at a later stage. The venture expects to produce pre-tax profits of about Dollars 24m by 1995. Although strongly backed by Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St Petersburg, the project has to overcome a number of financial and legal provisions. At present, 50 per cent of hard currency earnings must be changed into roubles - with pressure mounting for the government to introduce a 100 per cent regime because of its need for hard currency. Profit and value added taxes, as well as income tax, are currently at high rates of between 30 and 40 per cent - while Russian auditing and accounting standards are widely different from those in the west. Finally, there is no secure system of enforcing property and other legal rights.</p>

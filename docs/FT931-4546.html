			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise Oil lifted Another major oil discovery, this time on the Norwegian continental shelf, was announced by a consortium including the UK's Enterprise Oil. The stock gained 10 at 507p, its best level since November 1991. Turnover was a heavy 3.5m shares. 'This is wonderful news for Enterprise ahead of tomorrow's preliminary figures, which are expected to include a nudge upwards in the dividend payment to 16p,' said one oil specialist. Another said the discovery continued Enterprise's record of strong exploration success and would keep up the group's production profile in coming years. Last week BP announced a substantial oil find west of the Shetland Islands; initial estimates of the find, where BP has an 80 per cent stake and Royal Dutch/Shell the remaining 20 per cent, were put at 250m to 500m barrels of oil.</p>

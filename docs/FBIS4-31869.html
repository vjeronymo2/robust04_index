			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 15 Jun -- "I hope this visit revitalizes our  relations. The possibilities are much greater, but we do not  know how to fully utilize them today. The empty fields between  our countries should be cultivated as quickly as possible. If  we can help ourselves, then others will help us too," Polish  President Lech Walesa said, welcoming his guest, Vladimir  Shumeyko, the chairman of the Council of the Russian Federation,  the president's press bureau reported.    Shumeyko, stressing that Russia regarded Poland as a key  Central European state on which a great deal depended, expressed  the hope that a deepening of our still insufficient cooperation  would be an important result of his visit. President Walesa is  not satisfied with the results either, and in his opinion, the  reasons lie above all in Russia's internal problems. Adjusting  the law to meet the new challenges that the vital need for  economic cooperation presents us with, could facilitate mutual  contacts, economic contacts in particular. The need for  economic contacts was also strongly stressed by Shumeyko: "It  is the economy that serves politics. Today, more can depend on  the international division of labor than on military blocs."    Speaking about security issues, Shumeyko assessed Poland's  participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program as a  positive fact.    President Walesa noted that after the collapse of the two  confrontational blocs, the former Warsaw Treaty countries have  many problems and questions. "I even prefer difficulties, but I  want to know what they are," the president said. "Here we do  not know what can threaten us." "We want to go to NATO not as  Russia's opponent. The idea is not to be a buffer of the West.  What we want is to reduce the fields of military and economic  uncertainty. Poland wants good relations with Russia."    "Hard work awaits us. We have to reconstruct everything,  rearrange the economic system and the way we think of ourselves.  We have to do this for security, for logic, for the future,"  the president said. "We are living in a period of transition.  In a period of creating a vision of a new Europe and a new  world. It will take time and new generations not burdened by  the past and by longing for the old order for us to succeed in  creating a new reality without divisions.    "Today we need cooperation with both West and East, in order  to equalize economic levels. Political divisions will then  lessen too. The road of transformation that we have entered is  obvious. [passage indistinct]    "The period of old mistakes must be closed. We are counting  on the presence of the supreme authorities at the Warsaw  Uprising ceremonies. We invite you," President Walesa said.</p>

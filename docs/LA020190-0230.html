			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GUITARIST AIDS AILING MUSICIAN  </P> <P> Jazz guitarist George Benson gave a pep talk to a would-be musician suffering a  rare form of cancer. Then he backed up the kind words with a valuable gift.  </P> <P> When 22-year-old David Romito talked with Benson after a show here last fall,  it gave him hope.  </P> <P> "Benson talked with me a long time," Romito said this week. "He knew I was  sick, of course, and said he knew somebody who once was given only six weeks to  live -- and the person is still living 10 years later."  </P> <P> Romito admired Benson's guitar, a six-string Ibanez, and the singer offered to  send him an identical one. The instrument arrived at Romito's home last month,  he said.  </P> <P> Romito plays guitar, sings and writes music. He was diagnosed in 1985 with  rhabdomyosarcoma, a muscular cancer but said he is continuing to focus on his  musical career.  </P></p>

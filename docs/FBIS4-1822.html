			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Political Editor Danny Gittings and Dick Chan] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong has overwhelmingly thrown its support  behind Governor Chris Patten's proposed crackdown on property  speculation. An exclusive SUNDAY MORNING POST opinion poll  reveals that 79 per cent of those surveyed believe the Governor  was right last week to identify rising property prices as an  urgent problem. Only eight per cent disagreed, while 13 per  cent were unsure.    Speculation was almost universally identified as a major  cause of the soaring prices by the poll's respondents. There  was strong support for tough new measures to control it,  including a controversial capital gains tax on speculators.    The poll also uncovered startling new evidence of the effect  rising residential prices is having on ordinary people. Only  six per cent of those surveyed said they were intending to buy a  flat at present, in the Hong Kong Polling and Business Research  (PBR) survey of 1,055 people. Forty-nine per cent were less  likely to buy a flat because of recent price rises, while only  four per cent said this had made them more likely to do so. A  further 43 per cent said recent events had not affected the  prospect of them buying a flat, while four per cent were unsure.    The poll was conducted last Wednesday [30 March] and  Thursday, immediately after the Government announced the  establishment of a multi-disciplinary task force charged with  cooling the property market. The response rate was 62 per cent.  PBR managing director Citi Hung Ching-tin said the results  showed the Government had pinpointed the issue of most immediate  concern to people. "The Governor is reaping the political  windfall of correctly identifying the issue of the day that is  hitting the lower classes," he said.    Mr Patten last week pledged that "the number one domestic  issue on my agenda will be property prices". The Financial  Secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod, and the Acting Secretary for  Planning, Environment and Lands, Canice Mak Chun-fong, also  pledged the Government would take action to bring down prices.    Ninety-three per cent of those surveyed saw speculation as a  main cause of the soaring market. But most respondents believed  Hong Kong property developers and other local purchasers were  primarily to blame, rather than mainland firms, which had  recently been accused of fuelling the rising prices.  Seventy-eight per cent believed speculation by local developers  was a major factor behind the runaway market, while 76 per cent  believed the activities of other Hong Kong purchasers were an  equally important contributing cause.    Only 50 per cent identified speculation by Beijing-backed  enterprises as a major contributor to the increase in prices,  fewer than the 58 per cent who saw the lack of land in Hong Kong  as a key factor. Forty-nine per cent saw Government policy as a  major cause, while 39 per cent identified Hong Kong's booming  economy.    But Mr Hung warned that the support the poll showed for Mr  Patten's tough stance on property prices could prove to be a  double- edged sword if he failed to cool the market quickly.  The survey found 79 per cent of respondents believed the  Government had waited too long before taking action, while only  six per cent disagreed with this, with 15 per cent unsure.  "This could be extremely dangerous for the Governor," Mr Hung  said. "If he fails to deliver on the issue, then the high  expectations will backfire."    The poll findings suggest the most popular course would be  immediate action to try to control speculation and begin  building more public housing. Both options were backed by 85  per cent of respondents. But there was also strong support for  a capital gains tax on speculators. Other, less-favoured  options included discussing an increase in land supply with  China, backed by 62 per cent, and making it easier for  redevelopment, which won the support of 45 per cent.    The Government has always opposed the introduction of a  capital gains tax on speculators, although Sir Hamish last week  said he would consider it if other measures were ineffective.  The poll's revelation of public support for such a levy came as  pro-democracy politicians yesterday renewed calls for its  introduction.    Speaking after a panel discussion, United Democrat  legislator  James To Kun-sun said the Government's promise to cool the  market would be worthless unless tough action was taken to stop  speculation. "The problem cannot be solved only by releasing  more land. We must also have some taxation measures to punish  speculation," said Mr To, who described a tax on short-term  property gains as a vital part of the battle against rocketing  residential prices. He also pointed the Government could not  formulate consistent solutions because it did not have a clear  target. "We still don't know whether the objective is just to  relax the price increase or to bring it back to a reasonable  level," he said.    Law Cheung-kwok of the Association for Democracy and  People's  Livelihood also said a tax on speculators was essential,  claiming the Government's announcement of other measures would  have no effect on the overheated market. "Property prices will  not reach a reasonable level within the next two or three years  if only those suggestions are acted upon. Taxation measures  must play a vital role in dealing with the problem," he said.    But Liberal Party spokesman Man Tak-chuen opposed the  introduction of a capital gains tax because "we couldn't easily  identify those who are speculators and those who are not".</p>

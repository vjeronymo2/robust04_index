			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulbitskiy] </F>   [Text] Bonn February 22 TASS -- A working meeting of heads  of diplomatic services of Russia, the United States and Canada,  as well as the EC states and U.N. representatives expressed  concern over situation in Bosnian regions and said that  developments around Sarajevo caused by the NATO ultimatum and  active efforts of the Russian leadership are a major step  towards termination of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    The Russian Federation was represented by special envoy of  the Russian president and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin.    The negotiations decided to make use of the success achieved  by joint efforts in settlement around Sarajevo and continue  close interaction with the aim of immediate search for ways to  settle the Bosnian conflict by all the warring sides, head of  the German Foreign Ministry's political department Juergen  Chrobog told a news conference here today.    The meeting praised possible achievement of understanding  between the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Croats, said the  German diplomat.    Possible uses of heavy armaments pulled back from Sarajevo  in  other Bosnian regions were described as a major problem. The  meeting participants agreed to concentrate on the expansion of  security zones, achieve stable truce in Sarajevo through  efficient separation of the warring units, prevent the use of  pulled back heavy armaments in other regions, ensure free access  to the city of humanitarian convoys and restore normal life in  Sarajevo with the help of U.N. units.    In the opinion of experts, it is necessary to replace U.N.  personnel in Srebrenica and Jepa and ensure free access of  humanitarian convoys to the area, immediately open the Tuzla  airport for the delivery of humanitarian cargo, achieve truce  and pullback of artillery and ensure access of humanitarian aid  to Mostar, achieve efficient truce in central areas of Bosnia  and ensure free access of humanitarian cargo in Maglaj.    Asked by ITAR-TASS whether the Bonn working meeting  discussed  a summit on Bosnian settlement, whose idea was considered during  a telephone conversation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl late last week, the German  Foreign Ministry's political department head said participants  in the working meeting will inform the state heads of the  meeting discussion and results.    The politicians will decide what kind of meeting should  discuss Bosnian settlement. The issue was not discussed in  detail, meeting participants need some time to think.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zvonko Prijovic: "The Missing Judge"] </F>   [Text] Exactly a year after the arrest of the first group  of Muslims, the trial of 25 men from Novi Pazar, Tutin, and  Sjenica is still stuck at the beginning. The main reason is the  unceasing search for a judge to try this case, and not one from  Novi Pazar, where the trial is taking place, but from outside.  First, Radomir Janicijevic and Nikola Jovicic, former judges  from the Novi Pazar District Court, were "slated" for the trial,  but both left the judiciary at exactly that time and joined the  bar. Then, Dragoje Tapuskovic was brought in from Kraljevo to be  the judge, and the trial began on 31 January, but then on 18  February it was interrupted, because Tapuskovic had a traffic  accident in which he was badly injured.    Just the other day, three months after the trial was  interrupted, Dragomir Lelovac of Kraljevo was finally designated  the new presiding judge. In the meantime, Sava Teofilovic, a  judge from Novi Sad, who by decision of the Supreme Court of  Serbia was supposed to take over the trial in Novi Pazar,  withdrew without giving his reasons. On the insistence of many  attorneys that a new judge be designated as soon as possible,  Nuho Mehovic, president of the district court in Novi Pazar,  said that he was unable to form a new panel without consent of  the presiding judge of the Supreme Court of Serbia, and he  referred the attorneys to Caslav Ignjatovic.    By all appearances, it seems that the indictment charging 25  people with threatening the territorial integrity of the FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] dictates this kind of behavior  by representatives of the supreme and district courts, but many  people are inclined to believe that the trial is being dragged  out and a new judge is being constantly sought so that the case  would not be conducted by any of the judges (Muslims) from Novi  Pazar.  <H5>  The Turkish School </H5>   The entire case began in May of last year with the arrest of  four Muslims in whose possession, according to the news release  of the Serbian MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], was found a  large quantity of arms, explosives, and war plans. Arrests  continued in the days that followed, and soon there were 25  persons of Muslim nationality behind bars. The indictment then  said that the objective of the arrestees was to create by the  use of force an independent state of "Sandzak" from a part of  the territory of the FRY, that they drew up war plans and other  plans to that end, that they established military and police  units, and that they acquired large quantities of arms and  explosives without authorization.    Not long after that, an indictment was returned against  Sulejman Ugljanin, leader of the SDA [Democratic Action Party]  for Sandzak, who at that time was outside the country. Although  from the very outset Ugljanin has been mentioned as the main  culprit and was mentioned in connection with the first arrests,  he left the country quite legally. In any case, one group of  members of the Serbian MUP nevertheless arrived in front of his  house to arrest him, that is, to detain him. We will soon learn  whether the state agencies here intentionally gave the  appearance of releasing Ugljanin to leave or this was a mere  coincidence. Those who are very familiar with the situation in  Sandzak believe that it was the former, because in that way they  prevented him from returning to the country.    Sokol Ahmetovic, another of the key people in all of this,  was also outside Yugoslavia when the indictment was brought. He  is charged with organizing the departure of young Muslims for  military training in Turkey. Back in the middle of last year,  BORBA carried the story of one of them who went through that  training, and recently our newsman heard the same story in Rudo.  A young man from the vicinity of Prijepolje, who spent some 40  days in a military camp near Izmir along with 80 other young men  from Sandzak, is in the prison there. According to his account,  a fair number of those were convinced that they were going to  Turkey to work, but once they got there they were compelled by  threats to obey, and all of this was aimed at creating a free  Sandzak to which they would return as military officers.  However, after they returned to the country he and many others  were forced to flee either abroad or to Bosnia, where they  joined the Muslims. And that is how this lad was arrested--in  the attempt to get through to Gorazde or Sarajevo.  <H5>  Showdown With the SDA </H5>   Because both Ugljanin and Ahmetovic are inaccessible to  judicial authorities, Milan Veselinovic, federal deputy of the  SRS [Serbian Radical Party] from Novi Pazar, predicts "that all  the blame will be put on those 25 arrestees, while the main  culprits and ideologues will remain protected and unpunished."  Zoran Jovanovic, chairman of the Novi Pazar Committee of the  SRS, says that the Muslims have created paramilitary units, have  sent their children for military training, so that tomorrow, if  needed, they could fight against the Serbs. At the same time,  the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] in Novi Pazar says in its  news release that "the way in which this case is being treated  is yet another political act that serves to disgrace the Serbian  nation and state."    The SDA for Sandzak sees this entire trial as an attempt to  settle accounts with the Muslim people, but it is most likely  that the trial will also make it easier to attack that party,  which frequently represents itself as the sole legitimate  representative of the Muslims in Sandzak. This can be read  between the lines of the statement by Radmilo Bogdanovic made  recently in Prijepolje:    "The elements have long existed to ban the operation of the  Democratic Action Party. We did not do that, because this would  have been interpreted as a threat to their rights. It would only  have brought us foreign delegations, because Ugljanin has turned  to everyone in the world to say that the `Muslims are  threatened.'"    Numerous defense attorneys have been thinking in precisely  those terms in the statements they have made so far. Thus, Rajko  Danilovic says that "this trial is obviously aimed at a showdown  between the incumbent regime and the SDA, and the possession of  arms is a commonplace in ethnically mixed communities." That is  close to the thinking of Azem Vlasi, who says: "A trial is being  prepared for these citizens because they dared to think about  whether they could do something if necessary to the end of their  own self-defense, that is, defense of their people and the  territory where they live. And the need for defense is not some  function or consequence of a persecution mania, but a part of  our reality. It is hard to believe that there is anyone who is  not thinking about this today even in the situation when the  government is protecting him, but not in this case."    Seven of the arrestees recently wrote to the Serbian justice  minister and said in their letter: "It seems that in our case no  one is in a hurry to hear and prove the truth. Although a year  has already passed, we are still hostages to those who are  hunting fabricated enemies. The proceedings in the  investigation, seeking and bringing in judges from outside,  although there are five judges in the district court in Novi  Pazar, bring us to doubt the objectivity of this court. Do we  have to be tried by some obedient Serb, against all legal and  moral standards?"  <H5>  Unsolved Hijacking </H5>   The upcoming trial in Novi Pazar, whose resumption is  scheduled for 25 May, must nevertheless answer the key question:  Did the arrested Muslims intend to redraw borders by force under  the sponsorship of the SDA, or did they arm themselves for  self-defense? Provided the trial is legal, and not politically  colored.    When we bear in mind the way in which problems are being  solved in our region and the bloody outcome of the Yugoslav war  drama, it will not be easy to distinguish what part was a need  to collect arms for security and what part consisted of  extremist political objectives in order to create the so-called  republic of Sandzak. In the section that borders Bosnia and  Herzegovina, the Muslims have not been living in peace for the  last two or three years. This has been most pronounced in Priboj  and Pljevlja Opstinas. Many people remember two hijackings--17  Muslim inhabitants of the village Sjeverin were taken from a bus  in Mioce, and the same number of Muslims were taken from a train  standing in the Strpci station. Even today, nothing has been  officially solved concerning their fate. Only that recently  suspicion fell on one person for kidnapping them.    So, then, will the weapons and war plans that were found be  sufficient grounds to support the charge that the accused were  really threatening the territorial integrity of a state which  was unable to guarantee them any kind of security? Or will the  trial try to prove that the threat to the Muslims did not evoke  the extremism, but that from the very outset this was a  characteristic of the leading circles in the SDA, in particular  its leader Sulejman Ugljanin, who even before the war in the  former Bosnia and Herzegovina was declaring "We will either die  or be free"?    Like many former leaders of the SDA, Ugljanin is outside  Yugoslavia. The people who will have to continue to live  together in Sandzak or Raska Oblast have remained here.</p>

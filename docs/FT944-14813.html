			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Westminster 'planned illicit housing policies' Westminster Conservative councillors planned an 'illicit' use of housing policies to gentrify marginal wards to win a closely fought election, it was claimed on the second day of public hearings into gerrymandering allegations. Mr Andrew Arden, acting for the objectors who made the original gerrymandering allegations, highlighted a series of confidential documents written by leading councillors on how to win the 1990 local elections. Mr Arden described how the strategy documents 'succinctly' set out an 'illicit' policy to sell council homes in eight marginal wards, based on the assumption that the buyers were more likely to vote Tory. One document circulated in September 1986 by the then leader of the council, Dame Shirley Porter, said: 'What is gentrification? In short, it is ensuring that the right people live in the right areas. The areas are relatively easy to define: target wards identified on the basis of electoral trends and results.' The same document said Tory councillors were commissioning a report from an outside group - PA Cambridge Economic Consultants - which would help 'to define which initiatives are most likely to produce the desired results'. Mr Arden said one of the consultants was briefed by Dame Shirley. Notes of this meeting recorded that the Conservatives' strategy was to 'push Labour voters out of marginal wards' and 'boot out certain categories' of residents. But the consultants' report highlighted the need to maintain the number of homes available for renting. Mr Arden said the Tory councillors found the report 'disappointing'. One confidential document from January 1987 advocated that 'the short-term objective must be to target the marginal wards, and as a matter of utmost urgency, redress the imbalance by encouraging a pattern of tenure which is more likely to translate into Conservative votes'. In his report in January the district auditor, Mr John Magill, found provisionally that Dame Shirley and nine others had wasted Pounds 21m on selling off the homes. These accusations are denied. The hearings continue today.</p>

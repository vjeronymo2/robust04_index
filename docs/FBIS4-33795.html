			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV newscast] </F>   [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has visited a firing range and  agrarian units in Villa Clara Province as part of his continuing  tour of the Central Army region. He was welcomed by Tomas  Cardenas, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC]  in Villa Clara Province.    First, Raul visited the Corralillo farming-military district  and the Central Army firing range. He was briefed on the  program to increase rice production and develop the cattle  industry, fish farms, and reforestation efforts.    Colonel Ciro Gomez Betancourt, chief of the Army Studies  Center, gave a briefing on the results of the training period,  during which the projected maneuvers and exercises were  conducted successfully. This has helped maintain the troops'  high combat-readiness level despite the current shortage of  resources. Raul insisted that every officer and soldier must  realize the cost of every maneuver, exercise, projectile, or any  other military resource, as well as develop self-sufficiency  efforts to guarantee the food demands of the troops.    Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Rolando Ramos, chief of the  agrarian district, told Raul of his goal to plant 34 caballerias  of rice and to become self-sufficient in rice for 1995. He  noted efforts to breed bulls for Army ox teams as well as  efforts on fish farms, which they hope will cover 20 hectares  this year. They hope to produce 30 tons of honey and other  highly priced byproducts through beekeeping, as well as 300 tons  of charcoal from Marabu, which is abundant in this coastal  region.    Raul also visited the Central Army's microjet plantain farm,  in Santo Domingo Municipality. Raul was pleased with the  progress made on land cleared by the soldiers by hand and with  dynamite and irrigated with water from the Alacranes reservoir.  Raul also congratulated farm chief Ariel Pena for the results  attained and asked him to personally report to him on fulfilling  his goal by year's end. The farm workers work hard to remove  weeds, which have multiplied since the May rains.    Raul also visited the (Agrofar) Center, an entity attached  to  the military agrarian union. It supplies seed to FAR farms and  trains personnel and helps with research and ways to replace  imports and increase export resources. Center Director Antonio  Rodriguez gave a briefing on efforts to ensure that the FAR gets  quality seed since 50 percent of the agricultural yield depends  on this. Antonio is the son of well-know researcher Adolfo  Rodriguez, 87, who was a pioneer in agamic seeds research, which  is the cornerstone of a broad movement responsible for the  quality of Cuban agriculture:    [Begin recording] [Castro] The Army will eat the beans it  produces or it will eat no beans at all. Your efforts will not  be lost because they will continue through this bloodline. The  children and grandchildren must be introduced to this affair.    [Adolfo Rodriguez] Yes. I also have grandchildren who will  be here soon enough. The comrades tell me they hope to see a  movement of seeds alone or otherwise we will have nothing to put  on the ground. [end recording]    Raul was also interested in seeing the center's production  section. He praised its leaders and workers and stressed the  need for every agricultural leader to visit this center and  learn from its valuable experience.    [Begin Castro recording] This place is a gem. Let us work  faster toward its completion. [end recording]</p>

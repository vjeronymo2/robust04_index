			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sea sponge soaks up barnacles Barnacles on ships' hulls lead to increased friction and higher fuel consumption, slowing down the vessel and speeding up metal corrosion. On offshore platforms the deposits can cause a destabilising load on the structural members. At present there is no ideal recipe against fouling. But researchers at TNO, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, believe that sea sponges may hold the secret to an environmentally friendly anti-fouling technology. Field and lab tests using 50 different species of sponge from the Caribbean Sea have revealed the sponge's ability to shun barnacles, bi-valves and algae. But the active substances providing the protection are not yet understood. TNO: Netherlands, 3115 694975.</p>

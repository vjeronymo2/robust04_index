			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riyadh, Jan 1, (SPA) -- The custodian of the two  holy mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has approved the new  budget for the fiscal year 1414/1415 H which begins on the 18th  of Rajab 1414 H (corresponding to December 31, 1993) for twelve  months.    The Ministry of Finance and National Economy is therefore  pleased to comment on the current economic position and the  financial program for the coming year. First: The general  financial position:    The fiscal year 1413/1414 has witnessed a noticeable  reduction in the international oil prices, and as the principal  source of the government revenue, oil represents seventy five  percent (75) of the total government income.    This reduction has affected the growth rate of GDP which was  tentatively estimated at 1 percent for 1413/1414 even though it  will be revised as soon as the final data becomes available.  However, if we look at the private sector, the results are  different since its growth rate was estimated at 5.1 percent for  1993.    This growth rate is good and confirms the continued  expansion  of the private sector as well as the continued increase in the  absorptive capacity of the national economy as a result of  investments that took place in recent years.    In this regard, it is worth mentioning that one of the main  reasons for this improvement in the growth of the private sector  was price stability. The consumer price index remained low,  indeed, for the last month of 1993 it was 1.8 percent, in  comparison with the same month of 1992. This is a very low rate  compared to what is prevailing in most countries. Second:  Appropriations for the new fiscal year 1414/1415    1- as a result of a continually weak international oil  market, the revenues and expenditures of the new fiscal year  were estimated at one hundred and sixty thousand million riyals  (SR 160,000,000,000). The size of the new budget is less than  last year's budget by 20 percent. This level of public  expenditure is made to be in line with the expected incomes from  oil for the next year.    2- The appropriation for the ongoing maintenance and  construction projects in the new budget is estimated at forty  three thousand million riyals (SR 43,000,000,000).    3- The development funds will continue to provide loans to  the private sector's activities, which will be seven thousand,  eight hundred and seventy million riyals (7,870,000,000) during  the next fiscal year.</p>

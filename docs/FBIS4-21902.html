			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Coptic Pope Shanudah by 'Abdallah </F> al-Sinnawi; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Sinnawi] What were the motives of the attack  on the al-Muharraq Monastery? [see 22 March Terrorism Report for  report of incident] According to your information, was it an  isolated incident or was it premeditated?    Shanudah: I do not know the motives of those  people; they are in their minds and hearts, and I cannot express  them. But the incident apparently took place as follows: Some  monks were seeing off guests to a microbus outside. The  monastery's door was opened. A terrorist happened to be passing  by in his car. The door was open, the man had a machine gun in  his hand, and the chance was there. He fired his bullets and  killed two monks and some guests. It was merely an opportunity  that he found too good to miss.    Al-Sinnawi: Do you believe that the attack was not  planned?    Shanudah: I believe that it was not planned or  premeditated. No one knew that the monastery's door would be  open at that particular time and that some monks would be out  seeing some guests off. It was merely a chance incident.  [passage omitted]    Al-Sinnawi: When was the last time a monastery was  attacked?    Shanudah: This is the first time in the modern  age. The whole thing means that the attacker had no feelings of  love and was far from right. What was the sin of some monks or  monastery guests? Monks are virtuous, humble worshipers who have  nothing to do with any disputes or rivalries. Why should they  be attacked? But do not forget that the al-Muharraq Monastery  is located in Asyut, which is raging with violence.    Al-Sinnawi: Some people say monasteries and  churches are storing weapons for the decisive time.    Shanudah: What is the decisive time?    Al-Sinnawi: When the prestige of the state is  about to fall and the groups of political Islam come close to  governing.    Shanudah: No. The state's prestige cannot be  lost. Anyway, this is a rumor that has been proved false and  that we have repeatedly denied. If some people are exaggerating  things to the point where they say without thinking that the  monasteries contain weapons arsenals, then my response to them  is clear:    First, our monasteries and churches are open to anyone,  including non-Christians. Our Muslim brothers frequently visit  these places for social and national functions. I say it once  more: You have carte blanche, go see for yourselves whether  there are weapons. [passage omitted]    Al-Sinnawi: After the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, the al- Azhar shaykh called for liberating Jerusalem.  He said that this is the duty of every Muslim. Is there a  possibility of coordinating stances with the office of al-Azhar  shaykh on this issue?    Shanudah: Yes. We call on him to discuss with us  the practical stances for liberating Jerusalem and retrieving  our Islamic and Christian holy shrines. [passage omitted]</p>

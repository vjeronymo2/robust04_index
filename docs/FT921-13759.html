			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Same options still on the line Sir, I note from today's Financial Times that transport secretary Malcolm Rifkind's top priority on railway privatisation is to get the right solution not a rushed one (Parliament and Politics, January 15). As this work started under his predecessor, Paul Channon, in May 1988, and was described as 'urgent' at the time, one wonders just how much longer the government can keep on going round the same four options before accepting that none of them will improve services on the real railway.

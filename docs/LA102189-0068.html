			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY TO BE PROCLAIMED REPUBLIC ON REVOLT ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation Friday providing for Hungary's  first free elections in 42 years and agreed to proclaim Hungary a republic on  Monday -- the anniversary of the 1956 revolution crushed by Soviet tanks.  </P> <P> In a dramatic climax to a week in which numerous measures were adopted to  transform Hungary from a one-party Communist state to a Western-style  democracy, the Parliament voted to declare Oct. 23 a national day of  commemoration.  </P> <P> It also accepted the recommendation of Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth that  Speaker Matyas Szuros declare Hungary a republic from the balcony of Parliament  at noon Monday -- precisely 33 years after the first mass demonstrations for  political reforms that were put down by the Soviet army.  </P> <P> The vote on the electoral law was 286-to-20 with 24 abstentions after extensive  debate on how many candidates should be elected on individual merit and how  many as members of political parties.  </P> <P> In propelling Hungary toward Western-style democracy, the lawmakers also  declared a rehabilitation for all who were declared guilty of political crimes  and interned "in an unlawful manner" between 1945 and 1963.  </P> <P> The legislators asked the government to provide a proposal on paying damages to  those who suffered for their political views. It is estimated that between 1949  and 1953 alone, 1 million people -- more than 10% of the population -- suffered  in some manner because of their political beliefs.  </P> <P> Lawmakers also voted overwhelmingly Friday to disband the dreaded Workers  Militia. The 60,000-strong volunteer armed police force was created after the  1956 uprising by the now-defunct Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, or  Communist Party. Communist reformists dissolved the Socialist Workers Party  earlier this month and created the new Hungarian Socialist Party.  </P> <P> The upcoming elections will be the first free elections since 1947, when the  various political parties were allowed to run candidates.  </P></p>

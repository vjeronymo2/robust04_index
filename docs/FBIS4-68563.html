			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashot Aramyan: "Energy `Today' Energy </F> `Tomorrow.' Four-hour limit--`Ceiling' or `Floor'?"]    [Text] Recently our, shall we say, swimming in luxury, that  is, in electric energy, which has begun to remain in our  apartments not only for the four "scheduled" hours but also  longer, has given people hope for a brighter energy future. In  fact, since in practice the delivery of electricity to the homes  of the population lasts from 0600 to 1600, is it not possible to  increase the schedule for the delivery of electric energy to the  population until at least, say, 1800. Some people say: Why do we  need a schedule now, let them give us more light without any  schedules--and that is all there is to it. But the aspect of a  schedule is important in that only these hours are guaranteed by  the state: Beyond that there might be light and there might  not--and nobody who has received his four hours can complain  about the lack of additional energy supply.    The president of the state concern Armenergo, Mels Akopyan,  for example, does not rule out the possibility that the  surpluses of electric energy that appear will be distributed  unequally among the various localities. For instance, in places  where operational conditions are created for uniform provision  of electric energy to all the buildings for eight hours, some  will receive it for 16 hours, some for 10 hours, and others will  receive only the four hours that are guaranteed anyway. Thus  raising the "ceiling" of the guaranteed quota of electric energy  will probably be disadvantageous for those who have become good  at selling these surpluses. It is clear that the greater the  scheduled supply, the lesser the surpluses and, correspondingly,  the possibilities of various manipulations and machinations.    But there is also the opposite side of the coin. Actually  our  current relative well-being with respect to energy is in fact  extremely tenuous. For example, excessive usage in the gas line  could put an end to this immediately--and we would all be  sitting as we were during the winter with a zero schedule. So  far there are only two scales of differentiated provision of  electric energy to the population: the border regions and the  republic disaster zone receive 25 percent more electric energy  than the quota for the rest, which, incidentally, even here does  not preclude abuses in the localities. Because the quota is  determined centrally and handed down from Yerevan but the  functions of uniform and fair distribution of it are still up to  the local energy departments. For example, in Vanadzor,  according to the local schedule, the people's homes have light  for two out of every five hours (not counting the night hours,  when the electric energy might be turned off altogether). After  we eliminate the six night hours from the 24 hours of the day,  through simple calculations we reach the point where the people  of Vanadzor today have light only four to five hours during the  day time. Even worse, according to operational information, the  state of affairs in Gyumri, whose population so far can have  light for only two hours a day, it sometimes happens, for  example, that it is from 12 midnight until 0200....    "We are running into another danger today," says Mels  Akopyan, "--insolvency or deliberate refusal to pay for electric  energy, on the part of both the enterprises and the population.  According to our predictions, this problem will be aggravated  even more in a month or two, and its peak will come during the  middle of the summer, when it would seem that there should be no  special problems with the provision of electric energy. Based on  this, the following decision has been adopted: for the  appropriate prepayment we can increase the quota of electric  energy released to any rayon of the republic or rayon of the  city of Yerevan. That is, if you show me a receipt saying that  Araratskiy Rayon of the republic has paid for electric energy  for 12, 16, or all 24 hours a day during next month, then its  quota for energy released will be increased correspondingly.  And, conversely, if it continues to underpay, the rayon will be  given the minimum according to the schedule, at best...."    Today changes are taking place in the proportions of the  sources of electric energy as well. While during the winter, as  we recall, the gas ran out a good--or not good--dozen times, and  then all the electric energy produced in the republic came from  organic fuel (mazut) and it placed a heavy burden basically on  the hydraulic resources, now the fact that the republic is  receiving an acceptable amount of the blue fuel has removed some  of the load from the exhausted rivers, and mainly from the  literally exhausted Sevan, although the proportion of  hydroelectric energy in the overall volume of energy produced in  the republic is still fairly large.    Now a couple of words about nuclear energy. Today one can  say  quite simply that the population is faced with one more winter  without a nuclear power plant. Deputy Prime Minister V.  Chitechyan at his recent news conference stated that even when  it is on line the nuclear energy will be used in areas where the  turnover and return on capital are high--so as to recoup costs  of starting up the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant as quickly as  possible, and after that the nuclear energy can help to ease the  energy crisis of the actual population. Which areas are these?  One can make the assumption, say, that the following scenario  will occur: Gas freed up because of the availability of energy  from the "atom" could be transferred to Nairit in order to step  up the production of products that are in great demand abroad.  It would also be possible to give nuclear energy to the complex  of copper-molybdenum mining-enriching combines of the republic  in order at least to increase the extraction of raw material and  then sell it abroad. In a word, there are various possibilities  here. One thing is clear: In this breakdown of things the  immediate energy needs of the population are in one of the last  if not the very last place. Moreover, let us not forget that  nuclear energy can create conditions for saving on water of the  Sevan. In a word, so far the nuclear power plant is clearly not  about us. With the same or greater success we could link our  hopes to a partial solution to the energy crisis with the  startup of the fifth power block of the Razdanskaya GRES [state  hydroelectric power plant], where the problem of financing has  already been solved ($57 million) and at which construction work  is now in full swing. So next year the republic, including the  energy-producing facilities, will have a fifth block of the  hydroelectric power plant with a capacity almost as great as  that of the block of the nuclear power plant--300 megawatts.  Now, in particular, at the second International Energy  Conference in Yerevan, they are working extra hard on the  possibilities of financing the construction of a sixth block of  the Razdanskaya GRES with the same capacity--300 megawatts. So  in any case there are prospects of, if not completely then at  least partially, overcoming the energy crisis in the republic,  but, alas, not until next year.    In conclusion, a couple of words about the organizational  side of the matter. Recently the special-purpose state  enterprise Armenergo was transformed into a state concern. What  brought this about? Mels Akopyan explains this by the need to  improve it and bring it into line with modern requirements for  the structure of the department. In particular, the head of the  enterprise has now been assigned purely management functions,  and the lower levels--greater independence. But here is another  fact that is even more difficult to explain. During the winter a  good share of the property of Armenergo was arbitrarily placed  at the disposal of the Yerevan City Council and, corresponding,  the Yergorelektronet [Yerevan city electric energy network]. Not  only was such a decision not written into any laws, it  reinforces people's impression that it is now possible to do  anything you want to with state property--a circumstance that  does not contribute to good feelings.</p>

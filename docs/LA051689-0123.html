			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS STRIKE PROMPTS CHANGES ON TV  </P> <P> KLCS Channel 58, the TV station owned by the Los Angeles Unified School  District, altered its broadcast schedule in response to the teachers strike  Monday to include more instructional programs that do not require an adult  educator's presence.  </P> <P> The strike also shut down two 52-part educational series that KLCS is producing  -- "Driver Education" and "Educational and Career Planning" -- because six  certificated staff members were called into classrooms to fill in for striking  teachers, said Sabrina Fair Thomas, manager of program scheduling.  </P> <P> KLCS' staff-produced live show "Homework Hotline" (weekdays from 4:30 to 5:30  p.m.), which uses teachers on the air to answer questions called in by  students, will be replaced during the walkout by reruns of previous segments.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in its schedule of instructional programs for elementary and  secondary schools, KLCS was replacing some teacher-dependent shows with PBS  series such as "Newton's Apple," "Wonderworks" and "Reading Rainbow."  </P> <P> "This is relevant programming; it's not designed to baby-sit students," Thomas  said. "These particular programs were selected because of their instructional  value. They allow kids to learn something without direct supervision."  </P> <P> Thomas said the temporary programming schedule is most beneficial to secondary  students whose complex lesson plans are more difficult for interim teachers to  plan.  </P> <P> "We're like a backup," Thomas said. "Normal instruction will still go on. But  in case a person doesn't know how to teach science, they can turn on 'Newton's  Apple' and the class will still learn something."  </P></p>

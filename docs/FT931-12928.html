			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (3): Crooked path to reform - Interview - Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister with responsibility for economic reform, talks to Edward Balls and Chrystia Freeland Question: What are the goals and methods of your economic reform programme? Answer: The goal of the reforms is to stabilise the economy and to create circumstances which will be favourable for its growth. But we are opposed to the view that we should have stabilisation first and then structural reform. The lesson we have drawn from Russia's experience is that a pure monetary approach which looks very good on paper is nearly impossible to implement in an almost entirely monopolised economy. You cannot expect that with a single 'big bang' liberalisation you can initiate all of the necessary structural changes in the economy. For example, one of the most profitable sectors in the economy is metallurgy but these profits are due entirely to its monopoly position. Until we manage to de-monopolise this sector we cannot free prices. Another problem is that there are effectively no owners of state property. Property is controlled by the directors but no-one controls the directors. This has led to very serious abuses. We have seen the slow growth of a very strong alternative economy - an uncontrolled process of free or spontaneous privatisation. Before we can stabilise the economy we must reassume control over the state sector. Q: How will you liberalise the economy and tackle corruption? A: Wherever you have a closed stock company you should look for corruption. So we must commercialise enterprises and transform them into open joint stock companies. We also plan to transform collective farms into open stock companies. The other way that these enterprises will change their form is through bankruptcy. The decision we have taken to liberalise prices and end subsidies will lead to the almost immediate bankruptcy of many collective farms. Most collective farms were very positive about our decision on price liberalisation, especially the good ones because the good farms subsidised the weak farms. The people who are opposed to it are the local bureaucrats because our decisions have restricted their authority considerably. But these days the private garden plots are the main source of food for the cities. They had a rise of 50 per cent in their production last year. Not all of this food reaches the people because the central system of procurement was not interested in using these garden plots as a source of food. The only mechanism which can get food from the countryside to the cities is private small trade and this year we are chiefly interested in small-scale privatisation to encourage this. Already there are small private concerns which drive around the countryside buying food which they then sell in the cities. Q: So why not just push ahead with mass, small-scale privatisation? A: The problem is that many monopolist trading organisations have gone over to a leasing arrangement, thus preventing commercialisation of the trading system. But we plan a decree which gives the state the right to break the leasing arrangement if privatisation occurs. Then we will have established the legal basis for a move forward. But there is another problem. When some government officials talk about the interests of the people they are talking about their personal interests. The private racket takes 10-15 per cent of the profits of the private retail stores but the state racket hands 50 per cent of state store profits to local bureaucrats. Opposition to commercialisation comes from people who have very specific economic interests which they are protecting. So before we can push ahead with commercialisation we have to take much stricter control of state enterprises. Q: Are you going to fire the corrupt regional presidential representatives? A: We cannot fire presidential representatives, only suggest to the President that they should be fired. But today the presidential representatives have a dual subordination (to the president and to the prime minister). What we want is for the whole presidential administration in the regions to be dually responsible as well. If we do not manage to secure this tie between central authorities and regional authorities then our decisions will hang in the air. Q: What is the timetable for capping credit emissions and how long will it take before we see effects on the inflation rate? A: We are now preparing a decree which will limit credit emission to 80 per cent of our inflation targets. We expect a significant slowing of inflation only in March when the government will enact its decision to freeze the average wage and impose high taxes on enterprises which pay higher wages. Q: Can you control inflation and meet the budget targets without western aid? A: I think it is realistic to aim for a budget deficit of 6 per cent of GDP by the end of this year and we think we need to cover about 1 percentage point of this with western aid. There is a danger that if we meet this target then the unemployment rate will rise to 10 per cent, although in our economy there has always been a category I call the working unemployed. What we have to do is find a balance between an acceptable level of unemployment and an acceptable budget deficit. This is a very serious problem for us which can influence the further course of the reforms and we cannot avoid taking it into account. Q: Can you link the decommissioning of nuclear weapons to economic aid? A: No, I do not think that is realistic. A realistic path is to implement serious economic reforms in order to attract foreign investment. No-one is going to invest here when the economic situation is so uncertain. But at the moment we are concerned about getting a rehabilitation loan from the west. Q: How long do you expect to keep your job? A: The government has been granted expanded executive authority for only six months and in this time we can manage to achieve only the first positive changes. Once we start implementing the economic reform programme we are always going to have to be taking corrective actions and we are going to have to change many details of our programme to make it more politically acceptable. But you have to assess our programme not on the written plan but on the actions that are taken. We have a good saying in Ukraine: a crooked path is faster than a straight path if it avoids the bureaucrat. The straight path for us could be very dangerous but this is one of those times when we can take a crooked path. It will be faster.</p>

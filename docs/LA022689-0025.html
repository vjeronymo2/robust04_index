			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: RAY CHARLES' LIFE TO GET THE HOLLYWOOD TREATMENT  </P> <P> Hollywood has rock 'n' roll fever.  </P> <P> Tinseltown has already made "The Buddy Holly Story," immortalized the King  ("This Is Elvis"), documented Chuck Berry's life ("Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll")  and rediscovered Richie Valens ("La Bamba"). This summer Orion Pictures will  celebrate The Killer, with Dennis Quaid starring as Jerry Lee Lewis in "Great  Balls of Fire."  </P> <P> Who's next? A few hints: He's black. He's blind. He's a dynamic keyboardist and  sensual singer who's had dozens of Top 40 hits.  </P> <P> If you guessed Stevie Wonder, you're . . . wrong.  </P> <P> It's none other than Ray Charles. The R&amp;B legend's life and music will be  dramatized in "The Ray Charles Story," a just-announced film project being  produced by rock managers Mark Hartley and Larry Fitzgerald. The film is the  first project due from New Visions Pictures, a new production company headed by  Taylor Hackford, who says his production slate will offer "at least one" music  biography each year. (New Visions has acquired the rights to the life of Linda  Creed, an influential '70s-era black songwriter.)  </P> <P> "I wanted our first New Visions picture to really stand out," explained  Hackford, a pop aficionado who produced "La Bamba" and directed "Hail! Hail!  Rock 'n' Roll." "To me, Ray Charles is the greatest living figure in black  music. His music is the meeting place of R&amp;B, rock, pop, jazz and country  &amp; Western. He's a wonderfully complex character, a guy born into awful  poverty.  </P> <P> "Ray struggled against unbelievable odds to become one of the major pop music  icons of the last four decades. And to me, there's something inherently  dramatic about the distance one travels in American society -- and Ray went all  the way."  </P> <P> Though Charles experienced many traumas along the way, including a period of  heroin addiction, Hackford insists none of the rough spots will be smoothed  over. "We're telling the whole story -- the tragedies and the triumphs. Ray  doesn't want anything covered up."  </P> <P> No writer or director has been chosen yet. But Quincy Jones -- an old Charles  associate -- will be on board as a musical consultant. Hackford says he's  looking for several unknown actors to play Charles at various stages of his  career. As for the music, Hackford says it will probably be a combination of  old material and re-recordings. "I'm certainly not going to re-record Ray's  voice," he said. "No one sounds like him -- and no one ever will."  </P></p>

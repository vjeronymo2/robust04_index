			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Nations pledge more money to help refugees from Yugoslavia GOVERNMENT repres-entatives attending the special 60-nation Geneva conference on the refugee crisis in the former Yugoslavia have pledged more than Dollars 152m (Pounds 79.5m) to help the stricken populations of the region. Mrs Sadako Ogata, United Nations high commissioner for refugees, who had launched the appeal for funds, said it had been a good day for the displaced and distressed people of the former Yugoslavia. She warned the conference that 'if we do not act immediately and forcefully on both political and humanitarian fronts, we may find ourselves stranded with an open-ended relief programme and a massive permanent refugee problem in the heart of Europe.' She said there was an urgent need to prepare for winter, when more than 500,000 people were likely to need shelter. In the coming weeks innovative ideas were required, as well as involvement and support of both agencies and governments. The conference agreed to establish a follow-up committee to study comprehensive solutions to the refugee crisis. More than 2.2m people have been displaced since the Yugoslav crisis began, and a further 850,000 are trapped in besieged areas. Most participants at the conference said they were prepared to keep open their borders to refugees and displaced persons, though no finite numbers were mentioned, Mrs Ogata said. But Baroness Chalker, British overseas aid minister, said Britain was willing to take only special categories, such as orphans, wounded children and people in extreme need. Mrs Ogata said one of the most important elements of a solution agreed by the conference was that refugees should ultimately return to their land of origin and homes. But there was continuing disagreement between most participants and a small group of countries led by Germany about Bonn's proposal that refugee quotas should be fixed country by country to ensure a more equitable distribution of the burden. Britain and France were in the forefront of those opposing such a system, as were the US and the high commissioner herself. While all these countries were against a precise refugee distribution system, the US said Bosnians were now eligible to apply for 'temporary protected status', and France said it was ready to issue temporary entry to victims of the fighting in Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia. Lady Chalker opposed any new temporary refugee classification, stressing that it could form a precedent for individuals fleeing other conflicts throughout the world and lead to an unmanageable flow of such people. There was wide agreement, however, on giving priority to encouraging people to stay as close as possible to their home territories. 'If displaced persons can be helped to remain in safe areas, or relief zones, near to their places of origin, their eventual return home, resettlement and family reunification will be made that much easier,' Lady Chalker said. That view was supported by a large number of participants. But Mrs Ogata and some other delegates warned that carving out enclaves in Bosnia, as distinct from already secure areas in Slovenia and Croatia, could lead to creation of ethnically homogeneous areas - the very result they were trying to avoid. All participants strongly criticised so-called 'ethnic cleansing' practised by Bosnian Serbs. In a trenchant condemnation, Mrs Ogata said 'ethnic cleansing' lay at the very heart of the conflict in Bosnia. 'Displacement seems to be the goal, not just the result of the war, with the motive clearly being ethnic relocation.'</p>

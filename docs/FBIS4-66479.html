			<p>Reactor   <F P=102>   94P60229D Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 18 Apr 94  p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94P60229D </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI)  has begun the `ROSA-AP600' program in which safety experiments  will be conducted for the U.S.'s next generation AP60() light  water reactor. The JAERI, in collaboration with the U.S. Nuclear  Regulatory Commission (NRC) , will conduct experiments  simulating accidents using JAERI' s large-scale test facility  (LSTF) . They will continue for one year to collect the basic  data necessary to meet AP600 design qualifications.    The LSTF can simulate the functions of a pressurized water  reactor (PWR) of 1. 1 millionkW output. The height and position  of the equipment are almost the same as an actual PWR, but the  volume is 1/48 that of an actual PWR. It can examine what  occurs in the reactor at the time of the accident by simulating  the coolant' s flow rates in the reactor.    The UPS. asked the JAERI in 1992 to make safety evaluations  of the AP600 using their high performance LSTF, the world' s  largest such facility. In response to the request, the JAERI  modified the LSTF to conform to the structure of the gravity  injection-type emergency core cooling system (ECCS) of the AP600  and finally began experimenting.    The first experiment conducted on the 14th confirmed that  the  ECCS operated properly to cool down the core by simulating  conditions under which a 2.5 cm diameter hole would develop in a  pipe in the reactor. To collect comprehensive data, one test  per month will be conducted hereafter by simulating conditions  created by damage of much larger scale.</p>

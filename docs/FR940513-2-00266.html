The control number for information collections described in this document is 2535&hyph;0084.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Purpose and Substantive Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 123 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (42 U.S.C. 5318 note) (section 123) authorized the John Heinz Neighborhood Development Program. For Fiscal Year 1994, a total of $5 million has been appropriated for this program under the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 18, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 123(e)(6)(D) permits the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) to use no more than five percent of the funds appropriated for administrative or other expenses in connection with the program. The remaining funds are to be used to match monetary support raised over a one-year grant period from individuals, businesses, and nonprofit or other organizations located within established neighborhood boundaries, and from neighborhood development funding organizations. For purposes of this NOFA the term ``neighborhood development funding organization'' means:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A depository institution, the accounts of which are insured pursuant to the Federal Credit Union Act, and any subsidiary (as such term is defined in section 3(w) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) thereof;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A depository institution holding company and any subsidiary (as such term is defined in section 3(w) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A company at least 75 percent of the common stock of which is owned by one or more insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the program is to support eligible neighborhood development activities using cooperative efforts and monetary contributions from local sources. The Federal funds are incentive funds to promote the development of this concept and encourage neighborhood organizations to become more self-sufficient in their development activities. Not more than 50 percent of the 1994 awards may be to previous grantees in the program; the remaining awards will be made to organizations selected from among new applicants. Applications will be selected for funding on the basis of evaluation criteria that reflect the program purposes and priorities and are contained in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

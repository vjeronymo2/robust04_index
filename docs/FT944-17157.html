			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Leading Article: The decision is Saddam's President Saddam Hussein's decision to move tens of thousands of troops close to Iraq's border with Kuwait is as illogical as it is personally consistent. Iraq's at least partial compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions passed following the Gulf War in 1991 was beginning to soften some western attitudes towards the relaxation of sanctions imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN official in charge of monitoring the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is due to report to the Security Council today on the extent of Baghdad's compliance. The report was thought likely to produce evidence which could have been used by countries such as France and Russia to support Iraq's demands for a softening of sanctions. Instead of capitalising on this trend, the Iraqi leader has chosen to prejudge the Security Council deliberations with a characteristic act of belligerence, which suggests he has learnt nothing from his repeated gross errors of judgment over the past decade and a half. Mr Saddam's intention to provoke a crisis was no bolt from the blue. Mr Hamid Hammadi, Iraq's minister of information, said last week that it would have to find 'other ways' of dealing with the Security Council if it insisted on following the 'oppressive' determination of the US to keep sanctions in place. Regional domination The US attitude has been similarly well signposted. Mr Robert Pelletreau, the US assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, and Mr James Woolsey, the director of the CIA, have both argued strongly against any easing of sanctions. They claim that Iraq still harbours ambitions of regional domination. Mr Pelletreau added: 'Iraq today is not in full compliance with any of the UN Security Council resolutions. It has not even met the basic requirement . . . of formally recognising the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait.' Mr Woolsey additionally asserted that the Iraqi regime was still hiding Scud missiles, chemical weapons and its entire biological weapons programme. Whatever the relative merits of the arguments over the degree of Iraqi compliance with UN resolutions, there can be little dispute that the instincts of the Iraqi leader have not been moderated by his experience during and after the Gulf war. Everything Saddam Hussein does is based on retaining power in Baghdad, and for the past 14 years he has sought to explain away the suffering of his population by first the war with Iran and then by the hostility of the US. Mr Saddam's current military posturing may be as hollow as his threat in 1990 to unleash the 'mother of all battles' against the western allies, but it serves to embellish his role of the embattled Arab leader struggling against an international conspiracy. Humanitarian suffering It also seeks to disguise the fact that the Iraqi regime is solely responsible for the appalling state of the nation. Iraq could tomorrow renounce any territorial claim to Kuwait and, however reluctantly, accept the UN-designated border. It could make quite clear its intention never to use force against its neighbours. Mr Saddam could avail himself of UN security resolution 706 which allows Iraq to sell some oil to relieve humanitarian suffering within Iraq. He has chosen to do none of these things, but instead expects the UN to ease sanctions on the basis of his partial technical compliance with the demolition and future monitoring of weapons of mass destruction. It is difficult to believe that Mr Saddam, for all his ignorance of western political systems, could not have foreseen the reaction to his renewed military threats. It is almost as if he wished sanctions to be retained. In these circumstances he leaves the UN Security Council and the western allies very little choice. Critics may well continue to complain that the US has no coherent longer-term policy for dealing with Iraq, other than maintaining sanctions which have so far failed to bring about a change of political attitude, or a change of regime in Baghdad. The west might well consider doing more to soften the secondary effects of sanctions on countries such as Turkey and Jordan. But in the final analysis the easing of the Iraqi tragedy rests with the regime in Baghdad, and perhaps with those who have the opportunity and courage to bring about its demise.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Search for victory on streets of Madrid THERE was a long queue of elderly people lining up against the police barrier outside Madrid's swanky Palace Hotel, across the street from the parliament building, where despite the close exit polls, the Socialist party was beginning to celebrate an electoral victory. 'Only eight seats ahead?' said Mercedes Garcia, 78, who lives in a retirement home on the outskirts of the city. She had been bussed to the PSOE's end-of-election rally on Friday but took a metro to see the final celebration, if only from a distance. 'Eight seats, that's enough,' said her companion Rosario, white-haired and also wrinkled. 'We've won, we've won, we've beaten the right.' Were they worried that the Partido Popular, PP, would take their pensions away? 'Yes,' they said together. 'The PSOE is our party, it's progress, it's the future.' But last night their concerns were focused elsewhere. 'When is (prime minister) Felipe Gonzalez coming?' Mercedes wanted to know as she crowded against the barrier. 'I'll be here all night waiting to cheer him as he arrives.' But inside the hotel Carmen Garcia Bloise, a veteran member of the PSOE's executive committee and an early arrival to the party, predicted: 'Felipe won't come here for a few hours.' The old ladies' optimism was not matched by party activists inside the hotel, although most expressed relief that there was no immediate outright defeat. 'Yes, of course I am satisfied with the result. The right threw everything at us in the campaign and a fourth term in power, after 11 years in government, is something of a record, isn't it?' said Ms Garcia Bloise, who spent the Franco years working as an accountant for the Peugeot car company in France. Mr Manuel Garanacho, a veteran socialist and a leader of the national woodworkers' union was more cautious. 'Happy? So, so. The PSOE has not got a majority for the working man. It is going to have to team up with the Catalan nationalists and they don't like the strike law that we agreed with the socialist party in the last parliament.' Mr Jose Maria Benegas, the Socialist party's organiser was cautiously confident. 'The results are pretty satisfactory. 'The important thing is that we have won the election,' he concluded.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall STERLING futures contracts fell again yesterday as dealers continued to assume that UK base rates would not fall below 6 per cent in the medium term, writes James Blitz. The sterling market was again swayed by indications that UK monetary policy would remain tight for the forseeable future. In last Tuesday's budget, the UK chancellor said the prospects for economic growth were consistent with the current level of base rates. An unexpected drop in the number of people out of work also consolidated the view that the economy did not need to be stimulated by an easing of policy. In addition, yesterday's trade figures, which showed the UK's visible deficit with non-EC countries widening to Pounds 1.3bn in February, may also have raised concerns about the vulnerability of the pound if base rates are cut again. The June short sterling contract fell 10 basis points to close at 94.12, and the September contract fell 13 basis points to close at 94.26. Both these prices effectively assumed that base rates will remain unchanged for the next 6 months. The fall in the June contract by some 44 basis points since last Tuesday underlined the speed with which assumptions about base rates had been revised. One dealer said the June contract was a good buy from here, because it would easily rise if there is any bad news on the economic front. Cash rates in the sterling money market were more or less unchanged, with 3-month money again closing at 6 1/16 per cent. Euromark futures continued to reflect disappointment that the Bundesbank's Lombard rate had not been cut at last Thursday's council meeting. However, there were hopes that the repo rate - at which the Bundesbank provides weekly funds to commercial banks - might be cut from 8.25 per cent today. The June Euromark contract fell 7 basis points to close at 93.08. At this level it is pricing 3-month money in June at 6.92 per cent, some 89 points below yesterday's closing level. However, according to one dealer, the chances of a cut in the repo rate today are slim. He believed the Bundesbank would prefer to bring call money down from the relatively high level of 8.65 per cent by adding emergency funds. before touching the repo rate.</p>

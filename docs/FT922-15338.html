			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Airline traffic recovers AIR traffic has recovered strongly from depressed Gulf War levels, International Air Transport Association (IATA) data released yesterday showed, Reuter reports from Geneva. IATA said passenger traffic on international scheduled services jumped 46 per cent last month from February 1991, at the height of the Gulf War. IATA, always careful to report the financial difficulties of its 205 member airlines, cautioned that passenger traffic in January-February was only 10 per cent higher than in the same period in 1990. IATA says it will soon be painting an even more gloomy 1991 profit picture than before. It now believes that its members lost more on international scheduled services last year than the Dollars 3.7 billion estimated originally.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Uncertainty strikes tourist trail - Leisure Industry those whose customers are either too poor or too rich to be affected by mortgage rate movements - will be affected by the interest rate rises. Mr Bob Winder, finance director of Abercrombie &amp; Kent Travel, whose customers spend up to Pounds 6,000 each on holidays, said uncertainty would have a bigger effect than any eventual mortgage rate rise. 'The top end of the market tends to be sophisticated and reacts very quickly. It's not that they can't find Pounds 6,000 for a holiday - it's that they don't tend to spend during periods of doubt,' Mr Winder said. Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager of the luxury Inn on the Park in London, said the long-term impact on the hotel's restaurant and banqueting facilities might be severe. 'I always used to think a Europe without frontiers was a good idea,' Spanish-born Mr Pajares said. 'But after what we've been through in the last two years, you wonder if it's the best thing for this country.' At the other end of the scale are companies whose customers have small mortgages or live in council homes and are less affected by rate rises. First Leisure, whose interests include bowling alleys and snooker halls, has proved resilient. Mr John Conlan, its chief executive, said the insecurity arising from yesterday's news might hamper business. 'Interest rates are not the primary negative factor for our customers; it's the fear of unemployment,' he said. Uncertainty is also likely to affect package holidays bookings, as it did in the run-up to this year's general election. Mr Peter Rothwell, marketing director of Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain of travel agents, said winter holiday bookings were already 10 per cent down on last year. Skiing holidays attract a significant number of male under-35s in the south of England, who will suffer badly if mortgages rise. A substantial proportion of the 'winter sun' market is, on the other hand, made up of retired people, with paid-off mortgages and savings, who benefit from rate rises. Mr Bob Tyrrell, chief executive of the Henley Centre research institute, saw bright spots for leisure and other industries: 'There's no doubt that people have been staying at home more. Spending on heat and power have been very buoyant, and we may expect that home videos, the food industry and other home-based activities will be beneficiaries.'</p>

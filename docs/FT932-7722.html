			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late demand again propels Dow to record Wall Street AFTER spending most of the session in a narrow trading range close to opening values, a fresh late burst of program buying lifted US stocks to record highs for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 23.25 ahead at a record 3,523.28, with most of the gain coming in the final few minutes of trading. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 3.02 stronger at 450.59, while the Nasdaq composite was 7.00 higher at 697.43. New York SE volume came to 289.2m shares. The volatility and confusion of Wednesday - when an early 30-point fall in the Dow was turned into a record-breaking 55-point romp in the wake of a bond market rally and a sudden dip in gold prices - gave way to calm and contemplation at yesterday's opening. In spite of the new index highs, investors initially remained uncertain about the outlook, although in the first few minutes of trading it looked as if stocks were heading yet again into record territory. An early 14-point gain, however, quickly disappeared as the institutional buying that opened the day petered out. The day's economic news was not good, helping to keep prices in check. State unemployment claims rose by 7,000 during the second week of May, and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity fell. It was not until the last 15 minutes before the close that stocks took off, lifted by program trading related to today's expiration of stock and stock index futures contracts. Some of the market's recent leaders ran into profit-taking. Hewlett-Packard, in great demand following good earnings news early in the week, receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 87. AT&amp;T, at the forefront of the rally on Wednesday, eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60. Other leading issues built on their gains. Walt Disney added Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 44. Gold shares, which saw heavy selling on Wednesday, were firmer after a small rally in the gold price. Battle Mountain rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 . Citicorp put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 28 3/4 in volume of 4.07m shares on news that Mr Chris Steffen, former chief financial officer of Eastman Kodak, is joining the bank's management team. Canada TORONTO advanced as positive sentiment about Wednesday's Ontario budget and Wall Street's record-breaking run swept most indices higher. 'Banks were better on the fact that they do not get slapped with a heavy tax,' a trader commented. The TSE 300 index ended 20.3 up at 3,831.6 and rises led declines by 392 to 301 after volume of 79.6m shares. The financial services sector climbed 30.6 to 2,930.5.</p>

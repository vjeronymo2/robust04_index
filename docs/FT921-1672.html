			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A case of the jitters in the Tory press - Ballot Box The Tory press has concluded that the Conservatives lost the first week of the election campaign and may well lose the election itself if they do not step up the fight. Some of the comments have been quite sharp. Andrew Neil, the editor of The Sunday Times, wrote a signed editorial in his paper yesterday headed 'Round one to Labour'. It said: 'The Tory performance so far has been dismal. It must now have dawned on the prime minister and even the most complacent of his advisers just what a weak hand they have dealt themselves. They were warned not to go into the election with the present lacklustre team, and especially the present chancellor.' (The Sunday Times has long campaigned against chancellor Lamont.) Other Tory newspapers have come to much the same conclusion, urging John Major to take off the gloves. Old loyalties to Margaret Thatcher are reasserting themselves in The Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Express. There may be a note of panic, too, about the role of the Tory press under a Labour government. The Murdoch group, with its five titles, is vulnerable to Labour's promised attack on concentration of ownership. It would not be unknown for a Murdoch title to switch sides - Murdoch's Scottish Sun has already declared for an independent Scotland and his papers outside Britain have proved politically flexible. In England, only Today has hedged its bets so far. In the Tory party, the panic runs deep. Remember 'wobbly Thursday' in the last general election? The Tories suddenly thought that they might lose and started quarrelling among themselves. It was a false alarm. This time there is rather more justification. If they do lose, the inquest will be horrendous.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Gingrich gives up his Dollars 4.5m book advance 'I am not,' Newt Gingrich proclaimed yesterday, 'a normal politician.' To prove it, the next Speaker of the US House of Representatives announced that he was trading in a Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 2.9m) book advance for a single greenback and the hope that he would earn royalties from whatever he actually writes. In a remarkable letter to fellow Republicans in Congress and in an even more extraordinary press conference in Atlanta, Mr Gingrich, tieless but as combative as ever, asserted that he was taking up his new duties next Wednesday at 'a unique moment in time'. 'You can't just be legal and ethical,' he said, naturally claiming that he had been both, 'but must think about what's good for the country.' Nothing, he went on, could be allowed to weaken the Republican 'contract' to reform America. Although Mr Gingrich said he had not spoken about his book contract with the incoming Senate majority leader, the reality is that Senator Robert Dole pulled the rug from under him in a big way in year-end interviews published yesterday morning. Mr Dole said he 'did not want to pass judgment' on the book deal - and then promptly did. 'It's not too popular around people who talk to me. They think it's a lot of money.' It might also not look too good on the talk shows, the senator suggested, 'when you start cutting programmes that might affect a lot of low-income Americans.' In the week before Christmas, it was announced that Mr Gingrich was about to sign a Dollars 4.5m advance with HarperCollins, which happens to be owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, for two books - To Renew America, which he would write himself, and a political anthology which he would edit. The White House and every Democrat in sight jumped all over the news, charging that he was cashing in before he had even taken office and darkly wondering what it portended for the assorted regulatory matters Mr Murdoch has pending with the government. Mr David Bonior, the Democratic whip, brandished a large imitation cheque made out to Mr Gingrich and signed by the Australian-born media magnate (who later said that he knew nothing about the book contract). Mr Gingrich said he had had five book offers in the million-dollar-plus range, two exceeding Dollars 4m, before settling on HarperCollins. Invoking in rapid order Winston Churchill, the three Kennedy brothers, Vice President Al Gore and the 23 sitting members of the Senate who have written books while on the job, he could not understand he was doing anything unethical or improper. 'We are not rich,' he said, implying that the others did not need the money. Only one Republican - Jack Kemp, the highly moral former housing secretary - had called him with reservations, Mr Gingrich disclosed. He said he finally decided on Thursday morning to forgo jam today and to accept simple royalties tomorrow after talking to his old congressional friend, Bob Walker from Pennsylvania. 'Something you hadn't quite gotten suddenly becomes clear,' Mr Gingrich said. But he dismissed his other critics as 'bitter defenders of the old order' that he was intent on changing.</p>

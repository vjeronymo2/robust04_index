			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar demand estimate reduced DEVELOPMENTS IN the Commonwealth of Independent States have forced Czarnikow, the London trade house, to reduce its forecasts for this year's world sugar production and consumption for the second time. Production for 1991-92 is now estimated at 112.27m tonnes, compared with estimates of 112.86m tonnes and 113m tonnes in made last August and November respectively. The latest figure reflects increased output projections for Thailand, China, Argentina and the EC, but these were more than offset by sharp falls in the CIS (to 6.75m tonnes) and Cuba (to 6.5m tonnes), says Czarnikow in its latest Sugar Review. Consumption is put at 110.89m tonnes, compared with August and November predictions of 112.15m tonnes and 113.14m tonnes. The latest figure has been overshadowed by the CIS, where stocks held by consumers are high, and the picture is further obscured by overseas food aid prospects. Czarnikow now estimates Soviet consumption at 11.2m tonnes. After allowing for unrecorded disappearance, estimated at 600,000 tonnes, the latest figures imply a net addition of 770,000 tonnes to world stocks.</p>

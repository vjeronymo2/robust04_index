			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b. Duty-free entry filed late. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bond principal or surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $100 plus interest on any withheld fees and taxes calculated at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the entry summary was late.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Dutiable entry rejected and refiled late with no withheld duty, fees and taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bond principal or surety shall be charged $100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Dutiable entry filed timely but rejected, refiled late with additional duties, fees and taxes owed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bond principal or surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $100 plus interest calculated on withheld duties, fees and taxes only, calculated at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the withheld duty was late.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Entry summary not filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. If at the time the demand for liquidated damages is issued the entry summary has not been filed, a claim for liquidated damages for non-filing of the entry summary shall be issued. No mitigated amount shall be offered under Option 1. As a prerequisite for mitigation, the principal must file the entry summary and pay estimated duties, fees and taxes or the surety must deposit estimated duties, fees and taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Once the estimated duties, fees and taxes have been paid, a notice of claim for liquidated damages shall be issued for late filing of the entry summary, replacing the earlier notice of claim for non-filing of the entry summary. The late filing claim issued as a result of a non-filing situation shall be cancelled in accordance with the following guidelines once the estimated duties, fees and taxes have been deposited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The bond principal shall be charged an administrative fee of $200 plus interest on the withheld duty at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the entry summary was late. The interest amount shall be rounded up to the next dollar. For purposes of this calculation, the duty amount shall be rounded down to the next dollar.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. When the surety deposits estimated duties, fees and taxes, the surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $200 plus 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day between issuance of the demand on surety and payment of the estimated duties, fees and taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. If no response from the principal or surety is received within 60 days from the date of issuance of the non-filing claim, a claim for liquidated damages for late filing shall be issued to both the principal and surety, but no Option 1 mitigation shall be offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Late filing of statement summaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. If a Customs broker files an entry statement including multiple entry summaries for processing in an untimely manner, the district director may, in his or her discretion, cancel all claims for liquidated damages arising because of the late filing in accordance with the following standard:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The broker shall be charged, as an Option 1 amount, an administrative fee of $500 plus interest on the withheld duty at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the withheld duty was late. The interest amount shall be rounded up to the next dollar. For purposes of this calculation, the withheld duty amount shall be rounded down to the next dollar. For purposes of these mitigation guidelines, the term ``withheld duty'' shall include unpaid duties, merchandise processing fees, harbor maintenance fees and any other taxes or charges due and owing at the time of filing of the entry summary. This mitigation shall be afforded with regard to any first violation by a broker who is responsible for late submission of a statement summary. This mitigation may be afforded with regard to a subsequent violation, based upon the discretion of the district director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Petition for relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. If the broker files a petition for relief which demonstrates that the violation did not occur or occurred as a result of Customs error, all claims arising from the late filing should be cancelled without payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. If the broker files a petition for relief which fails to demonstrate that the violation did not occur or occurred as a result of Customs error, the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of $700 plus interest on any withheld fees and taxes calculated at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the entry statement was late.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Failure to pay Option 1 amount or petition for relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a broker fails to pay the Option 1 amount or fails to petition for relief, Customs shall issue appropriate claims for liquidated damages against all bond principals and sureties and the mitigation guidelines enumerated in paragraph B. above shall be followed. In no case shall the $500 plus interest Option 1 amount afforded to brokers in these cases be afforded to principals or sureties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Suspension of immediate release privileges. If an importer fails to meet his obligations with regard to claims for liquidated damages for late filing of entry summaries, the district director is always empowered to suspend immediate release privileges of the importer. Alternatively, the district director may choose to assess liquidated damages but not offer an Option 1 alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Late payment of estimated duties. Claims for liquidated damages for late payment of estimated duties shall be issued and mitigated as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Notification of liquidated damages incurred; estimated duties not paid. If at the time the demand for liquidated damages is issued the estimated duties, fees and taxes have not been paid, the claim shall be issued on a CF&hyph;5955A citing 19 CFR 113.62(a)(1)(i) and 19 CFR 113.62(k)(4) as the bond conditions violated. No mitigated amount shall be offered under Option 1. As a prerequisite for mitigation, the principal must pay estimated duties, fees and taxes or the surety must deposit estimated duties, fees and taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Notification of liquidated damages incurred; estimated duties paid late; modified CF 5955A. If at the time of issuance of the demand for liquidated damages, estimated duties, fees and taxes have been paid, the Notices of Claim for Liquidated Damages incurred shall be issued on a modified CF&hyph;5955A. The modified form shall specify two options from which the petitioner may choose to resolve the demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  He may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed. By electing this option in lieu of petitioning, he waives his right to file a petition. He may, however, file a supplemental petition, if he does so in accordance with the Customs Regulations and has some new fact or information which merits consideration in accordance with these guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petition for relief. Pursuant to the provisions of 19 CFR 172.11, the bond principal or surety may file a petition for relief. By filing a petition for relief, the petitioner will no longer be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. The district director shall grant full relief when the petitioner demonstrates that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs or financial institution error. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs or financial institution error, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Calculation of Option 1 amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The rally was attended by 'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant  secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [PFLP]; 'Umar al-Shihabi, Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command Political Bureau member;  and representatives from the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front,  the Palestinian Revolutionary Communist Party, the Islamic Jihad  Movement, Hamas, the PFLP, the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, al-Sa'iqah, and Fatah-the Uprising.    The rally was also attended by representatives of the Arab  liberation movements in Syria, Palestinian nationalist figures,  and a large crowd.    Abu-'Ali Mustafa delivered a speech on behalf of the APF at  the rally in which he condemned the unforgivable reprehensible  crime and stressed that the Palestinian people will pursue the  struggle until victory. He said that the crime which spread  from the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque to the Galilee, the Negev,  Gaza, and Nazareth did not come as a surprise to our people.  The evil Zionist enemy commits dozens of crimes against our  Palestinian people daily. He added: Some say that the crime  has come as a result of the rashness of a person in Hebron. We  say that this crime is not the first and will not be the last in  the Zionists history that is replete with crimes and that Israel  is responsible for it.    Abu-'Ali Mustafa added: If the Israeli enemy says that it  was  a psychopath who killed the defenseless people in the Ibrahimi  Mosque, then who are the psychopaths who daily attack the people  of Palestine in Janin, Nabulus, Gaza, and Jerusalem? Is he the  psychopath who attacked al-Aqsa mosque and southern Lebanon? He  said that our people will fight until they attain victory. Our  people will fight with faith and patience in spite of all the  hardships, and Palestine will remain Arab in spite of them, and  we will fight with all that we have, and the intifadah continues  and rages in all places. We pledge to our martyrs that we will  continue to fight until we score victory. [passage omitted]</p>

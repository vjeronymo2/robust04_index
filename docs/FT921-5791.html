			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Budget 92: In search of clues to the elusive 'feel good' factor - Business confidence is hard to create and even harder to define. Unlike inflation and interest rates, the mood of business cannot be precisely measured or lack of it  - can win or lose general elections. With business confidence falling rapidly, time is running out for the government. Economic indicators are unlikely to show any great improvement before the election, so the government is pinning its hopes on fostering an optimistic mood with a tax-cutting Budget on March 10. That may not be as easy as it sounds. Confidence is elusive - hard to create and even harder to define. Unlike inflation and interest rates, the mood of business and consumers cannot be precisely measured and fed into computer models. When the economist John Maynard Keynes used the expression 'animal spirits', he captured the intangible nature of what makes businesspeople tick. Put simply, it is to do with expectations. If entrepreneurs expect good markets they invest and a bandwagon of growth takes off. The Confederation of British Industry has tracked business confidence since 1958 by asking companies whether they are more or less optimistic about prospects than they were three months before and by plotting the difference to give an optimism index. The index reached its lowest point of - 75 in January 1974, a month after the announcement of the three-day week. One of its highest points since 1958 was June 1963 (+53), when Harold Wilson began his 'white-heat-of-technology' general election campaign. The CBI says the most important determinant of general business optimism identified in its survey is the level of orders. Interest rates rank second, with exchange rates and political conditions at home ranked equal third. But what effect can a hot summer, a big sporting success, Big Bang, or the end of a war have on that elusive 'feel good' factor? If you are looking for a consumer-led recovery, events such as a royal birth or a World Cup win are a good thing, says Professor Nigel Nicholson, director of the Centre for Organisational Research at the London Business School. 'But you can only buck the market for so long, and there are always going to be global economic forces at work at the same time,' he adds. Professor Douglas Mc-Williams, economic adviser at the CBI, considers outside factors to be 'surprisingly unimportant' in defining business confidence against the evidence company managers see with their own eyes. A company is confident when it is meeting its budget targets and loses confidence when it falls short, he says. Only in the former instance will a company be inclined to spend in the short term. Similarly, Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser at the Engineering Employers' Federation, points to activity at a micro-level when he defines business confidence. 'There could be a pick-up in business confidence when destocking comes to an end as the end of destocking brings orders for companies back up again,' he says. Activity at a micro-level constitutes the more tangible end of what influences confidence. But what of the other factors beyond company and factory walls that are said to hold sway over confidence? One of the problems of conducting a survey of confidence is that respondents tend to reflect their own hopes in the answers they give to questions about prospects for turnover. Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at merchant bank SG Warburg, believes businesses are influenced by national issues such as whether sterling should be devalued, the level of house repossessions and the general election. 'People who fill in the CBI surveys watch the media as much as anyone else and are going to be influenced as much as anyone else,' he says. Mr Clive Thomson, chief executive of Rentokil, the London-based timber treatment and services business, agrees. 'I think the media influences business confidence a great deal,' he says. 'If you read or see people expressing gloom or despondency it is very difficult to maintain a positive stance.' Mr Richard Brown, co-ordinator of a survey of business confidence carried out by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, believes that when confidence started to rise in the third quarter of last year there was a feeling that the respondents were being 'egged on' by comments the chancellor was making about 'green shoots of recovery'. His critics would call this 'jawboning' - attempting to create a mood by talking the economy up or down, an unlikely way of encouraging growth. As Mr Geoff Unwin, executive chairman of computer consultancy Hoskyns Group, says, confidence has to be based on a sound belief. 'Unfortunately the government has cried 'Wolf' too often - if someone keeps saying that the economy is going to get better next month and it never does, you end up not believing them,' he says. This year an obvious uncertainty affecting confidence is the general election. Mr Paul Droop, an economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, which draws up forecasts of the economy using the Treasury's computer model, says the election is bad for optimism. 'If there is a change in government there could be a change in policy, so no one really knows what to expect.' But it is the uncertainty rather than the outcome that appears to be stifling decisions. Mr Malcolm Blackburn, the managing director of Otter Controls, a thermostat manufacturer in Buxton, Derbyshire, says his company did just as well under Mr Harold Wilson as it did under Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He says that big, one-off events are more likely to influence confidence than changes of governments. 'We felt optimistic about the Common Market in the 1970s because it meant the disappearance of export duties - that was an optimistic period. But the oil price shock worried us because we are a very large user of nylons, which are oil-based.' Mr Gardiner at Warburgs points to the absence on the horizon of any such one-off confidence boosters. He says: 'Looking further into the 1990s, we are going to see eastern Europe opening up - but that is a long way off at the moment.' But if the Budget fails to boost confidence, there could be another saviour for the Conservative party - and the longer the election is delayed the more effective it will be. It is the weather. Mr Unwin is a great believer in the weather. 'People just generally feel better when the weather is better,' he says. 'I think it was a contributory factor to Heath losing the election in February 1974 - it was snowing, it was cold and everybody felt bloody miserable.'</p>

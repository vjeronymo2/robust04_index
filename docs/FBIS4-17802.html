			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- Viktor Yerin, minister of  internal affairs, said at a government session today that he is  ready to tender his resignation "if my resignation is necessary  in the interests of Russia and in the interests of the position  of the government." He stressed he is ready to resign only if  this is in the interests of state "and not in the interests of  certain factions."    Viktor Yerin made this statement in connection with today's  demands voiced in the Duma by deputies. Some Duma politicians  have appraised the murder of their colleague Andrey Ayzderdzis  as proof that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is unable to curb  crime.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: TVS takes another step nearer US ownership THE SALE of TVS to International Family Entertainment took another step forward yesterday. On a show of hands, shareholders of the company, which loses its ITV franchise at the end of this month, passed a resolution to change the company's articles of association which blocked anyone holding more than 10 per cent of the voting rights. The IFE offer is worth about Pounds 43m in shares with a cash alternative of some Pounds 36m.

Mr Julian Treger, of Restructuring Advisers, who speaks for a number of unhappy preference shareholders called yesterday for further negotiations.</p>

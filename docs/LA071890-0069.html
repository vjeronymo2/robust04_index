			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MASTERS NATIONAL CYCLING;  </P> <P> SCHAUB UP ONE NOTCH TO A TITLE  </P> <P> Robert Schaub of San Marcos, who rides for Celo Pacific, used last year's  second-place finish as a motivator and claimed his first U.S. title Tuesday in  the 45-49 time trials at the Masters National Cycling Championships.  </P> <P> Schaub was clocked in 53 minutes 33 seconds for the 40 kilometers. Although it  wasn't as fast as his 53:30 in the Finish Line 40K in Bakerfield earlier this  year, he said he was pleased, considering the wind conditions and competition.  </P> <P> Teruel De Campo of Englewood, Colo., placed second in 56:07.  </P> <P> Following last year's finish, Schaub's motivation increased, and consequently,  his training mileage increased as well. During non-racing weeks, Schaub rides  300 miles in the hills of Fallbrook and on and around Palomar Mountain.  </P> <P> His experience on hills helped him on the course of just under 25 miles, from  the Tijuana toll gate to the Rosarito exit and back. Two weeks ago, Schaub  said, he traveled to Tijuana, rode the course and graphed it out to know where  the inclines, hills and curves were.  </P> <P> "I always go as hard as I can to the turn-around, then use my hill strength on  the way back," Schaub said. "It's usually into the wind, like today. I like  rolling courses like this. I excel where there's rolling terrain on the return.  I rode about 32-35 miles an hour going out and 25-28 coming back because of the  head winds."  </P> <P> After getting to the starting line late, Norm Hoffman of Bakersfield made up  for lost time and won the 50-54 division in 55:23. He was 2:30 ahead of Ralph  Myatt of El Cajon.  </P> <P> "I was tickled to death to win this," Hoffman said. "They were running about  two minutes early, and I went into the bathroom and (a friend) came in and told  me I was up. I came running out of the bathroom, and when I went, I was in the  wrong gears. It gave me such a shot of adrenaline, I just really hammered it  out."  </P> <P> Hoffman holds the world record of 51:49 in the men's 45-49 time trial, set in  1987 in Moriarty, N.M., only a few months after he began competing. Each  September, record attempts are made on the same course, and Hoffman plans to  try for the mark in the men's 50-54 age group at that time.  </P> <P> These accomplishments are pretty amazing coming from someone who just nine  years ago was told he might not walk again. Hoffman was hit by a car while  riding a dirt bike and broke his right leg in eight places, his left leg in two  places and his left arm in two places.  </P> <P> "My (right) leg was shattered like a bag of mush. My doctor was able put the  eight pieces together," Hoffman said. "At first, they thought I'd lose the leg.  Then they weren't sure I'd walk again. I had to learn how to walk all over  again."  </P> <P> Hoffman began riding as a form of rehabilitation and soon found he excelled as  a cyclist. After winning local races, Hoffman was urged by friends to compete  in district races. After winning at that level, he tried nationals. This is his  third national title since beginning racing three years ago.  </P></p>

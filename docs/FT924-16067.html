			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Left wing takes pride in isolation IF THIS year's conference was meant to be an occasion for soul-searching, it is perhaps the left wing of the Labour party that has most to contemplate. Mr Dennis Skinner, the proudly 'working class' MP for Bolsover, lost his place on the ruling national executive committee. Mr Tony Benn, the veteran left-wing MP for Chesterfield, is now isolated on the committee. Hard-left resolutions - on state ownership, Europe, union laws - have been rejected without inflicting even a moment's anxiety on the party leadership, when they reached the agenda at all. The larger trade unions are now most notable for their support of the rightwing leadership. At a fringe meeting of the Campaign group of leftwing supporters and MPs, Mr Skinner made light of his exile from the NEC. There were old-fashioned banners, a chorus of the Red Flag and two standing ovations for Mr Skinner. 'Our people understand that a minor defeat on the NEC is not the be all and end all. You win the real battles on the street,' he said. But who 'our people' are is a legitimate question for a disillusioned leftwinger. They are certainly not the large numbers of constituency members who voted for Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown - bitterly referred to as the 'golden boys' - who replaced Mr Skinner on the executive. Campaign group MPs ignore the code of neat haircuts and well-tailored suits that their ambitious colleagues appear to regard as mandatory. They are not the people who told market researchers that they did not trust Labour on tax and other issues and who Mr John Smith, party leader, is anxious to reassure. Many of the left wing's natural supporters might not even be Labour members  -having been expelled or having resigned during the clampdown in the 1980s. Yet the indefatigable optimism of the left has not diminished. The Campaign group's rally was enthusiastic - as much for reminiscences of the good old times of successful strikes and demonstrations as for what lay ahead. There was standing room only at the back of the hall. In his speech, Mr Benn said events of this week had to be seen in 'historical perspective'. Other long-standing party members said they had been through bad times before, but the cycle had come round. During this bad time, while support among MPs is low, they are looking for new supporters in the party or on its fringes to carry on the work. Some leftwingers find they can work within the system. One is Ms Dawn Primarolo, the MP for Bristol South, who also addressed the rally. She takes over the chair of the Campaign group this autumn, and has just been appointed a shadow health minister. Others, however, almost relish their isolation. Mr Skinner says he prefers the attitude of ordinary, Labour-voting holidaymakers - not party members but Labour voters - who accost him on Blackpool's seafront to tell him to, 'keep up the good work in parliament'. They are unaware of the internal party politics that have set Mr Skinner back this week. As Mr Skinner wanders around the conference hall he takes cheer from delegates who say how sorry they were that he lost his seat. Most say they voted for him. He doesn't ask for proof.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There is again hope of settling the Karabakh  conflict. On Monday talks were held between Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Nagorno-Karabakh with Russia's mediation. Marina Chernukha  reports:    [Chernukha] Open talks were held at the Russian Defense  Ministry. Pavel Grachev insisted on it, in order that, as he  put it, journalists could decide for themselves who is  interested in settling the conflict and who is not. Probably,  this had an affect as the sides agreed on a cease-fire already  from the night of 16-17 May. An interstate group of experts  will be working in Moscow throughout this night so that on  Tuesday the leaders of the delegations could sign a protocol on  a cease-fire and on settling the conflict. After this, as  Grachev reported, on 19 May the protocol will be handed over to  the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan for coordination and to  the Russian president for his approval. Taking into account  that this is the third attempt to settle the conflict with  Russia's mediation, many people expressed doubts regarding its  success. What is needed for it?    After the talks we posed this question to Pavel Grachev:    [Begin Grachev recording] Desire has to come from both  sides,  not from the people, but from the leaders of both sides. I hope  there will be peace. Evidently it is the people who will not  allow fighting. Enough is enough. At this time, in such a part  of the world...you understand that when something is not working  out and after a truce fighting flares up afresh, then somebody  has a wish for and profits from this fighting. But remember  that those who issue commands regarding military actions, they  never take part in a war, they won't even go to the frontline.  They always issue commands from the rear. [end recording]    [Chernukha] Well, probably this time the politicians will  act  more carefully.</p>

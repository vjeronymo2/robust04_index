			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Previous devaluations no guide to present one Sir, Professor Maynard ('Devaluation - a remedy that has not worked in the long run', Letters, September 16) is right to remind us that some devaluations, such as those of the 1970s, have been failures. But conditions in the 1970s were very different from those prevailing now. Excess capacity and unemployment were low so that the flexibility of response to a devaluation in the output of tradeable goods and services was weak. Inflation, after the raw material, oil price and house price booms, was rampant. Real interest rates for borrowers were negative throughout the 1970s, and the benefits of mortgage interest tax relief were amplified by inflation. Unions were powerful and governments were ready to bail out strategic loss-making firms. How circumstances have changed] The risks of a wage-price devaluation spiral can be further reduced by a package of government policies. That includes such possibilities as holding down retail prices by lowering VAT to 15 per cent, paid for by higher income tax, a tax on wage increases (successfully applied in Czechoslovakia) and longer range reforms, including a commitment to regenerating private rental housing. The supply side and not consumer demand must pull the UK out of this recession. That should be the aim of policy. Professor Maynard, like Samuel Brittan, tends to underestimate the domestic demand origins of inflation and overestimates the effects of the exchange rate. That tendency, shared by Mr Nigel Lawson, contributed to the policy errors since 1986 which led to the overheating of the economy and the inflationary boom. This boom, of which I warned from autumn 1986 onwards, is ultimately the major reason for last week's devaluation. It could scarcely be the other way round] Samuel Brittan ('Economic Viewpoint: Devaluation defeat - how '92 differs', September 17) questions the competitiveness indices that were one of the four reasons I gave for claiming that sterling was overvalued. He prefers absolute purchasing power and the UK share of exports. Neither are very reliable. Most economists agree that the purchasing power parity theory is much better supported in its relative than its absolute form. Relative to the 1960s and 1970s, purchasing power indices have very similar profiles to the indices in my chart ('FT, Personal View: Crunch for sterling', September 14). One reason why export share figures are unreliable is that these share figures reflect other forces such as the huge relative rates of growth of Japan, Korea and other newly industrialised countries which led to falls in trade shares elsewhere in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. Japanese inward investment in the 1980s in the UK was a function not only of competitiveness but of the welcoming attitude of the government and of cultural and linguistic factors. Another reason is that, in the 1980s, the share of exports overstates the improvement in the real export performance of UK manufacturing. That is because UK manufacturing became more of an assembly operation, so that the import content of manufactured exports rose sharply. From 1985 to 1991, imports of intermediate goods grew 63 per cent while manufactured imports as a whole grew 39 per cent and exports 27 per cent. John Muellbauer, Nuffield College, Oxford</p>

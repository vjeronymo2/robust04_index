			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Profits rise to 9bn pesos by Telmex disappoints analysts Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest private company, lifted net profits by 4.5 per cent in real terms last year, to 9bn pesos (Dollars 2.9bn). However, the results of the telephone monopoly failed to meet analysts' expectations, largely because of a 250m-peso write-off on obsolete equipment in the fourth quarter. Analysts estimated the company's earnings amounted to about Dollars 1.40 per American depositary receipt for the fourth quarter, and Dollars 5.47 a share for the year, against Dollars 4.84 for 1992. Telmex shares were down slightly in early trading yesterday. A Mexico City analyst said: 'Investors will not be happy with the additional charge.' He said the results would dampen the Mexican Bolsa's current bull run. The company said it installed 867,228 new phone lines during 1993, bringing its total number of lines to 7.62m, a 12.8 per cent jump over 1992. Telmex is replacing Mexico's outdated telephone system with an fibre-optic system in one of the world's largest projects of its type. The company posted net sales worth 24.6bn pesos during 1993, up 10 per cent from 22.4bn pesos in 1992. Operating income amounted to 10.28bn pesos for the year, also up 10 per cent. Analysts said Telmex, owned by Mexican conglomerate Grupo Carso, will need to invest heavily in the next few years to face the opening of long-distance competition in August 1996. Several US-based telecommunications companies have expressed interest in entering the Mexican market. Under the terms of its concession, Telmex remains a monopoly until then.</p>

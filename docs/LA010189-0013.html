			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WAITING FOR CHILDHOOD BY SUMNER LOCKE ELLIOTT (PERENNIAL  LIBRARY/ HARPER &amp; ROW: $7.95)  </P> <P> Set in Australia at the turn of the 20th Century, "Waiting for Childhood" is  the story of seven children left to cope for themselves after their parents  die. Their father, The Rev. William Lord, expires at the breakfast table one  morning. After the family leaves for a ramshackle house owned by a wealthy  cousin, the mother loses her mind and then her life in an accident.  </P> <P> The eldest daughter, Lily, takes charge of the entire household, as Jess  becomes a favorite of her rich cousin Jackie and watches her rival for Jackie's  affections fall fatally from a mountaintop.  </P> <P> These characters, "all talented, all deeply human, (are) all so beautifully  realized that by the end of the novel we identify with them to the point of  heartbreak," Carolyn See wrote in these pages. " 'Waiting for Childhood'  manages to be at once terribly melancholy and extraordinarily exhilarating."  </P></p>

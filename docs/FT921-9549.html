			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: The unembroiling of the broiler market - Hillsdown's plucking of Unigate's chicken wing RARELY CAN a single business deal have pleased everybody in an entire industry as much as yesterday's announcement that Hillsdown Holdings is to relieve Unigate of its deeply troubled JP Wood chicken operations. For Mr Ross Buckland, who joined Unigate as chief executive 15 months ago, the deal is a much-needed opportunity to make good on pledges to improve the dairy group's flagging fortunes by stemming an increasingly heavy drain on profits. For Hillsdown, the acquisition provides the means to discipline a competitor which seemed to be running out of control. And for the rest of the UK poultry industry, it raises hopes of an end to the chronic excess capacity and vicious price-cutting which plunged the market into turmoil. Behind the Wood debacle lies an extraordinary story of over-ambitious expansion, commercial misjudgments and sheer bad luck which began three and a half years ago, when Wood opened the UK's biggest chicken plant in the industrial wasteland near Scunthorpe, on Humberside. The idea behind the Pounds 55m plant was straightforward enough. By using production-line techniques to achieve big scale economies, the plant would drive down unit costs and squeeze less efficient rivals out of the highly fragmented industry. Almost from the outset, the idea proved misconceived. Initial plans had been to export to the Continent most of the planned output of 1m birds a week. But they were soon abandoned after it turned out that Germany was the only sizeable EC country which was a net importer of chickens - and others were already competing hard for its market. When Unigate shifted its sights to the UK, the predictable result was to create a production glut and falling prices in a market where supply totalled about 10m birds a week. The glut was made worse when some competitors responded, not by scaling back capacity, but by expanding it. From that point on, the miseries multiplied. In 1989, the US drought pushed up feed prices, and with them the plant's costs. Then the salmonella scare dented consumption and added still further costs in the form of special government-imposed inspection charges. The final blow was the Gulf war. French poultry producers, which depended heavily on Middle East export markets, diverted large volumes of chicken to the UK. By selling at what the British industry considers ruinously low prices, they captured 15 per cent of the market last year. According to Ministry of Agriculture figures, volumes of poultrymeat production rose last year by 3.7 per cent to a record 1.05m tonnes. However, the value of output slipped Pounds 3m to Pounds 878m. Some critics doubt that the Scunthorpe plant could have been profitable even without so many setbacks, arguing that it was also critically handicapped by inexperienced management and the wrong product mix. Half its current production of 750,000 broilers a week are frozen birds, commodity items which command lower prices than fresh and partially prepared chickens. Unigate considered trying to move the plant upmarket into 'value added' products, such as coated or stuffed chicken. However, that would have brought it into direct conflict with leading customers which supplied such products themselves and who would have responded by cancelling orders. Wood, which also includes two smaller plants in Wales and associated hatcheries, rearing and growing businesses, lost Pounds 6.6m in the year to March 31. Unigate says the rate of loss has since accelerated, and City analysts were recently putting it at Pounds 15m for this year. Small wonder that one of Mr Buckland's first decisions after he moved in at Unigate was to seek a buyer for what has been unkindly dubbed the 'kamikaze chicken' business. Talks with Hillsdown, long considered the only serious candidate, began last summer. Most analysts agree that Hillsdown was obliged to buy Wood if it was to stay in the poultry business. Indeed, some suggest that Unigate may even have kept the operation running at an uneconomically high level of output - and thereby contributing to a general weakness in poultry prices - partly to put pressure on Hillsdown to do a deal. 'It seems to have been, quite literally, a game of chicken,' says one. Hillsdown is estimated by Henderson Crosthwaite, the stockbroking company, to have made a Pounds 12m operating profit on its chicken business in 1990. However, Henderson believes that this turned into a Pounds 8m loss last year despite cuts in production, particularly of frozen birds. Hillsdown needs swiftly to apply its skills at cost-cutting and rationalisation to the merged businesses if it is to avoid a steadily rising stream of red ink. Though it declined to spell out its plans yesterday, they seem certain to include extensive plant closures, though the Scunthorpe facility is expected to survive. Some analysts were suggesting that industry excess capacity is so acute that Hillsdown may need to reduce the merged businesses to not much more than the size of its existing operation, if they are to be profitable. Sir Harry Solomon, Hillsdown chairman, sounded confident yesterday, pointing out that the protracted negotiations on the deal have allowed the company plenty of time to work out exactly what needs to be done. 'We believe this deal will enable us to compete with anyone,' he said. Hillsdown's timing may also be opportune. A recent reduction in broiler chick placings - an important leading indicator - suggests that the chicken cycle may at last be bottoming out, while French producers are said to be re-orienting their export drive back to the Middle East. Longer term, Sir Harry expects demand for chicken to continue developing: 'It's a very cheap food, and the British eat a lot less of it than do the Americans. Of all the markets Hillsdown is in, this is one of the fastest growing.' However, even if yesterday's deal paves the way for a return to more stable market conditions, the chicken industry is likely to remain a relatively low-margin business, increasingly dominated by supermarkets' cut-price private label products. For Hillsdown, more is at stake than just the future of its chicken business. Once a City high-flyer, it has steadily lost popularity there, particularly since a failed rights issue last autumn. The deal offers the company an opportunity to regain favour by demonstrating one of its strongest suits, an ability to turn round troubled acquisitions. The market will doubtless form its own judgment about whether Hillsdown has been right to double its stake in the chicken business - or whether it would have been more prudent to have called it quits.</p>

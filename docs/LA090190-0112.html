			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT AGAINST GOODWILL GAMES OFFICIALS SETTLED OUT OF COURT  </P> <P> Goodwill Games organizers are in imminent danger of going broke, a Carlsbad,  Calif., company contended in documents filed shortly before settling a lawsuit  seeking $800,000 for work at the Olympic-style event.  </P> <P> The settlement was reached Thursday night, hours after lawyers for  International Events Management Ltd. released documents that contended the  Seattle Organizing Committee had underestimated its debt by more than $1.18  million.  </P> <P> Terms of the settlement were withheld.  </P> <P> Jim Greenfield, a lawyer for the organizing committee, would not say whether  the settlement left the group in a stronger financial position than when the  suit was pending.  </P> <P> In financial records released with Thursday's filing in King County Superior  Court, organizers said the committee was $66,000 in the black and had the rest  of the year to raise any additional funds needed.  </P> <P> IEM said the committee's figures were "highly speculative and misleading" and  accused organizers of minimizing outstanding debts and overstating potential  revenues.  </P> <P> The committee is "in imminent danger of insolvency," IEM documents said.  </P> <P> The settlement preempted an IEM move to place the committee in receivership to  ensure that any remaining funds go to creditors.  </P> <P> IEM's Thursday filing said the company had no guarantee of collecting  commissions it claimed for lining up corporate sponsors.  </P> <P> According to the IEM documents:  </P> <P>  -- The Seattle Organizing Committee had to borrow $1 million last spring to  keep the games afloat. The loan from Turner Broadcasting Systems of Atlanta,  the games' corporate parent, remains unpaid.  </P> <P>  -- The committee's claim of solvency depends on Turner waiving a debt of  $300,000, a third of the royalties from souvenir sales. Organizers conceded  they had yet to ask for a waiver.  </P> <P>  -- Tickets sales were $2 million less than the estimated $17.2 million needed  to break even.  </P> <P>  -- The committee's finance director did not know if organizers could pay all  bills now due, and the games' board of directors was advised that more  fund-raising efforts would be needed.  </P> <P> Games officials contend they will end up in the black on their $68.5-million  operating budget. A statement of the committee's finances showed remaining  debts of $4.59 million with revenues of $4.66 million.  </P></p>

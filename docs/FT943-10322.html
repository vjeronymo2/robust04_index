			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Williamson Tea shows advance to Pounds 8.95m Williamson Tea Holdings, which produces tea in India, Kenya and Tanzania, reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 6.22m to Pounds 8.95m on turnover up by Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 39.4m in the year to end-March. The improvement, the directors said, could be attributed mainly to increased profits of the Indian subsidiary, which had settled its dispute with the government of Assam on the quantum of cess on green leaf. In addition, firmer tea prices in the last quarter of the period had led to higher than anticipated profits from the group's overseas subsidiaries. The directors had forecast at the interim stage that full year profits would be no higher than those achieved in 1993. Earnings per share came out at 143.8p (109.74p) and the proposed final dividend of 15p (12.5p) raises the total payment for the year from 22.5p to 25p. The company is ultimately owned by George Williamson Holdings.</p>

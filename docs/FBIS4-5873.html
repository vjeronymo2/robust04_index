			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagoya, April 14 KYODO -- A group of Korean  residents in Japan said Thursday [14 April] they have found a  wartime Japanese Security Ministry document indicating Korean  residents were conscripted to work at a warplane factory in  Nagoya.    The document was seized by the general headquarters of the  allied occupation forces after Japan's surrender in 1945, but  was later returned to Japan. It has been kept in the Diet  library until the group detected it recently.    The group is led by Yu Hwang-su, a senior official of the  Tokyo headquarters of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun).    The group called a news conference at Chongryun's Aichi  Prefectural headquarters and distributed copies of the document  entitled "Thought Quarterly," compiled by the ministry in 1944.    The document says conscription squeezed the income of the  Korean residents so steeply that the despondent laborers at the  warplane engine factory in Nagoya had lost the will to work  hard, the group said.    Security Ministry investigators who probed the factory's  working conditions for 15 days starting February 16, 1944, found  that 24 people, or 36 percent of the 67 korean laborers, failed  to show up to work, according to the document.    Hong Song-chin, the group's secretariat chief and a  Chongryun  official, told reporters, "although we read 100,000 pages of  official documents, this is the first specific name of the  factory we have finally found" where Korean laborers were  conscripted to work.    In a related development, the same group announced it will  launch a nationwide investigation Monday to gather testimonies  from Koreans who were forcibly brought to Japan before or during  World War II.    The probe is also designed to elucidate the truth regarding  the Japanese Government's crackdown on pro-independence Korean  activists and citizens during wartime, it said.    The group said the probe is the nation's first into Korean  residents in Japan who were subjected to conscription or the  clampdown on the pro-independence movement.    It said it will submit its findings to the U.N. Human Rights  Commission in Geneva this August.    Chongryun pollers will visit and distribute questionnaires  to  10,000 households of Koreans who survived the repression or  conscription, it said.    The survey will cover pro-Pyongyang and pro-Seoul Korean  residents, and the group hopes to complete it by the end of May.    The Korean community numbers some 670,000, of which 10  percent are believed to be Koreans forcibly brought to Japan  before or during World War II, and the remaining are their  offspring.    The probe will touch on female laborers or "comfort women,"  who were forced to provide sex for Japanese troops at frontline  military brothels run by the Japanese Imperial Army.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S INVESTMENT IN U.K. SOARING;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: THE JAPANESE SHIFT TO EUROPE IS IN PREPARATION FOR A UNIFIED  MARKET IN '92. BUT THE U.S. IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE NO. 1 INVESTMENT TARGET.  </P> <P> Japanese investment has more than quadrupled in United Kingdom real estate in  the past two years and is also accelerating in other European nations as  investors seek to position themselves for the community's unified market in  1992, a new report shows.  </P> <P> In the first comprehensive survey of Japanese investment in Europe, the report  by the accounting group Clark Kenneth Leventhal found that major institutional  investors, such as life insurance companies, are turning away from the United  States and leading the way into Europe.  </P> <P> Europe offers not only a single market with a gross national product rivaling  America's but also potentially higher rates of return, the study found.  </P> <P> "We were extremely surprised by the acceleration in investment," said Nicholas  E. Young, executive director of Clark Kenneth Leventhal, an association of  independent accounting firms whose members include Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.  of Los Angeles. "I would think it would have to be seen as a rather dramatic  competition to the U.S."  </P> <P> But Jack Rodman, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth  Leventhal &amp; Co., said an informal survey conducted in Tokyo this week  suggests that any retreat by Japanese institutional investors from the U.S.  market would be more than made up by a "staggering" increase in smaller  investors.  </P> <P> The study estimated that cumulative Japanese investment in European real estate  reached $6.4 billion last year, which represents just 12% of the investment in  the United States. Overall direct investment by the Japanese in Europe was  $27.9 billion, or 40% of the U.S. total.  </P> <P> But in the past few years, investment has spiraled rapidly. In the United  Kingdom, which has drawn 61% of the investment in Europe, the cumulative totals  grew to $4.6 billion in 1989 from $2 billion in 1988 and $1.1 billion in 1987.  </P> <P> In a pattern similar to their early U.S. investment, the Japanese have  characteristically purchased "trophy" office buildings in prime London areas  through joint ventures with local partners. The study found that office  buildings accounted for 87% of the investment and that 90% was in London.  Purchases include the old Daily Express building on Fleet Street, Paternoster  Square, County Hall, the Post Office site at St. Martin-le-Grand and the River  Plate House in Finsbury Circus.  </P> <P> In France, two major deals have driven a surge in investment to $1 billion in  1989 from $260 million in 1988. Kowa Real Estate Investment has purchased the  Shell Oil headquarters near the Champs Elysees in a joint venture and agreed to  buy two office buildings over the railway line at Montparnasse.  </P> <P> Although most of the investment has focused on office buildings, recent  Japanese acquisitions have also included a 33% share in one of Paris' largest  shopping malls and the $41.5-million purchase of the Grande Hotel du Cap Ferrat  in the South of France.  </P> <P> Japanese interest in Spain has centered on hotels and resorts. Notable  acquisitions include the Ritz Hotel in Barcelona for a reported $80 million and  the Villa Magna Hotel in Madrid for about $78 million. Those two deals  accounted for the bulk of the total $182 million investment in Spain.  </P> <P> But the study forecast growing interest in Barcelona because of the 1992  Olympics; in Seville, which is hosting the World Exposition, and in the Costa  del Sol, because of the area's warm climate, golf resorts and retirement  communities.  </P> <P> Investment in West Germany accounted for only $66 million in 1989, but Young  said several Japanese banks were seeking to locate in Frankfurt as a  springboard into Eastern Europe. The United Kingdom experience suggests that  the presence of Japanese banks is closely tied to accelerated investment: Their  loans on U.K. property leaped to $6.9 billion in November, 1989, from $99  million in early 1985.  </P> <P> Rodman and Young said Japanese investors have so far preferred the United  Kingdom over other European nations for several reasons: less red tape over  foreign investment, use of the English language and the London financial  market.  </P> <P> But they disagreed on whether Japanese investment in Europe would ever reach  the level of investment in the United States.  </P> <P> "I feel so much of Europe is untapped by the Japanese," Young said. "The  potential of the single European market must be great and extremely promising.  And the Japanese feel comfortable there in the same way they feel comfortable  in the United States. I think they're genuinely liked."  </P> <P> Rodman said some Japanese institutional investors may be turning away from the  United States because they are generally disappointed by the rates of return on  their properties. Many targeted returns of 6% to 9% but have actually realized  average returns of 3%, he said.  </P> <P> In addition, rents have been declining in Los Angeles and office space is  overbuilt in major cities.  </P> <P> In contrast, the office vacancy rate in London is near zero. The United Kingdom  also offers "institutional leases," which provide income security without as  much risk of vacancies. Such leases are typically 25 years long and usually  have five-year reviews of rents, which may only increase.  </P> <P> Still, Rodman said the United States would continue to attract two-thirds of  overseas Japanese investment, much of it fueled by a second wave of smaller  investors who are following the bigger players and reselling their shares to  others in Japan.  </P> <P> "The increase in small investors is just staggering," he said. "Most of their  clients want to be in the U.S. So many Japanese have invested there. It's  harder to enter the European market; there's less property, and you can't  acquire it as readily as in the U.S."  </P> <P> Makio Nishikawa, Los Angeles manager of the real estate finance group for  Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co., agreed that the United States would remain the  top investment choice for most Japanese. He said investors are moving into  Europe because of the integrated market, a desire to diversify portfolios  deemed too heavily skewed toward U.S. assets and a reaction against growing  criticism of Japanese investment in America. But Europe will not replace  America, he said.  </P> <P> "We are still believing in the power of the currency, namely the power of the  U.S. dollar," Nishikawa said.  </P> <P> Rodman predicted that Japanese investment figures would increase again next  year after dropping for the first time in 1989. After meeting with about 30  clients in Tokyo this week, Rodman said the United States could expect 15 to 20  major office developments, continued investment in residential property, golf  courses, retail shopping centers and retirement communities.  </P></p>

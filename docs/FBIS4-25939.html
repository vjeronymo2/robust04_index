			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis": by Zhou Zexin and Huang Pengnian: "Africa </F> Facing New Challenges"]    [Text] Tunis, June 12 (XINHUA) -- The forthcoming summit of  the Organization of African Unity opens Monday [13 June] against  the background of some far-reaching development in Africa.  While the African continent traversed some of the most  difficult times in the last year, it also witnessed moments of  triumph and hope.    The Cairo Declaration adopted by the OAU in June last year  on  the establishment of the mechanism to resolve African disputes  peacefully represented a landmark achievement of the  organization in the political sphere.    The treaty establishing the African Economic Community, that  came into effect last month, was the first step Africa has taken  toward economic integration and it is expected to have a  significant impact on the revitalization of the African economy.    The summit also acquires its special significance as it  comes  in the wake of the first all-race elections in South Africa, and  the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as its president.    Reforms to end apartheid in Pretoria have brought about  world  acceptance and South Africa was formally welcomed as the newest  member of the OAU on May 25.    But there are new challenges that the African continent is  still facing.    Despite the political and economic progress in the past  year,  some African countries are still suffering from war and domestic  disputes.    The conflict in Rwanda has shocked the world by its scale,  brutality and savagery, which is expected to call urgent  attention of the African leaders.    Besides, the accumulated crucial economic and social  problems  are hindering development of the African countries.    Over the recent years, African countries suffered greatly  from the low prices of primary commodities in the international  markets. The 53 OAU member states are struggling with growing  foreign debts, which in 1993 amounted to 302 billion U.S.  dollars, or three times the figure in 1980.    The unfavorable trade balance in 1993 reached as high as 1.6  billion U.S. dollars. In Africa alone, 33 belong to the 47  least developed countries in the world.    Perhaps more devastating are Africa's exploding population,  which now totals nearly 700 million. According to OAU  estimates, at the region's current average annual growth rate of  3.1 percent, Africa's population will reach approximately 1  billion by the year 2005.    In the early years of the decade of the 1990s, the annual  average growth rate of the GDP (gross domestic product) has been  a mere 1.5 percent. This is barely half of the African  population growing the trend of continuing decline in per capita  income and a further slide into poverty in Africa.    It is evident that the most pressing issue is the resolution  of ethnic tension and conflict throughout the African continent.  And the second most important problem is finding ways and means  of combating the rising tide of economic problems.    African conflicts and economic development will top the list  of concern on the agenda of the OAU summit from June 13 to 15.    Given the changing international situation, it has become  increasingly important for African countries to maintain  political stability for the benefit of economic development.    In that light, the issue of assuring security for economic  development will appear to be the main theme of the African  summit.</p>

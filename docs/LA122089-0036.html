			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego Zoo has received one of the largest single donations in its  history, an unexpected $1.1 million gift from the estate of two La Jolla  retirees that has been earmarked for gorilla exhibits now under construction.  </P> <P> John and Opal McDonald, a 92-year-old retired executive from Caterpillar  Tractor Co. of Peoria, Ill, and his 85-year-old wife, had been members of the  San Diego Zoological Society for 15 years, but had never indicated their plans  to make the zoo a beneficiary of their estate, said Patrick O'Reiley, the zoo's  planned-giving director.  </P> <P> The gift, which zoo officials say puts them over the halfway mark in its  $16-million fund-raising drive for the gorilla exhibit, is among the zoo's  largest ever. In 1986, Joan Kroc gave $3.3 million for the zoo's Tiger River  exhibit. In 1987 and 1988, Paul and Ione Harter of Coronado created a  $1.75-million trust for the zoo, then deeded over their $3-million residence as  well.  </P></p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Letter: No long contracts at Hanson Sir, The Lex piece about Trafalgar House (October 10) included a reference to Hanson which suggested that its directors have lengthy contracts. Not so, and it has never been so. If your correspondent had looked at our accounts, he would have seen that there are no contracts of service under which directors of the company are employed by the company or any of its subsidiaries other than contracts expiring, or determinable by the employing company, within one year and without payment of compensation. That has been the case for as long as I can remember. Martin G Taylor, vice-chairman, Hanson, 1 Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7JH</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gediminas Kirkilas, first deputy chairman of the </F> Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party: "The Itch of Early  Elections"]    [Excerpts] Continuing their "best" party traditions, the  nationalists "shook" Lithuania's political world before  Christmas by inviting constituents and other political forces to  early elections.... [passage omitted]    Currently, we have a valid Constitution adopted in a  national  referendum, and its Article 55 states that the Seimas  [parliament] term in office is four years. True, the  Constitution specifies several cases when early Seimas elections  can be held. This could happen if three-fifths of the  legislature could no longer work together, or if three principal  governing institutions -- the Seimas, the government, and the  president -- could not agree among themselves.    We have neither case today. Cooperation among all of these  institutions is quite good. Their conflicts, if any, could be  resolved by the Constitutional Court. Thus, there are no  reasons for holding early elections today. There is nothing  except a great and almost sickly desire of the losers to take  their revenge and return to power. [passage omitted]    What is the purpose of this goal? Is there a desire to  assist the country at this difficult moment with ideas and  constructive proposals on how to continue reform? Do the  nationalists and other political parties seeking early elections  have any great ideas that could lead the state out of a crisis?  Might these parties have many candidates for ministers, prime  ministers, and government officials? However, Lithuanians  already saw their "skills" and assessed them in the 1992 Seimas  elections. Have these political forces evaluated their mistakes  and changed their principles and values within a year? It seems  that they have not! They are continuing to incite people,  increase tension, look for their own people, and so on.    It is obvious that these parties are not rich in intellect.  Why is it necessary to destabilize the situation in the country  again? Maybe, they want our potential economic and political  foreign partners to begin to assess our situation as unstable.  These reasons might force them to hesitate and refrain from  large investments.    Do not the goals of certain political forces coincide with  the aims of those "foreign political forces" which are against  Lithuania's independence? The fact that it is these forces who  often take care of our country's independence by means of words  does not mean that these words conform with their deeds.    If the Lithuanian people approved a four-year term in office  for the Seimas by voting for the Constitution in a referendum,  this is a law that must be observed by all political forces.  New elections will be held in four years (by the way, only  three years are left), while now oppositional parties have  enough time to prepare themselves for the next elections and to  work constructively for Lithuania's benefit, if they seek this  not just by means of words.    I can comfort those who are so fond of elections. After the  adoption of the law on self-governments, Lithuania will hold  elections almost every year: One year we will elect the  president, another year -- the Seimas, and every two years --  self-governments. Thus, we will be able to exercise in politics  each year, and all parties will have work up to their eyes. It  is very important both to constituents and to political parties  to preserve such regularity. Voters will be able to assess more  seriously different parties, their people, and "teams" that  would form the government, and so on. Therefore, the voters'  choice will be less influenced by various coincidences. Parties  will be forced to prepare themselves with greater care,  particularly when selecting their people. In general, politics  will become professional. [passage omitted]    "Thinking objectively," claims political scientist A.  Krupavicius, "there are no arguments for early Seimas elections  today." Then why has this statement been exploited  practically... since the first round of the 1992 Seimas  elections? A. Krupavicius believes that the opposition must  "accustom constituents to the thought of early elections," and  not only to this. Oppositional parties must sustain the  "militant" spirit among their members and supporters, and  encourage themselves continuously that the new elections will be  held soon.... Such tactics allow opposition leaders to keep  silent before their party members concerning the reasons for  defeat in the former elections. In normal democratic countries,  leaders of defeated parties usually resign with honor. We have  the opposite situation -- they have not only refused to resign  but have also raised themselves above others again or promoted  themselves. Only V. Radzvilas, former leader of the liberals,  is a pleasant exception here.    The third reason is that constant talk about early Seimas  elections is a peculiar form of pressure. For example, some  worker who sees the negative developments in his collective may  get frightened, or some higher or lower local official,  incapable of solving human problems or unwilling to do so, may  explain that "elections are not far off, our people will come,  and so on...."

			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALTRANS STUDY FOCUSES ON NEW CAR-POOL LANES  </P> <P> It may look like just another crowded interstate, but a four-mile swath of the  San Diego Freeway running through this community is serving these days as a  sort of laboratory.  </P> <P> The unveiling of the microscope took place Friday.  </P> <P> The California Department of Transportation has installed seven videotape  cameras atop freeway overpasses between Jeffrey Road and Irvine Center Drive  that will be used to study the demeanor of the new set of car-pool lanes that  were opened along the freeway earlier this year.  </P> <P> These car-pool lanes, after all, are anything but typical. Instead of the usual  double-yellow line separating them from the slow-moving masses, the Interstate  405 commuter lanes have a 14-foot-wide buffer of asphalt between them and  general-use lanes.  </P> <P> Caltrans officials are eager to determine if the new car-pool lanes, which are  the first of their kind in the United States, will perform better than the old  ones. The $48,000 worth of videotape cameras and recorders deployed along the  freeway will help with that task, Caltrans officials say.  </P> <P> "What we're going to look at with these cameras is the operational  characteristics of the 14-foot buffer," said Joe El-Harake, commuter lanes  coordinator for Caltrans in Orange County. "Right now, there's no real design  standard for the buffer between the lanes. This is an evolving science. We're  trying to push the limits of design."  </P> <P> The cameras are mounted on freeway overpasses and feed their pictures to  recorders in sealed boxes nearby. Each camera fires off a picture every few  seconds, so when the tapes are played at normal speed the movements of cars are  speeded up. With this time-elapsed video, a two-hour videotape can last three  days before a Caltrans work crew has to install a replacement.  </P> <P> When the tapes are returned to Caltrans district headquarters in Santa Ana,  El-Harake and other officials can monitor the disposition of the car-pool lanes  with a simple TV screen and VCR, watching three hours worth of traffic rush by  in less than half an hour. The tapes also carry the "real time" in minutes, the  date and the location where the pictures were being shot.  </P> <P> By monitoring the videos, officials will learn how the car-pool lanes and their  revolutionary 14-foot buffers perform. They can count the number of people who  risk a ticket by violating the buffer, an offense that carries a $246 fine, and  study how well the car-pool lane performs as traffic slows in the mixed-use  lanes.  </P> <P> Caltrans officials have been studying the pictures delivered by the cameras for  only about a week, and the entire study will continue for another six months.  But it already appears that the 14-foot buffers are a significant improvement  on the old designs, El-Harake said.  </P> <P> There are fewer violations in the new lane. In addition, the buffer appears to  help keep traffic in the car-pool lane moving at a good clip even when the  general-use lanes jam up, he said.  </P> <P> With a normal car-pool lane separated by a narrow yellow line, motorists have a  natural tendency to hit the brakes when they see traffic slow in the other  lanes. But with wide expanse of asphalt separating them from the heavy traffic,  motorists in the Irvine car-pool lanes seem to have less reluctance to ease up  on the gas pedal when traffic slows in the other lanes, El-Harake said.  </P> <P> Moreover, preliminary results show that the wide buffer acts as more of a  deterrent to motorists who might otherwise skip across the double-yellow lines  to sneak into the car-pool lane. As deciphered from the videotapes, the  violation rate on any given day ranged from less than 1% to 1.5%, well below  the current average of 4% on the Costa Mesa Freeway car-pool lanes, which  feature a four-foot buffer along most of their length.  </P> <P> "I think this bigger buffer represents a real mental barrier for most people,"  El-Harake said. "They just don't want to risk crossing something that wide.  They're almost behaving as if they have a physical barrier there."  </P> <P> An offshoot of the improvements, he said, may be reflected by the number of  people using the commuter lanes. The San Diego Freeway's car-pool lanes through  Irvine have managed to pick up a large number of users far more quickly than  did the commuter lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway.  </P> <P> During peak periods, about 1,450 cars an hour are using the Interstate 405  car-pool lanes, which opened in May. The lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway had  only about 800 cars an hour after they were in use a half-year, El-Harake said.  </P> <P> Such results have convinced El-Harake and other commuter lanes specialists at  Caltrans that the wide-buffer car-pool lane is the wave of the future.  </P> <P> Although the larger buffer cannot prevent accidents -- unlike a concrete  barrier -- they are far less expensive, he said. In addition, a concrete  barrier takes up just about as much real estate because of the need for  shoulder space.  </P> <P> While the cameras along the San Diego Freeway are providing authorities with  rolls and rolls of videotape, none of it is being used by law-enforcement  agencies for any purposes, El-Harake said.  </P> <P> But the cameras eventually might play a role in helping to police the freeways.  After the car-pool lane study is completed next year, Caltrans plans to install  microwave equipment at each overpass so the video pictures can be relayed to  monitors in the newly opened Orange County traffic operations center in Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> Authorities then will be able to detect traffic accidents or other problems  much more quickly and dispatch help.  </P></p>

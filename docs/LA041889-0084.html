			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: TAXPAYER PURSE IS CORPORATE GOLD MINE  </P> <P> Government officials predict that the American taxpayer will have to pay for  the vast oil clean-up in Alaska .  </P> <P>  As soon as I opened the door I recognized the man from the federal government.  He had come to the house last fall to ask me to bail out the S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> I told him, "I already gave at the office."  </P> <P> He said, "I'm not asking you to bail out the S&amp;Ls this time, I want you to  contribute to the clean-up in Alaska."  </P> <P> "Why me?"  </P> <P> "You're a taxpayer and we would like every taxpayer to behave responsibly and  help Exxon with this problem."  </P> <P> "But I had nothing to do with the tanker going aground," I protested.  </P> <P> "Each one of us is guilty. It's not our role to point the finger at others when  it comes to an oil spill. We have to leave that to wiser and more experienced  people."  </P> <P> "Such as the captain who was snoozing in his bunk while the third mate steered  the ship."  </P> <P> "Some day we'll get to the bottom of all this. For the moment, the only way to  make restitution is for John Q. Public to dig deep into his pockets and say,  'There but for the grace of God go I.' "  </P> <P> "I have never been to Alaska in my life. I'm tired of bailing out everything  from nuclear power plants to railroads. Someone has to say, 'Enough is enough.'  "  </P> <P> "You don't have the right attitude. The position you should take is, 'OK we  blew it. What can I do to save Exxon management and the stockholders whose  savings are at stake?' "  </P> <P> "I am not going to say that. Every time you come to the house looking for  bailout money you make an appeal to my patriotism."  </P> <P> "There is nothing wrong with a little flag-waving for an American company that  makes a teensy, weensy mistake. Just hand over $10,000 as your share for  cleaning up Alaska. I promise not to bother you again until I figure out how  much you owe me to prevent Third World countries from going bankrupt."  </P> <P> "I don't care about Third World countries going bankrupt."  </P> <P> "It's not them we are worried about. It's the American banks, which loaned them  the money. If you don't come through on this they could all be broke. Are you  willing to take responsibility for the Irving Trust Co. running aground?"  </P> <P> "Of course not," I replied. "But if I keep rescuing all these companies, I'm  not going to have anything left for myself."  </P> <P> "Surely, you jest. You have at least four more bailouts in you. Look, nobody  likes oil spills, but they are inevitable when the situation on board a tanker  is not as sobering as it should be. Your money will be used to clean up the  environment in Alaska once and for all. It will also enable us to study tanker  captains, who are under the weather, and how they behave when they are at sea.  Once we have the answer to this question, the only one left for you to bail out  is the defense company that makes the B-1 bomber."  </P></p>

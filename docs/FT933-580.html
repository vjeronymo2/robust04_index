			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Euromark futures rise THE BETTER performance by the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges led to a small rise in Euromark interest rate futures yesterday, writes James Blitz. Dealers have taken the view that the Russian crisis is calming down. The improved performance by the German currency yesterday raised speculation that the Bundesbank would have a little more opportunity to ease monetary policy. The December contract rose 2 basis points to close at 93.93, while the March contract gained 3 basis points at 94.47. Conditions in the German cash market remained rather tight, however. The central bank did not remove the Paragraph 17 emergency funds which it added on Friday. But call money nevertheless remained around 6.87 per cent yesterday, from the 6.95 per cent seen on Friday. There was little speculation of a variable rate repo in this week's money market operations by the Bundesbank. With call money above the established repo rate level of 6.70 per cent, the central bank could trigger a repo rate rise if it holds an auction on interest rate levels. This is probably not the message that Frankfurt wants to send to the market. The Bank of France disappointed a few players by leaving its intervention rate at 6.75 per cent. There had been a powerful surge in the front-month Pibor contract on Friday and call money came down to 7.15 per cent. A Danish rate cut had also raised hopes of Europe-wide easing. But the December contract was down 6 basis points on the day at 93.71. Sterling interest rate futures received good support after weekend comments from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, in which he gave some support to the view that there would be a rise in UK taxes in this year's budget. Dealers speculate that a tightening in UK fiscal policy would be accompanied by an easing of the monetary reins. The December short sterling contract firmed 2 basis points to finish at 94.43. In the cash market, three-month money came near to 6 per cent for the first time in many months as the approach of the month's end led to heavy demands on cash. A large shortage, forecast by the Bank of England at Pounds 1.6bn at the start of trading, did not help. Once again, the major players were reluctant to offer bills, and there was late assistance of Pounds 340m.</p>

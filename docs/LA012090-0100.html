			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 700 ATTEND RITES FOR MINER SLAIN ON PICKET LINE  </P> <P> More than 700 United Mine Workers members, dressed in camouflage green to  symbolize union solidarity, attended a funeral Friday for a coal miner who was  shot on a picket line.  </P> <P> The miners packed a funeral home chapel to pay their respects to John McCoy,  42, a union miner from Premier who was shot Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> Many of the mourners, who arrived from Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,  Virginia and West Virginia, wore camouflage green, which became a symbol of  union militancy and solidarity during last year's nine-month strike in three  states against Pittston Coal Group.  </P> <P> McCoy's death occurred in a union dispute with Regency Industries Inc. and a  handful of other companies that work in southern West Virginia. McCoy was  employed by a subsidiary of A. T. Massey Coal, the target of a bitter UMW  strike in 1984 and 1985.  </P> <P> McCoy and two other miners were shot as they approached a picket site, and the  assailants are still unknown, state police said. The other two victims were  still in the hospital Friday, officials said.  </P> <P> McCoy's body was taken to a remote cemetery seven miles outside of Welch for a  formal UMW burial. At the site, fellow members placed sprigs of evergreen on  the casket.  </P></p>

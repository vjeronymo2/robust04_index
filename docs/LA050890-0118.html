			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE TV CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The ballot measures: Propositions 108 and 111. The proposals would modify the  state's spending limit, trigger a 9-cents-per-gallon increase in the gasoline  tax phased in over five years and authorize a $1-billion bond issue for mass  transit.  </P> <P> Whose ad?: Yes on Propositions 111 and 108, a campaign headed by Gov. George  Deukmejian and supported by business, labor and professional groups.  </P> <P> Two 30-second spots featuring traffic congestion and the Bay Area earthquake  are scheduled to run for the next two weeks. They began appearing Monday night  in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco-San Jose and Sacramento television  markets. Although there is no well-financed opposition to the two ballot  measures, the television campaign is considered critical to overcoming a  general voter distrust and dislike of tax increases.  </P> <P> Neither advertisement mentions that the passage of Proposition 111 would  trigger a gasoline tax increase. Neither do the TV ads mention that Proposition  111 would raise the state spending limit to allow expenditure of revenue from  the increased gasoline taxes.  </P> <P>  Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer Virginia Ellis.  </P> <P>  Ad: "Experts warn us traffic will double in the next 10 years."  </P> <P> Analysis: Actually, the ad is referring to studies showing that in specific  areas within urban regions, particularly San Diego and Los Angeles, traffic is  expected to double and triple over the next decade. A report by The Road  Information Program (TRIP) released in January found that on a statewide basis  traffic congestion is expected to increase 33% over the next decade.  </P> <P> Ad: "Propositions 111 and 108 raise money for specific projects. . . ."  </P> <P> Analysis: Legislation accompanying the two measures does require the completion  of highway projects already scheduled but unable to be completed because of  lack of funds. However, it still gives the California Transportation Commission  latitude to approve additional highway and mass transit projects within certain  guidelines.  </P> <P> Ad: " . . . Like fixing potholes . . . improving freeways . . . and providing  other ways of getting around."  </P> <P> Analysis: Recents polls show that voters prefer seeing their transportation  dollars spent for highway maintenance and repair rather than new construction.  And a recent Los Angeles Times poll indicated voters were more inclined to  support tax increases for public transit than highways.  </P> <P> Ad: "We have the technology to protect these structures from earthquakes like  the one that hit San Francisco in October. We just don't have the money."  </P> <P> Analysis: Actually, the California Department of Transportation has the  technology to retrofit single-column bridges for earthquake safety, but  officials are still working on the technology to retrofit some multi-column  bridges.  </P></p>

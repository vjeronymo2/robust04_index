			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Once Again, No to Secession"] </F>   [Text] Many tense observers of the Yemeni war do not want  to consider reality. They are ignoring the objective facts that  put this war in its correct perspective and uncover the culprits  who led Yemen to this disaster.    Cards and whims have been confused and the only tune that is  heard is the tune of secession fed by those who urge a halt to  the fighting in order to entrench a dreadful reality as though  the only way to salvage Yemen is to slay and dismember it.    The claim that there is a war between the north and the  south  is not supported by the facts on the ground. On the contrary,  the fasts point out that Yemen, south and north, is waging war  against a misguided group that does not represent the south but  is controlling its fate and imposing on its children a stand  that does not conform to their interests and convictions. A  glance at the names of the military commanders who are leading  the forces that are advancing to defeat the secession confirms  that the vast majority of the south rejects the adventure, or  rather the plot, of secession which seeks to cancel the idea of  unity and obliterate the last hope of restoring factors of Arab  existence in the face of a bigger plot that aims to usurp Arab  land, resources, identity, and history from Arab sovereignty.    In a field count of the southern military commanders who are  waging the battle of defending the honor of belonging to a  unified Yemen, we read the following names: Defense Minister  Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi Mansur, central axis  commander Colonel 'Abdallah 'Ali 'Ulaywah, eastern front  commander Colonel Ahmad Musa'id Husayn, Colonel 'Abdallah  Mansur, Colonel Salim 'Ali Qutun, Colonel Muhammad Tumays,  Colonel Salih Ahmad al-Harithi, Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, and  Colonel Ahmad al-'Akrub. All of these are from the southern  governorates, joined by tribal men from Shabwah and Abyan  governorates. Indeed, some of the military forces that were  fighting within the southern ranks joined the northern forces  when the Socialist Party revealed its intentions and declared  secession.    Does not all this reveal the facts of the Yemeni events and  uncover the falseness of the secession which fell at home before  reinforcements came from abroad?</p>

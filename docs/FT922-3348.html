			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Procordia privatisation advisers appointed THE SWEDISH government will today announce the appointment of Enskilda Securities of Sweden, Goldman Sachs of the US, and SG Warburg of the UK as the financial advisers for the SKr18bn (Dollars 3.13bn) privatisation of Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group. Procordia is due to be privatised this autumn as part of the Swedish centre-right government's substantial privatisation programme. Up to half the offering will be made available to international investors. The state and Volvo, the automotive group and largest industrial company in the country, each owns 42.7 per cent of the voting shares in Procordia. Earlier this year, Volvo announced plans to merge with Procordia, but its proposal was rejected by the Swedish government. The state's stake in Procordia is valued at about SKr18bn at current market prices. Some bankers have expressed doubts over whether it will be able to sell it all in one tranche, given that the Swedish stock market has seen new equity issuance of between SKr10 and SKr12bn a year in recent years. However, the state is understood to be eager to sell its shareholding in one big privatisation. Up to 50 per cent of the shares will be made available to international equity investors, with Goldman Sachs and SG Warburg acting as joint global co-ordinators for the offering. Enskilda will be responsible for the Nordic region. Goldman Sachs will manage the US tranche, SG Warburg will manage the UK tranche, and the rest of the offering in Europe and Asia will be split between the three houses. Volvo and the state recently agreed to a share exchange whereby Volvo would increase its voting stake from 42.7 to 45 per cent ahead of the privatisation.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / TUC urges Pounds 4bn crisis cash for jobs THE government should implement a Pounds 4bn emergency work package to create 200,000 new jobs and 500,000 training and work experience places, the Trades Union Congress urges. Its Budget submission, published today, says job insecurity and unemployment are the most important barriers to a recovery in consumer confidence. The TUC hints at a trade-off between pay restraint and job creation - a controversial signal in view of the TUC's commitment to free collective bargaining. It says that the government's limit of 1.5 per cent pay rises in the public sector will not prevent substantial job losses. 'Instead the government should engage the public-sector employers and unions in discussions to sustain quality services while stabilising living standards and employment,' the submission says. Workfare - people being forced to work for unemployment benefit - is rejected by the TUC but it wants reform of the benefit system to help people back into jobs. It proposes abolishing the 21-hour rule under which unemployed people are refused benefit if they enter a training or education course that takes more than 21 hours a week. Employees' National Insurance Contributions should be increased by about 50p per week to finance temporary work programmes for the long-term unemployed, says Full Employment UK, the independent policy consultancy.</p>

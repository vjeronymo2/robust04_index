			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WEST SCORES 11-1 VICTORY IN ITS OPENER  </P> <P> With many of its players showing little effect from their disappointing loss in  the City Section 4-A Division championship game Wednesday night, Woodland Hills  West pounded out 15 hits Saturday to defeat Encino-Crespi, 11-1, in an American  Legion District 20 game at El Camino Real High.  </P> <P> The game was called after seven innings because of the 10-run rule.  </P> <P> Although the majority of its roster is composed of El Camino Real players,  Woodland Hills West nonetheless rocked four Encino-Crespi pitchers.  </P> <P> "Kids are much more resilient than adults," Woodland Hills Coach Don Hornback  said.  </P> <P> Outfielder Jason Cohen led the way with a single, double, triple and six runs  batted in. Chris Teich added two singles and double for West (1-0).  </P> <P> Left-hander Joey Rosselli (1-0) pitched five innings, allowed two hits, struck  out 10 and walked one.  </P> <P> In other District 20 games:  </P> <P> Woodland Hills East 14, Granada Hills 3 -- Eric Rothman (1-0) threw a  three-hitter, struck out eight and walked three to lead Woodland Hills East in  a game at Taft that was called after seven innings because of the 10-run rule.  </P> <P> Jamie Zeichick was two for four and drove in five runs for East (2-0).  </P> <P> Reseda 9, Agoura 4 -- Jared Baumblatt, Leo Tejada and Tuti Rodriguez each  doubled to key host Reseda's 10-hit attack.  </P> <P> Jesse Yeomans (1-0) and Louis Vanacore combined to limit Agoura (2-1) to eight  hits.  </P> <P> Eagle Rock 6, Studio City 5 -- Eagle Rock pitcher Jason Armanderiz hit a  two-run home run with one out in the bottom of the eighth to help give himself  the win at Eagle Rock.  </P> <P> Armanderiz (1-1) pitched two complete innings of relief and then yielded in the  ninth to Brian Esquival, who earned his first save when he pitched a scoreless  inning after entering with two on and none out.  </P> <P> Eagle Rock is 1-2; Studio City is 0-1.  </P> <P> Chatsworth 5, Las Virgenes 0 -- Chatsworth left-hander Danny Rodriguez struck  out seven and walked three in a seven-inning complete game at Las Virgenes.  </P> <P> Rodriguez (1-0) scattered eight hits.  </P> <P> Camarillo 14, Conejo Valley 11 -- The teams combined for 31 hits, including  eight doubles, at Camarillo.  </P> <P> Camarillo (1-0) led, 6-0, after one inning and never trailed. Ken Knight (four  for four with two doubles) and Jim Tackett (three for four with a double) led  the Camarillo attack.  </P> <P> Sun Valley 11, Panorama City 2 -- Right-hander Raul Torres (1-0) threw a  complete game, and Robert Aros had three hits, including a solo homer in the  sixth, for visiting Sun Valley in its opener.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DISTRICT 16  </P> <P> Lancaster 5, Newhall-Saugus 4 (13 innings) -- Deadlocked 2-2 after 12 innings,  Lancaster and Newhall-Saugus surpassed their previous offensive output with a  high-scoring 13th.  </P> <P> Visiting Newhall-Saugus took a 4-2 lead in the top of the inning and Lancaster  (2-0) answered with three runs in its final at-bat.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Apart from zinc (see above), LME BASE METAL prices remained under pressure, losing ground as traders feared consumers would be discouraged by a firmer dollar. The possibility of a rally in the dollar dampening any bargain hunting interest highlighted the continued fragility of demand from end users still concerned about low levels of industrial growth in the major economies, traders said. Comex COPPER futures extended losses by midsession, with pressure linked to arbitrage trading with London, analysts said. Losses were limited when the Comex December contract held support above 110.50 cents a lb, which is seen as a major support area. One analyst said sluggish economies around the world presented a bearish demand outlook for copper, particularly through the fourth quarter. London COCOA prices regained some of this week's losses, with dealers citing good trade and industry buying. The market had absorbed some heavy fund and commission house selling recently, which looked good for the market, one trader said. But if any news came out saying crops might be alright, 'it could collapse like a pack of cards.' Compiled from Reuters</p>

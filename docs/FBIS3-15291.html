			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from "SIBIRYAKI" newspaper feature] </F>   [Text] The Buryat Supreme Soviet has unanimously adopted  the republic's new Constitution by a roll-call vote.    According to the provisions of the Fundamental Law Buryatia  is henceforth a sovereign democratic rule-of-law state within  the Russian Federation. And the relations of its organs of  power with the federal authorities are built on a  constitutional-treaty basis. The new system for Buryatia's  state structure provides for the post of president, who is the  head of the republic and its executive power, and also for the  existence of a parliament -- the People's Khural -- as a  representative and legislative organ.    Before elections to the new organs of power in accordance  with transitional provisions the powers of the republic's  existing Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers are retained.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Acclaim greets Schneider chief freed from jail 'I am very, very happy to be here today,' Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, head of France's Groupe Schneider, told a packed shareholders' meeting yesterday in the Automobile Club in Paris's Place de la Concorde. It is safe to assume he meant what he said. Two weeks ago, the head of the electrical engineering group found himself in rather different circumstances  -an inmate in Brussels' Forest prison, facing charges of fraud relating to two Belgian subsidiaries. Last week, after 12 days in prison, he was released on bail of FFr2.5m (Pounds 290,000). However, Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman being investigated on the same charges as Mr Pineau-Valencienne, is still held after an appeal yesterday for his release was rejected by Belgian judicial authorities. If Mr Pineau-Valencienne had been expecting a difficult reception because of the Belgian investigation, he would have been pleasantly surprised. A round of applause greeted his arrival on stage, while shareholders expressed support for their chairman. The reception was less warm for one Belgian minority shareholder, who was booed after his complaint about a lack of information concerning offshore companies in the group. For his part, Mr Pineau-Valencienne sought to reassure investors that the group would not be damaged by the affair and sought to rebuff the allegations of the Belgian prosecution. Mr Pineau-Valencienne denied that Schneider had acted against the interests of minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, the two financial subsidiaries at the centre of the investigation. He also rejected charges that dividends paid by offshore companies had not been distributed equally among shareholders in the subsidiaries and denied that funds totalling BFr3bn (Pounds 580m) had been diverted from the two companies to the benefit of their parent company. The Schneider chairman told his audience that he was appointing an outside auditor with a view to clearing himself and the group of the charges. Mr Pineau-Valencienne said he had travelled voluntarily to Brussels on May 26 to make a statement about the case. He said the group would press ahead with its strategy of expanding its core electrical engineering businesses. The stock market responded positively. Schneider shares, which have lost 16 per cent of their value since the company chairman's unfortunate Belgian journey, bucked the trend in the depressed Paris bourse and rose 2.3 per cent to close at FFr356.9.</p>

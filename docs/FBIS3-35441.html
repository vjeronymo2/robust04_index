			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Tension in U.S.-Russian Ties"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Justice Department officials said yesterday  that they have arrested a key official of the CIA and his wife  on the charge of espionage in favor of the former Soviet Union  and also Russia. They described it as one of the greatest  events in spying operations so far.    In the wake of the disclosure of this news, U.S. President  Bill Clinton announced that he has ordered an enquiry and  investigation in order to speedily clarify the details of such  an event.    The subject of espionage and the reason why Russia and  America, under the conditions when the Cold War has already  ended, are trying to get informed of one another's secrets, have  drawn the attention of the world people.    At the end of the Cold War the heads of the CIA and the  Russian intelligence organization, KGB, in their speeches, had  dismissed continuation of the past policies that arose from  mutual distrust and proposed cooperation in various fields. But  facts now show that both countries still lack trust toward the  other. For this reason they continue to make use of their spy  organizations for acquiring secret information on the actions  and decisions adopted by the opposing country.    America is now trying to acquire precise information on  Russian policies in various parts of the world, especially in  the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union and  possibly to create grounds for its political influence in them.  In this regard one may refer to the murder of a CIA official in  Georgia last year. That event roused Moscow's anger, vis-a-vis  America.    It appears that spying measures of America, in order to  penetrate Russia and the newly-independent republics, have led  to the fact that Russia's spy organization too pursues its  operations to counter the rival's designs. However, it often  happens that spy organizations, based on their facilities,  penetrate sensitive administrative and intelligence centers of  the opposing country. Of course such an act, based on  undermining the prestige of one of these two states, may bring  sharp reactions in its wake.    In connection with the disclosure of the recent spying  episode, it appears that Mr. Clinton is extremely wrathful and  it is probable that he may adopt fresh decisions on U.S.-Russian  diplomatic ties. Inflection of this blow on the Clinton  Administration will compel Washington to have a closer survey of  the rulers in Moscow and to adopt caution in its ties. But  despite this one cannot stress the point that America will also  reassess its policies on supporting the reformists and checking  the ultra-nationalists. This is because in such case America  will have to ready itself for return to the Cold War era and  intense rivalry between the CIA and the KGB.</p>

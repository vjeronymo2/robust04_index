Under a four-level supervisory and report-back system,  thousands of agencies will be created within all levels of  administrations to enforce labour laws and regulations. The  agencies will be set up within counties, cities with prefecture  status, provinces and central government.    The move is the latest effort by the state to help build a  healthy labour market while protecting the legal rights of  workers, according to the Labour Ministry.    Lawmakers at the second session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] have reported many cases of labour  rights abuses. They have also expressed discontent over the  labour ministry's apparent inability to act on these cases.    In a written report, the ministry said the authorities were  to launch a nationwide campaign to check the widespread  violation of labour regulations by employers at the township [as  published] and at privately-run and foreign-funded firms. The  ministry said it would mobilise workers to report abuses.    Labour sources said the Labour Ministry, anticipating the  labour-related concerns of NPC delegates, only worked out these  measures late last month.    The ministry has issued an urgent notice to labour  departments across the country, directing the four levels of the  government to set up labour agencies that would form a national  network to oversee labour issues.    The ministry also urged local agencies to set up hotlines,  letter boxes and information offices to receive complaints on  labour rights abuses.    The notice said the labour departments should publicly  campaign to inform the workers about their rights and the  government services available to them.    The ministry has also assured workers they would have a  freer  hand in dealing with their employers, especially in negotiating  for collective bargaining agreements. Such rights would be  enshrined in the country's first labour law.    Under the proposed law, for the first time, trades unions  would be allowed to deal with employers on behalf of their  members on matters of salary, working conditions, welfare and  other concerns. And, also for the first time in China, the law  gives employers the right to get rid of staff to cut losses,  subject to approval by trades unions or the majority of the  employees.    The ministry's report said the labour law was aimed at  maintaining harmony between employers and their workers in a  socialist market economy while preventing abuses of labour  rights.</p>

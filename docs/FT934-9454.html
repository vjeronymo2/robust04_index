			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers dull There was further depressing news in the food retail sector as Smith New Court, the stockbroker, reduced profits forecasts for the leading supermarket groups. In a major review of the market, Smith went further down the negative track than any other broker so far in suggesting that the sector will see virtually nil earnings growth in the 1994-95 financial year. The house, which blamed the recent round of price competition for its move, was previously looking for earnings growth of 7 to 8 per cent. Supermarket shares steadied yesterday, although dealers said this was only a temporary halt, with few signs of buying around. Of the leaders, brisk trading saw Argyll Group stay at 257p with 10m dealt, J. Sainsbury added 2 1/2 at 368 1/2 p in volume of 6.4m, and Tesco slipped 2 to 184p in turnover of 7.1m. A downgrade from Cazenove on First Leisure was said to be responsible for the shares tumbling 20 to 257p. The broker, which has a policy of not commenting on market rumours, was said to have cut its forecast from Pounds 38m to Pounds 36m. The market range is Pounds 38m to Pounds 41m. Forte outshone the market for a second session, with reports of management changes at the Savoy Group possibly responsible. Forte has a majority of shares in the hotel group but a minority of the votes. Forte gained 5 at 224p and Savoy held at 790p. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries rose 13 to 491p as the end of the tobacco price war in the US was marked by a price rise from RJR Nabisco. Its subsidiary RJ Reynolds Tobacco raised cigarette prices to wholesalers by 40 cents a pack. Conglomerate Hanson, which generates much of its profits in the US, was helped by a rise in the US stock market and also by buying of call options, derivatives which give investors the right to buy shares at a fixed price and date and usually indicate confidence that the share price is set to rise. The shares put on 5 1/4 at 275 1/2 p. High street bank National Westminster recovered 8 to 547p in spite of an announcement that Ulster Bank, its Belfast-based subsidiary, was cutting variable loan rates in the Republic of Ireland, including mortgages, by  1/2 percentage point to 7.75 per cent. Drugs group Fisons was weak in a generally stronger sector on consideration of the company's announcement that it had suspended its West Midlands sales manager following allegations of unethical sales practices. Analysts said press allegations that some Fisons salesmen had tried to bribe doctors into prescribing its asthma drug Tilade had only added to the problems of a group already struggling with a weak product pipeline. The shares closed 4 off at 143p, with some additional pressure said to have come from the first half of a large bed and breakfast trade, a deal in which shares are sold just before the close of trading and bought back first thing the next day in order to establish a tax loss. Elsewhere, Glaxo added 6 at 659p, Wellcome rose 8 to 685p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' rebounded 13 1/2 to 409p. In spite of further falls in the price of Brent crude, British Petroleum gained 8 at 360p on heavy turnover of more than 14m shares. Analysts said UK institutions who had been left increasingly underweight of the stock because of persistent US buying had taken the opportunity of a dip in the price to pick up stock. Shell Transport rose 4 to 724p ahead of third-quarter figures due tomorrow. Pittencrieff, the oil and gas group, climbed 18 to 454p as the company announced it had agreed to acquire an additional 24.8 per cent working interest in the Patricia gas field in Alberta, Canada, and adjoining assets for CDollars 6.75m. The share price of FII, the diversified manufacturer, plunged 61 to 280p after the company warned that forthcoming profits would be significantly lower. A profits warning also hit International Foods. The shares fell 19 to 35p after the company said a downturn in European and UK business and delays in some big contracts meant that profits for this year would be 'substantially below market estimates'.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Your spouse to the rescue  -In A Nutshell Many small business owners depend on a supportive wife or husband. Recognition of the important role a spouse can play in business success has come with the launch of a pilot European Community scheme entitled Spouses in Businesses. Experimental courses will be run this month in Britain, by Gloucestershire Training and Enterprise Council, and in Denmark. The results of the two schemes will be compared for possible extension of the programme to other EC countries. Spouses will be taught the basics of financial control, sales and marketing and leadership skills and given guidance on legal issues and dealing with accountants. The course will also advise on the interpersonal skills needed by working couples. Twelve people have been selected to take part in the first, free, course. Gloucestershire TEC, Conway House, 33-35 Worcester Street, Gloucester GL1 3AJ. Tel. 0452 524488.</p>

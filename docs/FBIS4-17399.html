			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Belan Khamchiyev, the permanent  representative of the Ingush Republic under the Russian  president, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the latest  events on the border of the two republics once again prove that  the Ossetian side is aiming for mass bloodshed. According to  him, North Ossetia is shutting off all prospects for the  negotiation process.    In the situation that has emerged, Khamchiyev believes the  entire responsibility for the failure of the latest round of  negotiations between the leaders of the two republics rests upon  the top leaders of North Ossetia and Russia. Given that all  possible means for a peaceful settlement have been virtually  exhausted, it is expedient at the next sitting of the Federation  Council to consider the question of introducing amendments to  the Russian president's decree on introducing a state of  emergency and to introduce direct federal rule on the territory  of Prigorodnyy Rayon.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: MidCap index Head to head competition among London's futures and options exchanges is the exception rather than the rule. But the London International Financial Futures Exchange and OMLX, a competing exchange, are poised to launch rival futures on the FT-SE Mid 250 index. The timing could hardly be better. The MidCap has roundly outperformed the FT-SE 100 index since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism, rising by 15 per cent in the last two months alone. While enthusiasm for second line stocks continues, fund managers will doubtless welcome instruments which help them manage risk. Less clear is whether there is sufficient demand to support two thriving contracts. There must be a danger that two relatively illiquid products will result, in which case fund managers would stand back. That would start a game of chicken between the exchanges until one or other decided to cut its losses. The more desirable outcome is that a front runner emerges quickly and benefits from a virtuous circle in which liquidity generates interest of its own. Whichever exchange comes out on top, though, users have the opportunity to decide. By launching its contract at the end of next week, OMLX will be first on to the market. Against that, Liffe's established FT-SE 100 future could give it the edge. The further question is whether interest in second line stocks is sufficient to support a liquid future right through the cycle. Experience suggests fund managers will turn their attention back to the FT-SE 100 index after the economy has turned.</p>

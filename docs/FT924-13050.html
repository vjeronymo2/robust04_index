			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Japanese banks The Japanese authorities have good reason to study the 1974 British secondary banking crisis. As with Britain's property collapse then, it is Japan's smaller banks which are first in the firing line. Yesterday Ugo and Akita Akebono banks merged after a slump in Akita's profits. More mergers are sure to follow, particularly among weaker trust and regional banks. The government's reluctance to finance a bailout is understandable given public opposition. Yet it seems unlikely the private sector lifeboat under construction will prove equal to the task. Even by reasonably conservative estimates, the banks have Y30,000bn (Pounds 148bn) of bad property loans. They cannot afford to write off that amount over the next few years. Perhaps tax relief may be given on bad loans put into the lifeboat, and the Bank of Japan may indirectly make money available at preferential rates. This would help, but only rapid economic growth or a strong stock market would generate the profits banks need to repair the damage. Neither is likely. The economy is still in trouble as yesterday's industrial production figures underline, and August's economic package may be of limited help. It may take the imminent prospect of bank failures to break the consensus against government intervention.</p>

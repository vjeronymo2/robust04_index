			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday at the house of government President Askar  Akayev met heads of oblast, rayon, and town administrations.  They discussed economic problems and hardships on the way to  the market. In particular, the report presented by Akayev spoke  about the poorly thought-out mechanism of settling payments  between the branches of industry and enterprises. This  negatively affects production and brings about a stop to work in  plants and factories. Special attention was paid by Akayev and  those who spoke during the discussion to agricultural issues.  It was noted that owing to a timely allocation of a soft loan  by the government, the spring field works were done in time.  The fodder procurement campaign also began timely and in an  organized way. Preparation for harvesting is in progress. The  participants of the meeting outlined a number of concrete  measures to improve work of the industry and agriculture.</p>

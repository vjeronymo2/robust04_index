In an interview with AL-AHRAM that will be published  tomorrow, Friday, Dr. Sidqi affirmed that the president is keen  to observe the strategic factor in the development of Sinai.    He noted that, over the next few days, the president will  meet with the executive leadership to discuss the possible  impact of the GATT agreement on the Egyptian economy.    The prime minister affirmed that the government will  intensify its administrative reform efforts in the coming years.  He explained that this reform means that negligent persons and  those who cause a drop in production will be deprived of  incentives.    Sidqi said that the state will make an effort to decide  annual wage increases to cope with inflation, although its rates  dropped to 9.4 percent last December. He explained that wage  increases will be stipulated in a law that will be issued in  mid- or late June, when the state budget is prepared.    Sidqi affirmed that opening the economy makes it easier to  exchange products. He said that imports are necessary to export  the surplus in Egyptian products. He explained that the customs  tariffs were decreased to be in line with world policies.    The prime minister affirmed that the state does not overlook  corruption. Every single case of corruption is reported and  followed up, regardless of the status of those involved in it,  he stressed.    Touching on the issue of unemployment, the prime minister  said that the only solution is to expand production to provide  job opportunities. He noted that the private sector offers  increasing job opportunities for youth.    Responding to a question on government extravagance, Sidqi  told AL-AHRAM that spending is conducted within the limits of  the ministries' tasks and functions and the heavy burden the  state shoulders in the services sector.    Commenting on the terrorism phenomenon, Sidqi said that the  government is serious about its quest to obliterate this  phenomenon and that it has allocated large funds for the  development of shanty towns. Irrefutable evidence recently  proved that the terrorists have connections with foreign  elements, he said. He emphasized that dialogue does not work  against terrorism committed by persons with criminal  inclinations who are incited by local or foreign elements. I  have to protect society against anyone who carries a machine gun  or a pistol, he said.</p>

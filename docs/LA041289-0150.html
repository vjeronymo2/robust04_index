			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SINKS SHOT;  </P> <P> BUSH PRAISES U OF M TEAM  </P> <P> President Bush saluted University of Michigan's 1989 NCAA championship  basketball team as "America's sports heroes" today -- and then upheld his own  athletic reputation by sinking a crowd-pleasing foul shot.  </P> <P> Bush, who played first base on Yale's 1948 baseball team, stepped to the  free-throw line of an impromptu basketball court in the Rose Garden, said  nervously, "I'm going to live with this the rest of my life" and lofted the  ball toward the hoop.  </P> <P> The ball rolled half way around the rim before it dropped through to cheers  from the White House gathering, which included Michigan's congressional  delegation, Vice President Dan Quayle and members of three area high school  basketball teams.  </P> <P> Moments earlier, Michigan's Rumeal Robinson, who tossed in the winning free  throws against Seton Hall in the college championship game April 3, showed Bush  the preferred way when he swished his shot.  </P> <P> The President described the Wolverines as a blend of "shooting, intelligence  and character."  </P></p>

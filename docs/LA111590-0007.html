			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARITY WATCH;  </P> <P> FOOD FOR THOUGHT  </P> <P> The notion is nothing if not novel and visceral. But it may help others better  understand the pervasiveness and dimensions of world hunger.  </P> <P> Tonight in Hollywood 200 movie stars and celebrities will pay $150 each to  attend a fancy banquet. And not so fancy. Only a few will get to dine on the  gourmet three-course meal. Nearly one-third will have to make do with rice and  beans, a standard dinner in many developing countries. And a majority of the  guests will sit on the floor and use their hands to eat rice and water, the  most common meal in the world.  </P> <P> Who gets to eat what will be decided by drawing straws.  </P> <P> That's the idea of The Hollywood Hunger Banquet, a celebrity charity event  co-chaired by actors Danny Glover and Edward James Olmos and scheduled in West  Hollywood and three other cities elsewhere in the nation.  </P> <P> The Oxfam-backed exercise is designed to call attention to how food is  distributed today throughout the world -- and to raise money for the hungry.  While 15% of the world population routinely eat well, according to Oxfam  America, 30% eat simply, and the 55% who live in the poorest nations eat  whatever they can. World hunger is not limited to starving babies in Ethiopia,  a popular misconception. Millions of people -- one out of five -- are so  chronically malnourished they cannot lead productive lives. Thousands of people  -- the majority of them little girls under 5 -- die from hunger and related  diseases every day.  </P> <P> No doubt the Hollywood dinner is a gimmick. But it got our attention -- and  now, perhaps yours.  </P></p>

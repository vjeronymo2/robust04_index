			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina and Yulia </F> Kantor]    [Text] January 10 ITAR-TASS -- Parliamentary groups and  individual deputies must take political responsibility for any  damage done to Russia's national and state interests, stability  and peace by their pronouncements and actions, the parliamentary  faction made up of members of the Russia's Choice electoral  coalition said in a statement, which it adopted on January 9 and  plans to submit for consideration of the State Duma as a  legislative initiative, faction Chairman Yegor Gaydar told  ITAR-TASS.    The statement was prompted by some actions and  pronouncements  of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party which has the largest single faction in Russia's new  parliament. According to Yegor Gaydar, these prononcements and  calls fall clearly within the scope of those articles in the  criminal code of the Russian Federation which outlaw the  propaganda of war. "We will raise a question about due legal  assessment of violations of this ban," Gaydar said.    He was evidently referring to Zhirinovskiy's threats to  Germany, Europe and NATO, and Gaydar's Deputy Boris Zolotukhin  said a call for war was unmistakable in Zhirinovskiy's book "The  Last Push to the South".    According to Gaydar, Russia's Choice reached an agreement  about solidary voting of 94 faction members in the parliament,  whenever a decision on such voting is adopted by a two-third  majority of faction members.    As concerns interfaction cooperation, Russia's Choice tends  to interact with all factions in the State Duma's bodies, but  "is unable to collude with the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia, Communists and Agrarians against other parties". Gaydar  expressed apprehension that these factions may seek to "usurp  control over the key committees and commissions of the State  Duma, in particular, over the commission in charge of defence  and international relations."    As concerns the constructive programme of Russia's Choice,  the faction has prepared a package of initiatives in the field  of social and economic policy, including initiatives in the  housing sphere.    The new parliament's law-making activity should focus on  this  key issue of the development of society, Gaydar said. He added  that his faction has worked out proposals for legal and economic  guarantees of the freedom of the press.    The faction Secretary Sergey Yushenkov said in an interview  with ITAR-TASS that the faction fully supports the journalists'  demand that the government resolution be repealed before the  prices of periodicals increase six-fold.    As concerns relations between faction and the government,  Gaydar distanced himself from the cabinet decisions which  stipulated the expansion of subsidies to enterprises in 1993,  and led to the increasing budget deficit and unjustified  procurement of farming produce, all of which resulted in a  financial crisis of the state.    Russia's Choice is planning to support in parliament those  members of the government who share the faction's objectives.    Gaydar said he has come to realize the need to establish a  single party of liberal reforms to coordinate the activity of  all democratic forces in Russia.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: A market made out of muck - Expectations are high for the first public deal to trade pollution permits, but the scheme's long-term future is far from secure Last month, three US utility companies bravely waded into a national experiment to use market principles for environmental ends. In the first public deal to trade permits to pollute, the Wisconsin Power &amp; Light Company sold 10,000 allowances to the Tennessee Valley Authority and 15,000-25,000 allowances to Duquesne Light Company in Pittsburgh. Although the deal was widely hailed, it is far from clear whether the overall experiment will work. The allowances are part of the Clean Air Act of 1990, which requires America's mostly coal-burning utilities to halve their emissions of sulphur dioxide, the key ingredient in acid rain, by 2000. Under the act, those companies which exceed compliance with the emissions standard - by installing new, cleaner technology or switching to lower sulphur fuels - can sell their allowances, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, to those that have not fully complied. In theory, the total national cap on SO emissions will be achieved in the most cost-effective way by trading the rights to pollute among utilities. Enthusiasm for the scheme even led the EPA administrator, William Reilly, to declare when announcing some of its rules last October: 'The acid rain programme could become a model for other EPA programmes and indeed is causing us to rethink the way we approach environmental protection.' But, while hopes are high for its success, the results of the first national test of a market solution in the US are not yet in. The initial trade, announced May 12, has helped 'break a log jam' on starting the market, according to Richard Sandor, a managing director of Kidder Peabody and the mastermind of the idea that a commodities futures contract could be built on allowances. John Henry, founder and president of Clean Air Capital Markets, the small investment banking boutique that acted as broker for the transaction between the Wisconsin Power and the TVA, said his company has been inundated with calls from interested parties. Yet, even those who believe in the programme say that it will probably take until next year to know whether the market will take off or founder. Several impediments may slow or block its development. The foremost barrier is that the tax and accounting treatment for the allowances has not yet been worked out by the public utility commissions that regulate power companies. This is especially important given that this is a regulatory-driven market. The crux of the issue is that regulators have not spelled out who - the rate-paying consumers of electricity or the company's shareholders - is to benefit (or lose) from the trading of allowances. 'If all the gains go to rate-payers instead of the shareholders, there will be little incentive to use the market,' said Tony Visnesky, chief of the electric policy section of the Illinois Commerce Commission, which oversees utilities. 'On the other side, to what extent are rate-payers burdened if the company has to buy allowances?' If, for example, companies implement new technology the capital costs could be passed on to rate-payers. If they then have excess allowances, it would seem logical that the gain from the sale goes to rate-payers. However, if companies were unsure that they would be able to cover their capital expenditures with higher rates, their shareholders might prefer to buy allowances. These could then be treated as expenses in the companies' accounting, and the cost possibly passed on to rate-payers with little or no risk to shareholders. Visnesky believes that some formula for allocating the benefits and risks of the allowances will have to be worked out. Illinois is likely to arrive at a first draft of a policy by mid-summer, he says. The state has more urgency than others to formulate a clear policy. It is a top producer of high-sulphur coal and stands to lose if the market for its coal shrinks substantially. The only decision so far on the regulatory matters, which will no doubt be scrutinised by others, is being appealed. In the case of Wisconsin Power, the revenue from the sale of its allowances is set to go entirely to rate-payers, but the utility is asking its regulator to allow some benefit to go to shareholders. 'It will really be the public utility commissions that dictate whether this programme is successful or not,' said Thomas Brooks, vice president of Aer*x, a subsidiary of Electronic Data Systems which also aims to broker allowance deals. Aer*x has considerable experience with such transactions, having brokered 80 deals in regional markets for pollution permit trading since it was founded in 1984, according to Brooks. Trading permits in discrete regional markets have been part of US environmental laws since 1978, though the number of deals has been modest. A second hurdle for the allowances market will be how to heat up demand. At present, surveys of utility companies show that they are tending towards over-compliance with the new standards - mostly by installing new technology to remove SO from flue gas, known as scrubbers, and some through fuel switching. The inclination to over-comply means that there will be extra allowances. Prices, therefore, should be kept pretty low, according to David Baker of the Illinois Department of Energy and Commerce. 'They want to be ahead of the game and not be dependent on the market,' he said. Union Electric of St Louis, Missouri seems to typify some of the attitudes of utilities. 'It's a great concept and we hope the market works well,' said Jerrel Smith, a UE vice-president. But he explained that the company would 'bank' its allowances to cover any unexpected events such as the necessity to reduce electricity generation by its nuclear plant and raise generation at its coal-fired plants. The desire to hoard allowances stems in part, too, from the way the EPA has structured the emissions reductions. In Phase I, which runs from 1995 to 2000, 110 of the dirtiest plants have been targeted to reduce their emissions. But in Phase II after 2000, a permanent annual cap of 8.9m tonnes of SO has been set. This means that any future requirement to increase power generation by a utility will have to come under the ceiling, boosting either the need for installing clean technology or the demand for allowances. Allowances may not become hot commodities until the turn of the century. According to polls done by Aer*x of power companies, public utility commissions, coal producers and pollution equipment vendors, allowance prices are expected to rise after 2000 to about Dollars 600 per tonne (one allowance equals one tonne of SO). This compares with the Dollars 250-Dollars 300 per tonne in the first deal. The EPA's penalty for emitting excess SO is Dollars 2,000 per tonne. Of the total 5.7m allowances available annually in Phase I and the 8.9m available yearly in Phase II, 2.8 per cent will be creamed off by the EPA for public auction and direct sales, starting next year. This is aimed at allowing new power companies which have no allocations some access to them. The proceeds of the auctions and sales are to be returned to the utilities. While the supply and demand in the market might seem based on economics and logic - for example, the allocations per utility were calculated on the basis of their emissions between 1985 and 1988 - the process was riddled with politics. A number of companies, for instance, lobbied successfully for extra allotments. They pleaded special circumstances such as being in a high-growth state like Florida. With all the complications, even some of biggest promoters of the allowances market, such as Henry at Clean Air Capital Markets, are only cautiously optimistic. 'We jump-started the market,' he says, referring to the first deal. 'But it could choke out.' If it does, it will be a big setback for those who believe in market solutions to environmental problems.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Hosokawa cautious on UN role JAPAN yesterday called for a strengthening of the United Nations Security Council, and declared its firm support for the 'crucial role' of the UN in maintaining peace. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, stopped short of claiming a permanent seat for Japan in the Security Council, an issue that has sharply divided his coalition government. He said that there was a need to expand the Council membership beyond the present 15 states and it was important to engage 'those countries having both the will and the adequate capacity to contribute to world prosperity and stability in that effort.' However, its effectiveness must be maintained, he said in an address to the UN General Assembly. Japanese personnel had already joined UN peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, Mozambique and Angola, he said, and Tokyo intended to continue this policy. Echoing remarks by US President Bill Clinton, he called for 'serious reform efforts' to enable the UN to respond fully to expectations of the international community. Mr Hosokawa took the opportunity of his first visit to the UN to voice Japan's 'sense of remorse over its past actions' - an allusion to the second world war. He announced a Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) aid package over two years for the Palestinians, including food and medicine grants, and concessional loans for infrastructure. Later, Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa discussed US-Japanese relations, and in particular the large US-Japanese trade deficit. But if the US president had hoped for any precise Japanese commitment for the reduction of this deficit, he was disappointed. At a joint press conference afterwards, Mr Clinton emphasised that the bilateral economic relationship between the US was the most important in the world, and added: 'We must make progress on our bilateral trade.' For his part, Mr Hosokawa said only that 'Japan will do its best' in the framework of the economic policy adopted in July, 'so that favourable results will emerge as soon as possible'. Even if he was disappointed, Mr Clinton nevertheless said: 'I was heartened by our meeting. Mr Hosokawa has a mandate for change, and I think that means we can work together'. In an interview televised earlier, Mr Hosokawa said Japan should not go out of its way to seek a Security Council seat. 'I believe it is necessary for Japan to let things take their course, and if (Japan is) asked to be a permanent member, then (it would) become a permanent member,' he said. 'But I don't think Japan should go out of its way to make a campaign to become a member.'</p>

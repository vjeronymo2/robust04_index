			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 23 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC]  trade and defense officials will discuss the control of certain  high-tech exports with their U.S. counterparts when the two  sides meet for strategic trade consultations in Washington on  Tuesday [28 June] and Wednesday.    Since the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on  the protection of trade in strategic commodities -- such as  computers that can be used for military purposes -- and  technical data in 1990, they have held regular meetings.    The ROC, in the spirit of the memorandum, has mapped out  regulations governing the export and import of high-tech  products. One of these requirements is that domestic  manufacturers must receive approval from the Board of Foreign  Trade (BOFT) before importing such products.    A BOFT official said that the idea of controlling hi-tech  products first came from the international Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Control, whose original aim  was to keep high-tech products from falling into the hands of  communist countries. With the collapse of communism, however,  its focus has shifted to keeping such products out of the hands  of terrorists.    The official said that the government is now preparing a  list  of high-tech products subject to export control, and it is  expected that certain information and machinery products would  be affected.</p>

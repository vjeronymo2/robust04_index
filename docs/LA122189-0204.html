			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IVY LEAGUERS MEET FOR FUN, NONPROFIT  </P> <P> The question asked at the door was, "Ivy League?"  </P> <P> And the answer was simple -- the name of one of the eight Eastern college  allies, or mention of one of the seven affiliated "sister" schools.  </P> <P> With those passwords -- and a quick glance down the list -- 165 formally  dressed guests were admitted to the the upstairs dining area of John Dominis  restaurant on Sunday night. For them, the tendrils of Ivy cling mightily.  </P> <P> The $50-a-pop holiday dinner-dance was hosted by the Ivy League Assn. of  Southern California, a nonprofit group that organizes educational and social  events in Los Angeles and Orange County throughout the year.  </P> <P> "Contrary to popular belief," said Joseph Villarosa (Yale '84), "most of the  people in this group are really down-to-earth."  </P> <P> Villarosa, a native New Yorker and president of the alumni association, said  that he -- like many others in the group -- came to California "for a good job  and for life-style reasons." He joined ranks with his fellow alums out here  because he wanted "to network with others who share the same morals, values and  ethics. Does that sound elitist?" he asked. "I don't mean to sound elitist."  </P> <P> The party got off to a groggy start, thanks in part to the Coast Highway  traffic clogging the route to the Newport Beach restaurant.  </P> <P> Once inside, guests settled at dinner tables near windows overlooking the bay,  where boats trimmed in holiday lights glided between dark sky and black water.  </P> <P> Among the few minglers who stood while they sipped their cocktails were  University of Pennsylvania ('86) alumni Laura Delgado and Anne-Maree Cantwell.  </P> <P> Delgado, a convention planner, said she and her friend liked going to alumni  events because "it's wonderful to be with your comrades."  </P> <P> "You always have a lot in common with the people you meet at these (parties),"  said Cantwell, who lived in London before her recent move to Palos Verdes. "And  if nothing else, you can always talk about school."  </P> <P> Alan Beimfohr (Cornell '66), who co-hosted the party with Villarosa, talked  about the scholarship money raised by the different alumni associations, and  said he likes "having a group you relate to on a different basis from people at  work, or social groups. I think it's part of being a complete person to have  yourself invested in more than one area, with more than one group of people."  </P> <P> Julianne Hill (Brown '43) and her husband, Herbert, watched the boat parade  from a quiet table at one end of the wall of windows. Hill remembered "all  those years we were living out in the desert, and every year I'd get an  invitation (to an alumni party) and I could never go. Well, we just moved back  from the desert," she said, "and here I am at this party!"  </P> <P> Also attending were Joe and Pauline Fontana, Sid and Michelle Turkish, Jack and  Gail Finnell, Jay and Debbie Gilbert, Tom and Mary Barry, Bill and Joyce  Zaenglein, and Harry Jeffrey.  </P></p>

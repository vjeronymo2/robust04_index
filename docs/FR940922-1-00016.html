			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Contingency Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544). These measures must have been submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's core control strategy . These measures must take effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make reasonable further progress or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ. A findings letter, dated January 13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho informing him that the State had failed to make the required PM&hyph;10 contingency measures submittal for the Ada County/Boise SIP. The State has until July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency for Ada County/Boise, or it will face Federal highway and/or offset sanctions (see section 179 of the CAA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area when this requirement is submitted or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Transportation Conformity Protective Finding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 176(c)(4) of the CAA and the regulations implementing that provision require that transportation plans, programs, and projects which are funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act must conform with State or Federal air quality implementation plans (see 58 FR 62188 (November 24, 1993)). According to 58 FR 62228, &sect;51.448, areas which submitted a control strategy implementation plan before November 24, 1993 must be demonstrated to conform according to transitional period criteria and procedures by November 25, 1994. Otherwise, their conformity status will lapse, and no new project-level conformity determinations may be made. Under 40 CFR 51.448(a)(2), <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  if EPA disapproves a control strategy implementation plan revision submitted by the State and notifies the State, the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), and the Department of Transportation (DOT), the conformity status of the transportation plan and transportation improvement program (TIP) lapses 120 days after EPA's disapproval. After that time, no new project-level conformity determinations may be made and no new transportation plan, TIP, or project may be found to conform until another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted and conformity is demonstrated according to transitional period criteria and procedures. Note that these conformity consequences of a disapproval of a control strategy are in addition to the discretionary sanctions, which may be imposed under section 110(m) of the Act at any time following a disapproval, and the mandatory sanctions, which must be imposed under section 179 of the Act beginning 18 months following a disapproval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although &sect;&sect;51.448(d) (2) and (3) by their terms apply to ``areas which submitted a control strategy implementation plan before November 24, 1993,'' the effective date of the conformity rule, EPA intended that these provisions apply only to plans on which final action had been taken prior to the effective date of the rule. EPA intended the provisions of &sect;51.448(a) (2) and (3) to apply to all plans, regardless of the date of submission, on which final action was not taken until after November 24, 1993. In other words, EPA intended that the conformity status of the transportation plan and TIP lapse 120 days or, in the case of a protective finding, one year after the later of the effective date of the conformity rule (November 24, 1994) or the disapproval of the control strategy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 51.448(a)(3), however, allows EPA to extend the 120-day lapse period to one year from the date of disapproval if EPA determines that the control strategy contained in the revision would have been considered approvable with respect to requirements for emission reductions if all committed measures had been submitted in enforceable form as required by section 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act. If EPA makes such a ``protective finding,'' the transportation conformity plan and TIP will be valid for 12 months following the date of disapproval and the conformity status of the transportation plan and TIP will lapse 12 months following the date of disapproval unless within that time another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted to EPA and found to be complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, as proposed in this action, EPA disapproves the control strategy in the moderate area SIP for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area, under &sect;51.448(a)(2) the conformity status of the transportation plan and TIP would lapse 120 days after the effective date of the disapproval. EPA has evidence, however, that the wood smoke control ordinances for the cities of Eagle, Garden City and Meridian, and unincorporated Ada County are enforceable as a matter of local law, and believes that these control measures would have been considered approvable with respect to requirements for emission reductions if each of these control measures had been submitted to EPA in enforceable form as required by section 110(a)(2)(A). Therefore, EPA proposes that the 120-day lapse period be extended to one year under 40 CFR 51.448(a)(3). Accordingly, if EPA takes final action on this proposal, and the RACM (including RACT) requirement, attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and RFP elements of the Ada County/Boise moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment SIP are disapproved, then the State of Idaho's transportation plan and TIP may be found to conform for 12 months past the effective date of the PM&hyph;10 SIP disapproval. The conformity status of the transportation plan and TIP would then lapse 12 months following the effective date of final action on this proposal unless within that time another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted to EPA and found to be complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Implications of This Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to approve the emission inventory and, as described in the TSD, several submittals to address requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the Act, including the: a. Monitoring network (CAA section 110(a)(2)(B)); b. consultation and public notification/process (CAA section 110(a)(2)(J); c. provisions for revising the plan (CAA section 110(a)(2)(H)); and d. prohibiting sources from significantly impacting other states (CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)). EPA is also proposing to grant the exclusion from precursor control requirements authorized under section 189(e) of the Act. EPA is proposing limited approval of the control measures that have been submitted by the State as of this date under the authority of sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and making them federally enforceable. EPA believes making these control measures federally enforceable will achieve PM&hyph;10 emissions reductions in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area and, therefore, advances the NAAQS-related goals of the CAA. EPA is proposing disapproval of these control measures as meeting the RACM (including RACT) requirement, because the State has not adopted as part of the SIP and submitted to EPA those available control measures necessary for expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or shown that all economically and technologically feasible control measures have been implemented and timely attainment is impracticable), specifically, mandatory burn ban ordinances for Garden City, Eagle, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. In addition, because the attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP) elements of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP depend in part on the control measures which the State has not yet adopted and submitted to EPA, EPA is also proposing to disapprove these elements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

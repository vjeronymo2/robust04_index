			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / EC looks to deal on German steel A BONN government plan to rescue loss-making eastern German steelmaker Eko Stahl was unacceptable but a European Community ministerial meeting next month might thrash out a compromise, the European Commission said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. 'The Commission cannot accept the current plan to build new capacity with more than half the money coming from public finances,' the Bonn mission of the EC's executive body said in a statement. It added that the Community's industry commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, thought the aid for Eko, if approved by the meeting of industry and economics ministers on November 18, would jeopardise EC steel policy. The Commission wants to broker a deal among EC steelmakers that would encourage them to slash their combined annual capacity by 30m tonnes in a sector dogged by slumping demand and cheap eastern European imports. It only permits government restructuring aid to steelmakers if the help is tied to plant closures or other capacity cuts. The Eko plan would involve DM1bn of aid to modernise cold rolling facilities at Eko's Eisenhuttenstadt plant near the Polish border and build a new but relatively small mill with annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes.</p>

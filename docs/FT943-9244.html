			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / People: Lunn's last order at JD Wetherspoon JD Wetherspoon, the fast-growing chain of pubs whose reputation is based on cheap beer and no juke-boxes, is having growing pains. Keith Lunn, 38, who was responsible for the day-to-day running of the 87-strong chain, has quit as retail director. Tim Martin, the 39-year-old founder of the group, said that Lunn's departure had been 'mutually agreed'. Lunn, who had been with the group for four years, is the first main board executive director to quit since it was floated on the stock market in October 1992. A few months ago Martin's younger brother, Gerry, left the group in order to run his local pub in Barnet. Martin refused to elaborate on the company's brief statement to the stock exchange. However, it is believed that Lunn's departure may have been prompted by the arrival of Mark McQuarter, 34, who joined as Wetherspoon's first managing director in May. McQuarter, a Scottish chartered accountant, had worked for NatWest's venture capital arm in Scotland and before that had been with Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries. Lunn is not being replaced on the main board but his operational responsibilities will be undertaken by John Hutson, 29, a general manager who joined the group in January 1991. Since the company came to the stock market just under two years ago, its profits have grown rapidly and its stock market capitalisation has more than trebled to Pounds 140m. Wetherspoon is one of the first of a new generation of specialist pub retailers and has made a name for itself by developing new pubs out of vacant bank branches or empty supermarkets. Apart from its special retailing format, its skills are said to lie in its ability to win planning permission and get its outlets licensed. The number of its outlets has doubled since flotation and it is planning to open another 20 in the coming year. In March it raised Pounds 22m in a rights issue and analysts are expecting the company to increase its profits from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 6.2m when it reports its results for the year which has just ended.</p>

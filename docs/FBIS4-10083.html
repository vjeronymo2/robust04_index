			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raul Rojas] </F>   [Text] Following a long meeting of the Political  Interministerial Committee, which is presided over by the  president of the Republic, Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister  secretary general of the Presidency, reported that the  government will promote concrete measures against corruption in  the next few days.    Rebolledo said: "Ethics, transparency, and integrity  constitute a very high priority for the government as a  guideline for its public activities. The government  acknowledges the concern expressed by politicians and  congressmen over corruption. The government believes the  Chilean political system is not suffering generalized  corruption. It is very important to point this out. Our  concern follows some signs that have turned up. It is yet not a  generalized problem, but it is necessary to confront corruption  promptly, to prevent this evil from installing itself in our  political system."    Rebolledo said that in the next few days measures will be  adopted to combat corruption. The government will establish  regulations to prevent corruption from installing itself in  Chilean public life.    The Political Interministerial Committee studied the  priorities of the government's legislative agenda and concluded  that tension over the prioritization of social and  political-institutional subjects do not exist.    The meeting confirmed that social aspects will be stressed,  without overlooking other political reforms. There has been a  total consensus regarding some reforms, like procedures to be  adopted by joint committees in case of disagreement on a  constitutional amendment between the two houses of Congress.  There was consensus on subjects linked to citizenry,  nationality, and other issues, like the case of direct elections  for mayor.    The committee also ratified other wide-reaching reforms that  require open dialogue with the opposition: "We want to explore  possibilities for consensus. We believe there is a spirit of  dialogue, and it is understood that our institutional system can  be modernized and improved."</p>

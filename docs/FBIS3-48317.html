The parties ended Monday night's meeting of the House of  Representatives steering committee in a stalemate, holding over  their negotiations to the next committee session beginning at 3  P.M. Tuesday [25 January], they said.    The ruling coalition parties want to hold the joint council  to discuss concessions on the government-sponsored reform bills,  in a last-ditch effort to enact the legislation.    If two-thirds of a 20-member joint panel agree on a  compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent before a  plenary session of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The  bills would then become law if they are passed by the houses  with a majority vote.    If the next steering committee meeting reaches agreement to  form the council of 10 members each from both houses, the lower  house will then have to vote whether to hold the joint panel.    However, even if the joint committee is held, the ruling and  opposition camps are unlikely to agree on a concession plan, and  the package is likely to be then taken to the lower house for  another vote, they said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has said he would step  down if he fails to get the package passed, will put the bills  to a floor vote again at a lower house plenary session if the  joint council ends in failure, coalition officials said.

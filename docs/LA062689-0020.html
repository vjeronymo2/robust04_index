Tom Knopp said officers called in a report of the 9:45  p.m. incident at the consulate, but details were sketchy.  </P> <P> The impact apparently shattered the doors, but did no further damage. The  pickup was seen speeding from the scene.  </P> <P> In Chinatown, after entering the bank on Broadway, the truck slammed into a  counter, shattered a surveillance camera, knocked over several potted plants,  and left tire scratch marks along the length of the floor, Central Division  Sgt. Ed Wheelis said.  </P> <P> The truck finally exited the building through glass doors on College Street,  the opposite side from where it entered, police said.  </P> <P> Witnesses described the bank intruder's truck as a white, late model Ford  pickup truck, Wheelis said.  </P> <P> Police said the driver "left in a hurry," and that the bank vault and the cash  boxes were not tampered with.  </P> <P> The driver was being sought for investigation of vandalism.  </P></p>

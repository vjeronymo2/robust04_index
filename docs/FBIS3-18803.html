Government  spokesman Dieter Vogel told this to journalists in Bonn on  Tuesday [8 March]. For this reason, the ambassadors of France,  Great Britain, and the United States were received in the  chancellor's office for an exchange of information last Friday.    The departure is planned for September. The last contingent  of Russian troops is to be bidden farewell already in August.  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will  be present at the ceremony.    According to Vogel, on Tuesday the Cabinet adopted the  German-Russian treaty on mutual disaster relief, which was  signed by Kohl in Moscow already in December 1992, and passed  the annual disarmament report to Parliament. This report by the  Foreign Ministry deals with Europe's political efforts for  disarmament and arms control. The Ministry intends to comment  on the contents in the next few days.</p>

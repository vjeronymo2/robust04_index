			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroaki Morimoto, LSI Laboratory, </F> Mitsubishi Electric Corp.]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Although the present photoexposure technology used in LSI  manufacturing seems to be approaching its limits in terms of  both resolution and depth of focus, attempts are being made to  use DUV (deep UV) to fabricate the 0.2 to 0.25 m patterns  required for the fabrication of 256M DRAMs.    Figure 1 [photo not reproduced] shows the 0.24 m  L&amp;S  pattern fabricated with a KrF excimer laser stepper using a  Levenson-type phase-shifting mask. The stepper has an NA of 0.42  and the resist is SNR-248 manufactured by Shipley. Figure 2  shows the depths of focus (DOF) obtained at NAs from 0.4 to 0.6  with I-ray and KrF excimer laser-light sources. Here, the DOF  refers to the defocusing amount providing the optical image of  an L&amp;S pattern with a contrast of 60 percent or more. This  figure shows that, by adopting auxiliary means such as phase  shifting,[.sup]1,2[/] various shapes of  illumination,[.sup]3,4[/] and spatial filters[.sup]5[/]  and exploiting new technology, the required degree of DOF can be  obtained from 0.3 m patterns with I-rays and 0.2 m  patterns with DUV. Consequently, there is a strong possibility  that present photoexposure technology, with some improvements,  can be used up to 256M DRAMs.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-01A>           Figure 2. Depths of Focus Simulated for NA = 0.4 to 0.6 </FIG>        Even when the use of DUV may make manufacturing of 256M  DRAMs  possible in terms of resolution, it is expected that there will  still be a limitation in terms of DOF margin and alignment  accuracy. Also, further improvements in materials, processes,  and cost are required to allow the use of DUV lithography in  mass production.    The discussion in this report centers around these points.  <H5>  DOF Margin </H5>   As seen in Figure 2, DOF tends to decrease as the pattern  gets finer. Nevertheless, a certain DOF margin is required to  use the technology in mass production. Table 1 shows examples of  the required DOF obtained on the basis of various  factors[.sup]6,7[/] and the targets to be achieved in the  near future. If a 0.2 m rule pattern is to be fabricated  with  a KrF excimer laser stepper, a decrease in the DOF is inevitable  even when auxiliary means such as phase shifting is used, so it  is necessary to reduce the DOF requirement to as low as  possible. Factors involving DOF requirements include those  associated with the wafer and those associated with the stepper,  and the most important factor lies in device height differences  on the wafer. While efforts have recently been made to reduce  height differences, these are limited by device structures and  cost. Wafer flatness has been improved in spite of increased  diameter, but further improvements of the LTV is still  desirable. Most of the factors associated with the stepper are  related to image plane errors and the detection and reproduction  accuracy of auto focusing. To deal with this, a method using  multi-point focusing has been introduced to allow setting  optimum focusing according to each device.[.sup]8[/] It is  also desirable to improve the focusing detection and setting  accuracy itself. The required DOF is the sum of these factors;  presently about 2 m. If the target values can be achieved,  the necessary DOF may be decreased to 1.2 m.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

If alignment accuracy does not  improve as resolution improves, integration would be limited due  to the necessity of alignment margin. Table 2 shows the present  alignment accuracy and the target alignment accuracy for 256M  DRAMs of each factor.[.sup]6,9[/] If the minimum pattern size  of a 256M DRAM is 0.2 to 0.25 m, the required alignment  accuracy is around 0.08 m.       Table 2. Details of Alignment Errors   Item                                         Present           Target   Factor associated    Distortion of           0.05 m           0.02 m  with wafer           substrate wafer   Factor associated    Mask pattern position   0.15 m/5 =       0.10 m/5 =  with mask            error                   0.03 m           0.02 m   Factors associated   Lens distortion         0.08 m           0.05 m  with stepper                        Alignment error         0.08 m           0.05 m                        Magnification ratio     0.03 m           0.01 m                       error   Total (RMS)                                  0.13 m           0.08 m      In the course of fabrication, the wafer is subject to  nonlinear distortion, which results in alignment errors. An  alignment technique which corrects high-order nonlinear  distortion by optimizing the sampling shot and the weight of  each mark[.sup]3[/] is one approach aimed at reducing this  error. Mask pattern position errors are mainly caused by the  method by which the mask is held during electron-beam etching,  temperature changes, beam drift, deflection distortion and  stage-moving errors. The error is reduced to one-fifth on the  wafer, but this is still significant.    Lens distortion is a factor very difficult to reduce, but it  cannot be ignored in stepper matching. As well as minimizing the  distortion, it is desirable to provide a function to correct  distortion up to a high order for each stepper. Various new  methods have been developed to reduce alignment errors and  further improvements are forthcoming to improve stage accuracy.    A recently released step-and-scan system  aligner[.sup]10[/] detects and corrects alignment and  focusing during scanning to improve accuracy. Because the  factors determining alignment accuracy will be more obvious as  the accuracy improves, it is expected that in the future it will  be even more difficult to improve accuracy, and it will be  necessary to approach the problem simultaneously from the device  side, such as the use of a self-alignment structure.  <H5>  Cost of DUV Lithography </H5>   Figure 3 compares the calculated cost per layer of a single  8-inch wafer with I-ray and KrF excimer laser lithographies,  assuming that the cost of I-ray lithography is 1. Costs related  to equipment include the equipment price (depreciation of the  stepper, coater and developer), throughput, operating ratio,  maintenance cost, consumables and equipment area (clean-room  costs). The percentage of mask cost varies depending on the  types and number of input wafers. Resist cost includes the  prices of resists and developing solutions. As can be seen in  the figure, present excimer laser lithography is very expensive.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007-02A>           Figure 3. Example of Calculations of Cost per Layer of </FIG>       Causes of the increased costs of excimer laser lithography  are the stepper price, consumables, maintenance cost and  installation area of excimer laser equipment. In the future, it  is expected that excimer laser equipment cost will compete with  I-ray steppers by reducing the equipment price through mass  production and by increasing the service life and frequency band  of the excimer laser.    Few excimer-laser resists are available on the market, their  prices are high at the present, and a large price reduction by  mass production is essential in the future. Mass production of  excimer-laser resists may make it possible to reduce the cost  below that of I-ray lithography, which uses phase-shifting  techniques.  <H5>  Lithography Technologies After 0.2 m </H5>   Candidates being studied as lithography technologies after  0.2 m include the use of ArF excimer laser light with a  short  wavelength of 193 nm, the use of VUV (Vacuum Ultra Violet) light  emitted from an SR (Synchrotron Radiation) light source, the use  of soft X-rays, and the electron beam drawing method. However,  the use of short-wavelength light sources raises the problem of  light absorption by optical components and resist; the use of  X-rays is accompanied by the problem of mask fabrication  accuracy due to its equal-magnification transfer; and the use of  electron beam drawing is accompanied by problems in throughput  and drawing accuracy. It is left for future research to identify  if the lithography after the 0.2 m rule can be an extension  of the present photoexposure system, or whether a change to  another technique is necessary.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The 0.2 to 0.25 m rule lithography required for 256M  DRAMs  may be dealt with by improving present photoexposure technology,  but further improvements in equipment and devices are required  in areas such as depth of focus and alignment accuracy. With  regard to costs, price reduction is required through the mass  production of equipment, maintenance, and materials. Although  not mentioned in the above, improvements in processes such as  the implementation of simple ARC (anti-reflection coating) are  also important. It is desirable that these problems be  surmounted by closer cooperation among the equipment, material,  and device manufacturers.  References    1. M. D. Levenson, N. S. Viswanathan, and R. A.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has declared  that Pakistan will not give up its peaceful nuclear program  under any circumstances. She was talking to a group of newsmen  in Islamabad this evening. She made it clear that they were  pursuing a well-thoughtout policy in this connection and  Pakistan could ill afford to dispense with its knowledge in this  vital field. She pointed that Pakistan has been subjected to  three wars in the past and it was dismembered also. She  recalled that Pakistan had never violated the Nonproliferation  Treaty and it was India which violated it by exploding a nuclear  device.</p>

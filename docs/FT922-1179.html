			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Vaux acquires 124 pubs VAUX GROUP, the Sunderland-based brewer which has interests in hotels and nursing homes, has acquired 124 pubs from Inntrepreneur Estates, for Pounds 15m. In early April Vaux bought 85 pubs from Inntrepreneur and 28 from Whitbread in a Pounds 13.5m deal. At that time Vaux said it intended to increase its pub estate to 1,000 properties. The current acquisition brings the number of pubs now owned by Vaux to 988 and strengthens its position in the north west of England and Yorkshire. Some 84 of the pubs will be operated from Vaux Breweries in Sunderland, the brewing subsidiary of the group, and 40 from SH Ward in Sheffield. The vendor, Inntrepreneur, is a joint venture between Grand Metropolitan and Foster's Brewing.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL / MAL FLORENCE: PARDEE LINE: HURRY-UP OFFENSE WORKS  </P> <P> Football fans are often puzzled when they see a team that has struggled for 57  or 58 minutes zip down the field in the closing minutes with a hurry-up  offense.  </P> <P> USC, for example, went 91 yards in a late rush to beat Washington State, 18-17,  with a two-minute offense.  </P> <P> Coaches and players like to explain that the two-minute drill only works  because of special circumstances -- the defense is geared to stop the bomb so  the sideline pass is available -- but that it certainly couldn't be used for an  entire game.  </P> <P> The University of Houston would beg to differ. The Cougars are using the  hurry-up offense as their basic attack and may be hurrying to all sorts of  offensive records.  </P> <P> "We do it all the time," said Houston Coach Jack Pardee of his run-and-shoot,  hurry-up offense that spreads the field with four wide receivers.  </P> <P> Houston leads the nation by a wide margin in total offense, averaging 658.6  yards a game. The Cougars rank No. 1 in passing offense, with an average of 548  yards, and quarterback Andre Ware is the national leader in total offense with  423.3 yards a game.  </P> <P> Pardee, the former Ram and Redskin linebacker, concedes that Houston's first  three opponents -- Nevada Las Vegas, Arizona State and Temple -- were not  comparable to the caliber of teams the Cougars will play the rest of the  season.  </P> <P> "Our competition level changes drastically," said Pardee, whose team will meet  three Southwest Conference contenders this month -- Baylor, Texas A &amp; M and  Arkansas.  </P> <P> Even so, Pardee says that he has a better team than last year's, which had a  9-3 record and lost to Washington State in the Aloha Bowl.  </P> <P> Pardee, 53, has had an eclectic coaching career. He began with the Florida  Blazers of the World Football League and moved on to the Chicago Bears and  Washington Redskins of the National Football League, then the Houston Gamblers  of the ill-fated United States Football League.  </P> <P> Along the way, he beat cancer, and in each league, except the WFL, Pardee has  been named coach of the year at one time. He was so honored again last year in  the Southwest Conference. That may be a record for varied recognition.  </P> <P> While he was with the Gamblers, Pardee brought in Mouse Davis, the innovator of  the run and shoot, to establish that offense.  </P> <P> Pardee has stayed with it since he became Houston's coach in 1987.  </P> <P> "Most teams devote 15 minutes of practice time to the hurry-up offense," Pardee  said. "That's all we work on. We recruit for it and we get fast players. We  have some legitimate sprinters. If you don't have great team speed, you're  wasting your time with it."  </P> <P> The offense baffled Arizona State a few weeks ago, when Houston set a Southwest  Conference record with 744 yards in total offense on its way to a 36-7 victory.  </P> <P> "Many college defenses have to be concerned about stopping a running game with  an eight-man front," Pardee said. "Then, they face us and they have to worry  about pass coverage and they don't work on it all the time.  </P> <P> "Like, Arizona State. They're a zone team. They didn't have the ability to jump  into man coverage, or do any blitzing effectively. We gave them a different  picture than they face with other teams."  </P> <P> Pardee said that Ware, a junior, is a super athlete who thrives on the work  ethic, comparing him in that regard to his old Ram teammate, Roman Gabriel.  </P> <P> "He has a great arm and has the quality of quarterbacks I've had such as Joe  Theismann and Jim Kelly," Pardee said. "He has the temperament of a linebacker.  He's so tough that he just won't be intimidated."  </P> <P> Even though Houston is prospering on the field, it is laboring under National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. sanctions based on infractions from the previous  coaching regime.  </P> <P> The Cougars lost 10 scholarships and can't appear on television or go to a bowl  game this season. The sentence is less severe next season, with only a bowl  ban.  </P> <P> As the nation's 12th-ranked team, Pardee said Houston doesn't have the depth  of, say, Notre Dame or Miami.  </P> <P> "But we'd match up with them," he said confidently.  </P> <P> It isn't often that an Oregon-Washington State matchup has much significance in  the Pacific 10 Conference race, or that both teams are nationally ranked.  </P> <P> However, the Northwest schools aren't the doormats they once were in the  league.  </P> <P> "I know Washington State will be emotionally very high coming off a very  difficult defeat in a game they believe they deserved to win," Oregon's Coach  Rich Brooks said of WSU's loss to USC last Saturday.  </P> <P> "They're an outstanding football team," he said. "They can play with anyone in  the country and defeat anyone in the country."  </P> <P> The Cougars, who play the Ducks Saturday in Eugene, Ore., are ranked 21st  nationally. Oregon is No. 23.  </P> <P> "It's nice that some of the also-rans in past years, like us and Washington  State, now are getting the national attention that we struggled hard to earn,"  Brooks said.  </P> <P> Leave it to Lou Holtz to find something negative in an eased-up, 40-7 victory.  </P> <P> Speaking of his team's win over Purdue, the Notre Dame coach said his reserves  didn't impress him.  </P> <P> "I'm glad we got to play a lot of people, but I was really disappointed that  the second team didn't have more continuity," he said.  </P> <P> Other schools don't have much continuity with their first teams.  </P> <P> Purdue Coach Fred Akers had a more accurate assessment of the top-ranked Irish.  </P> <P> "That's the most talented group I've seen put together in a long, long time,"  he said. "Maybe ever."  </P> <P> Stanford, which has a 1-3 record, is next for the Fighting Irish. Just imagine  what Holtz will be saying after that one.  </P> <P> Auburn Coach Pat Dye conceded that Tennessee has the inside track to win the  Southeastern Conference championship after beating his Tigers last Saturday,  21-14.  </P> <P> "They ran the ball straight at us, and we couldn't do a lot about it," said Dye  of Tennessee's 350 yards rushing. "We were manhandled up front. That's the  worst we've been whipped in a long time."  </P> <P> Rick Telander, in his book, "The Hundred Yard Lie," which denounces the  hypocrisy in college football, asked former UCLA Coach Pepper Rodgers why  anyone would want to coach?  </P> <P> Said Rodgers: "Power. There's no other job where you can yell, 'Hit it,' and a  hundred men drop to the ground."  </P> <P> Clarifying a rule: When USC kicked off to Washington State late in the second  quarter of last Saturday's game, the ball was recovered by the Trojans in the  end zone.  </P> <P> Since a kickoff becomes a free ball after 10 yards, it was presumed by some  that USC had scored a touchdown. Not so.  </P> <P> The rule: "The ball becomes dead and belongs to the team defending its goal  when a free kick is untouched by team B (the receiving team) before touching  the ground on or behind team B's goal line."  </P> <P> If USC had recovered the ball in the field of play, it would have retained  possession.  </P></p>

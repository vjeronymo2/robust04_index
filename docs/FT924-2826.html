			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers return to hurt equities ANOTHER bout of fairly modest profit-taking in the UK stock market yesterday cut into some of the share price gains achieved over the past month. Selling pressure remained fairly light and the pattern was somewhat uneven, with the big names in the FT-SE list hurt by weakness in stock index futures, where the premium on the December contract was savaged. A sharp setback in sterling discouraged dwindling hopes of a further cut in UK base rates this year. London took its cue from doubts elsewhere in Europe of any interest move from the Bundesbank today. Equities opened firmer, with the stock market again responding to favourable reports from US purchasing managers on the outlook for the US economy. Attention was focused on the prospects for the meeting in Edinburgh tomorrow of EC leaders. Maastricht tensions were soon reflected in uncertainty over the implications surrounding the downward trend in sterling. However, some strategists suggested that the pound might soon stabilise and that this trend would encourage overseas investment in UK securities, especially UK government bonds. But once again, other considerations appeared to be sidelined when the stock index futures market opened and with the December contract on the Footsie under some pressure, share prices quickly turned off. The Footsie slid by more than 20 points before steadying as it challenged the 2,750 area. Trading volume was slow at first but picked up when share prices staged a minor rally before the close. Wall Street, 8.75 up on the Dow Average in London hours, provided little interest for the UK market. At its final reading, the FT-SE Index was 19.1 off at 2,750.7. Strategists continued to take the view that a pause for profit-taking down to these Footsie levels is quite acceptable and does not change overall views of the market outlook. While some of the more hopeful forecasts for the year-end may now be in doubt, equity traders remain optimistic for the new year. Seaq-reported volume of 660.5m shares compared with 605m on Tuesday, when retail, or customer business, recovered to record worth of Pounds 1.16bn. Profit-taking appeared to be fairly widespread across the range of the market, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was down by 9.5 points yesterday. For the near term, investment views on the outlook for interest rates remained uncertain. 'We continue to have doubts about a base rate cut before the end of January or early February,' commented Mr Trevor Laugharne at Kleinwort Benson Securities, adding, however, that the prospect of another cut helps maintain interest in UK equities. The final picture was somewhat mixed, with most of the blue chip internationals easier, while ICI, a dull feature in recent sessions, finding some support. Retail and store issues, closely linked to day-to-day views on base rate hopes, met some light selling. yesterday. The market was also featured by sharp movements in a handful of stocks driven by special situations. Guinness gave ground with UK investors believed to be taking a fresh look at the shares, while Lonrho continued to move higher ahead of a widely-expected statement from the boardroom.</p>

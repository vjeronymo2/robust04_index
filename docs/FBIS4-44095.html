			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Six European countries -- Belgium, the  Netherlands, Portugual, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom  -- today expressed their readiness to offer logistical or  humanitarian support for Operation Turquoise. For its part,  Italy is ready to send soldiers, but only under certain  conditions. More details from Arlette Chabot, our special envoy  to the European summit in Corfu: [Chabot] [passage omitted]  Italy alone is ready to send soldiers, as many as 5,000, if Mr.  Berlusconi can persuade his cabinet.    [Begin Berlusconi recording] I have just spoken with my  defense minister. We are organizing everything, and I believe  we will succeed in persuading those concerned.    [Chabot] Does this mean that you will send soldiers?    [Berlusconi] Soldiers with a field hospital.    [Chabot] In Rwanda? With French soldiers?    [Berlusconi] I do not know; if we can, I hope we can  coordinate. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

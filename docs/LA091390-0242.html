			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN CONSUL SEES HIS ROLE AS MORE THAN JUST CEREMONIAL  </P> <P> Jose Angel Pescador Osuna will conduct the most patriotic ceremony of the year  as Mexican consul general in Los Angeles on Sept. 15 at 11 p.m., when he  commemorates the cry of independence given in 1810 by Father Miguel Hidalgo y  Costilla in the town of Dolores, Mexico, marking the beginning of the end of  Spanish domination in that country.  </P> <P> A bell will toll, and on the front steps of City Hall Pescador Osuna will  pronounce the traditional words of the ceremony: "Long live Mexico, long live  Hidalgo, long live Morelos, long live Allende, long live the independence, long  live freedom!"  </P> <P> Then he will take the tricolored Mexican flag and swing it to one side to begin  the singing of the national anthem: "Mexicans, as you hear the call to war. . .  ."  </P> <P> "For the celebration of the patriotic holiday commemorating the 180th  anniversary of our independence, this year we have prepared a very sober and  simple ceremony, in which there will not be many speeches," said Pescador  Osuna, a former mayor of Mazatlan in Sinaloa state.  </P> <P> Pescador Osuna, 45, has been in charge of the General Consulate of Mexico in  Los Angeles for the past seven months. During that time, Pescador Osuna said,  he has stressed the educational and cultural aspects of his consular mission.  </P> <P> "We have initiated a series of visits to schools to explain Mexico's importance  and to celebrate patriotic holidays other than May 5 and Sept. 16, such as Feb.  24, which is Flag Day, and March 21, which is the birthday of Benito Juarez (a  president of Mexico in the mid-19th Century)," he said.  </P> <P> Pescador Osuna is an economist an educator. In 1964, he obtained a teaching  credential in elementary education; in 1970, he graduated in economics from the  Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, and later he received a master's  degree in education and economics at Stanford University. That background is  useful in his current position.  </P> <P> "Another of my priorities here in Los Angeles has been to promote the economic  development of Mexico," he said. He has worked with the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, the Latin Business Assn. and the Mexican Chamber of Commerce of Los  Angeles, he added.  </P> <P> According to Pescador Osuna, the responsibilities of Mexican consuls in the  United States have become broader than they used to be, and his duties now  include more activism. "The protection of our compatriots is fundamental. We  are not waiting any more for the complaints to reach us."  </P> <P> The consul said that, although he sometimes disagrees with U.S. authorities, he  maintains good relations with law enforcement officials and the U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> </P></p>

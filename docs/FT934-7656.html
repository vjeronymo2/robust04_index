			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Brussels begins social policy talks The European Commission yesterday launched a four-month consultation process aimed at inspiring far-reaching reforms of social policy in the European Union, writes Andrew Hill in Strasbourg. Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the aim was to find ways of reforming the policy against a background of economic difficulties. 'We need continuous economic growth, and we need to have more flexibility and competitiveness. But economic growth must go hand in hand with social progress,' he said. The Commission yesterday published a green paper on the options for social policy and invited ideas or suggestions before the end of March 1994. Brussels hopes to produce concrete proposals for action in the second half of next year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Bratunac, April 13 (TANJUG)--Moslem forces from  Gorazde on Wednesday continued artillery and infantry attacks on  Bosnian Serb Army positions, the military sources of the army of  the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) have said.    The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander for Bosnia,  British General Michael Rose, on Tuesday said that the Gorazde  Moslems are continuing unprovoked attacks on the Bosnian Serb  army.    U.S. NATO jets on April 10-11 bombed Bosnian Serb positions  near Gorazde, a U.N.-designated safe area which should have been  demilitarized.    Instead, this Moslem enclave served as the startingpoint for  a 10,000-strong Moslem offensive on Serb territories in late  March.    At the same time, in northern Bosnia seven civilians were on  Wednesday wounded seriously and four only slightly in a Moslem  mortar attack on the city of Doboj, the Bosnian Serb military  sources said.    The Moslems mounted artillery and mortar attacks on the  Bosnian Serb army in the region of Mount Ozren, close to  Gradiska, Orasje and Novigrad (northern Bosnia), Srbobran and  Olovo (central Bosnia), Bihac (western Bosnia) and in the region  of Mt. Majevica (northeast Bosnia).    In the Sarajevo area, the Bosnian Serb army repelled a  strong  Moslem infantry attack, while infantry fire was opened from the  Moslem-controlled part of Sarajevo on the Serb parts of the  city, it is said.    All these attacks are a part of a Moslem offensive on almost  all parts of RS with the aim of seizing as much as possible  territories before a final political solution is reached.</p>

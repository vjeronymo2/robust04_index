			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Most of the University of the Republic's nearly  60,000 students will return to classes on 13 June. But they will  no longer occupy buildings or demonstrate for bigger budgets.  They will come to study, if they want.    On 9 June, the four university associations decided to lift  the strike that halted classes and research at the university.  The strike lasted 45 days but teachers and employees continued  receiving their salaries.    The strike started on 25 April. It was staged in demand of a  20 percent salary increase [for faculty members] that, according  to students, was the cost of living increase last year and was  what the government promised to give the faculty in April 1993.    What students finally got was a 6 percent increase through a  law approved by Congress that interpreted a previous decision  and that, according to the University Inter-Association, "merely  corrected the illegal discrimination against the university."  The students also collected 436,400 signatures in support of a  plebiscite proposing a constitutional amendment to assure bigger  education budgets in general. [passage omitted]</p>

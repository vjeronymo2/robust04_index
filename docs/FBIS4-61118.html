			<p>BFN     [Text] A resolution issued at a rally of representatives  of trade unions and working collectives in the city of Grodno  and Grodno Rayon, sounded like a serious warning to the  Belarusian Government and Supreme Soviet. Given the  exacerbation of the economic crisis, they demand that urgent,  practical measures -- aimed at stabilizing the national economy  and relations in the social sector, ensuring a decrease in  retail prices, the liquidation of crime and corruption, and the  termination of the illegal redistribution of state property --  be undertaken. There are many reasons for this to be done.  There is a big gap between the consumer basket and actual wages.</p>

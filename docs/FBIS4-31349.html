			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 7 (ATA) -- Representatives of the  Albanological Institute received a letter from the so-called  prefect of the Kosova circle, Milosh Simovio, addressed to the  director of the institute Dr. Sadri Fetiu. The letter says that  the decision on the conditions and sequestration of the building  of the institute have been re-examined and as a result the  previous decision taken is invalid. According to the letter,  the present user of the building of the Albanological Institute  should evacuate the building until June 10 this year to hand it  to the Kosova circle.    After the building was sequestered from the institute and  the  Serbian violence, the Albanological Institute of Prishtina  continued its work in a private building.</p>

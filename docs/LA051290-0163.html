			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAREFUL PLANNING IS THE KEY TO AN EASY-MAINTENANCE FLOWER GARDEN;  </P> <P> GARDENING: PREPARING SPACE, SOIL AND WATERING SYSTEMS BEFORE PLANTING WILL MAKE  UPKEEP MUCH SIMPLER.  </P> <P> If you want to plant a flower garden but think you're too busy to take care of  one, then an easy-maintenance plan may be your pot of soil.  </P> <P> Easy-maintenance gardens are based on well-defined spaces and simple, effective  designs. They are planned from the very beginning with easy maintenance in  mind.  </P> <P> Once you decide on a design that makes good use of the garden space, you can  begin to consider what you will plant. It does involve some hard work, but  advance preparation is important: preparing the soil for ground covers, making  use of edgings, installing various watering systems, mulching and planting  trees and shrubs.  </P> <P> Plants should be chosen not only for their appropriate size but for their  suitability to your climate, soil conditions and the level of attention you are  willing to give. Also, the plants should be those that attract you.  </P> <P> "No matter how little care a plant needs, if you don't like it, you won't enjoy  having it in your garden," writes A. Cort Sinnes in "Easy Maintenance  Gardening" (Ortho Books, $6.95).  </P> <P> What you choose depends on where you live, how you want your garden to look,  what types of plants you want and how you want to spend your maintenance time.  </P> <P> Selection guides are available to help determine your initial choices, but you  might want to double-check your selections with nursery personnel, agricultural  extensions, garden clubs, gardening neighbors or friends.  </P> <P> Sinnes recommends new varieties of old favorites because plant breeders are  constantly working to develop new varieties that are more resistant to pests  and diseases and are more compact than their ancestors.  </P> <P> Depending on the climate where you live, there are many choices of flowers  available. But Peter Loewer, author of "A Year of Flowers" (Rodale Press,  $21.95) believes annuals are ideal for the easy-maintenance garden.  </P> <P> Annuals germinate, bloom, set seed and die in one year, while perennials bloom  year after year.  </P> <P> "There are a number of annuals really great for beds and borders across the  United States," Loewer said.  </P> <P> He suggests bedding begonia, edging plants that grow about nine inches tall,  with shiny, bronze or green foliage. They'll grow in full sun or partial shade.  </P> <P> "Once they start blooming, they'll bloom all summer until the frost cuts them  down," he said.  </P> <P> Loewer also suggests the Palm Springs daisy, which has lacy leaves and yellow,  daisylike flowers that grow about two inches across. It originated in Morocco  and is a "great plant" for summer across the country, he said.  </P> <P> Another daisylike flower, the cosmos, grows up to six feet and is great for  cutting. The many-petaled flowers come in a variety of colors, including pinks,  reds, whites and yellow.  </P> <P> Loewer also pointed to the California poppy and the sunflower, both annuals  that will do well across the country.  </P> <P> The California poppy will grow about a foot tall and will bloom the entire  summer. They can be perennial but most people grow them as annuals.  </P> <P> The sunflower, he said, will grow from New York to Kansas, and "no longer do  you have to settle for plants 10 feet tall." It comes in several varieties,  including Italian white, which is about four feet tall with creamy white  flowers and black centers.  </P> <P> Impatiens, originally from China, India and Tanzania, is an annual recommended  for summer. It reacts kindly to heat but likes a spot in the shade, he says.  </P> <P> Loewer, who has written three other gardening books and is the editor of the  Garden Writers Assn.'s newsletter, cautions that "all gardening is difficult,  but it's one of the most rewarding things you can do."  </P> <P> He is so convinced of gardening's advantages that he suggests it as the perfect  hobby for politicians.  </P> <P> "I've never met an evil gardener," he said. "If every member of Congress had to  be a gardener, we'd find things changing in this country."  </P></p>

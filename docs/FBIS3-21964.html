			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [RITZAUS Bureau report: "Man Arrested With 100 Kilograms of </F> Hashish"]    [Excerpts] A 36-year-old man was found out at the  Danish-German border when he tried to smuggle around lOO kg of  hashish from Germany into Denmark. This is the largest hashish  seizure that police and customs officials have made in recent  years.    The 36-year-old, who is an Icelandic citizen, is being held  for preliminary investigation in Grasten. The criminal police in  Aabenraa have charge of the investigation. [passage omitted]  Icelandic police revealed that the man has lived in Spain for a  number of years, and that earlier he had been convicted for drug  smuggling in both Iceland and Great Britain.    The finding of the 100 kg of hashish in the man's baggage is  the biggest single seizure at the Danish-German border in recent  years. For all of 1993 only around 30 kg were seized at the  border. The two preceding years, customs and police officials  found about 400 kg of hashish.    Reduced customs inspection at the border following Denmark's  joining the Internal Market in 1993 was named by the chief of  the Sonderborg Customs and Taxation Region as the reason for  authorities more rarely uncovering attempts at narcotics  smuggling.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Domination by US in oil services inevitable Sir, Please allow me to comment on David Lascelles' article, 'Still plenty of North Sea life' (February 6) on the the North Sea oil industry. I published a book on the subject a couple of years ago (Transaction Costs and Trade Between Multinational Corporations: A Study of Offshore Oil Production). David Lascelles is exactly right. British suppliers of inputs into offshore oil production have made very little impact on the wider world industry which remains dominated by American multinationals. The reasons are not hard to find. The oil industry originated in the US, with American companies gaining advantages that they have never relinquished. They have fought to sustain their lead effectively, keeping British competitors at bay. For example, my study showed that American affiliates were on average the first to establish themselves in the Aberdeen service base; they predominate in the technological core of the industry; they own the bulk of the industry's patents; and they spend more on R&amp;D. Moreover, the American affiliates in Aberdeen are small within their respective ownership groups - reflecting the prior globalisation of the parents' activities. As the British find it so hard to compete on their own turf it is not surprising that they cannot compete elsewhere - they simply come up against the same superior competition and without the benefit of the albeit slim protection afforded by British trade policy towards the industry, British success stories do exist but they are hard to find.

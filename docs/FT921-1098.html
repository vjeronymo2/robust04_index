			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Germany seeks to speed up G7 aid to Russia GERMANY is hoping to reach agreement on a comprehensive economic aid programme for Russia before the world economic summit of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised states in July. The package would follow Russian membership of the International Monetary Fund, which German officials hope will be agreed in April. It would include co-ordinated technical assistance, in addition to immediate humanitarian aid, and almost certainly a rouble stabilisation fund. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is chairing the economic summit in Munich, has spelt out three areas where western aid should be concentrated, apart from the stabilisation fund: on agriculture, infrastructure, and nuclear safety. He wants to invite Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to attend the meeting, but not in order to bargain over the shape and form of an aid package, German officials say. That should be finalised in advance. 'We don't want Munich to be an occasion to fix how much money will be given,' a senior finance official said. 'It would be wrong to think if Yeltsin comes it is to get more money." As far as Russia is concerned, the plan is for IMF membership to be agreed as quickly as possible, which depends on final agreement on the Russian quota, or share of the IMF capital, which in turn determines how much it can borrow. That question the German government sees as primarily political, not economic. 'We must be conscious that the Russian parliament might say to Yeltsin: 'Too low a quota means you are selling yourself to the IMF and getting nothing back.' The West might want the quota as small as possible, but if that means Yeltsin has the (IMF-backed) programme rejected in parliament, it would be self-defeating,' the finance official said. At the moment, the Russian quota is expected to be fixed at something more than 3 per cent, up from the 2.5 per cent first mooted. Progress with Ukraine, the second largest ex-Soviet republic, has been much slower, although the government in Kiev now appears ready to sign the western-backed memorandum of understanding on debt-servicing. 'The Ukraine is a bit crazy,' one official in Bonn said. 'They are only thinking of political liberation from Moscow, and they are prepared to let their economy suffer to get it.' The German intention, as co-ordinator of the G7, is to finalise the overall plan in the first half of the year. Another element will be an attempt to co-ordinate technical assistance, to avoid competition between the western countries. 'We cannot send a new adviser every day,' the senior official said. 'We must ensure that they strengthen their own decision-making capacity. And we must avoid national competition.' The former Soviet Union is likely to be given another breather on the repayment of billions of dollars of principal on its western commercial bank debt, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Sources on the advisory committee dealing with the bank debt of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) said a meeting in Frankfurt today would agree on a second 90-day extension beyond its original repayment date, known in banking as a roll-over. 'Another deferral makes sense ..probably for three months until the end of the second (1992) quarter,' said a senior banker.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Poland tries to force debt deal: Warsaw stops servicing loan from martial law era POLAND is unilaterally announcing its intention to cut debt service payments on a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 720m) loan originally extended as a revolving trade facility in 1983. The decision follows the appointment of Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the country's economic counsellor in the US, as chief debt negotiator for forthcoming talks with the London Club of commercial banks on Dollars 13.3bn of loans which Poland stopped servicing in the autumn of 1989. Unlike the bulk of Poland's frozen commercial debt, Warsaw has continued until now to service the Dollars 1.1bn loan which was extended after all other sources of credit dried up following the imposition of martial law in 1981. Warsaw's willingness to treat the revolving credit as a special case made it a favourite on the secondary market where it traded at a 20 per cent premium to ordinary blocked Polish debt. It has now lost this special status. The Polish side argues that the 80 per cent cut in payments from February 4 places all its London Club creditors on the same basis. Banks involved in the debt negotiations yesterday criticised the unilateral move while welcoming the appointment of a new debt negotiator after a two-year hiatus since the dismissal of Mr Janusz Sawicki in August 1991. An official statement said Poland was seeking an agreement with the commercial banks 'which is within the country's economic possibilities' and is 'comparable with Poland's other payments agreements'. This refers to Poland's search for an agreement similar to a 1991 deal with western government creditors in the Paris Club. This agreed a 50 per cent cut in the value of outstanding debt by 1994, provided Poland obtained International Monetary Fund approval for its financial and budgetary policies in this period. Poland's overall debt stood at Dollars 49.4bn at the end of last year, of which Dollars 31.7bn is owed to western governments. This year's budget sets aside Dollars 940m for debt service payments .</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Electricity industry staff cuts to total 9,000 by end of March Britain's electricity industry expects to have shed at least 9,000 jobs this year as Nuclear Electric, the National Grid and regional electricity companies increase efforts to improve efficiency. The planned losses have emerged from the sector's half yearly reporting season which ends on Friday. The 13 companies that have reported so far have disclosed plans suggesting that at least 7,000 staff will have left their jobs by the end of the current financial year, in March. The six regional electricity companies in England and Wales that report this week are likely to announce they are seeking job cuts of about 2,000, in line with the job losses announced by the six that have already reported. The four companies that comprised the pre-privatisation Central Electricity Generating Board will employ 25,000 people by the end of the financial year, compared with 48,000 in 1989 when the privatisation of the electricity industry began, according to Nuclear Electric estimates. Although opponents of privatisation will use the figures to try to embarrass the government, ministers will argue that the staff reductions are proof of the increased efficiencies produced by transferring public companies to the private sector. However, the company that is making the biggest contribution to the job cuts total is Nuclear Electric, which along with Scottish Nuclear, is still state owned. Nuclear Electric, which is pressing strongly to be privatised, has already cut 650 jobs from the 11,323 it had at the start of the year. It expects another 1,300 to go by April. National Power and PowerGen, the two English generators, which made swift progress in cutting jobs after privatisation, have slowed down their slimming programmes. Nevertheless in the first half of the year National Power shed 600 jobs and PowerGen about 150. Analysts say job losses at the two companies combined could reach at least 1,300 by the year end. The National Grid expects to lose 700 jobs by the end of the year, leaving a total of 4,750. The six regional companies that have already reported have plans for 2,300 job losses. Regional companies have a strong incentive to shed staff this year because their distribution businesses are being reviewed by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. The largest cuts have been made by Eastern Electricity and Seeboard. Eastern, having cut more than 1,100 jobs last year, is expecting a further 850 reduction this year, reducing employee numbers to 6,300. Seeboard has already cut 500 jobs in its core businesses in the first half of the year and expects more.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Markets: The stock pot threatens to boil over - Wall Street AS THE first quarterly reporting cycle draws to a close, Wall Street was left wondering whether the recent stock market rally may have been overcooked. The ingredients required for a sustained bull market are still there. Low domestic interest rates, uncompetitive yields on alternative forms of investment, unthreatening inflation, a recovering economy, improved corporate earnings and continued large net inflows of investor cash all bode well for stocks. It is not the ingredients, however, that may be at fault. Rather, investors may have turned the heat up too high under the equity pot. This, at least, appears to be the conclusion of two influential Wall Street market strategists - Byron Wein of Morgan Stanley and Michael Sherman of Shearson Lehman Brothers - who this week announced changes in their asset allocation recommendations. Both reduced by 5 percentage points the proportion of an investor's portfolio they recommend should be held in stocks. Wein now thinks all-equity portfolios should be 80 per cent in stocks, and not 85 per cent, and 20 per cent in cash. The Morgan Stanley strategist justified his shift on the grounds that he believes the recovery in the economy and in corporate earnings will not be strong enough to warrant stocks at current prices. Shearson's Sherman now suggests that a balanced portfolio should have 55 per cent in stocks, 40 per cent in bonds and 5 per cent in cash. Admittedly, Sherman said the changes reflected a 'neutral' view of market prospects over the next six to nine months, rather than a wholly negative view. He also said the revision was based on an expectation that short-term interest rates could soon rise, which would undermine the attractiveness of equities relative to other short-term assets. His message: over the near term the market has potential for as much movement on the downside as on the upside. While much has been said and written about fundamental market valuations - stocks look pricey judged by trailing earnings, but affordable so long as future earnings prove as strong as forecast - attention has switched to technical indicators, some of which suggest equities are overvalued. The number of stocks reaching 52-week highs has been steadily declining, an indication of overheating, say analysts. Another bad sign is that the ratio of stocks that rise each day to those that fall appears to have peaked. Then there is the issue of why the broader market indices - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index - have been lagging the record-setting Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow is trading within a hair's breadth of its all-time high, primarily because investors have been so keen on big capitalisation cyclical stocks, while the S &amp; P 500 and the Nasdaq composite languish some way below their records. Analysts would like to see the broader indices catch up with the Dow before calling the recent gains a deep and sustainable market rally. Even more worrying is the rise in long-term bond yields, which this week clambered back above 8 per cent as the Treasury market expressed its concern about inflation, the ever-growing budget deficit and supply pressure from the quarterly refunding round. With yields that high, and stock prices wobbling at historically expensive levels, yield-hungry investors could be lured from equities. Certain sectors have had good runs, none more so than the long-beleaguered banks, which hogged the limelight in a week that saw the completion of the biggest bank merger in US history - the marriage of BankAmerica and Security Pacific. Financial sector analysts are increasingly positive about the outlook for bank earnings. Some argue that an end to the long crisis in the industry may be near. Judging by the latest quarterly results, that optimism may not be misplaced. This week Chase Manhattan led the way with a 20 per cent improvement in net income to Dollars 141m, followed by Citicorp, which posted doubled profits of Dollars 183m, way ahead of market expectations. Equally stellar performances came from Wells Fargo, BancOne, Bankers Trust and Chemical Banking.  ------------------------------------- Monday    3336.31  - 30.19 Tuesday   3343.25  +  6.94 Wednesday 3338.77  -  4.48 Thursday  3348.61  +  9.84 Friday    3324.46  - 24.15  -------------------------------------</p>

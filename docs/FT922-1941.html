			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Rome may exempt foreigners from withholding tax The Italian Treasury is studying ways of issuing bonds free of withholding tax for foreign investors, according to a senior Finance Ministry official. Although the scheme is not new, the news had an immediate effect on the market, which has been extremely sensitive recently. Trading in Italian government bonds has been highly volatile for the past two weeks following growing political uncertainties about Italy's ability to meet the EC's convergence criteria for Economic and Monetary Union. However, the notion of issuing debt free of withholding tax for foreigners is fraught with difficulties, and may even be impossible. Paying coupons gross to foreign investors would lead to the creation of two markets for Italian government paper. A German attempt in the late 1980s to introduce withholding tax on domestic government debt proved short-lived owing to technical difficulties. Such complexities would be even greater in the case of Italy, where interest on government bonds is paid on an accrued basis rather than as a lump sum on the coupon date. The Finance Ministry said the step was being considered in view of repayments of withholding tax made to foreign bondholders in recent months. The decision to start reimbursements provided a considerable fillip to the domestic bond market, which has gained in appeal for foreign investors over the past two years thanks to Italy's relatively high interest rates and a variety of reforms which have improved liquidity and trading practices. The ministry said all outstanding claims on government paper had now been repaid. It implied that the size and number of reimbursements had triggered the Italian authorities to look into ways to streamline the system further, including exempting foreign investors from withholding tax altogether.</p>

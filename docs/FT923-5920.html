			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: MAN improves despite weakness abroad MAN, one of Germany's biggest engineering groups, managed a 3 per cent net profit increase last year in spite of continuing weakness in overseas business, which accounted for 64 per cent of sales, and fading demand in the domestic market. Total sales rose only DM140m (Dollars 100m), about 1 per cent, to DM19.2bn. Turnover from core interests in trucks and buses, diesel engines, rotary printing presses and plant construction rose DM900m, but the gains were eroded by a DM600m fall in sales of engineering products, including sheet-fed presses, and a DM200m decline in steel trading. Net profits rose about 3 per cent to DM12m, net return on sales was up from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent, and the company said yesterday that it intended to maintain its dividend at DM12 a share. The group added that current orders of DM16.8bn - more than half in the most profitable business sectors - provided a 'good basis for profits' in the current year. However, it noted, there were no detectable signs of recovery in export markets. At the end of June, its foreign order book was down 10 per cent compared with the same time last year. Domestic orders were 6 per cent lower. New delivery contracts for heavy vehicles suffered from falling demand in the former GDR during the year, and totalled DM7.2bn compared with DM9bn. However, the company said, demand was still stronger than in 1989-90, the last 'normal' year before unification. MAN reduced its workforce last year. The 2 per cent cut, mainly on printing equipment and other engineering divisions, took numbers employed to 63,250. The workforce in the commercial vehicle subsidiaries rose 1,000. The group invested a record DM1bn, mainly in its vehicles and printing factories. Orenstein &amp; Koppel, the building and mining equipment maker, has returned to the black with a DM7m pre-tax profit in the first half of this year, compared with a DM19m loss last time. O&amp;K, part of Hoesch, the steel and engineering group recently taken over by Krupp, increased sales 9 per cent to DM865m, and cut 600 jobs in the period under review.</p>

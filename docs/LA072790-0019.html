			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARKINSON INJURES KNEE AGAIN DURING DRILL WITH BRONCOS  </P> <P> Brent Parkinson, a former Canyon High standout who sustained two knee injuries  during his collegiate football career at USC, suffered an injury to his left  knee Thursday during the Denver Broncos' afternoon practice in Greeley, Colo.  </P> <P> "It looks like it could be a partially torn cartilage," Coach Dan Reeves said.  </P> <P> "It immediately started swelling on him. He'll be tested in the morning.  </P> <P> "Any time you get somebody hurt, it's a concern. We felt Brent was a tremendous  prospect. We had high hopes for him. We had just moved him to right tackle  (behind starter Ken Lanier), and he's a good snapper. I hope it's not serious."  </P> <P> The injury occurred as Parkinson was blocking for a running play during a  non-tackling drill.  </P> <P> Parkinson, a rookie free agent, had surgery on his left knee in 1988 to repair  the cruciate ligament and described that injury as his most serious.  </P> <P> On the sixth play of this year's Rose Bowl game, Parkinson sustained a ligament  strain to his right knee, which kept him out of the rest of the game. That  injury did not require surgery. STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

In statements to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY on the 24th  anniversary of the issuance of the historic 11 March statement,  the two Kurdish officials added that settling the Kurdish issue  and halting infighting in the Kurdistan region were only some of  the significant accomplishments of the glorious 17-30 July  revolution. They reiterated the Kurds' allegiance to the  historic and unique leadership of leader President Saddam  Husayn. They also reaffirmed their willingness to make  sacrifices to safeguard Iraq's unity and thwart the enemies'  schemes, which aim to undermine Iraq's sovereignty and national  unity.    The two Kurdish officials noted that the lawlessness,  instability, insecurity, anarchy, murders, and thefts currently  prevailing in the Kurdistan region are cogent proof of the false  claims made by archtraitors and archagents, who have accepted  subservience to their foreign masters, the enemies of Iraq.    Concluding their statements, they asserted that agents and  traitors will be defeated, with God's help and the determination  of zealous Kurds, particularly since the zealous Kurds have  always demonstrated their support for the courageous leadership  of leader President Saddam Husayn.</p>

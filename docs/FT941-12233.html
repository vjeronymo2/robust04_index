			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / German machine tool industry shows some sign of growth Germany's machine tool industry, one of the key sectors reflecting trends in the country's economy, is showing some sign of growth, the association for German machine tool manufacturers, VDMA, said yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey from Berlin. Foreign orders in December rose by 19 per cent compared with the same period the previous year, although there were few signs that orders from European Union countries and eastern Europe were increasing. The VDMA said that south-east Asia, the US and Latin America accounted for the bulk of the orders. But domestic orders continued to decrease in December, falling by 14 per cent over the same period last year.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Property: Foreign forays in bargain Britain - The impact of direct overseas investment The time to sell is when a foreigner starts to buy,' is an old investment adage that held true in the UK in the late 1980s: between 1988 and 1990, an unprecedented wave of overseas money - some Pounds 7.5bn - poured into Britain's commercial property. In contrast, while capital value growth reached a peak in 1988, rising by some 20 per cent in that year alone, by 1990 values were falling sharply as the market reacted to rising interest rates, a deteriorating economy, weakening demand and oversupply. In hindsight the burst of foreign investment activity was both poorly timed and too focused on central London offices. If overseas investment in UK property had ceased at the end of 1990, observers would have rightly described the foray as a passing fad that rose and fell with the boom and bust of the late 1980s. However, the recent renewal of foreign activity is a positive dev-elopment, suggesting interest in UK property is likely to be sustained. In the last property cycle in the late 1980s, overseas investors followed the market up to its peak and beyond; since last year they have been setting the pace in exploiting opportunities in the low point of the cycle - with property prices at historically high yields and the economy recovering. As a result, the old investment adage now has a hollow ring; no doubt many UK investors wish they too had spotted the opportunities at the low point in 1992 and begun buying as quickly as, for example, the Germans. Although some way off the peak levels of 1988-90, foreign direct investment in UK property this year looks set to total Pounds 2bn-Pounds 2.25bn. This activity has been spurred by several factors, notably sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism last September which has made UK assets relatively cheap; lower interest rates; and an improving economy. Collectively, these factors justify industry expectations of continuing strong inflows of foreign investment at least until the end of 1994. Another underlying attraction has been the UK's landlord and tenant system with its long leases, rent reviews and tenant responsibilities for repair and insurance. At a broader level institutional investors look to cross-border diversification as a means of achieving a more balanced portfolio and a spread of risk. The continuing process of deregulation of cross-border capital transfers in Europe makes a globally-spread portfolio more attainable. However, the inability of most European property markets to provide objective performance measures is a constraint on potential foreign investors. The UK's established market and reputation for high-quality measures of performance help ensure it receives at least its fair share of international flows of investment. The greater overseas investment in the UK in the past year has been generated from a large number of countries. Between 1988 and 1990, overseas investment was dominated by Japanese and Swedish investors; in 1992 the Germans were dominant, accounting for about 60 per cent of the total. This year German investors have been responsible for about a third of the Pounds 1.6bn total invested in the UK with other European sources accounting for 25 per cent, the Middle East 17 per cent and the Far East 15 per cent. The broadening of the overseas investor base is an important change. It potentially heralds a future pattern of activity less volatile than has been the case with one or two countries dominating the target country. Cross-border investment is inevitably mercurial as it reflects a mix of forces at work in the source market as well as in the target market. As a result, there is a greater prospect that the more diverse mix of overseas investors will reduce the likelihood of sharp rises and falls in investment. In addition to the enlarged investor base there has been a marked expansion in locations identified for investments. A narrow focus on central London still predominates but over the past couple of years a quarter of purchases by overseas investors has been in the regional property markets. This reflects several influences: reduced availability of suitable property in London; an increasing understanding of the UK provincial markets; and a belief that performance will be strong in certain sectors or regions. This broader approach to location is likely to continue. Investment from overseas can now be considered a permanent and important part of the UK commercial property market. Over the past five years foreign investors have accounted for at least 15 per cent of all annual transactions. Yet their impact has been much greater than the figure suggests, given the particular concentration of foreign money in central London. In the immediate future, although flows of overseas money for direct property purchases should continue to exceed Pounds 2bn a year, the greater geographical spread of investments across the UK will diffuse the impact. Where the effect may continue to be strongly felt will be in the market for properties in excess of Pounds 50m. In this category, the capacity of certain overseas investors to compete for the most valuable lots should continue to bring an additional element of competition to an, at times, illiquid part of the market.

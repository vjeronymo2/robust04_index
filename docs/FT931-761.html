			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Indl Bank of Japan sells Isosceles debt INDUSTRIAL BANK of Japan has sold Pounds 70m of Isosceles debt, thought to represent all or nearly all of its exposure to the retail group in the middle of a Pounds 1.4bn financial restructuring. The debt was bought at auction by US investors. Isosceles, parent of the Gateway supermarket chain, was not officially informed of the sale, suggesting that it was done on a 'sub-participation' basis meaning that IBJ would still be regarded as the lender. The new owners would not have a voice in the restructuring talks. IBJ said the buyers were supportive to the restructuring and the sale was made to take advantage of its ability to offset the loss on the disposal against profits for tax purposes. Isosceles has a standstill agreement with its lenders which expires on May 28. However, some trade creditors are beginning to be anxious that a deal is in place some time before the standstill expires, because they supply the chain on credit ranging mainly from 30 to 60 days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] forces control  the entire Byumba Prefecture, the entire Prefecture of Kibungo,  about three quarters of of the Kigali Prefecture, and it  controls half the Ruhengeri Prefecture.    This is the part of the country that has already been  snatched from the clique of leaders and their stooges: the  presidential guards, the [Coalition for the defense of the  republic militia, [Interahamwe], and the Revolutionary National  Movement for Democracy and Development militia, Impuzamugambi.  As for the rest of the country, it will not take long. Let  them be strong.    As for Kigali town, the rebels control northern, eastern,  and  southeastern parts. Fighting is taking place around Ruhengeri.  In the south of the country, fighting took place in the  southern part of Bugesera and now the military barracks of the  region has fallen to the rebels who now control it. [passage  omitted]</p>

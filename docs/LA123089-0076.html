			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE DISTRICT TO OPEN 2 NEW SCHOOLS ON TUESDAY  </P> <P> The fast-growing Palmdale School District is set to open two new schools on  Tuesday, easing the burden on the district's existing facilities and sending  about 1,350 students to new classrooms on their first day back from the holiday  break.  </P> <P> The highlight will be the opening of the district's $5-million Desert Rose  Elementary School, a permanent facility that will start with about 750  students. The children had been using portable classrooms on the same campus  since the scheduled fall opening of the new school had been delayed.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the district will open Mesquite Elementary School, a $2-million  temporary collection of bungalows that will be used by about 600 students who  spent the fall at Chaparral Elementary School, waiting for their own school to  be completed.  </P> <P> Supt. Forrest McElroy said the district now has room for about 13,000 students.  "We're certainly in pretty good shape," he said. Originally, enrollment was  expected to top 13,000 this year, but with a slowed housing market, district  officials now expect it to remain under 12,000.  </P> <P> The new schools will not require hiring of additional teachers and  administrators, since both will come with the students from their prior  quarters. Nor should the changes alter the size of classes, since those already  had been restricted under the teachers' contract.  </P> <P> But McElroy said the two new schools will ease the burden on libraries and  cafeterias at the schools the students are leaving.  </P> <P> The student population has almost tripled since 1984 from nearly 4,400 to an  expected 11,700 this spring, so the Palmdale district has many schools sharing  campuses and thousands of students in temporary quarters.  </P> <P> The Desert Rose students had been sharing their temporary classrooms with  another elementary school, Wildflower, on the same 10-acre site. With the  opening of the new Desert Rose school there, Wildflower can expand, and both  schools will now have separate cafeteria and library facilities.  </P> <P> Students and teachers at Mesquite, which had been one of three schools crowded  into temporary quarters on the Chaparral campus, will have their own bungalows  on a separate five-acre site. Eventually, the district hopes to build a  permanent school there.  </P></p>

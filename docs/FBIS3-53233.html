			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Defense Report" by R. Selva Raja] </F>   [Text] The armed forces have been alerted following secret  reports received by the Military Intelligence Unit stating that  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE] are preparing to  attack the Karainagar naval base and the Oorkavalturai and  Mandaitivu Army camps. In its report, the Military Intelligence  Unit has stated that after the destruction of the  Nagathevanturai naval base, the next LTTE target will be the  Karainagar base. The Tigers took six high-speed boats called  water jets from the Nagathevanturai base. They also have two  more boats of this type. Defense authorities are anticipating  an attack on the Karainagar and Kankesanturai units. Navy gun  boats and ships have been kept in readiness in Paruthiturai and  Kankesanturai territorial waters to repel an LTTE attack.    Some night infiltration by extremists was detected on  Oorkavalturai island. Recently two extremists were shot dead  for landing on the island. Therefore, the armed forces are kept  in combat readiness on the islands, which are under the control  of the Army. Meanwhile, new Army commander Major General Gerry  De Silva is going to take command on 1 January. Defense experts  predict that during De Silva's tenure, there may be major  changes in the Army. Tamil political circles say that one has  to wait and see whether he will adopt the policy of  confrontation followed by outgoing Lieutenant General Cecil  Waidyaratne, or encourage negotiations.    Meanwhile, local elections are going to be held in the  Eastern Province and Vavuniya. Nomination papers have been  invited for this purpose. It is a different matter that the  announcement for the elections has triggered strong protests  among the Tamil parties. Reports from Jaffna say that President  Wijetunge's announcement to launch an `operation' [preceding  word in English] in the north after these elections has created  a major stir in the LTTE circles. The president's announcement  indicates that a major offensive will be launched against the  LTTE. In Jaffna, the Tigers have announced that the speeches  made at last week's United National Party Conference indicate  that according to the president's plan, a major offensive  against the LTTE in Jaffna is planned for February. They have  also announced that they are not ready for any talks, their  doors are closed for negotiation, and they are also prepared for  the war.    The Tigers adopted the path of confrontation after former  President J.R. Jayewardene announced that the government was  prepared for either war or peace. Jayewardene's announcement  followed the death of 13 soldiers in the landmine blasts at  Tirunelveli in Jaffna in 1983. Thousands of soldiers were  killed within 10 years and tens of thousands of people became  refugees. Saying that today's problem is only terrorism and not  ethnic strife, the present president has announced that he is  going to give surgical treatment [chathira chikichai] to the  north. Tamil political leaders say that in the future,  everyone will understand the connotations of the announcement.    Meanwhile, the government is seriously thinking about  declaring the northern area to be a war zone. It is learned  from highly reliable sources that Wijetunge has asked the three  armed forces chiefs to be ready for a major conflict in February  and to devise a strategy for his consideration before the 4  February holiday. It is certain that a major offensive will be  undertaken in the north after the next independence day.  Reports from Jaffna suggest that the Tigers are getting ready  for a major conflict after their offensive in Pooneryn. The  Tigers have constituted hundreds of suicide squads to counter  the war to be undertaken by the government in the north.  Reports say that the Tigers are planning to deploy many more  suicide squads than they deployed against the Army's Yaldevi  operation and for their Frog Leap operation launched to overrun  the Pooneryn and Nagathevanturai army and naval bases.    In any case, after the local elections in Eastern Province  and Vavuniya, a major military offensive is certain in the  north. The security force officers in Eastern Province and  Vavuniya have already been directed to see that the Tigers do  not infiltrate the areas where polling will take place during  the elections. In the new year, the election process will be  set in motion, but the leader of a popular Tamil political party  has announced in Colombo that no political party with any  self-respect will take part in the elections. Whatever is the  case, there will no surprise even if the new year is declared as  a year of war.</p>

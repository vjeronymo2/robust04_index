			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniyel Aviv, Shlomo Dror, and ITIM] </F>   [Excerpts] Rallies against the peace agreement signed in  Cairo were yesterday held in Ashdod, Jerusalem, Qiryat Mal'akhi,  and the Valleys District.    Dozens of right-wing supporters gathered in the early  morning  hours in the Ashdod junction and blocked traffic. The  demonstrators carried placards denouncing the peace process, set  tires on fire, and some stoned cars driven by territories  residents on their way to work in Israel. Massive police troops  were summoned to the junction, and three demonstrators were  taken in for questioning. [passage omitted]    Terror victims' relatives staged a demonstration opposite  the  prime minister's residence in Jerusalem yesterday afternoon.  The police made sure that the demonstrators stayed on the  sidewalk near the prime minister's residence, and the protest  ended in relative quiet.    Another demonstration was held near the Hebrew University on  Giv'at Ram last night. Several dozen demonstrators carried  torches and placards denouncing the agreement; two tires were  burned. One of the demonstrators, who had probably set the  tires on fire, was detained by policemen.    No unusual events were reported yesterday in East Jerusalem,  with the exception of a partially observed commercial strike.  Beefed up police deployed throughout East and West Jerusalem  all day yesterday to deal with disturbances.    About 1,000 inhabitants of Qiryat Mal'akhi and the adjoining  towns yesterday rallied in the Qastina junction at the approach  to Qiryat Mal'akhi protesting the government plan to permit  Palestinian traffic from Gaza to Jericho to cross through Qiryat  Mal'akhi. [passage omitted]    Other rallies protesting the agreement were yesterday held  in  the Golani, Tzemah, Bet She'an, and Habiq'a junctions. The  rallies were organized by Golan Heights settlers. Some 50  people gathered in the Golani junction and attempted to set  tires on fire and block traffic. The police prevented the  demonstrators from blocking traffic in all the junctions.    [Reporting on page A6 of the same issue of HA'ARETZ, Amnon  Yosef adds: "Hundreds of settlers from the Qatif Bloc and  northern Gaza Strip settlements yesterday participated in a  rally at the Neve Deqalim settlement, protesting the agreement  with the PLO. In all the Qatif Bloc settlements, schools  remained closed and settlers did not go out to work."]</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] On 26 May, three international communications  carriers announced their earnings reports for the fiscal year  ending in March 1994. Despite languishing economic trends, the  three international carriers experienced steady growth in demand  for their services accompanied by increased revenues and  profits. International Digital Communications (IDC; Daito ward,  Tokyo; Katsuto Orihata, president) recorded recurring profits  for the first time since establishment of the firm. All of the  firms attribute their favorable results to increased use of  communications linked with Asia as a whole, including China.    Of total revenues, the portion attributable to telephone  toll  charges was 192.7 billion yen, a 5.1-percent increase over the  prior year, for Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD); 41.529 billion yen,  a 29.3-perecent increase, for IDC; and 38.902 billion yen, a  23.7-percent increase, for International Telecommunication of  Japan (ITJ; Chuo ward, Tokyo; Hiroshi Ohara, president).    At the beginning of the year, initial estimates forecast  growth of 9 percent for international communications demand for  Japan as a whole, but it appears that growth of  telecommunications linked with Asia grew at a rate in excess of  10 percent. Sources at KDD say, "China-related demand grew in  the mid-30-percent range and Philippines-related demand grew 12  percent," with similar sharp increases experienced by all of the  firms in relation to China, the Philippines, and South Korea,  second only to the traffic recorded with the United States. It  appears that the trend is backed up by increasing travel to  Japan and rising commercial operations in Asia by Japanese firms.    Capital investments totaled 45 billion yen for KDD, 9.6  billion yen for IDC, and 14.2 billion yen for ITJ, reflecting a  decline from recent years because of the absence of major  capital investments involving construction of international  marine cable links.</p>

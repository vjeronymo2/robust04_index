			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Time-Tested Norms] </F>   [Text] Forty years ago today, China and India put forward a  joint communique setting out the following norms to be observed  in relations between the nations of the world: Mutual respect  for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual nonaggression;  noninterference in each other's internal affairs; equality and  mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence.    Over the past four decades, these norms have become commonly  known as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.    At the end of World War II, a wave of national liberation  swept across the world. Many nations shook off the yoke of  colonialism and became independent. They needed a foreign  policy that could safeguard their hard won freedoms and protect  the development of their economies.    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence reflected their  aspirations and were warmly welcomed by them.    China not only participated in the initiation of the five  principles but has observed these principles as a responsible  member of the world community.    China adheres to these principles not only in its relations  with the developing countries but also in its relations with  developed countries, despite differing political systems.    By upholding these principles, China has won successive  diplomatic victories and made more and more friends across the  world.    Owing to the efforts of peace-loving countries such as  China,  the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have helped to  preserve world peace, resolve conflicts, and enhance harmonious  relations among nations over the past 40 years.    With the end of the Cold War, the 1990's has witnessed great  changes on the world political map.    However, in the new and fluid political situation, the five  principles are more important than ever. They embody the spirit  of the United Nations Charter, reflect the essentials of a new  and equitable form of relations among the nations, and represent  the time-tested norms for world dialogue. They are vital in  establishing the guidelines for a new world political and  economic order.    Nowadays, some nations seek to interfere in the internal  affairs of others, infringing on the sovereignty of other  nations under the guise of "human rights" and "democracy." They  seek to bully the weaker, smaller, and poorer nations in a bid  to force the latter to accept their values and dance to their  tune.    But history has shown that any arrogant bahaviour on the  part  of the big powers which goes against the Five Principles of  Peaceful Coexistence will never get anywhere. After all, times  have changed. And the sooner these countries change their  outdated practices, the better it is for them and for the world  community.    The global community is characterized by its diversity. The  differences between the nations should be recognized and  respected.    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence must be firmly  upheld in handling the relations between the nations so that  peace and development can be enhanced.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / People: Buba's new baby banker Gerd Hausler, one of only two candidates ever to pull off a 'one' in the tough apprenticeship exams for fast stream Bundesbank officials, seldom fails to make an impression, writes Katharine Campbell. So it comes as no surprise to German central bankers that, at the tender age of 42, their smooth-talking colleague is expected to succeed Gunter Storch in the council's seven-man directorate when Storch retires at 68 next month. Hausler would be the most youthful director ever - Helmut Schlesinger, Buba president until last October, was hitherto the youngest when he was promoted at 48. With his fluent American and French and his bulging international contacts book, he should also inject a cosmopolitan air into council proceedings. As well as showing talent in the bank's basketball team, Hausler worked for most of the 1980s as the then president Karl Otto Pohl's personal assistant. A veteran of the international department, he had also earlier had a spell at the Bank for International Settlements as pa to Gunther Schleiminger, who was general manager. He has run the main credit department since 1990. Closely associated with the Free Democratic party, he is also a natural replacement for the similarly aligned Storch, thereby maintaining the tradition that one member of the directorate is of liberal persuasions. With the approval of the Bonn cabinet already secured, formal confirmation of the appointment now appears to rest only on the signature of Germany's president Richard von Weizsacker.</p>

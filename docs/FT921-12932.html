			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Progressive Democrats tell Haughey to go MR Charles Haughey's coalition partners last night told him to resign or lose their support. The Progressive Democrats told the Irish prime minister 'to take the necessary step to restore the authority and effectiveness of the government' or face the withdrawal of their support following the Budget day next Wednesday. This is a thinly-veiled call for his resignation. Without PD support the government will collapse, precipitating a general election. The ultimatum was issued after a day in which Mr Haughey came under intense pressure to resign from cabinet colleagues. The crisis erupted on Tuesday when Mr Sean Doherty, a former justice minister, said Mr Haughey had known of illegal phone-tapping in 1982 for which Mr Doherty took the blame at the time. Government and party spokesmen were uncharacteristically silent about a meeting yesterday between Mr O'Malley and Mr Haughey. Speculation was rife yesterday that Mr Haughey was about to resign, although his spokesman said: 'I have no sense of that at the moment'. PD senators were yesterday instructed by Mr O'Malley to support the tabling of an opposition no-confidence motion in Mr Haughey, but the motion was ruled out of order by the Senate's chairman. On Wednesday night the PD issued a strong warning to Mr Haughey, saying they viewed this latest crisis 'with the utmost gravity' and that 'the credibility and stability of the government (must) be immediately restored'. Several Fianna Fail ministers, led by by Mr Bertie Ahern the finance minister, were yesterday working on a proposal to hold a parliamentary party meeting after the presentation of the 1992 Budget in the Dail next week, at which Mr Haughey would either resign, or face a vote of no confidence. An attempt to oust Mr Haughey last November, led by two cabinet ministers and a group of backbenchers, failed. Mr Haughey was able to sway wavering backbenchers then by a commitment to finish an immediate agenda of work ahead of him, and then reconsider his position. This was interpreted as this spring. At a press conference last week however, Mr Haughey said 'there is no timetable' for his departure. It is thought that a majority of Fianna Fail backbenchers would now support Mr Haughey's removal. The most likely contender for Mr Haughey's replacement is Mr Albert Reynolds, the former finance minister who was sacked for leading November's attempt to oust Mr Haughey.</p>

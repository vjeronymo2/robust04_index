			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Children hurt Several children were injured when a coach taking them home from a church outing lost control, police said today. The coach, carrying 31 children and 13 adults, ran across a roundabout and narrowly avoided two cars before coming to a stop on a grassy bank on the A380 at the junction with the Torbay ring road, Devon. Some children were treated in hospital for shock before being released; one 12-year-old girl was detained overnight for observation.</p>

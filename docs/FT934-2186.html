			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tax change forced Scottish plant job cuts Sir, Your Article 'US group cuts 200 jobs in Ayrshire' (October 29) misses a very key point - that the UK and EU governments effectively changed the tax position of the plant in Scotland. When Conner opened its plant in 1990, disc drives imported into the EC attracted a small duty (4.9 per cent). This amount helped Conner cover the higher costs of production in Scotland compared to plants in the Far East. Our competitors made several attempts to get this duty removed - finally doing so via a quota loophole which included imports from certain countries in Asia where most disc drives are made. We were then left with paying duty on parts being imported while finished products were imported duty free. Conner did not get the support it should have from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Scottish Office to close this loophole or administer the quota effectively. Conner has committed significant capital, resources, technology and management time to its operation in Scotland. We also benefited from a fine workforce. But if a government changes the regulatory conditions such that higher cost and lower prices result, the business model on which a plant is founded will no longer hold up. The real nonsense from the UK taxpayers' standpoint is that they paid to help set up the plant, then paid for competitive products to be imported from the Far East.

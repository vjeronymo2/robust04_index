			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: MacPhail plans rights issue in new year MacPhail Holdings, the South African coal distributor, said it planned a rights issue in early 1995 as the first step in a local and international expansion programme, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. At a meeting on January 6 shareholders would be asked to approve a proposal to increase authorised share capital to R15m (Dollars 4m) divided into 30m ordinary shares of 50 cents each, the company said in a statement. 'Subject to this approval the company will then proceed with a rights offer early in the new year.' The proceeds would be mainly used to repay short-term debt which the company said was raised earlier to fund two essential growth projects, continued expansion of its materials handling infrastructure, and an investment in a new bulk coal distribution centre on the East Rand. The rights offer would also provide additional working capital to fund stockpiling ahead of the 1995 winter.</p>

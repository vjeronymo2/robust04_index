			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Smoke signal? Warburg's Sir David Scholey has been telling anyone who cares to listen that he's faintly embarrassed by being the bookmakers' favourite candidate to become the next Governor of the Bank of England. He really has no ambitions to fill that post - or so he says. Few in the City take him seriously. Fellow bankers generally say he is the best candidate and they do not believe he would turn down the post. Hence the amusement at the speculation that Lord Weinstock has approached him to join the GEC board, with a view to Scholey's eventually becoming chairman. True, he and Lord Weinstock go back a long way. Sir Ronald Grierson, who retired as a GEC vice-chairman last year, was an old Warburg hand, and Weinstock's heir, Simon, worked at Warburg for five years. But would Scholey really want to take on the chairmanship of GEC which is regarded by many as little more than a high-powered public relations job? Aside from Lord Nelson, all GEC chairman up to now have been former politicians, the ambassadorial rather than the entrepreneurial type. Everyone knows that it's 68-year-old Weinstock who pulls the strings. Who takes over from him is the real question. Of course, when Weinstock eventually steps down, GEC may well require a very different type of chairman. In the meantime, the speculation is probably either a smokescreen while Scholey waits to find out about the governorship, or else someone has got his name mixed up with that of Sir Bob Scholey, British Steel's ex-chairman. If only he were 10 years younger, he would have made an excellent GEC chairman. It's hard to believe that GEC needs a banker at the helm.</p>

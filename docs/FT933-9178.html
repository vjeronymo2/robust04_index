			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Islanders fear the effect of a dirty word: A Scots ferries review may advise selling off a 'lifeline' THE Scottish Office yesterday named KPMG Management Consulting as the consultants who are to report on subsidised ferry services to the Scottish islands. KPMG's remit includes the politically explosive task of considering the possible privatisation of Caledonian MacBrayne, the state-owned shipping company which operates on the west coast. In May Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said he wanted to look at options for 'private-sector participation' in services operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, as well as review the subsidised shipping services to Orkney and Shetland, where the biggest operator is P&amp;O Scottish Ferries. The fact that the future of Caledonian MacBrayne was to be reviewed, for the third time in a decade, with the explicit mention of privatisation as an option, provoked uproar which has never really subsided. Yesterday hundreds of people from all 23 west-coast islands served by its ferries converged on Oban, one of the company's principal mainland ports, to express their opposition to privatisation. Mr Brian Wilson MP, a Labour transport spokesman, said: 'Islanders understand quite clearly that privatisation could only mean higher fares and loss of lifeline services.' Although Mr Lang has stressed that he is committed to continuing subsidies for 'lifeline' services, the phrase on many islanders' lips yesterday was 'cutting our lifeline'. Caledonian MacBrayne operates ferries to the Hebridean islands and around the Firth of Clyde, providing an essential service with its 32 ferries. With privatisation a dirty word to many Scots and Caledonian MacBrayne being anxious to carry on as before, the company is benefiting from a wave of public affection and favourable media coverage. 'It's questionable if changes are in the interests of either the customers or of the government,' said Mr Colin Paterson, CalMac's managing director. 'We think we are running services to the islands in the most economical way.' CalMac received a Scottish Office subsidy of Pounds 6m last year which almost covered its loss of Pounds 6.2m on turnover of Pounds 33m. Mr Paterson points out that the subsidy has steadily been falling as a percentage of turnover and that the 1992 subsidy is smaller in both money and real terms than that of 1983. That was the year Mr Paterson arrived from North Sea Ferries to improve the running of a company whose long-standing inefficiency had led it to be called the curse of the Hebrides. Since then, he said: 'We've brought the company into the 20th century'. CalMac began to market its services to tourists. It started a big programme of upgrading its fleet with newer and larger vessels. Because of the increase in shipping capacity and services, and with the growth in the economy of the islands, the number of passengers carried has risen from 4.3m in 1983 to 6.3m last year, while the number of cars has nearly doubled in that period to 1.3m. The company says a subsidy continues to be necessary because it has to operate uneconomic routes in winter as well as summer, and to service debt on its substantial ship replacement programme. The subsidy this financial year will rise by Pounds 1m to Pounds 7m to help pay for a new ferry to the island of Arran. CalMac's subsidy is to be boosted by a further Pounds 10.5m over three years to help pay for a new ship for the Ullapool-Stornoway route. Normally CalMac borrows long-term to pay for ships, with the interest rate subsidised by the Department of Trade and Industry. It has occasionally obtained capital grants for new ships. Some 40 per cent of one of the bigger ferries, the Lord of the Isles, was paid for by the European Regional Development Fund, while 75 per cent of the new ship for the Ullapool-Stornoway route, costing more than Pounds 15m, will be paid for out of a Scottish Office capital grant. Observers in the shipping industry accept that CalMac is much more efficient than it was but several believe the ready availability of subsidies has given it a culture of solving problems by throwing money at them. 'CalMac has no incentive to save on vessels so it produces grandiloquent ships which require large crews,' said Mr Andrew Wilson, a director of Western Ferries. His company is almost the only direct competitor CalMac has, operating profitably between Gourock and Dunoon on the Clyde against a lossmaking CalMac service. For 13 years until 1981 it operated a successful service to the island of Islay, before having to withdraw after being, it said, undercut by the subsidised CalMac service. 'It's a flabby operation,' said a west-coast businessman with experience of operating ferries. 'Several of the islands would be better served by more small ships rather one big one.' Mr Paterson admits that only three of CalMac's routes make a positive contribution to the company's finances: the short crossing of the Kyle of Lochalsh to Skye (which will end when the Skye bridge opens in 1995); the route from Ullapool to Stornoway in Lewis and the Oban-to-Mull service. He said: 'It is essential that CalMac is kept as a single entity so that the profitable routes can subsidise the unprofitable ones. If it was broken up and private operators were allowed in they would take on the profitable routes and keep the profits. The government would then have to spend more on subsidies for the unprofitable ones.' Mr Andrew Wilson said: 'There are plenty of ways in which ferry services can be organised which would produce better services for the islands and a smaller burden for the taxpayer. But . . . I don't expect the report will lead to any change.'</p>

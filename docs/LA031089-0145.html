			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALISO VIEJO SETTLEMENT IN JEOPARDY;  </P> <P> GROWTH ACTIVIST REFUSES TO SIGN  </P> <P> A tentative settlement reached last January in a lawsuit to block the  20,000-unit Aliso Viejo project is in danger of falling apart because a key  slow-growth advocate is refusing to sign the agreement and is insisting on  pursuing court action.  </P> <P> Thomas Rogers, who led the unsuccessful campaign for a countywide slow-growth  initiative last year, said Thursday that he will not sign the settlement  agreement even though lawyers for Citizens for Sensible Growth and Traffic  Control and the Laguna Greenbelt environmental group, which brought the  lawsuit, have strongly urged him to do so.  </P> <P> "I won't sign it," Rogers said Thursday. "Greg Hile has told me I have to, but  I won't." Hile is the attorney for the slow-growth organization.  </P> <P> Rogers believes that his signature on the agreement is a key element because,  he said, the Mission Viejo Co., parent company of the developer of the Aliso  Viejo project, has made it a condition of the settlement. But Rogers said he  believes the lawsuit still has merit and that he wants to pursue it.  </P> <P> The cities of Laguna Beach and Irvine, which had joined the environmental and  slow-growth groups in support of the court action, signed settlement agreements  with the developer in January. Terms of the settlement basically require all  parties to drop their legal actions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planned Community  </P> <P> Aliso Viejo is a planned community whose lead developer is the Aliso Viejo Co.,  a subsidiary of the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> The complaint against the Aliso Viejo development was filed in Orange County  Superior Court to challenge the constitutionality of the project's development  agreement, which was approved early last year by the Board of Supervisors.  Rogers and other slow-growth advocates argued that the agreement, and more than  a dozen similar documents affecting other planned communities, were an illegal  attempt to circumvent the countywide slow-growth initiative, which subsequently  was defeated at the polls last June.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taxpayer Benefits  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that taxpayers will not receive any benefit from the  development agreement that could not have been charged to the Mission Viejo Co.  anyway, during the county's normal development approval process. Under state  law, extraordinary benefits are required to justify such development  agreements.  </P> <P> Hile said Thursday that he doesn't need Rogers' signature to settle the case,  but he acknowledged that he wants Rogers to cooperate. No money is available to  continue paying costs of the lawsuit, Hile said.  </P> <P> "He's only one member of the board," Hile said of Citizens for Sensible Growth  and Traffic Control. "We can get other board members to sign, but we're still  negotiating details of the settlement."  </P> <P> Rogers said he may try to raise money on his own to hire another lawyer to  pursue the case. "The settlement agreement is terrible," he said.  </P> <P> A Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman said the firm would have no comment because  "there are no signatures on the settlement" and the lawsuit is still active.  </P></p>

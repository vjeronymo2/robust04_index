			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Twilight crusade of an obdurate Pope: John Paul II's absolutist approach is upsetting Roman Catholics When Karol Wojtyla, Pope John Paul II, bishop of Rome, vicar of Christ, infallible in matters of faith and morals for the world's 950m Roman Catholics, emerges tomorrow on the main balcony in St Peter's Square to deliver his traditional Urbi et orbi Christmas message, there will be the usual cheers of 'Viva il Papa'. But there will be none of the spontaneous explosion of enthusiasm which greeted his first appearance on the same balcony 16 years ago. The crowds and the Roman Catholic church as a whole were stunned by the election of the first Polish Pope and the first non-Italian in 455 years to sit in St Peter's chair. He described himself as a man 'from a far country' amid the roars of the faithful. They saw a vigorous and charismatic man - a swimmer, footballer, skier, and actor - who had fought communist oppression in his native Poland and seemed decidedly the man to lead the Church into modern times: a social reformer launching a revanchist crusade to re-introduce Christianity into the modern secular societies of the west and re-invigorate the Church's missionary drive in the developing world. But with old age creeping up on him, the Pope's photogenic figure is increasingly stooped. Although he continues to attract huge crowds and his spirituality remains unchallenged, his reputation is more and more at risk from his conservatism. Instead of confidently leading a united Church into the third millennium, his moral and theological conservatism is creating divisions within the Church by alienating Catholics in modern industrialised society as well as provoking unholy wars between radicals and traditionalists in the developing world. Some accuse him of fundamentalism in his uncompromising views on abortion and artificial contraception. Many have been angered by his intolerance against dissenting Catholic theologians such as Hans Kung, the German who questioned the Pope's infallibility. The Pope's defence of celibacy has continued to drive priests away from the priesthood in large numbers. Just before he died, Graham Greene, a Catholic convert and critic of John Paul II, said the Pope reminded him of Ronald Reagan: 'He was a former actor and liked crowds and cameras.' In Latin America, his refusal to endorse the message of Marxist-inspired 'liberation theology' has led to fierce battles within the Church between radical priests and conservative bishops and a loss of Catholics comparable to that during the Reformation. In North America - with 60m Catholics, the Church's single largest source of funds - he has alienated many different interest groups, ranging from feminists and homosexuals to New Age devotees, all seeking an individual expression of their faith. In Africa and Asia, the appeal of traditional native religions are threatening the Roman mould. Even in his native Poland, the popularity of the Church has fallen. 'Send the priests to the moon' ('Ksieza Na Ksiezyc') and other anti-clerical slogans appear regularly in the streets of this most Catholic of countries. 'Those who save most are the people who avoid the priests,' is another favourite. But probably the most cruel is a variation on the old anti-communist slogan, 'get rid of the red'. Now they are saying, 'get rid of the black'. For the younger generation, the Church has to some extent replaced the old communist authoritarianism. It still commands the approval of 53 per cent, but that compares with more than 90 per cent when the communists were in power. Although 63 per cent of Poles still go to church once a week, one third of these do not believe that the Church serves society well. These dangers - and criticisms of the Wojtyla pontificate - are increasing at a time when the Pope's health can no longer be taken for granted. Since a fall in April breaking his right leg, he has appeared frail. Rumours of his illnesses abound. And, at the age of 74, he looks like a man working against the clock. 'Everywhere the Pope looks in the world, he sees religious decay and decline,' explains John Cornwell, an author and Cambridge University academic. 'He is wonderfully holy, but the Church is not only about good and evil but also all about politics with its right-wing, centrist and leftist factions.' John Paul II's mission remains unchanged: 'You must lead the Church into the third millennium,' his Polish mentor, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, told him when he was elected in 1978. Now, the main tasks he has set himself are to achieve a reconciliation with the Orthodox churches and to organise a special jubilee for the third Christian millennium. Meanwhile, his global odyssey continues: his 63rd pastoral visit, in January, will be one of his most arduous embracing the Philippines, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, the question of which direction the papacy might take under his successor is inevitably beginning to pre-occupy the Church. The forces for conservatism are strong. The Pope has ensured that the college of cardinals is well stocked with his own appointees. The formal proclamation of 30 new cardinals, on November 26, ensures that the conclave electing his successor will bear the stamp of the Polish pontiff's views. In the event of a new conclave, 100 of the 120 cardinals who are under the age of 80 and are allowed to vote have now been chosen by the Pope. This has led to further criticism from liberals, yearning for a less autocratic successor. Their favourite is the 66-year-old archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, a Jesuit with a reputation as a conciliator who is described frequently in Italy as the 'pope in waiting'. In all this, the Pope's health has become the greatest imponderable. In July 1992, a benign tumour was removed from his colon. Then, in April this year, he slipped in his bathroom. As a result of the fall, he has had metal alloy replacements for part of a broken thigh bone and has not recovered fully. Yet, the Pope refuses to rest. Joaquin Navarro Vals, the Vatican spokesman and one of the few with daily access to the Pope, says: 'The holy father works every day of the week, 16 hours a day, and he is 74 years old. No weekends.' The media, which he exploited so successfully in the early years of his papacy, is now taking an intense interest in his age and infirmities. The effects are cruelly visible on television and in photographs. In October, when the Pope confronted a crowd in front of St Peter's shouting 'Viva il Papa', he said as an aside: 'Per ora vive' ('At least he's still alive'). Despite this good humour, the Pope is becoming more distant and withdrawn in public, often slumped in meditation. There have always been two sides to his complex character - the philosopher wrapped in abstract thought and the emotional, poetic man of action. Now, the meditative side is taking over. This impression is reinforced by the interview with the Pope conducted by an Italian journalist, Vittorio Messori, and published in book form this autumn. Despite its frequently dense philosophical prose, the book has become an international best-seller - proving the extraordinary magnetism of Pope Wojtyla. It has topped the lists in the US and the UK; in France, it is in its fourth edition; in Italy, more than 830,000 copies have been sold. Editions are being prepared in Chinese and Russian. Yet, this evidence for the continuing influence of the Pope's strong conservative views has worried many of his critics within the Church. The danger, they argue, is that the Church risks finding itself with another 'Pio Nono' - a reference to Pius IX who, in 1870, consummated his 32-year pontificate with the First Vatican Council and the declaration of papal infallibility. They fear John Paul II will become even more reactionary and continue to rein in the process of collegiality and democratisation launched by the Second Vatican Council under Pope John XXIII. The Pope, they add, has suggested he is keen to draw up a new definition of infallibility. They also argue that he has already, on occasion, made some serious political and diplomatic errors of judgment. One example was his decision to grant Kurt Waldheim, the former Austrian president who concealed his war-time involvement with German intelligence in Croatia, a papal knighthood for services to human rights. The Pope's efforts to achieve a rapprochement with Orthodox churches have been far from successful. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe - which he helped to bring about - has, if anything, exacerbated long-standing rivalries. The Russian Orthodox Church had been forced to collaborate with the Soviet regime and took over some Catholic institutions. Now, it views Rome as a proselytising threat and an institution that could reclaim property. In the former Yugoslavia, civil war has been given an added vicious twist by the rivalry between the Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats. Indeed, the Vatican was so anxious to back the Croats that it was the first, along with Germany, to recognise independent Croatia and Slovenia. Since then, the Holy See has being doing its best to minimise the consequences of this hasty diplomatic recognition. But the Serbs have not forgiven the Pope, and they forced him to cancel a visit to Sarajevo earlier this year. The Pope's big project, which he hopes will reunite the Church and revive its prestige and popularity, is to hold a special jubilee to mark the millennium, attracting perhaps 40m pilgrims to Rome during the year and large numbers to the Holy Land. A Catholic jubilee has, historically, been the occasion for individuals to seek pardon for their sins. The Pope is expected to use this jubilee to re-examine the Church to see where it, too, may have erred. This will include a re-assessment of the inquisition, the persecution of intellectuals and scientific thought (as with Galileo), its support of the colonisation of the Americas and, more recently, the role of the Church during the Holocaust. Yet, the jubilee also contains many pitfalls for a Pope identified with the most conservative side of Catholicism. As the gap widens between what the Vatican preaches and how modern industrialised societies behave, he is vulnerable to criticism for being obstinately out of touch. This gap was much in evidence at the recent United Nations population conference in Cairo. A strong Vatican delegation fought tenaciously to avoid acceptance of artificial birth control, much to the dismay of the conference organisers. Although it was unsuccessful, the Vatican was pleased to have forced moral issues on to the agenda. Taking a moral stand might not be enough. The Church cannot indefinitely ignore public opinion on issues such as birth control, women in the priesthood, and priestly celibacy. Of all the issues splitting liberals and traditionalists, the Pope's uncompromising view on birth control is the single biggest divide. Many Catholics disagree with the official doctrine and use artificial contraception. Many Catholic countries also have some of the lowest birth rates in the world. For them, the Pope's crusade against what he has termed the 'contraception mentality' has simply turned them away from the Church, just as the Vatican's insistence on priestly celibacy (which became obligatory only in the 13th century) has been largely responsible for about 100,000 priests leaving the priesthood in the past 25 years. John Paul II has clearly been touched by these criticisms. In his book, he insists: 'I must repeat that I categorically reject every accusation or suspicion concerning the Pope's alleged 'obsession' with this issue.' He adds: 'We cannot afford forms of permissiveness that would lead directly to the trampling of human rights, and also to the complete destruction of values which are fundamental not only for the lives of individuals and families but for society itself.' Even inside the sacred college, there are advocates of a more pragmatic approach. In an important interview with John Cornwall, the papabile, Cardinal Martini of Milan conceded that the Church's teaching on contraception had not been expressed 'so well'. The problem was a relatively new one. 'The Church, on the other hand, thinks very slowly, so I'm confident we will find some formula to state things better, so that the problem is better understood and more adapted to reality,' he said. Martini was also confident that the holy spirit would guide the Church to resolve the problem, just as the Church had overcome other moral problems in the past. Usury was considered a serious sin in the middle ages although everyone practised it. Little by little, the Church began to see usury in a different light, although it took centuries to resolve the problem. No one questions the power of the Pope's conviction, his role in helping to bring down communism and setting forward a serious intellectual alternative to the consumerism of capitalist societies which, he feels, has created a godless world without values. But can the Church afford to wait centuries to resolve the problem of birth control? And can it be achieved under a Pope with an absolutist view on dogma? As John Paul II enters the twilight of his papacy, the biggest challenge facing the Roman Church is to reunite its flock. Whether Karol Wojtyla is the right shepherd to lead it into the next millennium remains an open question.</p>

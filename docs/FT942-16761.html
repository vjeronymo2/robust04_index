			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Permanent chat shop After almost every round of world trade talks, exhausted negotiators have thrown up their hands and cried: 'Never again]' Yet a few years later they have been back at work hagg-ling over another omnibus package. This time, many insist, things really will be different. One reason is that the new World Trade Organisation is intended to make future rounds unnecessary by acting as a permanent bargaining forum. Full-scale ministerial conferences are planned every two years to inject regular political impetus. Another is that, in principle, the Uruguay Round is supposed to embrace almost every important aspect of international trade. However, its ambitious scope has also left much unfinished business to be sorted out. Gatt members have yet to strike the hard deals needed to flesh out their commitment to free trade in financial services, telecommunications and maritime transport. In sectors such as agriculture and textiles, where liberalisation timetables have been agreed, reviews are planned to assess progress or to chart the next phase of market opening. In addition, fresh items are jostling for a place on the WTO agenda. One is trade and environment policy, on which the Marrakesh conference is expected to set up a working group. The US wants to add to the list workers' rights and competition policy, while India wants a debate on the free movement of people. These issues are doubly controversial. Not only do they threaten to divide Gatt's ranks, as the rumpus over workers' rights has showed. Some policymakers fear they could further politicise the organisation and lead to conditions being placed on free trade - a development contrary to Gatt's central mission of tearing down barriers. Yet trade liberalisation is already evolving in a direction which may entangle it with a wider range of sensitive issues. Increasingly, it is thrusting beyond barriers at borders, such as tariffs and quotas, to tackle obstacles deep inside national frontiers, such as exist in most types of services. As a consequence, it seems bound to cut across ever more policies which governments have traditionally regarded as domestic priorities, or as being within the legitimate domain of national sovereignty. Sorting out clear dividing lines may not be easy. It is too early to judge how effectively the WTO will resolve such questions. Its first task is to show it can reach the kinds of decisions and breakthroughs which, until now, have required the political dynamics and scope for complex trade-offs generated by a full-blown round of world trade negotiations. The organisation's success on that score may determine whether it develops a powerful voice in wider international policymaking or risks becoming - in the words of the old joke about the Gatt - little more than a general agreement to talk and talk.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROTEST ERUPTS INTO SHOUTING MATCH;  </P> <P> MIGRANTS: NORTH COUNTY RESIDENTS CLASH WITH LATINO DEMONSTRATORS AT SITE OF  ALLEGED KIDNAPING OF MIGRANT WORKER.  </P> <P> Escalating tensions between Latin American immigrant laborers and the mostly  non-Latino population of northern San Diego County were bared in public Sunday  when demonstrators shouting anti-racist slogans faced off with area residents  at a Carlsbad store where a migrant worker was allegedly kidnaped and beaten  early this month.  </P> <P> The long-planned event, held under the watchful eyes of Carlsbad police, went  off peacefully under clear skies and a searing sun.  </P> <P> However, a dramatic and ugly shouting match erupted between the mostly Latino  marchers and about a dozen non-Latino residents who staged a  counterdemonstration at the Country Grocery Store on El Camino Real. The  establishment, which has a huge plastic chicken on its roof, is the site where  Candido Galloso Salas, a Mexican worker, was allegedly handcuffed, detained and  and beaten by the store's proprietor and his brother.  </P> <P> That widely publicized incident -- now the subject of local police and FBI  inquiries, along with a civil suit -- appears to have galvanized the mostly  unorganized migrant laborers and their supporters, both Latino and non-Latino.  Sponsors expressed hope that Sunday's demonstration would catalyze better  organization among North County's huge number of immigrant workers, most of  whom are from Mexico.  </P> <P> As the chanting marchers, numbering about 200, filed by the store, some of the  waiting residents shouted anti-immigrant comments; several non-Latinos  accompanying the marchers were derided as "wetback lovers."  </P> <P> "Go home!" one counterdemonstrator shouted continuously at the marchers.  </P> <P> The pro-migrant demonstrators retorted in English and Spanish, deriding the  residents as racistas -- racists.  </P> <P> "These workers make the food you eat," one man screamed at the residents  gathered in the front entrance of the store. "You should thank God that they  are here."  </P> <P> The confrontation, which lasted about 15 minutes, offered insight into the deep  divisions prevalent in North County, where thousands of migrant laborers live  in crude dwellings amid the brush, often in the shadow of luxurious suburban  homes worth $250,000 or more. Pro-immigrant groups have long accused local  governments and residents of malevolent apathy or hostility toward the workers.  They say violence against immigrants is on the rise, as evidenced by the recent  Carlsbad incident.  </P> <P> "They want the people to work and then disappear like a disposable cup," said  the Rev. Rafael Martinez, a Protestant minister who heads a chaplaincy in the  fields.  </P> <P> The pro-immigrant demonstrators said they were seeking basic human rights --  decent housing, freedom from physical and verbal abuse, and an end to racism  directed at workers. "We're just asking for justice," said Algimiro Morales,  one of the leaders of the Mixtec People's Civic Committee, one of the event's  organizers.  </P> <P> "It is our dark hands and sore backs that plant and cultivate these fields,"  said a written statement from the group, whose name derives from the many  laborers who are Mixtec Indians, from Mexico's Oaxaca state. "We ask for your  help for better housing."  </P> <P> But non-Latino residents who staged the counterprotest said they were fed up  with the immigrant laborers, whom they blame for a wide range of problems, from  trash on their lawns to trespassing on their properties to more violent crimes.  </P> <P> "I've watched this get worse and worse," Reinette Thurman shouted excitedly as  she traded verbal volleys with the demonstrators. "Where are our rights? They  come into my home and steal from me. I've seen them walk into this store and  steal. Once I saw four of them open cans of Coke and just start drinking it  without paying. . . . Where's the Border Patrol?"  </P> <P> Michael Haggerty, a Carlsbad electrician, stood beneath a U.S. flag at the  entrance to the market carrying a sign urging employers not to hire foreign  labor. He wore a hand-made button indicating his disfavor for "illegals."  </P> <P> "If nobody hired 'em, they wouldn't get any jobs and they'd just go home,"  Haggerty explained after a heated exchange with the demonstrators.  </P> <P> Joyce Stiffler, a 23-year area resident, spoke of what she characterized as a  growing crime problem that she blamed on the immigrant work force.  </P> <P> "It's very menacing," Stiffler said as she rocked her infant grandchild in a  carriage. "They (the laborers) used to be very low key. Now we're getting the  stabbings, the theft. . . . One of them chased me around my driveway a few  years ago. They were just squatting in my yard . . . three of them very drunk.  After I ran away from them, they ran into my neighbor's driveway and broke a  bottle. . . . My daughter walks to the store and she's subject to these  catcalls."  </P> <P> Apparently not present at the march was Candido Galloso Salas, the migrant  worker who was allegedly kidnaped and attacked early this month by Rickey  Ryberg, proprietor of the Country Grocery Store, and his brother, Randy. An  investigator for Marco E. Lopez, the San Diego lawyer who represents Galloso  Salas, said he served Rickey Ryberg Sunday with a civil suit that was filed  last week in U.S. District Court in San Diego. The Rybergs have denied any  wrongdoing in the case.  </P></p>

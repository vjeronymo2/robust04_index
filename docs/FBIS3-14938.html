			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Amnesty No Danger to Society"] </F>   [Text] An insignificant number of convicts, approximately  20,000 out of the more than 800,000 held in corrective labor  camps and solitary confinement centers, will be released from  their places of confinement. Major General of the Interior  Service Valeriy Orlov, first deputy chief of the Russian  Interior Ministry's Main Directorate for Enforcing Sentences,  said this in conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent  yesterday.    He noted that, formally speaking, the amnesty covers a far  greater number of people and this has given rise to various  conjectures and rumor. However, the present amnesty will not be  anything like the general release of recidivists well known from  the movie "The cold summer of 1953." In the main the people to  be released will be the very old, whom it is simply inhuman to  keep in places of deprivation of liberty, invalids, and minors,  as well as first-time offenders guilty of a crime of negligence  or of a crime which does not pose an exaggerated danger to  society. In particular, those who took part in combat actions  in defense of the motherland will be freed from punishment.</p>

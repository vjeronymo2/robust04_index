			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Railways measure attacked in Lords THE measure to open up British Rail to privatisation gained its Lords second reading last night, despite fierce criticism from former BR chairman Lord Marsh. He told peers: 'If the government persists in this exercise of primitive dogma, they will pay a very heavy political price, and rightly so, for it. But it will be the nation which will pay the full cost for very many years to come.' The Railways Bill was given an unopposed second reading under Lords convention, but could face later changes.</p>

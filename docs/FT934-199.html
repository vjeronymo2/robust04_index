			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Arafat sees Mubarak as Israel-PLO talks hit deadlock Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, last night held urgent talks in Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak after Israel and the PLO failed to break the deadlock in peace talks. Egyptian officials said that, in the half-hour meeting, Mr Arafat reacted positively to some of the Israeli proposals on plans for its already delayed troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Mr Mubarak, who is believed to have requested Mr Arafat's trip to Egypt, was expected to press the PLO chairman to soften his stance. But Mr Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, the PLO's ambassador to Jordan, said Mr Arafat had gone to Cairo with a formal rejection of 'humiliating' Israeli proposals. The two sides had earlier given conflicting statements about progress in the Cairo negotiations aimed at implementing the Israeli withdrawal. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said the two sides had reached broad agreement but would need more talks. Israeli officials said they had offered their last compromise position. At a press conference with Mr Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO's chief negotiator, Mr Peres said: 'The two delegations have reached a meeting of the minds on the central issues of border crossings, the size of Jericho and matters relating to the Gaza Strip. The leadership of the two parties will now have to accept or reject this paper.' A more downbeat Mr Abbas said: 'The negotiations were constructive. There were some ideas that will be discussed . . . and we hope to reach an agreement.' The failure of the talks came amid growing signs of a crisis in the PLO leadership over strategy and mounting criticism by rank-and-file Palestinians of the lack of consultation by Mr Arafat. An hour before the Cairo press conference, the PLO executive committee issued a statement in Tunis rejecting the latest Israeli proposals. It insisted that Palestinians must have total control of crossings between Gaza and Egypt and between the Jericho enclave and Jordan. The committee blamed Israel for obstructing the negotiations and withdrawing previous offers. The Tunis statement fuelled speculation that Mr Arafat was deliberately undercutting the position of Mr Abbas. Mr Abbas is reportedly in favour of a softer negotiating stance and a greater democratisation of the PLO. Mr Peres also appeared to indicate that the obstacle to an agreement was Mr Arafat rather than the PLO delegation. Vatican-Israel pact ready, Page 2</p>

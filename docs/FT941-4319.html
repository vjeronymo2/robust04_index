			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fife Indmar continues progress with Pounds 0.9m Fife Indmar, which returned to the black at the interim stage, continued to progress through the second six months and for the full 1993 year swung from losses of Pounds 1.66m to profits of Pounds 903,000 pre-tax. The dividend is being lifted from 0.5p to 2.75p via a final of 2p - in line with the December forecast. Earnings per share emerged at 7.13p (losses 14.38p). The news prompted a 16p rise in the share price to 76p. Along with its preliminary results, the Edinburgh-based engineer announced the acquisition of Glegg &amp; Thomson, an independent ironmongery business based in Aberdeen. The consideration of Pounds 780,000 will be satisfied by the issue of 1.3m new ordinary shares, of which 116,667 will be retained by the vendors. The remaining 1.18m shares, together with 500,000 new ordinaries to be issued for cash, have been underwritten by Quayle Munro at 60p and conditionally placed with institutions. Group turnover for 1993 was little changed at Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 31.7m). Interest charges dropped to Pounds 616,000 (Pounds 1.02m). Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman, said the streamlining and rationalisation undertaken last year had provided the group with the appropriate base from which to make progress overall during 1994.</p>

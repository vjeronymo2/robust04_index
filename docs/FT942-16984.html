			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / China sounds alarm over growing industrial unrest: Reforms push up unemployment as state enterprises face funds squeeze China sounded the alarm yesterday over rising unemployment, growing industrial unrest and the deteriorating health of state industry, which is under pressure in the transition to a market economy. Commentaries in the People's Daily - the Communist party newspaper - and the Economic Daily drew attention to potential instability in China's cities where state enterprises are undergoing a painful transformation. Alarmist references in the official press to China's economic problems coincide with indications that the country may be entering an uncertain period, with fresh reports about the deteriorating health of senior leader Deng Xiaoping. 'This year and next year the employment situation will be extremely grim,' said the People's Daily in an unusually frank reference to looming problems in a politically sensitive area. The Economic Daily also displayed unusual candour in referring to the plight of the state sector which it said would register little or no growth this year due to 'lack of funds and sluggish sales'. Western officials in Beijing wonder whether the fresh detention of Mr Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, on suspicion of commiting 'new crimes' might be connected with internal party struggles. The fate of dissidents has in the past been tied to conflict between party moderates and hardliners. Confirmation of pressures on the once heavily-subsidised state sector came with a report yesterday that a Shanghai textile company had become the city's first state enterprise to file for bankruptcy. Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily, reported that the Shanghai Number Two Weave Band factory blamed bad management, accumulated debts and removal of subsidies. In industrial strongholds like Wuhan in central China and Harbin in the north-east, unemployment is rising rapidly and companies starved of credit are barely surviving. Disaffected workers in state enterprises across China have engaged in unprecedented levels of unrest in the past year. Official unemployment in urban areas is 2.6 per cent, but this vastly understates the extent of the problem. Some estimates put urban unemployment at about 20 per cent of the workforce. People's Daily quoted Mr Li Boyong, the labour minister, as saying that China was 'faced with unprecedented challenges in deploying all the jobless'. A prices spiral is adding to disaffection among city workers. Cost of living increases are running at more than 25 per cent compared with the same period last year, according to statistics for February. Paris tries to melt Beijing ice, Page 5</p>

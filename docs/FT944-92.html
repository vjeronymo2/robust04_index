			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / West criticises Russia over Chechnya assault The Russian government is facing an increasing barrage of international as well as domestic criticism over its strong-arm tactics in the breakaway Chechnya region. In remarks to be published today in the German daily Berliner Zeitung, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, says: 'The methods which the Russian government is using to try to resolve the conflict are cause for the utmost concern.' In Washington, the state department for the first time directly criticised Russian tactics. Urging an end to attacks on civilians, it said the US was 'deeply disturbed' by reports of the bombing of an orphanage in Grozny, the Chechen capital. A Chechen official meanwhile warned that a blaze at an oil refinery on the edge of the capital Grozny, set alight by the Russian bombardment, could spread to a nearby storage facility containing 5,000 tonnes of ammonia. This threatened environmental catastrophe across the Caucasus, he said. The Russian ministry for emergency situations said the fire threatened only those living in the 'near vicinity'. Renewed fighting left at least two Russian soldiers dead. The Russian government seemingly spurned an offer of a new year ceasefire from Mr Dzhokar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, who declared independence from Moscow three years ago. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, reiterated Moscow's message that force was the only way to solve the crisis. 'We are in a situation where there is no other choice,' he said, claiming that any other democratic state would behave in the same way. The use of force was again condemned in Moscow yesterday when Mr Leonid Petrovsky, a communist member of the Russian parliament's human rights committee who has just returned from Grozny, said military action threatened 'the direct destruction of the Russian state'. The Women of Russia parliamentary faction also said it had been inundated with messages from soldiers' relatives urging a peaceful solution to the crisis. In further criticism from abroad, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, a US-based organisation which monitors compliance with the human rights obligations enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki Accords, protested that Russia was violating its international obligations under the Geneva Conventions, which protect civilians in armed conflicts. Some Russian officials privately fear a continued conflict in Chechnya might tarnish Russia's image abroad, jeopardising its chances of receiving a substantial aid package from the International Monetary Fund.

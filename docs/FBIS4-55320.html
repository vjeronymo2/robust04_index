			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Jevtic -- recorded] </F>   [Text] [Jevtic] According to the recently adopted Law on  Foreign Exchange Loans, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has  authorized its central bank to assume loans in the amount of  $300 million both in-country and abroad in the name of and for  the federal state. In order to collect this sum, the National  Bank of Yugoslavia has signed the first contract on loans with  Belgrade Bank, Invest Bank, and Beobank. The job is worth $10  million and at the same marks the beginning of the realization  of Financial Pool No. 2 of the Program of Monetary  Reconstruction and Economic Recovery. According to Nikola  Stanic, vice governor of the National Bank, the loans granted  will be transferred to the country's foreign exchange reserves  and will be used as a foreign exchange backing for the new  dinar. This will at the same time represent the additional  financial boost for furthering economic activities in the  country.    [Belgrade Bank Director Ljubisa Igic, identified by caption]  We see our interests here. The conditions under which we are  granting the loan to the National Bank, that is, to the state of  Yugoslavia are in fact market conditions ....    [Jevtic] The fact that banks are now giving their own money  to support the program means that they have to look after it in  a different, more serious manner than they have done to date.    [Igic] Certainly. In fact, this money will again come to  banking and financial channels through the economy. It will be  a basis for general economic activity in the coming period.  This money has not been given away for good ignoring this  economy, our bank's savers, and our shareholders.    [Jevtic] By the way, the Belgrade Bank, Invest Bank, and  Beobank were the first to grant foreign exchange loans to the  National Bank of Yugoslavia in conformity with the adopted law.  Therefore, the loan has been given to two years with a one-year  delay in payment and a flexible domicile rate of exchange for  individual foreign currencies.    This week and the next, the management of the National Bank  of Yugoslavia will sign individual contracts with several dozen  banks so that the planned $300 million can be ensured as soon as  possible.</p>

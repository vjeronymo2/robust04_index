			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOND BIZ;  </P> <P> SIMI SCHOOL OFFICIALS TRY SONG AND DANCE STRATEGY TO GET VOTERS' ATTENTION  </P> <P> Simi Valley school district officials say they learned their lesson after  losing a close bond election last year.  </P> <P> This time, the town hall meetings that the district holds to promote its  position are short on statistics and long on shtick, with performances by  singing and dancing students whose parents are almost a sure bet to attend.  </P> <P> The coffee-and-cookie Talent Night performances are just part of the district's  campaign to pass two new measures asking voters to approve $43 million in  school bonds in a special election March 7.  </P> <P> "We're making a major effort to get into the community," school board President  Lew Roth said. So far, the strategy is working.  </P> <P> More than 200 parents showed up for a recent district presentation to watch  their children sing, dance, play the piano, perform skits and lead cheers. The  performances by students of four elementary schools and one junior high  followed a 15-minute presentation by district officials and community members  in support of the two measures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Really Too Intensive'  </P> <P> "Last year they had meetings for the school bond at every single school," said  Pamela Spencer, the district's public relations coordinator who came up with  the entertainment idea. "They were cumbersome, very long presentations that  were really too intensive for the general public."  </P> <P> So instead, parents and students at the Sinaloa Junior High School meeting, one  of four districtwide, got to hear a pint-sized Michael Jackson imitator, the  first movement of Sonatina No. 2 by Clemente and an elaborately costumed  flapper girl routine.  </P> <P> Paul Psik said that although he enjoyed the performance, he resented being  lured to the meeting to see his sixth-grade daughter, Janelle, and her  classmates from Abraham Lincoln Elementary School perform patriotic songs,  including "America the Beautiful," in sign language. "I'm not convinced yet,"  he said of the measures.  </P> <P> Voters last year narrowly defeated a $35-million bond issue to repair aging  schools in part because supporters took victory for granted, officials said. In  addition, town hall meetings on the issue were sparsely attended, only a  handful of volunteers were recruited and not enough money was raised to  campaign effectively, officials said.  </P> <P> Simi Valley attorney Robert O. Huber, co-chairman of Citizens for Yes on School  Measures A and B, said the committee hopes to persuade voters that the bond  measures are a matter of city pride. "It's a community issue; we can't be real  proud of the way our schools look," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Volunteers Recruited  </P> <P> The committee has recruited more than 200 volunteers to staff telephones and  walk door-to-door and so far has raised more than $6,000 to pay for a political  consultant and other campaign expenses.  </P> <P> The 27 elementary, junior high and high schools in the Simi Valley Unified  School District probably won't look much different even if the two measures  pass, district officials said. Most of the $35 million sought in Measure A,  about 77%, will pay for air conditioning and heating. The rest will be for  plumbing, roofing and asphalt repairs.  </P> <P> "When it's cold the air conditioning goes on and when it's hot the heater seems  to kick on," said Sinaloa Junior High ninth-grader Michelle McMorris, one of  several students stumping for the measure by speaking to groups around town.  </P> <P> The district's nearly 19,000 students attend schools that are, on average,  about 26 years old, officials said.  </P> <P> Measure B, which calls for an $8-million bond issue, would pay for three new  junior high school gymnasiums and an auditorium at a fourth junior high, as  well as a football stadium at Royal High School. Although voters could approve  Measure A and reject Measure B, Measure B cannot be approved alone.  </P> <P> The bonds would be paid off in 20 years.  </P> <P> The combined annual cost of both measures to the average Simi Valley homeowner  would range from about $20 the first year to a high of about $65, district  officials said. The average homeowner pays about $120 a year on the $13 million  the district still owes on state school construction loans, said Associate  Supt. Cathi Vogel.  </P> <P> A bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and passed  Friday would, however, extend the repayment time of the existing debt from  three to six years, officials said. The bill was approved by the state Senate  35 to 0 and is expected to be signed by Gov. George Deukmejian later this  month, district officials said.  </P> <P> The extension would cut the annual amount now paid by taxpayers. It is  contingent on passage of Measure A.  </P> <P> Endorsements for the two ballot measures have come from the Ventura County  Taxpayers Assn., the local Chamber of Commerce, the area's Board of Realtors  and local service clubs. Mayor Gregory Stratton is one of the signers of the  ballot argument in favor of the measures.  </P> <P> But even with such widespread support, as well as no organized opposition,  Huber and others said tax hikes are a tough sell because they require approval  by two-thirds of the voters. Last time, the bond issue failed only by 100 or so  votes, prompting frustrated school board members to blame the local newspaper,  even though it had endorsed the measure, as well as residents who were given  absentee ballots but did not return them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last Year's Opponent  </P> <P> The most vocal opponent to last year's bond measure, Ventura County Community  College District board member Tom Ely, said he has yet to decide whether to  speak out on this year's measures.  </P> <P> "Why should we be giving people responsible for the deterioration more money to  handle when they haven't properly handled the money they already have?" Ely  said. "But I don't want to deny educational benefits to students just because  the district administrators and board are inept."  </P> <P> At least two parents who had come to see their children perform at a recent  town hall meeting on the bond issues had similar questions.  </P> <P> "If you have a $50-million to $60-million annual budget now, why isn't the work  being done with the money you have?" Gordon E. Micklos asked during a  question-and-answer session Wednesday at Sinaloa Junior High. He said most  districts in the state are making do without new taxes.  </P> <P> Roth said about 85% of the district's annual budget is used to pay salaries and  benefits, leaving little for the needed repairs.  </P></p>

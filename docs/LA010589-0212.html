			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> PISTONS' VERSACE TO LEAD INDIANA PACERS  </P> <P> Dick Versace, the Detroit Pistons assistant who arrived in town in time to  watch the Indiana Pacers snap a nine-game losing streak, was named head coach  of the Pacers today.  </P> <P> He arrived Wednesday night, 30 minutes before the tip-off of the Pacers game  with Atlanta. Indiana won 116-113.  </P> <P> "I will not accept losing from this team or any team that I coach," Versace  told a news conference this morning. "When I'm introduced to the players, that  will be my opening statement and we'll go on from there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Work on Defense  </P> <P> Versace promised that the first thing he will work on will be defense.  </P> <P> "I'd like everyone to say that's a very fine defensive team. That's a team  you're never going to be able to run on. You always have to play them five on  five."  </P> <P> Versace, 48, is the third leadership change this season for the Pacers.  </P> <P> Interim coach George Irvine took over nine games into the season after Jack  Ramsay resigned.  </P> <P> Versace, former head coach for Bradley University, said on arrival Wednesday  that "I've been in this situation before. When a man is working at his craft,  it's always great to work in an area where it's appreciated, and it isn't  appreciated any more than in this city and in this state."  </P> <P> He added, "We certainly like to think we can together and collectively build  this thing into something the state can be proud of."  </P> <P> "He's a good coach, and I think he's suited to our team," Pacers General  Manager Donnie Walsh said. "I think he has got the proper elements in his  personality and coaching philosophy to turn it around and continue what we want  to do in the future.  </P> <P> "Everyone I interviewed had a great technology of the game, knowledge of the  game. Dick put life into it, intensity into it. It was just the whole  combination. I think he has the technical knowledge, experience as head coach,  experience in the NBA and putting in proper things as a head coach."  </P> <P> Walsh also interviewed NBA assistant coaches Allan Bristow of Denver, Bill  Blair of Washington and Frank Hamblen of Milwaukee.  </P></p>

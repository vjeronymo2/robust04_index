			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pasminco registers ADollars 11m deficit Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead producer, yesterday unveiled a loss of ADollars 11.2m (USDollars 8m), after tax but before abnormal items, in the six months to end-December. In the same period of the previous year, there was a ADollars 4.7m loss. Abnormal charges amounted to a further ADollars 8.7m, and reflected redundancy costs of ADollars 6.3m, plus a ADollars 2.4m loss on the sale of certain UK assets to MIM Holdings. This left the group's bottom-line loss at ADollars 19.9m, compared with ADollars 6m a year earlier. Total revenue fell from ADollars 789m to ADollars 614.5m. Pasminco said that the low level of metal prices, due to world oversupply, had caused the loss but also noted that 'continued improvements in productivity and efficiency generated cost savings of ADollars 42m pre-tax'. Under the circumstances, it suggested that the loss this time compared favourably with the previous year's half-time result. Pasminco says it hopes to improve on last time's full-year result, which showed a net loss before abnormals of ADollars 43.2m. The half-year figures benefited from a reduction in the group's interest charges - down from ADollars 14.4m to ADollars 10.9m, with borrowings declining by ADollars 170m to ADollars 351m, due to the sale of the UK assets and a share placement which raised ADollars 88m.</p>

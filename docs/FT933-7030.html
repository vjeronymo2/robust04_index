			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Playmates hit by fall in Ninja Turtle sales PLAYMATES, the Hong Kong toy manufacturer which produces the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, yesterday announced a further decline in earnings. First-half 1993 net profits fell 16.5 per cent, to HKDollars 146.6m (USDollars 18.9m). The interim dividend is being cut from 7 cents a share to 6 cents. At the peak of Turtle sales in 1991, the company posted six-month profits of HKDollars 409m. However, the product's popularity has waned and the company has failed to find an alternative source of income. Turnover fell to HKDollars 600.6m from HKDollars 645.5m in 1992, despite the success of the group's Star Trek product line. In addition, associate contributions swung to a HKDollars 12.6m loss due to a negative contribution from the 37.5 per cent-owned Ideal Loisirs of France. The French toy group is expected to turn in a profit in the current half-year. Like many other Hong Kong manufacturers, Playmates has turned to property development in an attempt to make up for dwindling profits from its toy core business. Director Mr Edmund Ip said the company's 'objective is to establish itself as a quality developer concentrating initially on smaller sites in carefully selected locations'. Nintendo America, the US arm of the Japanese video game maker, announced plans for a new generation of home video game machines using advanced microprocessor and computer graphics technology provided by Silicon Graphics, a leader in the field of advanced computer graphics, writes Louise Kehoe. Nintendo said the new game machine would be available in 1995 at less than Dollars 250. The company, which is projecting Dollars 5bn in retail sales this year, will invest a 'significant amount of money' to fund the joint venture while Silicon Graphics will provide its MIPS microprocessors and graphics technology.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Home, costly home: John Willman on a risk to private investment in UK housing Finding ways of raising private finance to fund public expenditure is one of the UK government's priorities, as it struggles to contain this year's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. Yet plans to cut grants to housing associations could reduce the availability of private finance for the government's housing programme, says the cross-party House of Commons environment select committee in a report to be published tomorrow. Housing associations have provided a model example of how private capital can be used to finance public spending. Associations build more than 50,000 homes for rent each year, by combining Pounds 2bn a year of government grants with Pounds 1bn of private finance raised on the capital markets. However, the select committee warns that cuts in housing association grants would make it much harder for associations to borrow the money they need, and may deter private investors from lending to them. The grant cuts were announced in last year's Autumn Statement, when the chancellor provided Pounds 700m to remove 20,000 homes from the housing market. The money for his housing market package came from the budget of the Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes grants to housing associations. The chancellor was quick to promise that the cut in the corporation's budget would mean no reduction in the 153,000 new housing association homes promised for the next three years in the Conservative election manifesto. Instead, the level of grant would fall from an average of 72 per cent of the cost of each new home last year to 55 per cent in 1995-96. The housing associations would therefore be forced to raise 45 per cent of the cost of new homes from the capital markets, rather than 28 per cent. In order to pay the additional interest, they are likely to have to raise rents. This is in spite of the fact that the chancellor said in his Autumn Statement that the steady fall in interest rates, combined with lower land prices and building costs in the aftermath of the recession, ought to counteract any need for a steep rise in rents. The announcement caused consternation at the Housing Corporation, which had recommended no change in the grant rates. It predicted that investors would not be prepared to lend housing associations such a high proportion of the cost of a new building against the security of a tenanted home, which is normally valued at 50 per cent of its vacant value. In the short term, associations could pledge their older property as additional security for loans. But, eventually, even that source of asset cover would be used up. And there would be very little additional security available for newer housing associations or the small associations that cater for the needs of special groups such as single people and ethnic minorities. This would inevitably reduce the diversity of accommodation offered by housing associations - one of their most attractive features, in contrast with the monolithic housing estates built by local authorities. 'The problem of asset cover is surmountable as long as grant levels stay above around 60 per cent,' according to Mr Maurice Hochschild, associate director of European Capital, a merchant banking firm which advises on housing association fund-raising. 'But if the average grant falls to 55 per cent, there will sooner or later be problems in finding sufficient security for loans.' There is an additional threat to lenders, however: lower grant rates could make it harder for associations to service debt. Projections carried out for the National Federation of Housing Associations by stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew suggest that, despite lower interest rates and building costs, rents would have to rise by 75 per cent over the next three years to meet the cost of raising a higher proportion of private finance. 'That would raise rents to almost 40 per cent of the average income of working households,' says Mr Jim Coulter, director of the NFHA. 'With rents at such levels, 89 per cent of new tenants would qualify for housing benefit.' That compares with half of new tenants qualifying now. 'Many more housing association tenants would find themselves stuck in the poverty trap, where almost all of any increase in income is clawed back in taxes and reductions in means-tested benefits,' says Mr Coulter. More worrying for lenders, however, are the implications of such reliance on housing benefit for the rent payments to service their loans. The cost to the exchequer of housing benefit is rising fast, at more than 10 per cent annually, and will reach almost Pounds 10bn this year. With housing benefit already under close scrutiny as part of the Treasury's long-term review of social security spending, further large increases could persuade the government to consider cutting it. 'Any cuts in housing benefit could make it harder for housing associations to collect rent and to service their loans,' says Mr Hochschild. 'The dependence on social security benefits which could be vulnerable to government cuts in the future may make investors cautious.' Thus the government could find that reducing the grant paid to housing associations not only boosts the social security bill, it also makes investors less willing to lend associations the private finance they need. 'That would be a pity,' says the NFHA's Mr Coulter. 'Housing associations have been very successful at raising private finance to supplement public expenditure on housing.' It would certainly be strange for the government to put that success at risk at a time when it is looking for private finance to fund other parts of the public expenditure programme. The government's response to the select committee's report will be vital in convincing many in the City that it is serious about wishing to work in partnership with private investors in financing public expenditure.</p>

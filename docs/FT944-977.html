			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: KKR wins Borden with Dollars 2bn buy-out Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US investment firm, yesterday won control of foods group Borden, following a controversial Dollars 2bn buy-out offer, writes Richard Waters. KKR said that it had acquired 63.5 per cent of Borden's shares through an exchange offer in which it was offering part of its stake in RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco giant. It had needed 40 per cent to gain control. Together with additional Borden shares acquired by exercising an option, KKR and an investment affiliate, Whitehall Associates, will be left with 69.5 per cent of the stock. That will give the investment group more than the two-thirds needed to pass a plan to merge Borden's operations with those of RJR Nabisco and buy out the remaining shareholders, KKR said.</p>

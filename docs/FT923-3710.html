			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Borland aims to boost spreadsheet sales IN A bid to capture a bigger share of the billion dollar market for personal computer spreadsheet programs, Borland International, the US software company, today launches its Quattro Pro for Windows program. Quattro Pro will compete directly with spreadsheets from Lotus Development, an early leader in the market, and from Microsoft, which has won sales with its Excel program. Earlier this week, Lotus slashed the price of its 1-2-3 for Windows spreadsheet by Dollars 100 to Dollars 495, matching the price of Microsoft's Excel. Borland has also priced Quattro Pro for Windows at Dollars 495, but will include a copy of Quattro Pro for use with the older DOS operating system as well as the Windows version. It is also offering the program to users of competing products for a special price of Dollars 150. Borland and Lotus are locked in a copyright dispute in which Lotus has accused Borland of copying elements of 1-2-3 for use in Quattro Pro. Borland recently modified its program to eliminate some elements after a US court ruled that they infringed Lotus copyrights. Borland is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

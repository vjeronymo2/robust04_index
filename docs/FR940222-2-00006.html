The total cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995 is estimated at $411,765. The application must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost, through non-Federal contributions. The Federal amount includes $8,540 for an annual audit fee. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof. The RMBDC will operate in the State of South Carolina geographic service area with the exceptions of Greenville, Charleston and Columbia, MSAs. The headquarters of the RMBDC will be located in Orangeburg, South Carolina. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The award number for this RMBDC will be 04&hyph;10&hyph;94007&hyph;01. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RMBDC will provide business development services to the rural minority business community to help establish and maintain viable rural minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and private sector resources on behalf of rural minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical assistance to rural minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding rural minority business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of rural minority businesses, individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing rural business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application must received at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDC program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest points score will not necessarily receive the award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an application is select for funding, DOC has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection with that award. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion of DOC.

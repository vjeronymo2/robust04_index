			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mirjana Kusmuk report from Pale] </F>   [Text] [Begin recording] [Kusmuk] The meeting between the  political leadership of the Srpska republic on one side, and UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi Akashi  and Russian envoy for former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin on the  other side, ended in Pale today at 1700 [1500 GMT]. After the  meeting, president of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said:    [Karadzic] I wish to say that today's talks were long.  Considering the crisis that we are gradually overcoming, it is  not surprising that they were long and difficult, but in any  case we have made some progress in overcoming the crisis,  particularly regarding our relations with the United Nations and  the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. Today we achieved certain  progress as regards the position of UNPROFOR members on our  territory. [Words indistinct] that it has still not reached all  the headquarters, but it will reach them in any case. As far as  Gorazde is concerned, the situation is much more complex and  very difficult to resolve. We have agreed to order an immediate  cease-fire, a certain disengagement of forces in the conflict --  as much as it is possible -- maximal restraint regarding  activities and provocations, and finally, to do the utmost that  can be done in the humanitarian field. I believe that UN  helicopters will fly in in the morning to evacuate the wounded  and killed. If we manage to implement the cease-fire and  achieve a certain disengagement of forces, then we can say that  we are drawing closer to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Kusmuk] Addressing the assembled journalists, Akashi said:    [Akashi in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] President Karadzic and I agreed that a cease-fire  around Gorazde should go into effect immediately and that troops  would be withdrawn from the town as soon as possible. We agreed  that all sides should maximally restrain themselves from all  offensive activities. In the meantime we shall review the talks  and try to sign an agreement as soon as possible in order to  stabilize the situation. President Karadzic agreed to an urgent  evacuation of humanitarian personnel and population from  Gorazde. UNPROFOR is ready to do so tomorrow morning at 0800.    [Kusmuk] At around 1730 in the presidency of the Srpska  republic, informal talks continued between diplomats and the  political leadership of the republic. [end recording]</p>

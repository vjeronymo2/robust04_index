			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz fall gives pause to year-end rally talk Bourses climbed again and excited observers talked about year-end rallies or, less ambitiously, about window dressing, writes Our Markets Staff. However, a big line came out to test the Frankfurt market, and the response suggested a certain lack of fibre in many of yesterday's gains. FRANKFURT saw several blue chips reach new highs, Daimler rising DM35.20 to DM789. The DAX index closed 27.14 higher at 2,178.16, and hit a new all-time intraday high of 2,190.87 in the post-bourse before ending at 2,188.18. However, Allianz, one of the leaders of the recent upswing, fell DM20 to DM2,940. A major US investor decided to lock in some of its profits on the stock late last Friday, and a London market maker took 50,000 to 60,000 shares on board; about half of those were sold on yesterday, and professionals said that there was a message for the market in the insurer's share price action. Metallgesellschaft continued to languish on concerns about management changes and the company's earnings position, falling DM23.10 to DM286.20. There was little news on the corporate front, but construction stocks rose as new building orders in western Germany, boosted by homebuilding demand, showed rises of 2.3 per cent in the third quarter and 1.3 per cent in the first nine months of 1993; Hochtief and Philipp Holzmann both rose DM20, to DM1,070 and DM915 respectively. PARIS came close enough to threaten a 1993 closing high nearly two months old, the CAC-40 index finishing 27.03, or 1.2 per cent higher at 2,223.47 against a peak of 2,231.86 on October 22. Turnover rose from FFr4.42bn to FFr5.1bn. Michelin, the tyremaker, hit its own year's high, FFr6.30 higher at FFr205.30 after the French weekly, Le Journal des Finances, said that it was on the road to recovery following a positive note on the group from Lehman Brothers. Recovery prospects on the US automotive scene were also good for Peugeot, up FFr20 at FDFr746, and the components manufacturer, Valeo, FFr44 higher at FFr1,269. AMSTERDAM was fuelled by institutional demand, the CBS Tendency index adding 2.80, or 1.9 per cent to 146.10. Unilever jumped Fl 5.70 to a year's high of Fl 223.60, due in part to its well-received acquisition of a majority stake in French ice-cream maker Miko. ING peaked at an intraday Fl 92.90 before closing up Fl 3.00 at Fl 92.80 on switching from other financial stocks. VNU, the publisher rose Fl 7.50 to a 1993 high of Fl 165.00 although volume was thin with only 50,000 shares traded. Against the trend, DSM, the petrochemical group, was Fl 2.50 easier at Fl 105.00, after Friday's news that a European plan to cut ethylene capacity had collapsed; Hoogovens, the steel group shed Fl1 to Fl 46.30 on Friday's EC subsidies-for-capacity-cuts deal, on the view that it did not do enough to alleviate the industry's problems. ZURICH closed at a new high, the SMI put on 19.5 at 2,909.0. Ciba-Geigy registered, SFr14 higher at SFr858, topped the active list, supported by hopes that the group's industry division would gain strongly from an economic upturn in Europe and the US. Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, sharply lower last week, rose SFr34 to SFr1,004 on a forecast rise in 1993 sales and profits. MADRID exercised its capacity to exaggerate gains elsewhere and broke through resistance levels in the futures and cash markets, the general index rising 5.61 or 1.8 per cent to a new 1993 high of 314.22 in turnover up from Pta28.3bn to Pta33bn. Construction stocks rose by more than 5 per cent with Uralita up Pta80 at Pta1,260. However, the most active sector was utilities where Iberdrola rose Pta30 to Pta999, and Fenosa Pta17 to Pta597. MILAN was initially firm in response to the lower house of parliament's approval of the 1994 budget over the weekend but the momentum was not maintained and the the Comit index edged 3.57 higher to 606.01. Against the trend, Ferruzzi added L931 or 3.4 per cent to L28,407 and Montedison L68.30 to L929.10 ahead of the complicated capital increases which begin today. Among blue chips to suffer from profit-taking, Olivetti slid L28 to L2,082 and Pirelli L15 to L2,130. Telecoms also suffered with Sip off L25 to L3,442 and Stet down L62 to L4,136. WARSAW climbed to a fourth consecutive record high, the WIG index rising by 244, or 2.3 per cent to 10,921 in the second highest ever turnover of 1,400bn zlotys. Analysts predicted that prices could be lifted further after the public oversubscribtion 6,600bn zlotys of a record 1,400bn zloty offering of Bank Slaski shares. STOCKHOLM was broadly higher as a rebound in LM Ericsson, the telecommunications group, supported the market. The Affarsvarlden general index added 9.2 to 1,370.3. Ericsson's B share advanced SKr15 or 4.8 per cent, to SKr326 after a fall from SKr477 earlier this year. Volvo continued higher adding SKr7 to SKr531 on news of the proposed new chairman and board. HELSINKI saw heavy domestic and foreign demand push the Hex index 16.8 higher to 1,536.5. Nokia's ordinary shares closed FM8 higher at FM286, partly helped by Ericsson's rise.

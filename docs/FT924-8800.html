			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (12): Fortunes shift with those of the industry - Profile of Tandem THE changing fortunes of Tandem, the Cupertino, California-based maker of 'fault-tolerant' computer systems, reflect the shift in attitudes towards computerisation within the financial services industry which is its principal customer. Founded in 1974, it has grown steadily if unspectacularly to revenues of Dollars 2bn for the year ended September 30, 1992. The company made a net loss of Dollars 41.2m after restructuring charges of Dollars 106m. The company, therefore, has not proven immune to the effects of the worldwide recession on its leading markets. Mr James Treybig, Tandem founder and chief executive, made it clear that adverse market conditions would continue: 'We remain cautious about the future,' he wrote, introducing the results. 'Historical experience would indicate a slower first quarter and uncertainty in Europe and Japan continues.' The bald figures, however, give little indication of Tandem's position and continuing potential in the financial services world. In two decades it has become as clearly identified with 'mission critical' systems in banking and finance as International Business Machines and Digital Equipment are identified with 'back office' accounting machinery. Its customers include big banks and stock exchanges. One of the best-known examples of a Tandem-based system is the London clearing banks 'Chaps' same day payments system. There have been three phases in the history of Tandem. Its earliest role was as a pioneer of fault-tolerant systems. It was the first minicomputer manufacturer to understand that a market existed for systems which could be guaranteed never to fail. Customers for such systems included financial institutions, newspapers and the armed forces. Tandem's approach was to duplicate all the essential hardware elements, controlling the allocation of resources through the 'Guardian' operating system; Tandem computers, like any others, failed on occasion, but in a controlled manner without loss of data. It was an expensive approach, but for some applications there was no alternative. In its next phase, beginning in the early 1980s, Tandem emphasised its expertise in on-line transaction processing (OLTP). It reasoned that fault-tolerance was of such advantage that within a few years, all computers would be fault-tolerant. At the same time, a rash of competitors emerged in the fault-tolerant arena, of which the most tenacious has proved to be Stratus, based in Marlboro, Massachusetts. The threat failed to materialise. Perhaps because of the increasing reliability of computer hardware, few other manufacturers made much of fault-tolerance and Tandem and Stratus - which supplies its machines under a marketing agreement to IBM, Olivetti and ICL - remain market leaders. On-line transaction processing, however, is the key to productivity in applications from payment processing, airline reservations, telephone networks, operations management, time and attendance and customer information. According to the Gartner Group, OLTP is the fastest developing sector of the computer industry with an annual growth rate of 20 per cent; it is expected to be worth over Dollars 70bn by 1994. Tandem claims that OLTP run on its fault-tolerant systems is more cost-effective than OLTP run on its competitors' non-fault-tolerant (and therefore less expensive) machines. In its third phase, Tandem is moving into 'continuous availability', a stage beyond fault tolerance, where the system is never out of action. Components will, of course, continue to fail, but in such a way that they can be removed and repaired while processing continues. Mr Roger Bellass, managing director of Tandem UK, one of the company's biggest markets outside the US, says that few companies have so far tried to design a continuously available system. 'It is possible to create a continuously available system if you buy enough equipment, but that is quite different from designing a continuously available system from scratch.' Tandem typically spends 13-14 per cent of revenues on research and development and intends to maintain its investment; it is looking for economies elsewhere in the organisation as the recession continues to bite. Mr Treybig points out, for example, that the company has moved out of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacture, and sold off its PCB factory. It will now buy in its boards, fully populated with microchips and other electronic components: 'We can never be happy with our costs,' Mr Treybig says. A big feature of the company's product line has been its ability to offer liner expandability - where performance increases in direct proportion to system size. In the past few years, moreover, Tandem has developed products to match industry trends to 'open systems'. It offers a family called 'Integrity' which provides fault-tolerance on the Unix operating system. Announced early in 1990, it was a startling development for a company whose success had been closely tied to the quality and reliability of its proprietary operating system, but its acceptance in the market is further evidence of the appeal of standard software. Mr Treybig says: 'After several years of investment in building a Unix-based product division, our Integrity systems division more than doubled revenues in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago and contributed to profits.' It has also recently moved into reduced instruction set (Risc) architectures which offer high performance at low cost. Its chosen partner in Risc technology is Mips, now a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics. Mr Treybig seemed confident of Mips despite the company's recent indifferent performance. Referring to a new microprocessor from Digital Equipment which, on paper at least, is the world's fastest, he says: 'I don't think that the Alpha chip is going to run away with the market.' At the top of the range is the Cyclone/R, which Tandem says is the first Risc-based mainframe for high volume OLTP. Mr Treybig believes Tandem's survival and success stems from its ability to provide scalable systems, fault-tolerance and data integrity: 'It is not just the work of a few people. it is a whole culture,' he concludes.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Spanish Bonds: Madrid dealers fall for Maastricht factor THE European Community's Maastricht summit last December motivates Spanish government bond traders and buyers every bit as much as it does those who walk the Brussels corridors of power. Those who shuffle policy papers around Eurocrat departments and those who in Madrid dealing rooms cradle telephones and stare at VDU screens share an enthusiasm for convergence. Madrid bond dealers unsurprisingly call it the Maastricht factor and they love it. The factor has ensured attractive yields for the foreseeable future. The bond market is looking very good, they say, and there is nothing to suggest it will lose its looks. Convergence was Maastricht's buzz word, and at the summit Spain committed itself to narrowing the interest rate differential that sets it apart from its northern European neighbours in order to make a soft landing in the first-tier group of EC members that will form Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Euro-enthusiasts may talk about binding the EC together and Spanish government policy makers, obsessive about the value of EMU, are the chief cheerleaders in the convergence fan club. Spanish bond market watchers, who have taken convergence fully on board, know that such excitement means lowered interest rates and improved yields. Currently, the 10-year 11.30 coupon is yielding around 10.67; the five-year 11.60 is yielding 10.34; and the yield on the three-year 11.80 coupon is 11.41. Traders are monitoring a switch into the newer bonds, and they see that foreign buyers have clearly understood Spain's determination to meet the convergence criteria. One startling implication is that the peseta, which is currently up in the skies as the ceiling currency of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism (ERM), must buckle down to adjust from its present 6 per cent band in the mechanism to one of 2.5 per cent. Spain has until the end of 1993 to do so but already there is talk that the switch may take place in the second semester of this year in conjunction with the pound, the ERM's floor currency. A depreciation of the peseta is inevitable this year. The likelihood is that it will be a controlled depreciation geared to avoid panic among foreign investors. Bullishness over an interest rate cut is fuelled by the particular strength of the peseta which last week was stretching near to snapping its 6 per cent margin against the pound. Nobody imagines the British interest rates going up to narrow the gap; everybody expects Spanish rates to go down to ease the pressure. That is exactly what happened on February 25 when the Bank of Spain introduced a 25 basis-point cut to bring its intervention rate down to 12.40. It did so as much as a favour to the pound as in preparation for convergence. Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, said there was a need to favour 'a more balanced situation' in the ERM. Another cut, one in the range of 10 to 15 basis points, is on the cards in the coming weeks for exactly the same reasons. In expectation of this development, what the market has uppermost in its mind is that Mr Solchaga has said that interest rates could fall by up to 1 percentage point this year if the inflation rate performed well and if salary increases were moderate.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: French farmers in unequal struggle for survival - A look at despairing attempts to turn back the tide of agricultural policy reform FRANCE'S FARMERS are embarking on the final round of a fight for survival. Thousands of them unsuccessfully attempted to blockade Paris yesterday, as France's great and good converged on Louis XIV's chateau in Versailles to vote on the country's European future. Some of the angrier members of Coordination Rurale, a minority splinter group that wants the government to overturn last month's European Community farm policy reforms and raise farm prices, had promised a re-run of the French revolution. Yet the end result was tame, a sign of the diminishing power of the once mighty farm lobby. It caused less disruption than the average bank holiday traffic jam. Instead of blocking access to the capital, the demonstrators chatted amiably with motorists and police, meekly allowing themselves to be rounded up by the latter. The government had in any case forbidden them to hold up the traffic and given the police special powers to shift vehicles. Conscious that it would lose in any confrontation with the police, the CR had ordered its members to avoid violence. The CR represents only 7,000 out of France's 1m farmers and managed to set up a mere 15 road blocks, according to the interior ministry. Even so, the Socialist government is worried by the wave of demonstrations by the CR and some members of the main unions, the right wing FNSEA and CNJA over the past fortnight. The protests have been worst in south-west France, dominated by the small farmers who are likely to be worst hit by the reforms, where vegetables have been dumped on the streets, tyres burned and traffic has been held up by tractors performing 'operations escargots'. For President Francois Mitterrand such a resurgence of anti-EC feeling is most unwelcome at time when he is trying to nurse volatile public opinion towards a firm 'yes' vote in the autumn referendum on the Maastricht agreement. Accordingly, the government has handled its farmers with kid gloves. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, has promised tax benefits, debt assistance and other aid, to be unveiled by the end of July, and has discreetly shelved a series of farming conferences. The police have steered clear of confrontation. A worried Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has joined in, warning on French television that refusal to accept the reforms - steep price cuts over the next three years, with compensation in the form of direct income support - 'would be a catastrophe for our farm system'. The number of French farms could fall to 300,000, less than a third of the present level, if the reforms were not applied. 'With the new system, we can keep 600,000 to 700,000,' he said. These latest demonstrations are different from the ones that have broken out across the French countryside in recent years, and contrasts with last autumn's peaceful and united demonstration by 200,000 farmers in the streets of Paris. Today, the farmers are more divided, less powerful and therefore more tetchy. Only a year ago, they were united against the basic principle of the compensation for price cuts in the form of direct income support. The main farming unions, have always argued that they wanted incomes to depend on prices rather than aid, which they see simply as a way to bring about the slow death of thousands of small farms. The government could not afford to be isolated in opposition to EC farm policy reform, and correctly guessed that FNSEA would have no option but to negotiate. The reforms are 'a series of impostures', says Mr Raymond Lacombe, its president, but he pledges that the union will 'try to use to the best the margin of manoeuvre available in this faulty accord'. The CR, by contrast, will accept nothing less than the complete abandonment of the reforms - a stance that the main unions know is unrealistic. Economically, farmers' power has been in steady decline for the past 20 years, as a result of the ageing of their population, the fall in prices and the growth in their debts. France had 4m farms in 1970, four times today's level, contributing 7 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, as against a mere 4 per cent in 1990. Of today's farms, 18 per cent grow cereals, 17 per cent are dairy and 20 per cent sheep or beef rearing. In line with the intensification of farming across Europe, French farms have also got bigger, from an average of 19 hectares in 1970, to 30 hectares now, according to the agriculture ministry. This suggests that France should do well out of the EC reforms, which favour the most efficient farms. Yet the average hides big disparities. Properties of 100 hectares or more account for a quarter of French farmland, such as the huge wheat farms of plains of the Brie and Beauce in the Paris basin. Not surprisingly, these are the farmers that tend to be most ready to negotiate on CAP reform. The small properties fall into two categories: market gardens, vineyards and orchards, which are profitable on small amounts of land; and the genuinely depressed farmers of the poorest rural areas. This last category is the one that has born the brunt of a decline in earnings, down 2.2 per cent last year despite EC subsidies and a rise in debts, now on average FFr400,000 (Pounds 40,000) per farm. Debts of this magnitude constitute a real burden for a population whose incomes last year ranged from a low of FFr20,000 in Corsica to FFr300,000 in the Paris basin. Against this background few young people are prepared to continue operating their parents' farms, the main reason for the ageing of France's farmers. Of the total, 60 per cent are more than 50 years old and 40 per cent of the total profess to having no successor.</p>

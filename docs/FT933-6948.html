			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / 'Bidding wars' truce by governors US GOVERNORS have agreed on a new policy aimed at preventing 'bidding wars' in their efforts to attract businesses to their states by offering tax breaks and other incentives. The policy will not end such competition but officials hope it will mark a truce and help states to focus on improving their general economic conditions. Governor Jim Edgar of Illinois, main author of the policy, said it 'should restore some sanity to the competition'. Governors have often come under attack for spending more money and effort trying to attract new industrial plants than on maintaining sound business conditions for existing businesses that may have a much better record of creating local jobs. The new policy statement from the National Governors' Association, agreed at a meeting in Oklahoma last week, says that the competition for plant location 'should not be characterised by how much direct assistance a state can provide to individual companies'. Instead, states should be judged on such factors as improvements in education, transport, telecommunications, general tax policies, business regulation and the quality of public services. The announcement of a new industrial plant can trigger a flurry of offers from states anxious to win the jobs it would bring, ranging from tax holidays to free land and infrastructure investments. Mercedes-Benz received offers from more than 30 communities around the US when it announced it would build a Dollars 300m factory making four-wheel drive utility vehicles. BMW won an estimated Dollars 71m in land grants and other incentives from South Carolina when it decided to locate a Dollars 410m plant in Greenville.</p>

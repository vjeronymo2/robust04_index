			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / French franc slips against D-Mark THE FRENCH franc continued to weaken against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers suggested that signs of weakness in the economy were putting pressure on the Bank of France to cut interest rates, writes James Blitz. It closed at FFr3.386, having been at FFr3.383 in London on Friday night. Last night's close left it some 2 centimes weaker against the D-Mark than it had been a week ago. Against its ERM divergence indicator, the franc closed at minus 61 percentage points. Dealers said a spate of poor economic indicators, last week's unemployment figures among them, had made an interest rate cut even more urgent. Although the Bundesbank reduced its official interest rates by half a percentage point last week, some saw this yesterday as insufficient for France's economic needs.</p>

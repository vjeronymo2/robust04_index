			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / City workers accused of complacency on security COMPLACENCY among companies and workers about security in the City of London was criticised yesterday. The comments followed an IRA bomb 10 days ago which killed three people and caused extensive damage. Mr John Wyatt, a security and bomb-disposal expert, said: 'Some companies feel they are faced with a situation they cannot understand and are incapable of taking any measures that will help them.' Police said the scale of damage caused by the St Mary Axe bomb had made companies take the possibility of terrorist attack seriously but employees were less concerned. Two meetings for company representatives had attracted 300 managers, while only three people had attended a well-advertised police meeting on Tuesday for the public. As the city continued clearing up, getting back to business appeared to take priority over tightening security. At Commercial Union, whose head offices on 10 floors of the 23-storey CU tower took the full force of the blast contractors are concentrating on making the building weatherproof. envisage extra security precautions. It is expected to move its HQ into the Cutlers Exchange building on the eastern edge of the City. Companies which have moved into temporary offices such as Sanwa, the Japanese bank, said the main priority had been to ensure that dealing rooms could operate normally again. Mr Noboshi Kamei, Sanwa's deputy managing director, said: 'It is impossible to prevent a bomb disaster from happening.' Chief Inspector Peter Moore of the City Police said: 'Businesses have begun to realise the necessity to have back-up systems for the retention of computer data, financial information or whatever.' The lack of interest in Tuesday's meeting had been partly because the incident had gone from the headlines. The judge in the Birmingham Six case last night admitted he felt unhappy about the verdict which sentenced the men to 16 years in prison before they were freed on appeal. Lord Bridge said on Thames Television's This Week programme that the judiciary should take a 'share of the responsibility' for injustices. He was unhappy, but did not feel guilty about the Birmingham Six. Letters, Page 23 A ROW over the leaking of a secret Scotland Yard report on the IRA to the Irish Times intensified yesterday with allegations that M15, the British intelligence service may have been responsible. Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow said it was 'more than likely' that M15 was responsible. The row follows the sending to the prime minister of a Home Office report which discusses the possibility of M15 taking control of intelligence gathering from the police. Scotland Yard last night would not confirm a report that senior officers were convinced that the document leaked to the Irish Times formed part of an M15 'dirty tricks' campaign. It has set up an internal inquiry. The document sugggests the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist squad had 'little' intelligence on the IRA members responsible for some 17 killings in more than four attacks on the mainland since 1988.</p>

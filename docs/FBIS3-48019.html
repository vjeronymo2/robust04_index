			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] U.S. Commerce Under Secretary Garten, who is now  visiting Japan to attend the vice ministerial-level Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, held a meeting with Yutaka Kume,  chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association  [JAMA] Inc., (and chairman of the Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.) on 13  January. During the meeting, in touching on the deadlocked  government-level negotiations on the issue of Japan's purchase  of U.S.-made auto parts, he asked Kume to come up with a "mid-  to long-term purchase expansion" plan. At the same time, he  urged that in an effort to increase sales of U.S.-made autos in  Japan, Japan should open its automobile dealers' sales network  to U.S.-made autos.    In response, JAMA Chairman Kume firmly rejected Under  Secretary Garten's call for expanding the purchase of U.S-made  auto parts in the mid- to long-term by saying: "This call means  asking us to set numerical targets for future purchases.  Therefore, we cannot make any promise." In this way, Kume  clearly indicated a stand of firmly rejecting any requests that  lead to the setting of numerical targets. With regard to  Garten's call for opening auto dealers' sales network to  U.S.-made autos, Kume said: "That is not something in which we,  auto manufacturers, should interfere."    Under Secretary Garten also met with Mitsubishi Motors  Corporation President Yuichi Nakamura and asked him to increase  Japan's purchase of U.S.-made auto parts. In reply, President  Nakamura, in referring to the Japanese auto industry's goal of  increasing the total amount of its purchases of U.S.-made auto  parts to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994, said: "Because of a  drastic change in the economic environment, it is difficult to  attain our goal ($1.6 billion). Given such a situation, it is  impossible to set a numerical target for fiscal year 1995 and  after that."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Lansana Conte following his </F> inauguration as president in Conakry on 29 January -- live or  recorded]    [Text] Guinean men and women, by the grace of God, on 19  December 1993 you elected me through the ballot box to continue  to lead our country. I thank you for the confidence that you  have renewed in me, not only because of my victory, but  especially for the political maturity that you have displayed  through your massive participation in this first multiparty  election and your calmness and tranquillity during the  elections. This good example was well noted by the impartial  observers. This is again to the credit of the Guinean people.  I sincerely thank the entire Guinean people for this. I extend  my sincere gratitude particularly to all those who contributed  to the smooth organization of the elections. I particularly  have in mind activists and supporters of the Party for Unity and  Progress [PUD], the party which chose me as its humble  presidential candidate, as well as activists and supporters of  other parties and associations that supported my candidacy.  Finally my gratitude goes to all anonymous persons who do not  belong to any political parties or associations but who placed  their confidence in me.    Dear compatriots, in this regard I do not want to represent  a  particular family, ethnic group, or region. I want to be the  humble servant of all Guineans wherever they are and whatever  their social category. I want all Guineans to know that I will  never consider the unfavorable votes of some compatriots as the  expression of hostility against my person. On the contrary, I  consider the expression of difference an indispensable element  for strengthening democracy which I have resolutely introduced  into our country. I wish that this viewpoint as well as the  determination to build national unity through work and education  will be shared by all the actors in the political life of our  country. Never will I consider my seven competitors as my  enemies but as indispensable actors in the democratic process.    During my mandate, I will devote most of my energies and  experience to the service of Guineans and our fatherland Guinea.  In this task of nation building which we will accomplish  together, I will need the ideas, competence, and know-how of  each and everyone of you. This is why I am making a solemn  appeal to all persons of goodwill, regardless of their political  leanings, to join in building Guinea, for in my view, the  victory of the PUD candidate is not the victory of one fraction  of Guineans against another. It is the victory of all Guinean  people over their agonies and over all the insidious forms of  social disintegration.    It is now up to all cadres to be responsible for  safeguarding the presitge of our nation and the existence of the  state by showing our people the highest degree of tolerance.  Tolerance, which was the motto of my electoral campaign, is for  me the most beautiful and the highest of all virtues. Nothing  is possible in society without this human quality. It is a  precondition for all relationships between men. Those who  describe tolerance as a sign of weakness should know that  tolerance does not leave out any ideal. It is a virtue whose  force resides in the respect of others.    Dear compatriots, one condition that will enable us to  confidently begin this new page in the history of our country is  for all political leaders to come together and together set up a  solid foundation for a democratic society. For my part, and  within the framework of the already defined conditions, I am  open to dialogue, consultations, and cooperation with all  Guineans of goodwill, regardless of their political leanings.    Dear compatriots, the important changes that we undertook in  all fields, should be pursued with more rigor and cohesion so as  to confer more efficiency to our action. As I have said on  several occasions, during my term of office, I will strive to  pursue -- with your help -- the social program that was  initiated in 1984 and that I proposed to concretize in December  1985. Of course, I will continue to proceed with the necessary  assessments in order to readjust it and make the necessary  changes. Therefore, priority sectors remain the same such as  the strengthening of national unity to ensure the prevalence of  peace in our country, the consolidation of a law-abiding state,  and the respect of republican institutions.    Dear compatriots, I am well aware of the importance of the  tasks ahead, some of which deserve special attention. The war  against delinquency and insecurity will be resolutely and firmly  waged. We should know that this fight is the duty of each and  every one of us. Families, schools, communes, and prefectures  should play their role as educationists. All in all, the state  will assume its responsibilities to maintain public order and to  ensure the security of citizens.    Fellow Guineans, the fact that the international economic  circumstances are becoming more and more difficult has also led  our country to be confronted with the painful problem of  unemployment. At that level, the struggle to create a maximum of  jobs requires the involvement of all our financial backers. We  should facilitate their participation in order to achieve these  objectives. To do so, we have to take global measures capable  of making it easier for them to revamp the private sector and  thus generate new jobs.    In this framework, there is the need to be adapted to the  labor market. Young graduates in search of jobs will have to  benefit from the preferential recruitment quota on the basis of  qualification criteria required by the employer.    Our equipment and territorial development policy will  particularly stress the solution of energy problems and the  development of communication infrastructure in order to make the  remote areas accessible. We must never forget that our  prosperity depends mainly on the farmer. Helping the farmer to  efficiently formulate factors of production and continuing to  protect him from arbitrary fixing of prices of his produce are  some of my main concerns. He must be encouraged in his fight to  make our country self-sufficient in food production.    These objectives cannot be attained without ensuring moral  probity in the management of public affairs. I will personally  watch over this. In order to implement this program, I place my  great hope in women and young people, the active forces of the  society. This is an occasion to salute the important role  played by women and young people in all our achievements so far.  I would like to remind them that we are looking forward to  their contribution. It will be decisive in the successful  implementation of the socioeconomic program that we have  assigned ourselves.    People of Guinea, in addition to the great efforts that we  have to make in developing our country, we need the support of  our traditional partners and the international community. We  thank them for the assistance they have given us in the  implementation of our democratization process.    Fellow Guineans, your trust gives me a new force that I am  determined to put to the service of our dear fatherland. All we  need now is to accept our differences and reach a national  consensus on the strategies and stakes for the country's  economic development. In this connection, we must learn to  resolve our problems ourselves without being discourteous. This  means we must get down to work. Our ambition to be a strong,  united, and prosperous nation calls for this attitude.    Long live democracy. Long live the Republic.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENSION HEIGHTENED OVER PROTESTANTS' PARADE;  </P> <P> IRA BOMBING PRECEDES ULSTER MARCH  </P> <P> A bomb planted by the outlawed Irish Republican Army exploded here Saturday as  thousands of Protestants gathered to march in a parade celebrating a victory  over a Roman Catholic king three centuries ago.  </P> <P> The explosion, wrecking a bar four hours before the Apprentice Boys' Parade but  causing no injuries, underlined tensions as Northern Ireland approached the  20th anniversary of the British government's decision to send troops to Ulster.  </P> <P> It was the Apprentice Boys' Parade in 1969 that touched off rioting in Roman  Catholic areas and led to troops arriving in the province on Aug. 14, 1969.  </P> <P> Saturday's bombing, said marcher Robert Kerr, "means we have no security."  </P> <P> "For the amount of money they're spending, we should get better security," said  Kerr, who drove 60 miles from his farm near Dungannon to join the parade.  </P> <P> Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a Butcher Street bar. It  had been discovered by security forces who evacuated the area, but it exploded  before army experts could defuse it, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> The explosion shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IRA Statement  </P> <P> A statement released by the IRA said the bomb was timed to go off when security  forces were in the area. By planting the device, the statement said, the IRA  proved it could strike despite heavy security.  </P> <P> The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to drive the British out of the province.  </P> <P> On Friday night, police said they had seized a bomb packed with 10 pounds of  Semtex plastic explosives and arrested two men in the Catholic Creggan  neighborhood of Londonderry.  </P> <P> There was heavy security Saturday along the parade route across the broad River  Foyle and through the picturesque walled city, with dozens of armored police  vehicles in the streets and soldiers patrolling in full combat gear.  </P> <P> The Royal Ulster Constabulary, a provincial police force, reported that the  parade passed without incident.  </P> <P> Londonderry has long been a place of mythic significance to Protestants as the  scene of a 15-week siege in 1689 by the forces of the exiled Catholic King  James II, who had been ousted in favor of the Protestant William of Orange, the  Dutch-born prince who ruled Britain jointly with his English wife and cousin,  Mary.  </P> <P> The "no surrender" spirit of the apprentice boys who slammed the city gates to  prevent their leader from capitulating lives on as a political slogan for the  so-called Loyalist side -- the large segment of the Protestant community that  supports British rule.  </P> <P> Aug. 12 is the day the siege was lifted.  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Firm golds help S Africa to extend recent gains Johannesburg was broadly firmer as investors overcame fears of profit-taking and stocks extended recent gains in mostly steady trade. The US Labor Day holiday did little to dampen enthusiasm, while a static bullion price proved no inhibition to demand for gold shares. A decision by motor assembly workers, on strike for the last five weeks, to return to work from tomorrow gave late support to industrials, which had lagged behind the market for most of the day. The gold shares index climbed 51 to 2,453 after a 71-point advance on Friday. The overall index was 41 ahead at 5,956 and industrials added 22 at 6,608, having rebounded from an early low of 6,572. De Beers was R2 higher at R107, Anglos put on R2 at R260 and Gencor firmed 50 cents to R14.75. Against the trend, SAB lost 50 cents at R86.75 and Barlows shed 25 cents to R33.75. Iscor was 16 cents stronger at R4.48 in a continued bullish reaction to year-end results.</p>

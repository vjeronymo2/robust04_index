			<p>BFN     [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will not  participate in the next government if the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] nominates Chairman Gyula Horn for prime minister.  Campaign chief Balint Magyar told journalists that if the MSZP  names the party chairman as candidate for prime minister, they  will read the message that the Socialists do not want to form a  coalition with the SZDSZ.    The party will accept only an alliance in which it can  realize its program, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe said. He added  that the final word on coalition membership will be pronounced  by the extraordinary delegates' meeting of the SZDSZ a week  after the second round of the elections.</p>

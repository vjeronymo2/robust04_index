			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade Balance in the Black in </F> January"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 1 -- The Italian trade balance  continues to be healthy and in January Italy posted a surplus of  912 billion lire, some 560 million dollars, compared to a  deficit of 464 billion lire in January 1993.    The exchange office said here Friday [1 April] that payment  made for Italian exports totaled 17.519 trillion lire, up 15.1  percent, while payment for imports came to 16.607 trillion lire,  for a 5.9 percent gain.    Italy's trade balance with its European Union partners also  improved, from a 610 billion lire deficit in January 1993 to 214  billion lire this past January, while there was a significant  increase for Italy's trade balance with non-European Union  countries, which went from a 532 billion lire deficit in January  1993 to a surplus of 506 billion lire this January.    The improvement was said to have been recorded for all goods  sectors and especially, regarding trade with European Union  countries, mechanical products which shifted from a deficit a  year earlier of 712 billion lire to one of 512 billion lire, and  for textiles and clothing, for which the surplus rose from 873  to 967 billion lire from one January to the next.    On the opposite end of the scale, the trade balance got  worse  for food products, with the deficit growing from 737 billion  lire to 929 billion lire.    Outside the European Union there was a significant reduction  in the trade deficit for food goods, from 200 billion to 82  billion lire, and the surplus improved in the textile-clothing  sectors from 124 to 289 billion lire, as well as the mechanical  sector, to 165 billion lire, and steel products, up 113 billion  lire.    On a nation-by-nation basis, the improvement in the trade  balance was most evident towards France, Germany and the United  States, with the surplus climbing, respectively to 92 billion  lire, 326 billion lire and 526 billion lire.    Italy's surplus shrank, however, from January to January,  with Spain, from 272 to 166 billion lire, Portugal, 175 billion  lire to 121 billion lire, and Greece, 379 to 166 billion lire.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Arms tenders save MoD Pounds 1bn a year The Ministry of Defence has probably saved more than Pounds 1bn a year from its annual Pounds 10bn equipment budget through competitive tendering, a National Audit Office report published yesterday says. The report adds that the greater use of competitions for contracts, and increasing the risks borne by contractors, have been the critical factors in gaining better value for money from weapons procurement. As a result Britain's arms industry has become more competitive, helping it to win export orders worth more than Pounds 6bn in 1993. But the report questions some aspects of MoD policy. Collaborative development with other nations may mean lower costs than if each country pursued a weapon design on its own, but there are cost penalties because work is duplicated. Rationalising production of the Eurofighter could save Pounds 625m on the UK's projected order of 250 aircraft - some Pounds 2.5m per plane. Constant changes of specification are also a problem, costing Pounds 112m on important projects in 1992-93. One project had 193 changes of specification at a cost of Pounds 9.3m - 20 per cent of the total project costs. The report recognises that there are costs associated with encouraging competition. Some 13,000 competitive contracts have been run by the MoD, attracting an average of 6.4 tenders each. The audit office suggests that companies will attempt to recover the costs of unsuccessful tenders through other business. Britain's defence industry is seen to have been squeezed since the end of the cold war. The audit office estimates that the industry's workforce has fallen from 625,000 in 1985 to 500,000 now. Of 30 large defence contractors surveyed by the European Commission, 27 saw a threat to their future profitability. The arms industry needs government guidance if it is to focus its capital investment and research and development programmes effectively, the audit office says, noting that efforts have been made to improve communication between government and industry. The report applauds the transfer of risks to industry, but suggests that the MoD could also refine those passed on to contractors by not insisting on fixed prices for some very long-term projects, avoiding the expense of insuring companies against inflation risks which may be overestimated. The 'formidable force' of the Russian air force must remain the yardstick against which the RAF and allied air forces are measured, the cross-party Commons defence committee said yesterday. 'We cannot conceive that further cuts would be acceptable in an RAF strike/attack force of fewer than 100 frontline aircraft,' the MPs said. Following the Options for Change defence review, the Tornado force is 104 aircraft.</p>

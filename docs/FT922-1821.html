			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Major's plan is to seek new view of accord - London THE decisive Yes vote in yesterday's Irish referendum brought the expected relief in Whitehall - alongside an acknowledgment that for Mr John Major a second chance for the Maastricht accords carries risks as well as opportunities. British ministers believe the deal on economic and political union has been reprieved rather than rescued. A mechanism has still to be found to persuade the Danes to reverse their vote. The accord must also survive the unpopularity of President Francois Mitterrand in the French referendum. But the confident tone of Mr Major's dismissal yesterday of the calls from Euro-sceptics in his own party for a renegotiation of Maastricht suggested that, for now at least, he is focusing on the opportunities. Mr Major, whose government takes over the EC presidency on July 1, has the task of securing a settlement which meets the fears of the Danes without unravelling the Maastricht treaties. He hopes the British presidency will secure a re-interpretation of the direction in which Maastricht will take the Community. In satisfying Denmark, Mr Major believes he can marginalise the Euro-sceptics in his party and secure enough support for ratification in parliament. The basic strategy is to give substance to the once dubious British contention that Maastricht could represent a break with the 'centralising process' in the Community created by the Single European Act. Mr Major will seek ways to reinforce an interpretation of the treaty in which closer European co-operation is set firmly on intergovernmental rather than federalist pillars. One possibility is the much tighter definition of subsidiarity already floated by London. But it sees an unequivocal commitment to rapid enlargement as equally important in persuading doubters in Denmark and at home that Maastricht is not the precursor to a United States of Europe. No one in London is certain how such formulae could be attached to the Maastricht accord - nor what if anything might be enough to persuade the Danish people to change their vote. There are also too many other battles waiting to be fought - among them the level of Community resources, the size of cohesion funds and the Gatt trade talks - to allow for confident predictions that the route will be smooth. But the task suits Mr Major's temperament. He is a politician adept at building compromises, setting a painstaking approach to detail alongside an ability to defuse confrontations. The judgment in London is that Danes have clipped the wings of the federalists and in the process greatly strengthened Mr Major's case as EC president for the Community to put pragmatism first. His colleagues believe there is a chance that by the time of the Edinburgh summit, there will be a deal on the table that will stitch together again the patchwork of compromises agreed at Maastricht. At home the Conservative Euro-sceptics will not give up. Next week the European Reform Group of Conservative backbenchers - which claims around 80 members - will attempt to broaden its attack on European integration by blaming the depth of the country's recession on sterling's participation in the exchange rate mechanism. But along with the Community, Mr Major has recovered his balance. For the moment he rather than his party's rebels holds the initiative.</p>

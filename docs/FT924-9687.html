			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Du Pont faces tough test of fibre - The potential buyers of its carpet capacity DU PONT'S swap of chemical assets with Imperial Chemical Industries, which was given the green light last month by the European Commission, could provide a few headaches for the US group. A condition of the deal was that Du Pont dispose of 12,000 tonnes of newly-acquired nylon carpet fibre production. Du Pont says it has already had a couple of unsolicited expressions of interest about the capacity, but given the sorry state of the west European carpet fibres industry, it is far from clear how serious these might be. Falling demand and substitution by other materials, in particular polypropylene, has led to gross over-capacity among carpet fibre manufacturers. Nylon carpet fibres come in two types. The most common is continuous filament, while the other is discontinuous or staple fibre. ICI's former plant at Oestringen, in Germany, which manufactures both types, is the most likely candidate for disposal, although Du Pont says the final decision is yet to be made. European capacity currently exceeds demand. Sales of carpet filament last year were 164,000 tonnes, compared with a capacity of 230,000 tonnes. Meanwhile, demand for staple fibre was only 138,000 tonnes, compared with a capacity of 180,000 tonnes, according to the Brussels-based International Committee of Rayon and Synthetic Filament (CIRFS). About 70 per cent of production is used in carpets. Europe is a net exporter of both types, but has little chance of reducing over-capacity by raising sales abroad, says Mr Jean-Louis Juvet, director-general of CIRFS. The fall in demand has been created not just by consumers putting off purchases. Large groups, such as department stores, are not replacing floor coverings, says Mr Stan Davies, an independent consultant. Demand in the automotive market is also depressed. Meanwhile, although nylon has 39 per cent of the fibre market for textile floor-coverings, polypropylene has captured 36 per cent and is shortly expected to overtake nylon. In addition, nylon is under competition from cheap wool. Operating rates in the nylon carpet fibres industry remain terrible, says Mr Juvet. In filament, only 74 per cent of capacity was running last year, while staple production was running at 83 per cent. Analysts believe no European nylon carpet fibre manufacturer is making money. Casting around for possible purchases of Du Pont's surplus nylon fibre production, analysts have come up with France's Rhone-Poulenc. The group has just linked with Snia of Italy to form a joint-venture which has about 15 per cent of the European continuous filament market and about 30 per cent of the European staple fibre market. However, Rhone-Poulenc is in the middle of an asset disposal programme aimed at cutting borrowings by FFr3bn (Dollars 564m) this year. The group's target is to reduce its debt to equity ratio from 0.78 at the end of last year to close to 0.5 in 1993. Other candidates include Germany's BASF. The group has substantial carpet fibre operations in the US, with four plants and an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes a year. It has no production in Europe and might be interested in creating a global presence. Akzo, the Dutch company, is another possibility. The group has limited nylon carpet capacity. However, Mr Syb Bergsma, a member of Akzo's management committee, said in August that its carpet operations were unprofitable. The company is reducing production and cutting 240 jobs. Analysts expect Akzo to pull out of the market, if it can find a buyer. Small to medium-sized candidates include Beaulieu of Belgium, which has about 12 per cent of the continuous filament market, and Aquafil and Radicci, both of Italy, which respectively have 11 per cent and 9 per cent of the west European market. Further potential buyers include actual carpetmakers. Mr Davies believes German carpet companies might group together to make a bid. This would free them from the threat of Du Pont's potentially dominant position. However, the commission would need to be convinced of the need to sell to the carpet makers. Competition officials indicated last week that the capacity and related facilities should be sold to a single competitor, which ought to be a fibres manufacturer. A further possibility is a management buy-out by former ICI fibres marketing employees, says Mr Davies. Their jobs would be most vulnerable in the event of rationalisation, he explains. Outside the EC, the most likely is Allied Signal, one of the US's largest industrial groups. It already imports fibres equivalent to about 9 per cent of European filament market. And this summer it started a significant expansion of its industrial fibres operations with construction of a new Dollars 220m plant in France. But some analysts believe it may prove difficult for Du Pont to find a buyer at all. The group has undertaken to make 'best endeavours' to dispose of the 12,000 tonnes within 12 months of the completion of its deal with ICI. Analysts, however, are far from convinced anybody would want to expand their share of the market at the moment. If Du Pont fails to find a buyer, the commission says it will extend the deadline. But the US group may end up with all of ICI's fibres capacity in spite of the best efforts of Sir Leon Brittan, the commission's vice-president, and his trust-busters.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WESTERN EUROPEAN NYLON PRODUCERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                      Market share %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bulk Continuous Filament  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Du Pont                           21 Snia/Rhone Poulenc                18 Beaulieu                          12 Aquafil                           11 ICI                               10 Allied-Signal*                     9 Radicci                            9 Akzo                               8 Others                             2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Polyamide Stable Fibre  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ICI                               35 Snia/Rhone Poulenc                28 Du Pont                           20 Others                            17  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Imported from the USSource: Snia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

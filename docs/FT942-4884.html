			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Battle for Moscow moves from street to balance sheet: The mayor's attempt to short-circuit privatisation Moscow has become the site of a furious battle over privatisation in Russia. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, has called on the country's president and prime minister to 'punish' the mayor of Moscow for 'undermining the foundations of Russian statehood'. He accuses Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, an old-style manager with a populist touch, of trying to replace the government's radical privatisation policies with his personal control over enterprises in the Russian capital. In three weeks vouchers entitling every Russian citizen to a share of state property expire. Mr Chubais has launched his assault on Mr Luzhkov before the next stage of privatisation. From July 1, enterprises will be sold for money only and Mr Luzhkov wants to make sure that that money ends up in the city's coffers rather than those of the government. Moscow is not only important as a showpiece of the government's reform policies, but the capital is a leading industrial centre in its own right. Despite claims by Mr Luzhkov that Moscow was among the top privatising areas, figures from his own office show that it was 20th in a list of 89 regions, having privatised less than half the companies it was supposed to have sold off under the government's programme. Mr Luzhkov's 'special' plan for privatisation in Moscow would enable the mayor's office - and that means the mayor because all important decision in the city administration are taken by him - to dictate what happens to enterprises after they are privatised. This includes instructions that new owners would be entitled only to profits over and above those made by a company before it was privatised and that only the mayor's office would be able to decide whether enterprises could be bankrupted or liquidated. Mr Luzhkov claims that enterprises auctioned off so far have been sold to speculators and that the government's ambitious sell-off of half of Russian industry has not yielded any benefits. On April 1 Mr Luzhkov suspended the registration of joint-stock companies, a precondition for their privatisation according to the government's sell-off method. This has consisted of auctioning off enterprises for vouchers, as quickly as possibly, in order to get the state out of the economy while minimising opportunities for corrupt officials to decide who gets what. At the end of last month, at Mr Chubais' request, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, gave Mr Luzhkov a three-day deadline to resume the registration of joint-stock companies. But on Thursday last week, Mr Luzhkov suggested that the instructions were not to be taken seriously. Last month, he suspended land sales in the capital, saying the government needed land to generate revenues for the city budget. The main reason Mr Luzhkov has been able to get away with so much is political. Having been loyal to President Boris Yeltsin in all his conflicts with the Russian parliament, the mayor of Moscow is seen as an essential ally for any Kremlin ruler should the country's power struggle ever return to the streets of the capital. Nor has Mr Luzhkov hesitated to take his struggle to the streets and to factory shop-floors. In a direct challenge to the government's policies, he gave Rbs30bn (Dollars 15m) to 'save' Zil, an ailing Moscow truck manufacturer which had closed its gates for several weeks. While the government had proposed that Zil re-organise and use its land holdings to raise new capital, Mr Luzhkov, who always says the city is too broke to pay its doctors, teachers, and police properly, found no trouble financing support for Zil, which happens to be run by an old political rival of Mr Yeltsin's. Mr Luzhkov, who rejects suggestions that he plans to run for president in elections scheduled for 1996, denies that his motives are political. He says simply that the government must take into account factors that make Moscow different.</p>

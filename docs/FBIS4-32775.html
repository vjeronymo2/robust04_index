			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mario Esquivel] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 29 May (PL) -- Members of the Mexican  Let's Go for Cuba solidarity group today held a rally in front  of the U.S. embassy in Mexico City to protest the U.S. blockade  against that Caribbean nation.    The demonstration, which coincided with U.S. Democratic  Representative Robert Torricelli's visit to Chiapas, was  intended to demand the lifting of the more than 30-year-old U.S.  restrictions against the island which harm the Cuban people.    Spokesmen for the solidarity organization reported the  "interventionist nature" of Torricelli's presence in the  country, which is intended to harm traditional relations between  Mexico and Cuba.    In this regard, they urged the Mexican Government not to  forget the traditional policy of friendship that has been  maintained with the Caribbean nation for years and they stressed  that "to struggle for Cuba is to struggle for Mexico."    Several of the demonstrators protested Torricelli's attitude  of meddling in Mexico's domestic affairs. Torricelli stated  recently that with the signing of NAFTA, the United States  acquired not only the right, but also "the responsibility" of  evaluating what occurs in Mexico.    In a communique released this Sunday, the solidarity group  also rejected the so-called "Cuban Democracy Act" of 1992  because the group considers this document to be contrary to  international law.    In this regard, Jose Carrillo, coordinator of the  organization, told PRENSA LATINA that as part of the strategy of  support for Cuba, they have presented to the Mexican Congress a  petition with 13,000 signatures asking for the sale of petroleum  to Cuba under preferential terms.    We also seek, Carrillo added, negotiations to refine Mexican  crude in Cuban installations because it is a transaction that  would benefit both countries.    Slogans such as "Jump if you are not a Yankee" and jeers  against Torricelli characterized the rally, which ended with the  symbolic burning of the law sponsored by the U.S.  representative. The rally was watched by several U.S. embassy  officials who refrained from going outside the diplomatic  mission.</p>

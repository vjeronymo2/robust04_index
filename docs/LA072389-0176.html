			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM, LIFE IN THE FREE-LANCE LANE;  </P> <P> MUSICIANS PLAY FOR SEVERAL OUTLETS BUT STRAINS INCREASE  </P> <P> James Thatcher sees himself as an independent businessman. The 38-year-old  French-horn player has built a substantial studio career in addition to his  work with the Pasadena and Pacific symphonies. "It's not uncommon for me to do  a film in the morning and 'Ein Heldenleben' at night," he says. "There's no  such thing as an ordinary week."  </P> <P> Thatcher is one member of Los Angeles' free-lance musician work force. Like the  others, he may spend as much of his workday behind the wheel of his car as  behind a music stand, but he relishes the variety of music the free-lance life  provides.  </P> <P> "The balance is wonderful," says violist Laura Kuennen. "I'm often tired, I'm  often overworked, but I'm never bored." Kuennen has been here less than two  years, after experiences with large orchestras in Rochester, Puerto Rico and  San Diego.  </P> <P> She adds that the combination of work available to her, "is probably possible  only in Los Angeles. Free-lancing here is much more wide open than in New York  -- New York is very tightly controlled."  </P> <P> Consider -- if you are not subject to vertigo -- just some of the labyrinthine  interrelationships among some local orchestras.  </P> <P> The principal trumpeter of the Pasadena Symphony plays principal trumpet with  the Pacific Symphony, the principal bassoonist of the Pacific Symphony is also  principal for the Glendale Symphony, the principal cellist of the Glendale  Symphony is co-principal of the Long Beach Symphony, the concertmaster of the  Long Beach Symphony shares the post in the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and  the whole viola section of the Chamber Orchestra is part of the Pasadena  Symphony.  </P> <P> Throw in other community orchestras -- and there are 37 that have found it  worthwhile to sign a master agreement with Musicians' Local 47 alone, not  including ensembles in Long Beach and Orange County -- which employ many of  these players as principals, and it should be clear that there are some very  busy musicians in town.  </P> <P> Particularly since these orchestras are not even the main source of income for  many of these players. Local part-time orchestras are beneficiaries of the  enormous pool of top-notch players drawn here by high-paying studio work. From  these ranks come the key musicians who can make regional and community  orchestras in the area sound like world-class ensembles, given the right  conductors.  </P> <P> That, at least, is the conventional wisdom, and it provided a fair picture of  the way things were. A laissez-faire sort of non-system evolved that, horrors  of scheduling aside, served both organizations and musicians well.  </P> <P> But the system is changing under pressure from within and without the  orchestras, as the groups themselves and the needs of the players change.  Strain is showing as orchestras dive into the talent pool and hit bottom, and  competition begins to color cooperation.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> "It is difficult, and it's getting more difficult all the time," Robert  McMullin, executive director of the Pasadena Symphony, says of the effort to  secure the services of the best free-lance players. "Los Angeles is becoming  more and more an important center for the arts, and, as it happens, the core  players -- the studio musicians -- are in greater and greater demand."  </P> <P> Other orchestra administrators echo McMullin's plaint. Through close  cooperation, though, they try to minimize scheduling conflicts, allowing their  musicians as much freedom as possible.  </P> <P> "One thing that I think is positive," says McMullin, "is that there is a  greater awareness among orchestra managers that we're going to have to  cooperate. With that happening, we may be able to avert disaster."  </P> <P> "We have to make it as 'do-able' as possible by consulting with colleagues,"  says Mary Newkirk, general manager of the Long Beach Symphony. "We go out of  our way to see that that happens. We exchange our schedules a year, two years,  in advance."  </P> <P> The players appreciate those efforts. "We're lucky to have good contractors and  managers," says Susan Ranney, principal bassist for the Chamber Orchestra and  the Pasadena Symphony. Last season, Pasadena and Music Center Opera (for which  the Chamber Orchestra is the pit band) changed some rehearsals to ease the  pressure of overlapping dates.  </P> <P> Steven Scharf, the personnel manager for both the Long Beach Symphony and the  Chamber Orchestra, says: "It's my job to see both ends of the issue of  free-lancing."  </P> <P> In addition to trying to juggle schedules, most orchestras also have a policy  of allowing some absences. Flexibility, indeed, is the great virtue of the  present free-market system, according to all managers.  </P> <P> But Scharf warns that the future may be much more rigid. "I'm going to have to  cut that flexibility," he says. In Long Beach during the last season, with its  search for a music director, there were five rehearsals for each concert and  musicians were allowed to miss one. Next season, however, the orchestra is  going back to four rehearsals and players will find it harder to get out of  any.  </P> <P> The Long Beach Symphony is also expanding its season. Also with full calendars  are the Chamber Orchestra -- which augments its own busy season with  engagements as the orchestra for the Music Center Opera, totaling more than 200  services for the coming season -- and the Pacific Symphony -- which can offer  its musicians engagements accompanying other organizations at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, such as the Pacific Chorale and visitors such as  American Ballet Theatre. Both offer large numbers of concerts and rehearsal  dates, with accompanying paychecks, to their players.  </P> <P> The result of larger seasons is an increased pressure on players to commit  themselves to the organizations and increased sense of competition for the  players' services.  </P> <P> "The players will bounce around from orchestra to orchestra, and its hard to  get them to commit," acknowledges Scharf. "The expansion is not as much of a  problem as that the younger players are getting older, more experienced and  more in demand."  </P> <P> "At a certain point, truthfully, we have to say, 'You have a commitment with  us,' " says Deborah Rutter, executive director of the Chamber Orchestra, who  points out that the commitment works two ways. "I've been here (with LACO) 2  1/2 years, and this is the worst . . . and it's getting much worse."  </P> <P> In a chicken-and-the-egg situation: The quest for key players is itself feeding  the move toward longer seasons. Says Newkirk: "No question, it's going to be  harder as all the orchestras grow. We want to compete for the best players.  That's one of the factors that drives us to get back to a larger level of  performances."  </P> <P> Newkirk adds, however, that "I truly believe that the competition is not  between orchestras -- who gets the best players or even subscribers' dollars --  but for people's time."  </P> <P> The musicians express a mixture of worry and optimism about the situation.  </P> <P> "People on all ends have been very understanding," says Kuennen, a violist with  the Chamber Orchestra, Long Beach Symphony and the New 20th-Century Players at  CalArts, where she teaches. "How long they'll be able to keep that going, I  don't know. I think everybody who employs free-lance musicians understands that  if they put the screws to them too hard (to commit to any one organization),  they're going to be the losers. They want to keep the talent pool happy."  </P> <P> For all the understanding, good will and collegial consultation, there are  still inevitable scheduling conflicts, which force some hard decisions on  players and create curious coincidental anomalies. Kuennen, for example, is on  the Pasadena roster but, she says, "I haven't played with them this season,  because I've been too busy."  </P> <P> When musicians must choose between orchestras -- as they will have to do more  and more as seasons expand -- the choice is seldom made over money. Pay and  benefits are almost the same per service, roughly $85 for concerts and $65 for  rehearsals, in all of these orchestras.  </P> <P> Instead, the musicians pick the orchestra offering the most interesting  repertory (or repertory with important solos for their instrument) and the most  artistically and personally congenial people. On this point, nobody is more  important than the conductor.  </P> <P> "There is an inside joke among local per-service orchestra managers who depend  upon hiring the best studio musicians," McMullin wrote in Symphony magazine.  "If one orchestra aces another by providing more interesting or more  remunerative work, the winning manager is liable to chortle condescendingly,  'Isn't it wonderful that Los Angeles has so many good musicians to pick from?'  Indeed it is wonderful, but getting first choice saves nerves and pleases  conductors."  </P> <P> That was made very clear in May, following Keith Clark's last concert as music  director of the Pacific Symphony. He made public a letter blasting the  orchestra management for allowing key players to miss rehearsals for Pasadena  Symphony, Joffrey Ballet and recording dates. In response, Stewart Woodward,  president of the Pacific Symphony board of directors, noted that this  flexibility follows a traditional pattern and is part of the orchestra's  agreement with its players. He also suggested that the players may have been  expressing their own feelings about Clark by working elsewhere when he was  conducting.  </P> <P> Though reluctant to go on the record about their artistic preferences, several  of the musicians interviewed for this story agreed that they made at least some  of their decisions about where to play based on who was conducting.  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony was working under a new contract when Clark made his  complaints. Before that incident, Louis Spisto, executive director of the  orchestra, noted that "we do need to define excused absences." Otherwise, he  said, "the new contract is working out well, with few hitches. This season  we've offered tenure, guaranteed minimums and set procedures for auditions and  termination. At the moment, we have a situation that is good for us and good  for the players."  </P> <P> There is some feeling, however, among rank-and-file section players in the  larger orchestras, that what is good for the mobile first-desk musicians may  not be good for the whole orchestra, something that union officials and  musicians acknowledge.  </P> <P> "I think there is a fear from some of the section players that we don't want to  see the orchestra grow, but that's not true," says Thatcher, principal  French-horn player for the Pacific and Pasadena symphonies. "We don't want to  see it become so stringent that you can't do anything else."  </P> <P> Bernie Fleischer, president of Local 47, says that in contracts he likes to  see, "the kind of flexibility that will allow those orchestras to retain their  important players. The union's ends are labor ends, not artistic ends, but I  think everyone's beginning to realize that playing together consistently makes  the best orchestras."  </P> <P> "We want to play more because we want to be better -- and that includes getting  the best players," says Newkirk in Long Beach. "We never pay them enough, so  we've got to offer them an artistic experience. I think the players would like  to see us grow -- we would like to see us grow. We're very clear about where we  are going and how we're going to get there. There is no dissatisfaction because  everyone knows what the limits are."  </P> <P> Even the players with the busiest outside schedules express strong feelings of  professional pride and artistic satisfaction about their work in their multiple  orchestras.  </P> <P> "Every group I play in, plays really well," boasts Kuennen, while Thatcher  says, "Another thing I like about the free-lance world is that everybody is  always trying their best."  </P> <P> The resultant quality of these orchestras, given strong artistic leadership, is  high. There is a question, though, given the personnel duplication in major  positions, whether there is a homogenizing effect.  </P> <P> "I think it's difficult," Mary Newkirk says. "I'm not sure many orchestras have  their own sound anymore."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly then, orchestra executives tend to look to their music  directors for a distinctive artistic stamp, referring to a Jorge Mester sound  in Pasadena, or an Iona Brown string sound at the Chamber Orchestra.  </P> <P> For some players, the insecurity of life without a regular salary is more  apparent than real.  </P> <P> "Because it's so diversified, there's always something going on," says Susan  Ranney, pointing out that many of these players flit from festival to festival  during the summer as regularly as they commute between orchestras during the  regular season. "It's becoming a year-round thing, being a free-lancer.  </P> <P> "I would love to have a steady job, but that isn't sufficient motivation to  practice for an audition, where you are competing with college and conservatory  kids who do nothing but practice all day."  </P> <P> In a widely read -- and often debated -- speech the executive vice president of  the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Ernest Fleischmann, proclaimed "The Orchestra Is  Dead, Long Live the Community of Musicians." There he pointed to  dissatisfaction, frustration and boredom among orchestra musicians, and  recommended converting standard orchestras to flexible -- there's that word  again -- communities of musicians, able to provide their members with an  exciting, personally satisfying range of work.  </P> <P> Many of the free-lance musicians, with experience in full-time orchestras,  including the Philharmonic, would concur with Fleischmann in his portrayal of  the often demoralizing effect of routine work in those ensembles. Not only may  the repertory be standardized, but the players must work with the same people  every day.  </P> <P> Ranney says: "I'm very happy with what I do. Not only is it a combination of  different types of music, but you see different people." As the mother of a  small child, she adds: "Your time is your own."  </P> <P> But she and her colleagues see the potential problems on the horizon.  </P> <P> "Hopefully it will all be worked out, though I don't know how," she says. "I  think we all benefit from this, in the general health of all our minds."  </P></p>

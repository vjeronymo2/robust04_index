			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Beijing to control HK lawmaking Hong Kong's laws will be made by a Beijing-appointed legislature for at least a year after the colony's sovereignty passes to China in mid-1997 under a decision taken by the preliminary working committee (PWC), a high-level group of mainland officials and Hong Kong personalities who advise Beijing on practical issues concerning the transfer. This and other PWC decisions on Hong Kong's legal system and rights of abode are likely to raise concern in Hong Kong and London that China will reverse the democratic gains of the recent past. Next September Hong Kong will hold its first fully democratic polls, but those elected seem certain to be ejected the day China resumes sovereignty. The PWC has become the forum for forward-looking discussion and decisions affecting Hong Kong's future without any British input. It is headed by Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, who called upon Britain to co-operate with China on Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty. He noted that Britain had expressed a wish to co-operate and had 'done a little bit' in that direction, but said the UK should lift the prohibition on formal contacts between the PWC and Hong Kong government officials. The deliberations of the PWC came as British and Chinese officials were preparing to meet in London today for the 31st session of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG). When set up in 1985 the JLG was meant to deal with Hong Kong's transfer to China, but since 1989 has achieved little. Britain hopes China will respond to a draft bill concerning the establishment of Hong Kong's court of final appeal, which will replace the Privy Council when sovereignty changes hands. The PWC sent out mixed signals on China's intentions towards the court. Mr Lu said that Beijing stood by a 1991 Anglo-Chinese agreement on its establishment and that China would welcome the British setting it up before the handover. However, he included enough jibes and asides to raise doubts whether China would give its blessing to a court established under British rule.</p>

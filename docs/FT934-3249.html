			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Rembrandt paints a broader picture Rembrandt Group, the South African tobacco-based conglomerate, performed in line with market expectations to record a 16.6 per cent increase in net income to R530.8m (Dollars 157.8) in the six months to September, compared with R455.2m a year earlier. The results are notable for the increased level of disclosure in the income statement compared with previous years, when the group had been notoriously shy in its disclosure. Rembrandt is controlled by the Cape-based Rupert family, which also controls Richemont, the Swiss based tobacco and luxury goods group. For the first time, a turnover figure is disclosed, showing an increase of 9.6 per cent to R2.22bn. There is no indication, however, of how much of this comes from the group's valuable tobacco interests, which normally contribute about 40 per cent of bottom line earnings. The results also break new ground in that pre-tax income is broken down between operating income and dividend income. Operating income rose by 7.7 per cent to R532.5m and dividend income by 9.8 per cent to R133.9m. Operating income includes the group's tobacco interests, where analysts estimate pre-tax profits grew by between 5 and 8 per cent, and Huntcor, a holding company for Robertsons, a food company, the TSB sugar group, the Rainbow poultry group and Rembrandt's timber investments. The biggest change was the fall in Rainbow's losses, which were R77m in the year to March. Dividend income comes from investments in mining (Gencor, Gold Fields and Trans-Hex), banking (principally ABSA, the country's largest bank), and assorted industrial investments, including a stake in the Total oil group.</p>

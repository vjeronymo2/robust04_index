			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Venezuela pledge on Brady accord VENEZUELA says it intends to seek new financing terms for about Dollars 769m (Pounds 422.5m) of external government debt not included in a general debt restructuring agreement signed in 1990, but is not seeking to renegotiate the accord. This week's announcement by Mr Pedro Rosas, finance minister, came after Venezuelan newspapers quoted a congressman and other figures as saying that the government should consider renegotiating its Dollars 19.8bn of restructured debt. Mr Rosas denied that the government intended to renegotiate the debt rescheduled in the 1990 Brady accord, which con-sists principally of marketable bonds. The government, facing a large fiscal deficit this year, plans to reschedule about 50bn bolivars (Dollars 769m at the current exchange rate) in non-restructured foreign government debt, scheduled to mature this year and next year. The debt comprised mostly supplier credits and commercial paper to finance military purchases, Mr Rosas said. Some internal government debt will also be refinanced. The minister added that interest payments were being made 'normally' on both restructured and non-restructured debt. The government of President Carlos Andres Perez, immersed in a political crisis since a coup attempt in February, is struggling to cover a large fiscal deficit caused mainly by weak prices for its main export, petroleum. The government, however, still has a strong reserve position. International monetary reserves in mid-May stood at more than Dollars 13bn, about the same as at the end of 1991. According to official figures, Venezuela's total external public debt stood at Dollars 26.8bn at end-1991, up slightly on the year. Interest and principal payments on external debt last year totalled about Dollars 2.2bn. The government also allotted Dollars 646.5m to debt repurchases and Dollars 329.8m for debt-equity swaps in 1991.</p>

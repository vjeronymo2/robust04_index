			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Play it again and again, Uncle Sam: A controversial market in second-hand CDs THE SIGN in the window is discreet and handwritten: CDs for as little at Dollars 2.99 (Pounds 1.97). But the savings to be garnered inside this downtown Manhattan record shop in New York are anything but modest. Products at Dollars 2.99 may be rare but used compact discs in the Dollars 6-Dollars 10 range are plentiful. For example, Next Exit, Grover Washington's 1992 album, is being sold for Dollars 8.99. The same CD, purchased new in Tower Records, one of the biggest mainstream record stores in the area, costs Dollars 14.99. Shops like this have become the focus of a crackling debate in the US, leading in the past month to lawsuits and heated accusations. On one side are retailers and consumers, interested in being able to buy and sell recordings at the best price. On the other are some of the largest US record labels and well-known recording artists. They are concerned that sales of used CDs will cut into new purchases, and that royalty flows will be reduced. The volume of business in these sharply discounted, second-hand CDs is reckoned to be small. The Recording Industry Association of America, a Washington-based trade group, says total sales of CDs rose by 22.3 per cent to 407.5m units last year, or over Dollars 5bn in value. Used CDs are estimated to account for only 1-2 per cent of this. But the second-hand market's growth potential could be considerable. Many music retailers would like to exploit it. A second-hand CD is unlikely to be noticeably inferior in quality to a brand-new product - unlike a vinyl record, or even a cassette tape. Mr Russ Bach, president of Thorn-EMI's CEMA Distribution arm in California, recently forecast that, 'if left unattended, the used CD business will grow to about 20 per cent of unit volume by 1998'. Small, independent music retailers have dealt in used CDs for some time. But the stakes were raised last winter when Wherehouse Entertainment, a US west coast chain, moved into the market. Wherehouse operates 339 outlets and was the first retailer of any size to defy the distributors' wishes. The wrath of some of the industry's biggest companies - such as CEMA, Sony and Time Warner - descended. They withdrew advertising and promotional support for all retailers dealing in second-hand CDs. Wherehouse has fought back in the law courts. Last month, it launched a suit against four of the biggest record distribution companies - CEMA, Sony Music Distribution, UNI Distribution (part of MCA, now owned by Japan's Matsushita) and Warner Elektra Atlantic. In its complaint, the retailer alleges that prices of new CDs were being maintained 'at artificially high levels', and that the four distributors had 'combined. . .unreasonably to restrain trade. . .in used CDs'. It points out that the same distributors operate 'record clubs' which advertise and sell CDs at a substantial discount to shop prices. Wherehouse also argues that its own second-hand CD sales are an effort to stay competitive with these record clubs. Distributors, it says, are worried that the secondary market in CDs will threaten clubs' viability. Wherehouse's legal action has been followed by the Independent Music Retailers' Association - about 150-200 'mom and pop' music stores formed to fight the distributors over second-hand CD sales. Like the Wherehouse suit, IMRA's class action is filed in Los Angeles courts. It alleges price-fixing and unfair trade practices. Mr Don Rosenberg, one of IMRA's founders and owner of the 15-outlet chain Record Exchange, says there is no law against selling second-hand CDs. He also notes that the royalty issue has not stopped second-hand trading in other industries. Mr Rosenberg claims, more controversially, that the sale of second-hand CDs does not depress new CD business, and points to his own stores' experience as evidence. Here, big distributors beg to differ. 'There is no such thing as a small sideline when you are taking royalties from artists, producers, songwriter, publishers, musicians and artist managers, and taking margin away from the record company,' claimed Mr Bach in Billboard magazine last month. 'If used CDs hit the main record channels of America and become widely accepted by consumers, and if CEMA supports retailers selling used CDs, then we will be cutting off our own future.' While the lawsuits grind on, the Federal Trade Commission is also understood to be looking at the issue. In line with its usual practice, though, the government anti-trust agency declines to confirm any specific investigation. Not all distributors think like the retailers named in the Wherehouse suit. Retailers say that PolyGram, for example, has a different policy, arising from the notion that the industry must learn to live with sales of used CDs. In London, PolyGram refused to comment. Judging by the number of people in the downtown Manhattan store, there is no doubt where consumers' sympathies lie. 'Customers love it,' says Wherehouse. 'As long as we're involved in a legal business and the distributors are involved in illegal restraint, the lawsuits will continue'.</p>

Chien said he has received no reports about the matter from  the Lesotho Government or from ROC diplomatic workers stationed  in the African nation.    Chien admitted, however, that the ROC Government has tried  its best to improve relations with the new Lesotho government  which took the power in April this year after a general election.    "Pitifully, the efforts were made in vain," he said.    Lesotho resumed diplomatic relations with the Republic of  China and broke ties with Beijing in April 1990. After that  time, Chien said Beijing officials maintained contacts with and  extended financial aid to exiled parliamentarians from the  Basotho Congressional Party (BCP) there.    The return of exiled BCP parliamentarians and losses  suffered  by pro-ROC lawmakers in April 1993 elections resulted in the  abrupt change in Lesotho's political stage this year, Chien  explained.    Meanwhile, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)  reported Thursday that Lesotho's break in diplomatic relations  with the ROC was caused by an alleged attempt by two ROC  citizens to bribe two Lesotho cabinet ministers.    Chien called the report "groundless."    However, Chien explained that the ROC Government contributed  financial aid to Lesotho, Swaziland and Malawi last year when  the three African countries were hard hit by drought.</p>

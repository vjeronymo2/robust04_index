			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Menem delays his re-election decision PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina said yesterday he would decide within a year whether to run for re-election, after his present term ends in 1995. The question of re-election, which would require reform of the clause in the constitution that prohibits successive presidential terms, has become one of Argentina's most controversial political issues as the Peronist president approaches the middle of his six-year term. In an interview, he said: 'This is not a Peronist project or a project of Carlos Menem, it's an old project that was begun by the (opposition) Radical party' which held the presidency immediately before Mr Menem took office. He added that the question of whether he would be a candidate for re-election was premature, stating that he would make a decision in a year. Mr Menem said reform of the 1853 constitution would require a two-thirds majority of Congress to convene an assembly that would re-write the constitution. There is concern in the business community that a re-election bid would overshadow economic reforms, which are considered a priority. There is also fear that a sovereign assembly would be empowered to undertake a drastic revision of the constitution, focusing on social aspects which would saddle the economy with added costs. Recent constitutional reforms in Brazil and Colombia have been blamed for obstructing economic changes there. Mr Menem emphasised that he was committed to maintain the momentum of economic reform in Argentina. He dismissed speculation that he and Mr Domingo Cavallo, his widely respected economy minister, were at odds and that the latter would resign. The president warned, however, that all members of the cabinet were expendable. 'Ministers are like fuses - they are the ones who get worn out.' Asked whether economic reform depended too heavily on Mr Cavallo, the president said it depended on himself. 'Without Menem, there are no possibilities for Argentina.' The president is reported to view Mr Cavallo as a potential rival in a future presidential election.</p>

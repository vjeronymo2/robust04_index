			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Ranariddh is the Master Liar </F> Prince"]    [Text] In a radio interview in Phnom Penh on 12 May, liar  Prince Ranariddh intentionally and shamelessly lied, in the same  manner that fault-finders and foreign vassals usually do, that  Democratic Kampuchea has given the Preah Vihear Temple to  Thailand.    Liar prince, your should not tell such an empty lie; even  the  children will not believe you. Do not look down upon your own  people as being so ignorant; they know well that you are very  notorious. You believe only in the words of the allies and  communist Vietnamese who are killing the Cambodian nation and  people and the national resistance forces which are struggling  for national salvation.    The Cambodian nation and people know well that you, the liar  prince, have resorted to this tale because the allies and  communist Vietnamese have suffered serious defeats everywhere,  especially on the Anlung Veng battlefield in February 1994 and  on Pailin battlefield in April 1994, and are suffering serious  setbacks on the Route 5 battlefield -- in the areas from Nimit  to Poipet and from Nimit to Sisophon and so forth.    In the same interview, liar Prince Ranariddh further lied  that the two-headed elements could not control the influx of  millions of Vietnamese immigrants into Cambodia because the  Cambodian-Vietnamese border is very long.    This statement is really [words indistinct]. This statement  is in favor of the influx of Vietnamese in order to turn  Cambodia into another Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian  territory annexed by Vietnam].    The liar prince has allowed thousands of Vietnamese  nationals  to flow into Cambodia every day. They have come by truck, boat,  and motor boat through big and small rivers and Routes 1, 2, 3,  and so forth. Meanwhile, Prince Ranariddh has thought only of  attacking his own nation and eliminating the patriotic  resistance forces. Why? It is because Ranariddh has sold  himself out to the allies, communist Vietnamese, and Vietnamese  puppets in exchange for U.S. dollars, gold, jewels, luxurious  cars and villas, and private airplanes.    The Cambodian nation and people condemn and will continue to  condemn the two puppet groups for betraying the nation and  people and allowing the communist Vietnamese to annex Cambodia  into late Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese Federation.</p>

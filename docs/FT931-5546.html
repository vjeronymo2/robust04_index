			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Management: When the sky falls - Precautions companies can take against terrorism or disaster How would companies cope if a bomb went off in or near their offices? Anxious managers have been asking that question this week in the wake of the blast at Manhattan's World Trade Centre and threats from the IRA that British commercial and industrial targets are on its list. For many the answer is not reassuring. John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert, estimates that less than half of the UK's biggest companies have a carefully thought-out response. He and other security consultants believe businesses need to give more attention to preventive steps and to contingency plans to get business started as quickly as possible after an emergency. Complacency is perhaps more understandable in the US, which has less experience of urban terrorism than Europe. But several recent events - from the Wall Street power blackout in August 1990, to security threats during the 1991-92 Gulf war and last December's storm that flooded parts of downtown Manhattan - have ensured that security officers and contingency planners are reasonably well prepared for catastrophic disruptions to their businesses. While most companies are reluctant to discuss security, one spokesperson for a big Wall Street firm said yesterday: 'We are now using the security programme we introduced at the time of the Gulf war - essentially, it entails a more restrictive policing of entry and exit from our building.' The bomb in New York's financial district was worrying to local companies, because many of them are either banks or securities firms which stand to lose millions of dollars if their business is seriously disrupted for any length of time. According to city authorities about Dollars 700m (Pounds 493m) could be lost in disrupted business during the first week after the bombing alone. Bill Kelly, the man responsible for contingency planning at JP Morgan, said the bank has a 'mosaic of plans' that is ready in the event of a catastrophe. If, for example, the firm's data centre is disrupted, JP Morgan can either use its data centre in Delaware, or it can turn to emergency personnel and computer sites provided by private companies such as Philadelphia-based Sungard or Comdisco of Chicago. If the bank's securities trading room is put out of action, JP Morgan has arrangements to use a temporary trading facility in Staten Island operated by another private company, Exchange Resources. At Salomon Brothers, the securities firm that occupies the northernmost building of the World Trade Centre complex, chief administrative officer Tom Brock says last week's bombing did not catch the firm unprepared: 'We had planned extensively for this kind of event.' Salomon's offices were not damaged by the explosion, but the police ordered the power to be cut off for a few hours as a precautionary measure. Salomon used its own generators and the firm's business continued throughout the crisis. If Salomon had been forced to evacuate its building, Brock says the firm has various sites around the country that could be used, including a special location near Manhattan that stands by as an emergency trading room. Some firms, however, were not as well prepared. Cantor Fitzgerald, the biggest inter-dealer broker in the US bond market, had to scramble over the weekend to find a home for its hundreds of brokers. Fortunately, Salomon was able to offer a temporary home to some of them. Even big UK companies have a security and contingency planning approach which can be half-baked: most issue passes to visitors, for example, but few are so careful about collecting them and thus have little idea of who is in the building. Similarly, they may have an evacuation plan but may not have considered whether this is always the best approach. One lesson from last year's explosion at St Mary Axe in the City of London - which happened after hours  -was that staff would have been safer in a basement rather than on the street, where they would have been hit by flying glass. Companies with closed-circuit television, meanwhile, sometimes render it useless by not watching it. Others check baggage, but in a predictable way. Most large UK financial firms have back-up computer tapes stored off the premises and a 'hot-site' facility to plug the tapes into. But according to Charles Shaw from Safety Net, a business recovery firm, this is as useful as 'a fire escape going half way down a building' if it is not part part of an overall business plan. Companies on both sides of the Atlantic, meanwhile, are turning to specialist security consultants for help. Eugene Mastrangelo, managing director of risk assessment at California-based Pinkerton, has been advising corporate officers they should take three initial steps: Conduct a 'vulnerability survey' to determine if there are any gaps in the security protection. Increase security around premises and upgrade the screening of employees and visitors entering and leaving buildings. Re-examine crisis management plans and ask one important question: how would your company have responded if its offices had been bombed? According to the experts, companies must be clear about what they can and cannot protect. In theory everything can be protected, but inevitably there will be limits to financial and human resources. A company's response in the first few hours can be crucial. Everyone needs to know who is responsible for business continuity. A good press manager has to reassure the outside world that everything is under control. Companies need to keep up-to-date records of all important customers and suppliers so that they can be notified at once. They may need separate plans if the building is closed for hours, days or weeks and have plans for moving certain staff to other branch offices or alternative accommodation. It is not just the UK financial sector that is starting to take action. Shaw says the message is getting through to manufacturing, distribution and retailing businesses, which now make up almost two thirds of his clients.</p>

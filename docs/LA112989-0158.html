			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICARE SYSTEM'S EARNINGS RISE 71%  </P> <P> Powered by strong membership growth and aggressive control of medical costs,  PacifiCare Systems Inc. earned a record $10.9 million for the year ended Sept.  30, up 71% from $6.3 million in 1988.  </P> <P> The health maintenance organization, the fourth-largest in California, said  Monday that its membership increased more than 70%, to 553,165 enrollees in the  fiscal year.  </P> <P> Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer, said the burgeoning  membership substantially increased its administrative costs.  </P> <P> However, that added expense was successfully offset by the company's efforts to  reduce medical costs as a percentage of revenue, Lowell said.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Terry Hartshorn, PacifiCare's president and chief  executive officer, said: "The earnings increase is primarily attributable to  our ongoing cost-control efforts and our case-management program.  </P> <P> "Our health-care costs as a percentage of revenue are down, compared with a  year ago. Our hospital costs -- measured by days per thousand members -- are  among the lowest in our history and are even lower today than they were a year  ago."  </P> <P> PacifiCare's revenue for the 1989 fiscal year was $650.2 million, up 52% from  $428.5 million. Net income for the fourth quarter stood at $4.1 million, up 78%  from $2.3 million for the same period of fiscal 1988. Revenue was $190.6  million for the quarter, up 60% from $119 million a year ago.  </P> <P> PacifiCare Health Systems owns and operates HMOs in California, Oregon,  Oklahoma and Texas and an insurance subsidiary licensed in 33 states.  </P> <P> Todd Richter, senior vice president and health services analyst with Dean  Witter Reynolds in New York, said PacifiCare's bright year-end financial report  comes as no surprise.  </P> <P> "These numbers are very strong and show the strength of PacifiCare as a  dominant player," he said. "And we should see a continuation of very strong  results in 1990 and 1991."  </P> <P> PACIFICARE PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> (In millions of dollars)  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.33IN:2.22IN:2.22IN:2.00IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Mo.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Mo.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $190.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $119.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $650.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $428.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net Income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> SUSPENDED MEET TO RESUME TUESDAY WITH TRIPLE JUMP  </P> <P> Newspaper deadlines came and went, but several events were not completed until  late Friday night at the Southern Section track and field championships at  Cerritos College.  </P> <P> As midnight neared, the stadium was nearly deserted except for a handful of  high jumpers, shotputters, their coaches, family and friends, and various meet  officials.  </P> <P> Mark Parlin led a first-, second- and fifth-place finish by Esperanza's  shotputters, helping the Aztecs to a 50-40 lead over Santa Barbara and at least  a share of the 3-A team championship. Final results will not be announced until  the triple jump competition, postponed Friday because section officials feared  it would run well past midnight, is completed Tuesday at Cerritos.  </P> <P> The high jump ran longest, finishing in odd fashion for Katella's Kevin  Carlson, who has a share of the Orange County record.  </P> <P> Carlson was declared the 3-A champion after meet officials ordered the  competition halted at about 11:30. Ten jumpers had cleared 6 feet 6 inches when  officials told the athletes they would all advance to Friday's Masters meet.  Carlson was told to go home.  </P> <P> The ruling went against established Southern Section finals procedure. The top  nine finishers Friday advanced to the Masters meet in every other event.  </P> <P> Carlson, who jumped 6-11 3/4 this season to tie the county record, had jumped  only four times since the event began at 8 p.m. And because he was the only 3-A  jumper to clear 6-6, he was awarded first place.  </P> <P> He said it took some of the luster off his championship, but Carlson shrugged  and said, "A first is still a first."  </P> <P> After the 1-A and 2-A jumpers were dismissed, a jump-off was then held to  determine the medal winners among the seven left in the 4-A division.  </P> <P> Parlin, a junior, won the shotput with a personal-best of 62 feet 6 1/2 inches,  the second-best throw in the state this year. Brent Noon of Fallbrook leads the  state and the nation with a toss of 76-2.  </P> <P> Mark Kinney, a senior at Esperanza, was second (58-0 1/2), and Mike Burns, a  junior, was fifth (53-7 1/2).  </P> <P> "We needed that," Esperanza shotput coach Bill Pendleton said Saturday. "We  were down by 10 points going into the shot."  </P> <P> Pendleton said the trio saw teammate Roshawn Sims pull up in the 200-meter  race, grasping at his injured hamstring.  </P> <P> "They knew if they didn't come through and place all three guys we were going  to be out of it (team championship)," he said. "So the guys came through. I  figured Parlin would win, but I was happy to see the other guys come on like  that."  </P> <P> Parlin, Kinney, Edison's Lawson Mollica, who won the 4-A with a throw of 54-3  3/4, and Matt Jordan (second in the 4-A at 54-2 1/2) will advance to the  Masters meet.  </P> <P> Tuesday's triple jump will determine the 3-A team champion. Esperanza has a  10-point lead and the event's winner receives 10 points. Esperanza has Clayton  Tharrington jumping and Santa Barbara has Mike Thompson.  </P></p>

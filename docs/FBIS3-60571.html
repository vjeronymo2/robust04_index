			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, November 30 (XINHUA) -- China now has 1,159  reported cases of AIDS infection and the virus carriers, a  health official said here today.    Of the 1,159 cases, 211 are foreigners and Overseas Chinese  and 948 are Chinese. China has found 19 aids victims, 14 of  whom have died.    Most of the HIV/AIDS carriers in China are drug abusers or  returnees from abroad, said the official.    On the eve of ``World AIDS Day'', a national association of  sexually transmitted disease (STD) and AIDS control and  prevention was set up here.    Addressing the inaugural meeting of the association, Chen  Minzhang, minister of public health, said that the association  will help the government organize figures from various circles  to take part in STD and AIDS prevention activities. Meanwhile,  it will focus on health education, information exchange and  international cooperation on STD and AIDS control.    According to Chen, the Chinese Government has always  attached  importance to preventing and controlling the spread of STD and  AIDS. It has passed laws and regulations on prevention of AIDS  and STD, which have promoted the management, research,  surveillance and treatment of such diseases.    However, STD and AIDS epidemic areas are still expanding in  China. ``We lack publication and comprehensive management  measures on STD and AIDS prevention,'' said Chen.    He urged government departments at all levels and  communities  all over the country to undertake commitments in STD and AIDS  prevention and control. Meanwhile, he called for more  cooperation on AIDS control among different departments in the  country.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> PARK DEPARTMENT TO ASK FOR OPINIONS  </P> <P> The Parks and Recreation Department will go to the people today in an effort to  find out what citizens think of the city park system.  </P> <P> Residents will have a chance to meet with recreation officials at four sites in  Mission Viejo to discuss problems and solutions, said Wayne Lowery, director of  the department.  </P> <P> "We're just going to open our ears . . . and let people talk," Lowery said.  "We'll sit and talk about what they would like to see improved and about  problems like teen-age drinking in the parks."  </P> <P> The meetings will start at Castille Park at 9 a.m. and move every two hours to  El Dorado Park, Melinda Park and Marguerite O'Neill Park. City staff will also  present a package of improvements planned for some sites, such as additional  playground equipment, security lighting, picnic shelters and landscaping,  Lowery said.  </P> <P> The park director was enthusiastic over the response received from citizens on  the park forums.  </P> <P> "To be honest, I was just half optimistic originally, but we've gotten several  phone calls from people," Lowery said. "One lady who said she couldn't make it  managed to send a letter with her comments. So we expect quite a turnout."  </P> <P> This is the first year for the park forum, and Lowery hopes to make it an  annual event.  </P> <P> "The city wants to be service-oriented and the best way to provide good service  is to find out what the people want," he said.

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST BERLIN: FROM GRIM GUARDS TO HAPPY HACKIES  </P> <P> Gus the cab driver was practicing some street-smart capitalism. He scoffed at  the Southern Californians' offer of $10 to drive five of them around East  Berlin for two hours last weekend. The burly man with a round, gentle face  noted that his counterparts on the other side of the wall demand 30 West German  marks an hour per person. Seeming to argue that the winds of democracy already  had brought East and West together, he said, "We are worth the same now."  </P> <P> Not quite. More than holes in the Berlin Wall will be required to do that. Gus  and fellow driver Henry finally settled on their two cabs for two hours at  roughly $10 a person. That is less than a bus tour. At the same time, Gus and  Henry would pocket $25 each in hard currency in two hours' time. Not a bad  day's work, considering that amount will buy nearly a month's apartment rent or  gasoline in the heavily subsidized East Berlin economy.  </P> <P> These are good times for Gus and his fellows.  </P> <P> To visit Berlin, East Germany and other East Bloc countries has become the  thing Europeans want to do this winter -- the destinations of choice as a whole  region emerges from four decades of repression and economic stagnation. Airline  flights are jammed. Trains are booked far in advance. Hotel rooms are hard to  get. Pan Am reports that traffic to Eastern Europe has increased by 25% over  last year.  </P> <P> Berlin is the strongest magnet of all.  </P> <P> "Everybody wants to go to Berlin," Danish travel agent Marianne Lohse told  members of the California group attending a week-long series of environmental  conferences in Copenhagen. Now the contingent was exploring a chance to extend  their travel by one day to squeeze in a quick trip to the city.  </P> <P> The going grew more complicated when an official of the Polish embassy in  Copenhagen urged the party to visit Warsaw, too. He offered to provide visas  quickly. The incredibly patient Lohse of the Danish travel agency explored at  least a dozen combinations of routes and times into Berlin and/or Warsaw. One  leg of each potential route was already booked to capacity.  </P> <P> On Thursday night, Dec. 7, we learned that Lohse had achieved what had seemed  to be the impossible only a day before: a flight out of Copenhagen Saturday  morning to Warsaw, Warsaw to West Berlin via Frankfurt Saturday evening, and  returning Sunday night to Copenhagen by way of Frankfurt.  </P> <P> For all the change, visiting Eastern Europe for the first time can be daunting.  Arriving at Warsaw's airport was like stepping into a 1950s black-and-white  movie. Armed soldiers stood at the foot of the airline ramp. Passport guards  stared grimly from passport photo to visitor time and again before stamping  approval. Passengers, including many Polish-Americans coming for the holidays,  jammed customs lines with bulging suitcases and cardboard boxes.  </P> <P> Those were minor anxieties and inconveniences, though. Graced with a five-inch  blanket of fresh snow, Warsaw was much less bleak than expected. After lunch  for five at the Victoria Hotel for 92,000 zlotys (about $23), driver Leszek  Drzazgowski took us through historic sections of the city, including stops at  the site of the ghetto, the church where Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski's crypt was  covered with fresh flowers and the Old Town market square.  </P> <P> Even with the wall breached, getting into East Berlin at the Friedrichstrasse  S-bahn station still has a Cold War atmosphere. When our group tried to return  to West Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie, we were told we must exit along the same  route we had entered, a bone-chilling 20-minute walk back to the station.  There, the guards seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to clear us.  </P> <P> East Berlin is home for most of the great buildings that survived World War II.  It has taken more than 40 years, but the majority of gutted structures have  been restored handsomely. The tour included Hitler's unmarked bunker and the  Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden to Alexanderplatz and Marx-Engels Platz, the  cathedral, the state opera house, Old Town and the museums alongside the River  Spree.  </P> <P> There was a stop for beer and coffee at a comfortable tavern in Old Town, where  students at the adjacent table laughed and joked as Henry and Gus debated in  German how to answer our questions about the changes in East Germany.  </P> <P> Both in Warsaw and East Berlin, guides remarked that they are no longer  harassed by police over petty infractions or perceived violations. "I don't  have to do that any more," Henry said, referring to his unbuckled seat belt. In  Warsaw, Drzazgowski commented, "You don't have to worry about tickets. The  police don't have anything to do. And they don't want to do anything."  </P> <P> Back on the west side of the Bradenburg Gate, thousands of tourists bundled  against the cold wind walked half a mile to the Berlin Wall on Sunday  afternoon. There was no hammering here, and not much celebration. Many walked  up and touched the graffiti-covered barrier silently, in awe, much like people  seeing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington for the first time. They  were not mourning the fact that it was coming down, of course, but perhaps  reflecting on what it had meant for so many years, and what the future might  hold.  </P></p>

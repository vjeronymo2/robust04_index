			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gencor unit in R1.25bn share swap GENBEL, the investment arm of Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining house, has announced two large share swap transactions, valued at R1.25bn (Dollars 372m), which will expedite the unbundling of the Gencor group. In a tidying-up exercise preceding the planned unbundling, Genbel has exchanged its foreign interests as well as a portfolio of mining shares for shares in Engen, Sappi and Beatrix, three other companies in the Gencor stable. The portfolio is valued at R862m. In a second share exchange with Sankorp, Gencor's ultimate controlling company, Genbel has exchanged R385m worth of Sappi and Engen shares for R50m in cash plus shares in ABSA, Murray and Roberts, Malbak and Mercedes Information Technology. From a Gencor perspective, the deal achieves two main aims: it means they will have fewer Engen and Sappi shares to distribute when the unbundling is effected, and it also consolidates their control of various mining companies, notably Kinross, Impala, Samancor, Trans-Natal and Winkelhaak. Getting access to offshore assets will also assist Gencor if it makes a bid for Billiton, the mining arm of the Royal Dutch Shell group with which it is currently in discussion. Genbel's offshore interests (valued at R512m) consisted of shares in TransAtlantic Holdings, cash and minor exploration ventures in Turkey. These interests, plus R350m worth of shares in the five mining companies, have been exchanged for 8.9m Engen shares, 12.4m Sappi shares and 5.1m Beatrix shares.</p>

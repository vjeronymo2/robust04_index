			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ferdinand Hennerbichler: "Security Center </F> Vienna"]    [Text] In 1955 our neutrality brought us freedom -- also  freedom from Soviet communism. Our country became a symbol of  detente between East and West, a bulwark of peace against war.  Since the demise of the Soviet Union, democratic Russia has  shown great interest in preserving neutral Austria's traditional  peace role.    "Stay as you are -- a neutral country in the heart of  Europe,  which, with its active policy of neutrality, has made an  important contribution to peace in Europe for decades and will  continue to do so. You are an asset for more security in  Europe!" This conviction is advocated by one of Russia's great  intellectual pioneers, Professor Vitaliy Churkin, director of  the Europe Institute in Moscow.    In an exclusive interview for NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG Prof.  Churkin appeals to us Austrians not to let ourselves "be  persuaded by anyone" to give up our neutrality because it is  outdated and does not have any value in peace times anymore.  The opposite is true. In particular in the middle of Europe's  gigantic upheaval our neutral Austria continues to play "a  central role in Europe's newly developing security system."    In the interview with NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG, Russia's great  European strategist cites three reasons why Austria should "keep  its active neutrality policy":  <H5>  Military Asset </H5>   Neutral countries are states with low armament. Thus, they  are "demilitarized zones" without super armament. They do not  emanate any military danger. Neutral states with few weapons  therefore do not pose any danger of war and mean more security  for all Europeans in East and West.  <H5>  Strategic Asset </H5>   Neutral countries like Austria are also buffer zones. They  are located like buffers between areas of tension, conflicts,  and wars -- for instance on the fringe of the war hell in the  Balkans. If the neutrals were taken out of the new Europe,  enormous contradictions, which still exist on our continent,  would threaten to clash directly -- without buffers, without  safeguards, without brakes. The results would be the escalating  danger of direct confrontations in Europe.  <H5>  Diplomatic Asset </H5>   "Europe still needs venues for meetings, for dialogues, and  for mediation, such as neutral Austria," Prof. Churkin insists.  If such diplomatic oases of neutrality did not exist, one would  practically have to invent them to banish war in Europe once and  for all.    Prof. Churkin also sees a central role for neutral Austria  in  the newly developing security system in Europe. Russia's  intellectual pioneer for Europe stresses that the new peace  system must be supported diplomatically above all by the CSCE.  Even though it is lagging behind in development, it should play  the main role. NATO should become the backbone, but is "still  too highly armed" and must transform itself "more quickly than  in the past" from a military alliance to the supporter of a new  security system.    "Austria should become a center of the new global security  system in Europe," Vitaliy Churkin told NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG in  an exclusive interview. He does not yet want to commit himself  to details. However, he advocates that Vienna become the seat of  important institutions, such as a European Security Council or a  military committee. Vienna is already the CSCE center for the  prevention of conflicts, disarmament, security, and for more  trust between East and West.</p>

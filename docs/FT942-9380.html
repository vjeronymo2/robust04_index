			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: London A flood of economic statistics and comment this week will keep the gilts market on its toes. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC Greenwell, says: 'Gilts could end the week three points up or three points down', depending on Wednesday's news of retail price inflation in April and average earnings in March. A jump in average earnings growth to 3.75 per cent in the year to March from February's 3.5 per cent would be 'dreadful', he says. A rise in April's retail price inflation, minus mortgage interest payments, to above 2.5 per cent from 2.4 per cent would be 'disappointing'. According to Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, the background for gilts looks more favourable than for some time. Last week's UK trade figures reduced fears of a trade-induced sterling crisis and he expects less talk of leadership struggles in the Conservative party following last week's tragic death of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Recent US news may also foster calmer conditions on global bond markets. The Bank of England contributed to the better tone with Friday's announcement of its first convertible gilt since 1987. Details are due tomorrow. The Bank's apparent determination to resist a cut in base rates has also boosted hopes of steady and sustainable economic recovery.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen is the best qualified Chinese city to be  the "second Hong Kong" on the mainland, Shenzhen and Guangdong  officials said yesterday. Li Haidong, director of Shenzhen  People's Congress, said the congress would speed up its work so  that Shenzhen could be the first Chinese city to establish a  legal framework to serve the development of the "socialist  market economy". The whole legislative process should take  three to five years. At least 25 new laws will be introduced  this year and many are considered unprecedented in China.    The director, who is in Guangzhou to attend the eighth  Guangdong People's Congress, said these new legal codes would  not contradict those passed by the Central and provincial  authorities. They include a property transaction law, laws on  partnership companies and companies with unlimited liabilities,  social insurance law and a statue on state owned properties.    And Lin Ruo, chairman of Guangdong People's Congress, said  the Shenzhen experience would soon be spread to other cities of  Guangdong. "This is natural. Cities which have the conditions  can soon follow Shenzhen," Mr Lin said. Building more Hong  Kongs on the mainland was first suggested by patriarch Deng  Xiaoping to push ahead his quasi-capitalist reform experiment.    According to Mr Li, the Shenzhen Congress will step up its  supervision over the Government to make sure that all these new  laws would be implemented. In addition, Shenzhen would also  encourage more lawyers to set up law firms in the city to  provide the necessary service to the public. While Mr Li  admitted that many government officials only paid lip-service to  the statue book, he said changes needed time. When asked about  the industrial accidents that happened in Shenzhen last year Mr  Li agreed they occurred because many city government officials  lacked a "crisis consciousness". "(We've) learned a very deep  lesson (last year)," he said. "This has helped our leaders to  understand that on the one hand they must do a good job in  reform and opening up, but on the other hand they have to do  better in their management." He added the most important point  was that administration should be anchored on a body of laws  that is, the realisation of the rule of law.    Meanwhile, Mr Li said Shenzhen had had difficulties in  maintaining social order because it was an open city. He said  although the majority of mobile population in Shenzhen were  law-abiding, some were bad elements.    Speaking on another occasion, Shenzhen Mayor, Li Youwei,  indicated Shenzhen was the "best qualified" city in China to be  come the second Hong Kong because it had accumulated rich  experience in its experiment with the market system.</p>

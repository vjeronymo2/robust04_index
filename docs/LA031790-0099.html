			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAILING CONGRESSIONAL CUP: FOUR ARE WELL-SUITED TO SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Two Americans and two New Zealanders were in the semifinals of the 26th  Congressional Cup sailing regatta at Long Beach Friday.  </P> <P> Does this mean they settled it in the New York Supreme Court?  </P> <P> No way. This time, while their countrymen await the final ruling on the  America's Cup, these Yanks and Kiwis are competing in their saltwater element.  </P> <P> In the first round of the best-of-three semifinals Friday, Robbie Haines of  Newport Beach beat Russell Coutts, the round-robin winner, by 20 seconds; and  Chris Dickson defeated Peter Isler of San Diego by 24 seconds.  </P> <P> They will complete those series today, then go directly into a best-of-three  final on the one-mile, windward-leeward course off the east end of the Long  Beach breakwater.  </P> <P> Coutts, 28, finished the round-robin with a 7-2 record, followed by the three  others at 6-3. First place entitled Coutts to select his semifinal opponent --  who promptly beat hin, convincingly.  </P> <P> Addressing the issue, Coutts said: "I'm wondering why I picked Robbie, too."  </P> <P> Dickson, 29, said this week, after losing three consecutive races: "I thought  the race committee did a great job in equalizing the boats. I wish they could  do something to equalize the skippers."  </P> <P> In truth, there isn't much difference. In 30 races over the last two days, the  largest margin of victory has been 1 minute 6 seconds and the smallest Coutts'  five-second spread over Australia's Peter Gilmour in the round-robin finale.  </P> <P> Dickson, who has won the last six match-racing events on the world circuit,  beat Isler, 35, by guessing right or anticipating a wind shift when they sailed  to opposite sides of the course off the starting line.  </P> <P> Haines beat Coutts with a two-second jump at the start that gave him the  favored position to leeward. Coutts stayed close until two-thirds of the way to  the weather mark, when the wind shifted just far enough right to force Coutts  off Haines' hip and into his disturbed air, driving him back.  </P> <P> Earlier, in a round-robin match against Dickson, Haines had lost by 23 seconds  after faltering at the start following some frantic pre-start maneuvering  through the spectator fleet, missing boats by inches.  </P> <P> "The spectator boats were too close," Haines' tactician, Doug Rastello, said.  "I don't say that as an excuse, but we're spending more time dodging spectator  boats than judging our position."  </P> <P> Rastello was Rod Davis' tactician when Davis won the first two of his three  Congressional Cups. He is serving Haines well, since Haines, 36, seemed a  longshot to reach the final four.  </P> <P> Unlike the three others, Haines is not a regular on the match-racing circuit.  The Newport Beach sail maker was a late replacement for Paul Cayard, who  withdrew because of his commitment to Italy's Il Moro America's Cup syndicate.  </P> <P> Haines, an '84 Olympic gold medalist, also competed in 1986 but was  ill-prepared and placed seventh at 4-5.  </P> <P> "We prepared a lot more for this," Haines said.  </P></p>

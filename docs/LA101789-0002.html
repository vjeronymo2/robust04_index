			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Doris Bloch wants to thank the youngster who donated four toy Soviet jets to  the downtown relief organization she heads.  </P> <P> But, inasmuch as she's executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Food  Bank, she says that the aircraft will have only a short stopover there.  </P> <P> "We'll give them to an agency that deals with needy children," said Bloch,  noting that Christmas is approaching.  </P> <P> She offered her thanks to the anonymous benefactor, but added that "he should  work on his spelling."  </P> <P> A note accompanying the gift said: "I donate theys micro jets to th needy. I am  sory to say that I stoel them but my dad paid for them when he found out about  it. I will pay my dad back."  </P> <P> Just a temporary cost overrun.  </P> <P> Several blocks north, pink balloons were carefully tied Sunday to a fence along  a trash-littered sidewalk on Winston Street. A Skid Row wedding was about to  begin.  </P> <P> The bride, Tamara McZeal, 18, arrived in a flowing white dress, a gift from the  Skid Row Ministry of the West Angeles Church, which organized the event.  </P> <P> The groom, Albert Franco, 35, wore a turquoise-and-white sweater and a gray  pair of pants.  </P> <P> The two, who had been living in a nearby motel, said they wanted to show others  that good things can happen on Skid Row. But an unwanted guest showed up: A  camera crew from a local television station.  </P> <P> "No cameras!" the groom yelled.  </P> <P> The couple, a few friends and a church minister then jumped into a car and sped  off. They exchanged vows on the steps of the County Courthouse.  </P> <P> Afterward, when the newlyweds were certain that the TV crew was gone, they  returned to the dirty street, where they ate wedding cake on a folding table.  </P> <P> "We wanted it to be just us," Franco said.  </P> <P> "Just us and Skid Row."  </P> <P> The city of Long Beach will go to court in two weeks in an attempt to make  resident Ski Demski take down the 95-by-160-foot American flag that he flies in  his front yard. The charge: The big flag flaps too noisily.  </P> <P> But the San Francisco Giants, who might welcome noise after their lifeless  World Series beginning, are more appreciative. Demski's flag -- an Only in L.A.  regular -- will be unfurled today at Candlestick Park during pregame  ceremonies.  </P> <P> "At least something from down here will be in the World Series," quipped  Demski.  </P> <P> An ache up her sleeve: Hathu Koff suffered minor injuries when a Los  Angeles-based tour bus flipped on its side in Las Vegas the other night. It  didn't stop her from gambling. But she did switch to push-button video poker.  </P> <P> "I don't feel like pulling the slot-machine arm," she explained, "because my  side is hurting too much."  </P></p>

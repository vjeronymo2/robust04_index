And quite  understandably, it is the aim of China's car manufacturers to  make this dream come true.    The dream seems to have advanced a step closer to the truth,  as a minicar, named "Haishen", or Poseidon, was developed just  before the traditional Chinese New Year in early February, in  this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, where China's  first automobile was produced.    The four-seat minicar, with a maximum speed of 80 kph, was  developed by the Haishen household car institute.    To put the minicar into mass production, the North Haishen  Automobile Stock Company will be established later this year.  Li Weidong, the chief initiator, said the company plans to  produce 1,000 Haishen minicars in 1994 and 10,000 in 1995.    The prototype of Haishen was produced here last August by  senior researchers and engineers with the Changchun Automobile  Research Institute.    Though it is designed to be China's first car for common  people, and meanfully named as "Sankoule", or "a happy  three-member family", an appropriate name with regard of China's  one-child policy, some people refuse to admit it to be a car,  saying that it is merely a motorcycle with a top.    In fact, Haishen is not the first, nor the only attempt by  the Chinese automobile industry to produce a car for the  ordinary Chinese residents.    The idea was first put forward by the Xiali Automobile  Company in Tianjin. However, its 90,000-yuan price militated  against its promotion strategy.    Meanwhile, a plant under the No. 1 Automobile Factory of  Jilin has developed a four-seat minibus and has put it into  small-scale production.    The Nanjing Automobile Plant of Jiangsu Province, east  China,  developed a three-seat minicar named "little squirrel". And in  southwest China's Sichuan Province a minicar is to be produced  by a former defense factory.    Besides being small, all these minicars share the same  traits  in that they consume less gasoline, and unlike their more  sophisticated counterparts, all their parts are China-made.    Their biggest common point, however, is that they all strive  to be as cheap as possible, so that they can be acceptable to  the ordinary people.    At present, the Jilin minibus sells at 40,000 yuan, the  Haishen at 30,000 yuan, and the "little squirrel", the cheapest,  at 5,000 yuan.    But doubts and worries continue about whether they are  genuine cars, how to improve their quality and how they can be  put into mass production.    However, some experts hold that the minicar is probably a  must if the Chinese automobile industry, the sector with the  deepest impact on the centrally-planned economy, is to step into  the market economy. They even hint that minicar will possibly  bring the prosperity that the automobile industry has waited for  so long.    The minicar -- is it a dream coming true?</p>

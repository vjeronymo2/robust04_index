			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza Rosales] </F>   [Text] National Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez  reported yesterday that he will visit the United States from 24  to 28 January following a Pentagon invitation to visit its  installations and other military sites in Washington.    Enriquez added: "I will take the opportunity to exchange  views with some of the U.S. generals. The opportunity is great  not only to learn about general culture but to learn about the  views of the military authorities of that country with regard to  Guatemala."    Concerning the possibility of discussing the Civilian  Self-Defense Patrols (PAC) after the letter sent by the  president to his counterpart Bill Clinton, he said: "if they  ask me about the PAC's, I will reiterate what De Leon Carpio  stated, that they will disappear when the internal armed  confrontation ends."    In addition, he noted that the PAC's have significantly  drawn  down in Guatemala as a result of a drop in the subversive  effort. Consequently, these patrols have gone from 1 million  members in 1983 to 433,000 in 1993. He also said that there  were only 17,000 weapons among them. In many departments, the  PAC's were turned into committees for development without the  control of the armed institution.    He further remarked that the Defense Ministry budget has  always been less than those of the Education and Health  Ministries. At present, it is only 8.2 percent of the national  budget.    On another topic, the minister said that, if necessary, in a  meeting to be held with certain labor leaders he will tell them  that he favors the yes vote in the referendum because it is a  legal mechanism and because the Army is the guarantor of the  constitutional order. He said he has read the constitutional  reforms and that he believes they are aimed at improving public  administration in the country because in the case of the  confidential points [confidenciales] and other important  matters, there is nothing that hurts society. "They are  measures that if implemented, we will have the Guatemala we want  in the near future, perhaps, slowly, but surely and within the  framework of the Constitution," he noted.    He stated that if he were a civilian and had the option to  vote, he would vote yes because it is a benefit. He said that  he supports the reforms because "it is not a matter of backing a  political party, it is not party politics. It is truly  something done for Guatemala."    During the news conference, Enrique officially presented  Colonel Morris Eugenio de Leon Gil, the new chief of Information  and Press Department of the Army (DIDE). De Leon Gil promised  to be open to the media 24 hours a day.</p>

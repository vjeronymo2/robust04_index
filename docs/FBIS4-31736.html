			<p>BFN     [Text] A few minutes ago we received the following  communique from the Romanian Government:    In connection with the Alfa Cartel Trade Union Confederation  rally that took place in front of Victoria Palace today, the  government spokesman is empowered to state the following:    Although negotiations with government were not included in  the program of trade union demonstrations, nevertheless the  government showed from the very first moment its willingness to  hold a dialogue and, together with a trade union delegation, to  look at all the claims brought up by demonstrators. It was  established that the team of negotiators should include State  Ministers Mircea Dan Popescu and Florin Georgescu, Government  General Secretary Viorel Hrebenciuc, and Octavian Partenie,  state secretary and government representative for relations with  employers associations and trade unions.    It was also decided that discussions should take place in  the  presence of mass media representatives. Unfortunately, the  government offer was not honored because the demonstrators did  not display the same willingness as the government in  establishing a reasonable number of trade union leaders to form  their group of negotiators. At the time of this broadcast,  Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, together with Mircea Dan  Popescu, Florin Georgescu, Viorel Hrebenciuc, and Octavian  Partenie, are holding talks with a trade union delegation that  includes Bogdan Hosu, Victor Ciorbea, and Florin Diaconescu and  are trying to reach a solution regarding the number of members  to be included in the trade union delegation.    The government proposal that the trade union group should  include 15 people, considered to be sufficiently representative  for the entire trade union spectrum participating in the  demonstration, has been rejected by trade union leaders, who  propose a delegation that includes no less than 40 people.  However, the Romanian Government continues to maintain its  willingness for a sincere and constructive dialogue with trade  unions for a thorough examination of all real problems facing  them, certainly in accordance with the real possibilities that  the national economy can currently offer.    As a matter of fact, as is known, the claims of trade unions  have been discussed on several occasions. Most of those claims  are specific to a controlled, directed, and centralized economy  that is no longer in line with the current stage in Romania's  development, the communique sent to us by the spokesman of the  Romanian Government reads in conclusion.    A few minutes before the start of our broadcast, our  correspondent at the Government Headquarters informed us that  the two sides have not reached a joint accord on the major issue  under discussion, namely the number of participants in the  negotiations.</p>

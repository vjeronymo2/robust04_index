			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: Brands too valuable not to be in balance sheet Sir, Lex, in its tirade against brands and other intangibles on the balance sheet (January 30), has got it wrong. Lex comments that 'the Savoy name would be worth rather more to Mr Rocco Forte than it would be attached to a boarding house in Blackpool'. But the Savoy's kitchen equipment would also be of more value to Mr Forte than to a small Blackpool boarding house, yet the Savoy's kitchen equipment is accommodated quite readily on the balance sheet. Lex then argues that 'accounts are there to allow the user to judge future cash flows'. If we accept this definition, as brands are for many companies the key determinants of future cash flow, it is particularly important that they do appear in accounts. Finally, let us consider Maxwell. Lex implies that MCC's collapse illustrates the inappropriateness of putting brands on the balance sheet, yet virtually the only assets which will emerge unscathed from the wreckage will be the brands and publishing mastheads. In today's world the 'worth' of a company frequently resides more in its intangible assets (brands, patents, copyrights, software, etc) than in its tangible assets, yet current accounting techniques are rooted in the 19th century and virtually ignore the importance of intangibles in contemporary wealth creation. Railing against brands on the balance sheet is inappropriate; Lex should be championing their inclusion. J M Murphy, chairman Interbrand Group, 40 Long Acre, Covent Garden, London WC2E 9JT</p>

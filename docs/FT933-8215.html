			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: WB Inds cuts losses to Pounds 795,000 WB INDUSTRIES, the West Bromwich-based spring maker whose shares were suspended at 10p last November, reduced pre-tax losses for the year to December from Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 795,000. Turnover fell to Pounds 6.99m (Pounds 9.67m). Losses per share were 12.38p against 70.83p after an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.65m. The company said it still relied heavily on bank support. Its recovery 'will be slow, taking two to three years to see the property assets contributing materially to profits and cashflow.' The spring business should return to profit next year, it said.</p>

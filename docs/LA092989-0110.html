			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILIPINO COMMUNITY IN L.A. REMAINS DEEPLY SPLIT OVER MARCOS  </P> <P> In exile, Ferdinand E. Marcos split Los Angeles' Filipino community, leaving it  bitterly divided over his efforts to return to his native country. In the hours  after his death, there were sorrowful reactions from fellow expatriates -- and  a clear sign that the Marcos controversy has not ended.  </P> <P> "My initial reaction is sadness," Rolando B. Fernandez, president of the  Filipino American Community of Los Angeles, known as FACLA, said Thursday. "He  was a good man. He was brilliant, and I respect him."  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge Mel Red Recana, another prominent member of the local  Filipino community, also had kind words for the former president.  </P> <P> "He is a Filipino, after all. He did things we did not like, but he did good  things as well," Recana said. "This is now a healing period for all of us."  </P> <P> Among the county's estimated 155,000 Filipinos, the years have seen a closing  of the rift between pro- and anti-Marcos factions that had deepened in the wake  of his ouster from the Philippine presidency and allegations that he had looted  the country's treasury.  </P> <P> Fernandez, whose organization claims the largest membership among the county's  Filipinos, said he hopes that Marcos' death will work to unify his fellow  expatriates and not reopen old political wounds. But many of the Filipinos who  showed up at an afternoon dance at FACLA's Los Angeles headquarters not only  mourned the death of the man some still revere as their president but also  contended that he suffered needlessly.  </P> <P> "As Filipinos, we pray that his sins will be forgiven," said Nemesio T. Bonoan,  president of the Philippine Retirees Assn. of California. "Let us forgive and  forget."  </P> <P> Others in the crowd -- some of whom were dressed in their traditional barong  tagalogs and butterfly-sleeved gowns popularized by Imelda Marcos -- called the  news of Marcos' death tragic and defended a man who has been accused of  plundering his own country of billions of dollars and who was forced to give up  his office.  </P> <P> "He was a great president, and he should be allowed to go home," said Aledria  Albano, who was busily circulating a petition among the dancers and card  players asking President Corazon Aquino to allow the Marcos family to bury his  remains in the Philippines.  </P> <P> The issue of where the former president will be buried has galvanized Marcos  supporters and others who feel that his body should now be returned to his  native country. And a small group of protesters met Thursday with officials of  the Philippine Consulate to press their view that Marcos should return "for the  sake of national unity."  </P> <P> Alex A. Esclamado, publisher and editor in chief of the California-based  Philippine News, supported the Aquino government's decision not to allow burial  in the Philippines and said Marcos loyalists should accept his death. He added:  "I feel the death of Marcos will finally close the darkest period of Philippine  history."  </P></p>

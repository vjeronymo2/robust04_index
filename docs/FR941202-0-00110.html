			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's discussion of the environmental audit privilege was not intended to be taken as a threat to the approval of Oregon's title V program; rather, EPA merely intends to advise Oregon that the audit provision could be grounds for withdrawing Oregon's title V program in the future if EPA were to determine that the provision interfered with Oregon's enforcement responsibilities under part 70. Section 70.11(c)(iii) allows EPA to withdraw program approval if it determines that a State has failed to enforce the requirements of part 70. EPA also disagrees with the premise underlying the commenter's assessment that the Oregon audit provision is consistent with the Clean Air Act and other Federal criminal law. The commenter stated that the Oregon audit statute provides a shield only against criminal liability. By its terms, however, the privilege applies to ``any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding'' except as otherwise provided by the statute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ORS 468.963(2). Finally, the commenter's argument that the Oregon statute does not impinge on EPA's enforcement authorities, if carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that a State would not have to have any civil or criminal enforcement authorities to obtain title V approval. Such an argument contradicts the clear requirement that States must have certain civil and criminal enforcement authorities in order to obtain title V approval.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 502(b)(5)(E) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any event, the commenter's concerns are premature at this time. As the commenter acknowledged, EPA has not proposed to take any action on Oregon's environmental audit privilege in the context of this final action on Oregon's program. Such concerns would be properly raised when and if EPA proposed to withdraw Oregon's title V approval because EPA determines that the Oregon statute is interfering with Oregon's ability to enforce its title V program or EPA revised part 70 to prohibit environmental audit provisions such as Oregon's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Criminal Authorities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Upset/Bypass.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received two comments on its proposed finding that ORS 468.959, which provides a specific defense to criminal liability for violations resulting from an ``upset'' or a ``bypass,'' precludes full title V approval. In its proposal, EPA stated that the Oregon provision appears broader than the affirmative defense set forth in 40 CFR 70.6(g) for emissions in excess of technology-based emissions limits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 47108.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated simply that Oregon's statute is consistent with part 70, without further elaboration. The other commenter argued that the Oregon statute clearly places the burden of proof of establishing an upset or a bypass on the defendant, as required by 40 CFR 70.6(g)(4). The commenter also stated that the Oregon statute merely sets forth an affirmative defense based on necessity and that nothing in the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to preempt such longstanding notions of fairness that have been incorporated into State criminal law. The commenter further argued that if the Oregon upset/bypass statute precludes full approval in Oregon, other States with similar statutes should be similarly treated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the commenter that the Oregon statute appears to place the burden of proving an upset or bypass on the defendant, as required by 40 CFR 70.6(g)(4). EPA nonetheless maintains that the Oregon statute is broader than the emergency provisions of 40 CFR 70.6(g) for several reasons. Section 70.6(g) requires a source to prove that the excess emissions were not caused by improperly designed control equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error. No similar showing is required for a source in Oregon to claim an affirmative defense to excess emissions due to a ``bypass.'' For example, the Oregon provision would allow a source to routinely bypass improperly designed control equipment with impunity simply by indicating that the control equipment would be severely damaged if operated during the periods of bypass. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements under part 70 are also more extensive than those required by ORS 468.959. Moreover, the emergency provision of part 70 provides a defense only to emissions in excess of a technology-based emissions limit, while the Oregon statute provides a defense to any emissions limit, including a health-based limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also disagrees with the commenter's assertion that the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to require States to make changes to their criminal statutes. Title V requires that States have appropriate criminal authorities in order to obtain title V approval.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 502(b)(5)(E). EPA has interpreted this statutory provision in part 70 section 70.11 and must evaluate State programs for consistency with the promulgated rule. In response to the commenter's concern that all States should be treated similarly on this issue, EPA notes the commenter's concern and agrees that evenhanded treatment is appropriate. In conclusion, EPA continues to believe that ORS 468.959 poses a bar to full approval, but does allow for interim approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Corporate criminal liability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received three comments concerning EPA's interpretation of ORS 161.170, which addresses the extent to which a corporation can be subject to criminal liability in Oregon. Based on its initial review of the statute, EPA believed that, in order for a corporation to be criminally liable for knowing violations of permit terms and other applicable requirements under ORS 468.936, the State must show that the board of directors or a high managerial agent ``engaged in, authorized, solicited, requested, commanded or knowingly tolerated'' the conduct giving rise to the violation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ORS 161.170(1)(c). EPA's preliminary view was that the Oregon statute imposed a greater burden of proof and degree of knowledge or intent than Federal law, which requires only that the crime be committed by an employee of the corporation and that the employee was at the time performing that employee's duties for the corporation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 47108.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

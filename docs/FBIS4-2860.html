			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (CNS) -- Director of the Foreign  Trade Administration Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation Mr. Zhou Keren stressed at a meeting on  countering the illegal re-export of textiles yesterday that the  fight against these activities had to be strengthened in order  to wipe them out.    Mr. Zhou said that a consensus was reached during the  meeting  for a heavy crackdown on such illegal practice. Participants  lent their support and expressed understanding of three punitive  measures submitted by the ministry, the General Administration  of Customs and the State Import and Export Inspection Bureau and  of the punishment handed down to four enterprises found guilty  of violation of the relevant law. They expressed their  determination to further fight against the illegal re-export of  textiles.    All of the participants were clearly aware of the serious  harm resulting from such offences which bypassed the quota  system administration at home and disrupted the conducting of  foreign trade while it also ran counter to a commitment made by  China in bilateral and multi-lateral international agreements,  resulting in great damage to China's prestige and credit in  terms of foreign trade in the international community. Illegal  re-exporting carried out by a handful of enterprises caused  damage not only to the state, but also to themselves finally.  Their offence made other law-abiding enterprises subject to  unnecessary inspection and accusations when undertaking  foreign-related business.    Leading teams have already been set up in Tianjin  Municipality and Shandong Province to counter the illegal  re-export of textiles and have worked out measures for  inspection and handling of the offence. The Shenzhen Import and  Export Commodities Inspection Bureau and the Shenzhen Bureau of  Economic Development often join forces in inspecting processing  plants.    The Foreign Trade Ministry, the Administration of Customs  and  the State Inspection Bureau will continue to send inspection  teams to do spot checks on enterprises this year. The  implementation of any decision made by this meeting will be  examined, while Guangdong, Shantou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Xiamen,  Zhejiang and Ningbo have to boost cooperation and coordination  in carrying out inspections of production, transactions,  examinations, customs declarations and the export of textiles  there.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Today" -- BTA lead] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofia, June 22 (BTA) -- During the second day  of consultations on the Judiciary Act, which passed late last  week, President Zhelyu Zhelev received Prosecutor General Ivan  Tatarchev and the 25-member Supreme Judicial Council headed by  its chairman, Justice Minister Petur Kornazhev. Supreme Court  Chairman Ivan Grigorov set forth the council's opinion that 20  texts of the law contravene the Constitution. In contrast to  other council members, Ani Kruleva, director of the National  Investigative Service (NIS), believes the president should not  veto the law, which meets with approval from investigators.  According to her, the Judiciary Act adequately regulates the  structure and functions of the NIS, as well as the status of  investigators.    President Zhelev, who is also Supreme Commander-in-Chief of  the Armed Forces, today received Vice-Admiral Ventseslav Velkov,  Commander of the Navy. The sides discussed the state of the  Navy, ways to resolve its problems and the progress of reform,  says a press release of the president's office. They exchanged  views on the Breeze-94 Naval Exercise, the first in this country  within the framework of the Partnership for Peace programme.  Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Turkey, Greece and the  United States will be taking part in it and Georgia will send  observers.    Filip Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces  (SDS), met with top-level representatives of the United Romany  Alliance headed by Vasil Chaprazov, the SDS press office said.  The Gypsy leaders expressed concern over the SDS's failure to  commit itself sufficiently to the problems of the Gypsy  community, which could make it easy prey to manipulations. Also  on the agenda were national economic problems and prospects for  cooperation between the two organizations for their resolution.    The Press Office of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP)  today  denied stories in DEMOKRATSIYA, EXPRESS and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK,  misquoting a statement by socialist leader Zhan Videnov who  spoke at a news conference yesterday [21 June]. The Press  Office said questioners had asked Mr. Videnov to comment on the  BSP's silence and lack of official stand on the census in  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  and Skopje's policy on ethnic minority issues, to which he  responded, "On the contrary, the Bulgarian Socialist Party was  the only political force two and a half years ago to refuse to  applaud the hasty unconditional recognition of the Republic of  Macedonia, arguing that, predictably, such problems would arise  between the two countries." According to Mr. Videnov, the  language problem, the problem over the "Bulgarian" option in the  census forms, and the "Macedonian" option in similar censuses in  Bulgaria were bound to arise. He went on to say, "Disputes over  the historical legacy were also bound to arise, and territorial,  maybe even border disputes, are probably taking shape. No doubt,  national security is another such area of which the two states  have profoundly different concepts. For Skopje, it amounts to  the presence of foreign troops on Macedonian territory, while  Bulgaria sees it as balanced and peaceful relations with all of  its neighbours, integrated into the European and world security  systems. Thus the BSP cannot in the least be accused of taking a  conformist, vague and inconsistent stand on these issues. They  cannot mar Bulgarian-Macedonian relations, though many  opportunities for their preventive settlement have been lost in  the last two and a half years. Now, undoubtedly, the  responsibility will have to be shouldered by the respective  state institutions, and not by those who warned that the  complicated configuration in the Balkans was fraught with grave  difficulties."    National Bank Governor Todor Vulchev met today with members  of the BSP leadership, national radio reported. Speaking to a  radio reporter, BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva said the meeting  had taken place at Mr. Vulchev's request. Doncho Konakchiev of  the Socialists' top leadership said the BSP had asked for such a  meeting much earlier and it had been occasioned, among other  things, by vacancies on the central bank's Governing Board and  forecasts about the exchange rate of the lev.    President Zhelev uses the political centre to fulfill his  ambitions, Velislava Dureva of the Social Democracy Alliance  within the BSP told a news conference today. [passage omitted]    Speaking at a news conference in Razgrad (northern  Bulgaria),  Nedim Gendzhev, former chief mufti, now leader of the Democratic  Party of Justice, said he expected the World Bank to extend a $1  million loan for the opening of food enterprises in northeastern  Bulgaria (a region with a large ethnic Turk population), as well  as for other projects in the region. Gendzhev believes the  Organization of the Islamic Conference may rescind its decisions  against Bulgaria. [passage omitted]    Experts of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and of  the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions (KNSB) hold  similar views on the government ordinance on permissible levels  of pollutants in industrial units, the press learned from KNSB  Deputy Chairman Zhelyazko Khristov today. The entry into force  of the ordinance, scheduled for January 1, was postponed at the  trade union's request. If it is enforced in its present shape,  some 220,000 people working in a harmful environment will lose  their social benefits, Dr. Khristov said. [passage omitted]    In an open letter to Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, the two  influential trade unions -- KNSB and Podkrepa -- today called  for the resignation of Culture Minister Ivaylo Znepolski. Their  demand is motivated by what they see as a "disgraceful action  aimed to eliminate the institutions which direct, create and  popularize Bulgarian culture".    The customs office in Kyustendil has collected over 1.5  million leva in fines for customs irregularities this year,  BTA's correspondent reported. Cigarettes, batteries, water  pumps and welders have been confiscated and 5 kilos of heroin  has been seized.</p>

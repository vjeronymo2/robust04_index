			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: The undisputed jewel in the crown ranging from gold mining in Ghana to Kenyan hotels, Mauritian sugar estates and Tanzanian tea plantations - the undisputed jewel in the crown is Western Platinum, the world's third largest producer. Situated in South Africa on the Bushveld complex along with Rustenburg and Impala, the other two main producers, Western has been at the centre of speculation for the past two years over some sort of closer tie between Lonrho and Gencor, the country's second largest mining house. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, confirmed yesterday that discussions on an ongoing basis had continued ever since Impala, the platinum arm of the Gencor group, had put its Karee mine into Western in return for a a 27 per cent stake. Mr Gilbertson reiterated that although various options - including a possible takeover of the Lonrho group - had been discussed, the primary focus of discussions had always been in achieving synergies on the platinum side. His view remained that more could be achieved in this area to the benefit of all parties, especially Lonrho shareholders. He added: 'I like to think Mr Dieter Bock will come to the same view.' Mr Gilbertson said the most recent discussions with Lonrho had been about a month ago. But he said he hadn't personally been involved in any detailed discussions. It is believed that these were conducted mainly by Mr Bernard Smith, a Gencor director and chairman of Engen, the group's energy arm. The attraction of Western to Impala was, in the first instance, its reserves. Two years ago Impala had a paucity of reserves, subsequently addressed in part through acquiring a lease over the Deeps area and purchasing the platinum interests - later mothballed - of Rand Mines. A merger with Western would have solved this problem. Another attraction was that heavy start-up costs would be avoided, since Western was already in production and that it was in a major expansion phase. It has also long been accepted that it is the lowest cost producer in the industry. On the downside is Western's high level of debt - estimated by analysts to be in the region of R900m (Pounds 192m). There are concerns as to whether cash flows are sufficient to fund interest payments on this debt. Analysts ascribe this problem to extremely rapid expansion coinciding with a sharp decline in world rhodium prices. Production grew from 274,000 ounces of platinum group metals in 1988 to an estimated 690,000 ounces in 1992 - a rate of expansion way in excess of anything contemplated by Rustenburg or Impala.</p>

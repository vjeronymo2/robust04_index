			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Poland expands debt plans Poland expects to buy back around a fifth of its Dollars 13bn commercial debt, according to Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the country's chief debt negotiator. This is more than the 5 per cent of the debt mooted in talks with banks for the buy-back operation earlier this year as the country looks to reduce the stock of debt by as much as it can afford in order to clear the way for bond issues abroad next year. A buy-back of 5 per cent of the debt was considered when its price stood at around 50 cents to the dollar. The current price is 38.5 cents. Mr Krowacki said yesterday he would know exactly how much of the debt would be bought back once holders of the debt had responded to Poland's proposal made last weekend to purchase the debt at between 41 cents and 38 cents to the dollar. The operation is part of a debt reduction framework agreement negotiated with the London Club of commercial banks last March.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Australia cuts growth prediction THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday cut its forecast for 1992-93 growth in gross domestic product (GDP) from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, confirming earlier indications that the economy is recovering more slowly than expected. The announcement coincided with the eighth successive quarterly reduction in the inflation rate, which fell to a 30-year annualised low of 0.3 per cent at the end of December, the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, Mr John Dawkins, the Labour treasurer (finance minister), said unemployment was unlikely to fall substantially below 11 per cent before the end of the financial year in June. The government forecast in the August budget that unemployment would fall to about 10 per cent by June, the latest possible date for the next federal election. Unemployment has since risen to a record 11.3 per cent. Mr Dawkins said the budget forecast of 2 per cent inflation for the current year would be revised downwards by an unspecified amount, but the forecast current account deficit would be revised upwards from 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent of GDP, equivalent to about ADollars 16bn (Pounds 6.91bn). He said the government had been forced to reduce its GDP forecast by sluggish growth in other OECD countries, which affects demand for Australian exports. Mr John Hewson, the conservative opposition leader, said GDP growth was unlikely to exceed 2 per cent.</p>

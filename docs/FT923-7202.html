			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price surges as funds change tactics THE COPPER market burst into life when prices rose very strongly in New York and London after investment funds, which had been attempting to push the price down, changed tactics, dealers suggested yesterday. The funds' selling strategy was unsuccessful because it stimulated buying by North American consumers and China, said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch. 'Consumers see copper as a 'buy' when it is below Dollars 1.10 a lb,' he said. Also, merchants say the Chinese are looking for up to 200,000 tonnes of copper in the next six to nine months. 'Copper at Dollars 1.05 a lb is seen as a bargain basement price by the Chinese.' Ms Karen Norton, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, pointed out that the copper market was fundamentally well-balanced and there was likely to be a supply deficit of 70,000 tonnes this year compared with a surplus of 112,000 tonnes in 1991. Copper's three-month price touched Dollars 2,563 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange yesterday before closing at Dollars 2,556 (Dollars 1.16 a lb) up Dollars 57 from Monday's kerb close. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, said: 'We are looking for it to move to Dollars 2,575. If it goes through there the upside target is Dollars 2,635.' Some 8 to 9 cents a lb will be added to the cost of about 347,000 tonnes of annual aluminium production capacity on the US west coast because of power restrictions to be imposed for four months from September by the Bonneville Power Administration, according to Mr Tom Van Leeuwen, analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York. He said a maximum of 30,000 tonnes of annual capacity might be temporarily shut down but, after talking to producers, he believed none would make a decision before the end of this year when they would know if the drought conditions  - which are causing a 25 per cent cut in BPA power supplies  - continued. Meanwhile, smelters would buy power from other sources at a cost roughly double that of their contracts with BPA.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium    +11,150  to  1,325,575 Copper        +7,075  to  258,425 Lead             -25  to  150,600 Nickel        +1,188  to  42,156 Zinc            +750  to  345,875 Tin             -135  to  14,500  --------------------------------------</p>

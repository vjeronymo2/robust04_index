			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Arts: The Life of The World to Come On August 2 1894, as FT readers may already be aware, death duties were introduced in Britain. It would be nice to think that Rod Williams' The Life of the World to Come at the Almeida Theatre was part of a celebration of this centenary. But it seems more likely to be a lucky chance, part of the general hit and miss of a not very cohesive play. It begins promisingly enough, with an accountant discussing tax loopholes with his client. It gradually becomes clear that these projected investments over, say, 100 years (we are talking over Dollars 9bn by the end) and the avoidance of death duties are postulated on the client not dying but going into 'temporary cessation of vital processes'. This is the world of cryonics; of deep-freezing a punter until a cure for his ailments, or simply ageing, is found; then attaching the severed head to an ideal body, putting blood back into the cadaver, and waking him to an eternal youth, a few fiscal nest eggs and a possible case of frostbite. This is the world where being a pensioner leads to being a 'suspensioner . . . Not dead, merely incapax . . . A win-win situation . . . simply no down side.' What sounds like one of the wilder satirical flights from Brave New World is currently taken very seriously in America and is, inevitably, attracting big money. The scene looks set for a swingeing attack on the barmier fads of our day at the very least, even though the scene is tentatively played with flat reticence, as if by actors more used to performing to mike or camera than projecting in a theatre. Unfortunately the play swerves between farce and sitcom, satire and moral exploration. Nearly four years in the writing, the piece simply fails to hang together. A plot is less important than the style, a deadpan look at the contrast between the kitsch solemnity surrounding death (or pseudo-death) and the cynical realities of business: territory familiar from The Loved One and The American Way of Death. The cynical realities of science, too, where the suspensioners are experimented on by the brilliant Makoto in his quest to 'thaw out the stiffs', only to be incinerated when he fails to revivify them. Derek Wax, who directed the powerfully claustrophobic No Remission for the same author (and group, Midnight Theatre Company), lacks the incisiveness to impose shape on the generally garbled goings on. Act 1 ends with the revelation that the cryonics firm's smoothy director sees his work as 'consecrated euthanasia' where 'we give our patients death, club class', and has no intention of resuscitating the clients. In Act 2 the plot gets going in earnest when Makoto succeeds in resurrecting the company's late president, an improbably young man who combines a Baywatch build with the business hustle that made the American Dream and, even more improbably, a conscience. For this medical breakthrough (announced by the naked patient racing around the stage pursued by amazed doctors) triggers off general horror all round. The last thing share-holders want is the status quo to be disturbed; but idealist young Steve is shocked at millions being deceived. Here the play shows signs of confusing rewrites. For a president, Steve seems to know nothing of the company he presides over. The lovely Marilyn Shriver (employed to bring an element of spirituality to her position of 'closure therapist') treats him as a stranger even though she has been admiring his 'suspended' nude body, on display in a showcase as an inspiration to aspiring patients. Illogicalities and inconsistencies abound, not least when she tearfully talks Steve back into his living death - from which, we know, his business associates will make sure he never returns. The satire never quite takes shape, and we are left with jokes about jargon ('Don't go quichey on me,' snarls the villainous businessman to a colleague afflicted with scruples) and two good performances. Simon Burke's Steve has evidently had his shrewd head attached to a pretty good body which he unabashedly displays; and the excellent Dearbhla Molloy, rather wasted, almost makes a living human being out of blonde comforter Marilyn. For the rest, the patients are not the only ones in suspended animation on stage.</p>

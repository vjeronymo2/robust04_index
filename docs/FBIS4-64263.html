			<p>President   Stresses Common Monetary Policy   <F P=102> AU2904153594 Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 29 Apr 94 p  16 </F>  <F P=103> AU2904153594 </F> <F P=104>  Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT </F> <F P=105>  German </F> BFN   <F P=106> ["beu"-signed report: "EMI President Lamfalussy Emphasizes </F> Importance of Common Monetary Policy"]    [Text] Hamburg -- One of the central tasks of the European  Monetary Institute (EMI) will be finding a consensus on the  basis for a common monetary policy conducted by the European  Central Bank. EMI President Lamfalussy knows one thing for  sure: "This is not going to be an easy task."    Speaking before the central bank of Hamburg, Mecklenburg,  and  Schleswig-Holstein, Lamfalussy said that the course of fiscal  policy can considerably narrow down monetary policy's  stabilizing possibilities in both phases of the economic cycle.  The only thing that the currency authorities can do is continue  to conduct a medium-term stability policy, hoping that this will  limit the damage caused by a false fiscal policy.    Lamfalussy: "I can see a major problem coming our way here.  We will have to define what we mean by a stable monetary  policy." This is the biggest challenge that monetary  politicians will face over the next few years. Lamfalussy  considers the use of a money supply target to be the crucial  point. The biggest advantage of a money supply target is that  it clearly determines the course of monetary policy. If the  targeted money supply growth rate remains unchanged, this  indicates a stable monetary policy course.    Determining money supply targets takes the pressure off  central banks that is exerted on them by governments or  parliaments, Lamfalussy said. A central bank has less  difficulty resisting an adjustment of monetary policy for  subjective reasons. Also -- and this might be the most  important point -- a money supply target that is well understood  by the general public clearly signals to the players in the  market what range of prices and wages is permitted.    Whether determining money supply targets is appropriate  depends on two things. First, there must be a stable  medium-term link between money supply and prices, the final  target; and, second, the central bank must be in a position to  control the targeted money supply.    Several countries, such as the United States and Great  Britain, no longer meet one or both of these preconditions.  John Crow, former governor of the Canadian Central Bank used to  say: "We have not given up M2 -- M2 has given us up."    In Germany, such a statement is not justified, in spite of  occasional diversions from the M3 target and in spite of M3's  recent behavior. Lamfalussy: "But this behavior does not go  back nearly long enough to draw any conclusions on medium-term  stability of the money demand function, which is the whole point  of the matter." Yet, there are ongoing discussions on what basis  the European Central Bank's common monetary policy shall be  conducted.</p>

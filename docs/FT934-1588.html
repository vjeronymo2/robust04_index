			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark broadly firmer The Bundesbank's decision yesterday to leave official interest rates unchanged bolstered the D-Mark against the US dollar and most European currencies, writes Conner Middelmann. At its last meeting of the year, the Bundesbank's central bank council held its 5.75 per cent discount rate and 6.75 per cent Lombard rate steady. This disappointed many dealers, who had hoped for another rate cut before the year-end, in spite of the Bundesbank's recent reminder that it had set fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements until January 5 to quell speculation about a cut in interest rates. But even before the Bundesbank said it was leaving rates unchanged, the dollar slid on the announcement that German M3 money supply had grown by an annualised 7.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 6.9 per cent in October and well above forecasts for a 6.7 per cent rate. This not only dampened hopes that M3 would return to its 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target this year, but also dashed any lingering speculation of a rate reduction at yesterday's council meeting. The Bundesbank's council lowered the central bank's M3 target range for 1994 to 4 to 6 per cent. This had been widely expected and had little market impact. Disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut rates sent the March three-month Euromark interest rate contract tumbling by 0.09 point to 94.45. The French March Pibor contract slid in sympathy, ending at 94.16, down 0.09 point from Wednesday's close. The French franc finished at FFr3.415 to the D-Mark, compared with FFr3.418 on Wednesday. The Bank of France left interest rates unchanged at its latest open-market operation, where it drained FFr9.2bn of liquidity. Its five to 10-day rate currently stands at 7 per cent, while the intervention rate is 6.2 per cent. The D-Mark also firmed against the Belgian franc, which fell to BFr20.88, down from BFr20.86. The Italian lira closed at L987.4 to the D-Mark, down from L987.0 the previous day. The Danish krone ended at DKr3.912 to the D-Mark, up from DKr3.923 on Wednesday. The dollar fell to around DM1.7080, recovered during midday but slipped towards the close on late profit-taking. It ended at DM1.7085, down from Wednesday's DM1.7160. It also slipped against the yen on November trade data showing that the US trade gap with Japan reached a seven-year high at Dollars 6.1bn. It ended at Y109.75, up from Y109.65 but off an earlier high of Y110.05. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.7093 and Y109.55. Although German interest rates remained on hold, Austria and Switzerland lowered theirs. Early in the day, the Swiss National Bank reduced its discount rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4.25 per cent, explaining that the cut took account of interest rate developments in the markets. However, it stressed there was only limited room for further interest rate declines. Immediately after the announcement, the Swiss franc declined to SFr0.859 to the D-Mark, but it recouped its loss to close at SFr0.853, up from SFr0.855 at Wednesday's close. 'The market is taking the view that the relative interest-rate differential will move in favour of the Swiss franc,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency analyst at UBS. He feels that the Swiss central bank may shave another 75 basis points off rates as Swiss inflation continues to ease, while he expects the German discount rate to fall by around 175 basis points next year. The Austrian National Bank announced a 10 basis-point cut in its Gomex open-market intervention rate to 5.70 per cent, effective today. Earlier this week a central bank official indicated it would continue cutting interest rates autonomously if it had room for manoeuvre. Austria has cut its rates several times in recent months, helped by the recent strength of the schilling, which on Tuesday was fixed at its highest level this year against the D-Mark at Ats703.05 per 100 D-Marks, but yesterday finished at Ats703.15. The sterling money market was slightly more relaxed, helped by the smaller liquidity shortage and waning rate-cut expectations. The Bank of England initially announced a shortage of Pounds 1.5bn, but later revised that to Pounds 1.1bn. That compares with a Pounds 2.65bn shortage on Wednesday. In early operations the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 488m for resale to the market on January 7 at 5 13/32 per cent. In further operations it bought Pounds 58m of bills, followed by late assistance of around Pounds 510m. 'We have had a terribly tight week, but things should start easing off a little into the Christmas period,' said a senior money dealer. He added that the Bank of England had kept the market tight to indicate that there would be no near-term cut in interest rates. 'Now, all the speculation for rate cuts this year has gone, which is a reason for the Bank to be a bit less tight.' The March short sterling contract slipped by 0.04 point to 94.80 after sliding by 0.09 point on Wednesday. Early in the day, the pound firmed briefly to a high of DM2.5478 on the back of a stronger than expected decline in UK unemployment, but it slipped back to finish at DM2.5450, unchanged from the previous day. Against the dollar sterling ended at Dollars 1.4890, compared with Dollars 1.4835 on Wednesday.  ---------------------------------------          POUND IN NEW YORK  --------------------------------------- Dec 16           Close   Prev. close  --------------------------------------- Pounds spot     1.4875      1.4785 1 mth           1.4842      1.4750 3 mth           1.4794      1.4703 1 yr            1.4672      1.4587  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Markets: Investors search hard for new worries - Wall Street Wall Street's latest inflation scare seems to be over - at least for now. After fretting about whether factory and retail prices rose sharply in September or not, investors' nerves were calmed this week by data showing surprisingly a low inflation rate. The news lifted bonds and stocks, which were given an additional boost by a promising opening to the third quarter reporting season. Yet, the warm glow left by the September inflation figures will soon fade, probably by Monday. Once the new week starts, investors will start worrying about something else. Will this be the last quarter of strong corporate earnings before the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightenings start to take effect? Will the dollar weaken further? Is the economy still growing too strongly for the Fed's liking? Thus, will the central bank sanction another rate increase before the end of November? Soon, it will time for investors to start fretting about the October inflation data, and the whole cycle can begin again, for Wall Street just cannot seem to shake its inflation bug, even after this week's reassuring statistics. On Thursday the government reported that producer prices fell 0.5 per cent in September, the steepest decline since August 1993. Yesterday's consumer prices data were almost as encouraging, with the consumer price index rising just 0.2 per cent last month. Since the start of the year, producer prices have risen 1.9 per cent, and consumer prices 2.8 per cent. This means that the rate of inflation has barely budged since last year, even though consumers continue to spend, jobs continue to be created and the economy continues to grow at an impressive rate. Investors worried about inflation have been unable to draw much comfort from the low rate of price increases because they cannot believe that current solid economic growth and low inflation can last for long. Yet, there are some good reasons why inflation is low now, and likely to stay that way: commodity prices remain low (the threat of another conflict in the Gulf this week actually led to a decline in oil prices); global competition is preventing companies from raising prices and labour demanding higher pay; technological development continues to forge efficiency gains and depress wages; and companies continue to respond to high costs by restructuring their operations rather than raising prices. Then there is the Fed factor. Interest rates have been raised five times this year, and this tightening of policy should eventually take its toll on the economy. Assuming that it does, and economic growth slows down in 1994 because of the Fed's actions, it is safe to assume that any inflationary pressures in the system will also ease next year. If inflation is running at around 3 per cent this year, it is difficult to envisage it rising much above that rate in 1994. At some stage, the bond market is going to wake up to the fact that inflation is not going to prove as bad as they expected. When it does, long term interest rates, which are hovering around 8 per cent today, should come down. Until that happens, however, the stock market is probably going to continue to struggle to break out of its trading range, which over the past few months has left the Dow Jones industrial average stuck between 3,800 and 3,950. At least investors can draw strength from corporate profits, which looks as if they will post handsome growth in the latest quarter. Although there were a handful of disappointments (Weyerhauser, CBS, JP Morgan), the trend in earnings remains positive, and four companies which represent a good cross-section of the US economy - Chrysler, Pepsico, Apple Computer and Motorola - all had good news this week. Chrysler's was the most impressive. The carmaker posted a 54 per cent improvement in three-month profits to Dollars 651m as demand for its most popular models in North America again outstripped supply. Analysts expect Ford and General Motors to perform equally well. Pepsico's results also came as a pleasant surprise to analysts and investors. The group reported an 18 per cent increase in earnings to Dollars 541.4m as soft drinks sales growth offset disappointing sales in the fast food division. The news lifted Pepsico's stock by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34. Apple Computer and Motorola, meanwhile, helped provide a boost to a flagging technology sector. Motorola's profits jumped 50 per cent to a record Dollars 380m in the third quarter, while Apple said it would beat analysts' forecasts of its earnings when it reports fiscal fourth quarter profits next week, news which lifted the company's stock to a new 14-month high of Dollars 39 5/8.  ---------------------------- Monday      3821.32  +  23.89 Tuesday     3876.83  +  55.51 Wednesday   3875.15 -  01.68 Thursday    3889.95  +  14.80 Friday      3910.47  +  20.52  ----------------------------</p>

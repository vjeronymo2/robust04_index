			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Capital questions for EC investment - Current talks could lay the foundation for Europe's securities industry A SERIES of intensive discussions over the next two and a half weeks could lay the foundations for the future structure of the securities industry in Europe. The subject: the amount of capital needed by investment firms in the EC. After four years of debate, Commission staff led by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Commissioner responsible, finally put a compromise to EC ministers earlier this week. If all goes well, ministers will be asked to give their formal approval on June 9. The rules in the proposed Capital Adequacy Directive will apply both to non-bank investment firms (including the investment subsidiaries of banks), and to banks' 'trading books' - the part of theirbalance sheet on which they conduct their investment business. Divisions between member states remain, though. Reservations expressed at Tuesday's meeting revealed a number of important areas which are still open to debate. They include: How much capital should firms have to back their large exposures? Previous proposals would have prevented investment firms from taking on exposures of more than 25 per cent of their capital base - effectively restricting underwriting and block trading of securities to large well-capitalised banks. The compromise put forward this week will do away with this so-called 'hard limit', though it will introduce severe capital rules for large positions, particularly those which remain on an investment firm's books for longer than 10 days. This compromise still concerns some member states where investment business is dominated by large, well-capitalised universal banks, such as Germany. It could also pose significant difficulties for the handful of institutional brokers in the UK which are not owned by banking groups, and so do not have ready access to capital to back their exposures. How much subordinated debt should firms be allowed to count as capital for regulatory purposes? The directive introduces a new type of capital, known as 'tier three' capital - effectively short-term subordinated debt. Parallel discussions over a global accord on capital adequacy, between Iosco and the Basle committee of banking supervisors, proposed earlier this year that tier three capital should be restricted to 250 per cent of other capital. This has yet to be accepted by all EC member states. Should tier three capital be allowed to back all of an investment firm's risks? There is little dispute that it should cover position risks. But it is still unclear whether tier three capital will count against large exposures or the counterparty risks which arise from trading derivative instruments. What exactly is a 'trading book'? The definition is important: anything not on the book will be caught by more stringent capital rules. The dividing line is a difficult one to enforce. Where, for instance, should repurchase agreements (or repos) fall? If they are allowed on the trading book, then the directive could encourage disintermediation of the banking system. Rather than offering secured loans, financial institutions could offer reverse repos (arrangements under which they buy securities with an agreement to sell them back again at a later stage). The effect of the product would be the same, the capital needed to back it would be less. However, keeping repos off the trading book could stem the rapidly-growing repo market in London, which investment banks use to finance themselves. One suggestion is that repo business done between professionals (broadly, investment firms and banks) should qualify for the trading book, but this restrictive definition may not fit the realities of the repo market in all centres. Even if final agreement on all these matters can be reached at the meeting of ministers on June 9, it is debatable whether the final form of the directive will be agreed. Consultation is due to start this summer on similar proposals by Iosco and the Basle committee, and it seems unlikely that EC ministers will want to set in stone rules for European investment firms which may eventually be out of line with rules agreed globally. But Portuguese representatives may want to reach a broad political agreement on the issue before the Portuguese presidency of the EC ends next month. If they succeed, it could be difficult for other member states to reopen the issue.</p>

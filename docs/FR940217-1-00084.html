			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.92&blank;Fines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary proposes to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references to third-party servicers in this section to conform to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed changes governing the imposition of fines in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section would also be amended to provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of the size of the servicer's business (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of institutions and student accounts served by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer) in determining the amount of a fine against a servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision would be similar to the provision already in place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section that requires consideration of the size of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution in determining the amount of a fine against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. The Secretary also proposes to take into account,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the case of a violation by a third-party servicer, the degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to which the servicer can provide evidence that the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributed to that violation and the extent to which repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanical systemic unintentional errors contributed to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation. For purposes of this section, repeated mechanical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systemic unintentional errors would be counted as a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation. This provision was requested by non-Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators to cover cases where errors in computer systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in multiple violations. The Secretary proposes to adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these measures in the interest of fairness to a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer in cases where a minor programming error leads to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundreds or thousands of violations. While the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that all resulting losses should be compensated for by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution or servicer, fines need not be unduly multiplied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary specifically invites comment on whether this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision is sufficiently specific and not excessively broad and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively balances the Federal interest in ensuring compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the realities of computer processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to provide for the consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the amount of liability owed by an institution or third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer on the misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds or refunds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in determining the gravity of the institution's or servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation, as applicable, of a Title IV requirement. The number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of students affected by the violation also would be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration in that determination. The Secretary intends these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions to serve as guidelines for evaluating the gravity of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.93&blank;Limitation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary proposes to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references to third-party servicers in this section to conform to proposed changes governing the imposition of limitations in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of this subpart. The Secretary also proposes that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation on a third-party servicer's eligibility to contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with institutions to administer any aspect of an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could include a limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the number or size of institutions with which the servicer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract, the number of accounts (borrower or loan accounts) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer may service under contract, an increase or reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the responsibilities allowed or required of the servicer under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a contract, or a requirement for the servicer to obtain surety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assuring the servicer's ability to meet financial obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that these limitations are necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to address the probable causes of improprieties in which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer might engage. By limiting the number or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size of institutions or accounts that a third-party servicer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve (including, for example, requiring the servicer to transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing accounts back to the institution) the Secretary may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address a problem involving the servicer's overextended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources. By limiting the responsibilities performed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer under a contract, the Secretary may restrict the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's administration to a particular Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while prohibiting the servicer from administering another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program for which the servicer's past performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been inadequate. By imposing additional responsibilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a third-party servicer's contract, the Secretary may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the servicer to use additional safeguards before awarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or disbursing Title IV, HEA program funds or delivering Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stafford or Federal SLS loan proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

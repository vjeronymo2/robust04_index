Speaking at the first meeting of the preparatory committee  for the World Summit for Social Development, Li Zhaoxing,  Chinese permanent representative to UN, said China will make  full use of the good conditions created by the economic growth,  pay attention to new problems and make the society more  civilized, equatable, healthy and happy.    The convocation of the world summit, in 1955 in Copenhagen,  reflects not only the importance attached to the issue of  development by the United Nations and its member states, but  also the common aspiration of jointly facing the future by  entire mankind, Li said.    With the view of achieving more practical and desired  results  at the summit, he made five observations:    -- Economic development cannot automatically promote social  progress. In an ideal and healthy society, there should be a  coordinated development in economic and social fields, and the  economic achievements should be applied to social development in  a timely and appropriate manner.    -- The promotion and enhancement of social development is a  fairly strong government action. The coordination between  economic and social development, between departments within the  field of social development, between regions and between  government and non-governmental organizations all depend on the  comprehensive coordination and management of the government.    -- The declaration and program of action to be adopted by  the  summit should give special attention to the grave problems faced  by the developing countries, and international cooperation  should be conducted in a comprehensive, effective and fair  manner and on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.    -- The establishment and maintenance of a peaceful and  stable  international environment and the establishment of a new  international economic order of justice, equality mutual benefit  and cooperation, should be a precondition for the settlement of  social problems in various countries.    -- Since countries have different development level, social  system and cultural tradition, their emphasis on questions in  social development vies, specific policies, approaches and  programs of action should be formulated in line with different  national conditions.    The Chinese ambassador also told the meeting that his  government is planning to hold a national conference on social  development, the first of its kind in China, in September to  review the program for social development in China for the next  few decades.    China is also planning to hold in Beijing an international  symposium on social development in June to discuss such issues  as social development and social progress and role of the  government in social development.    China's preparatory committee for the summit, chaired by the  head of the State Planning Commission and composes of 25  officials at the ministerial level from central departments and  leaders of non-governmental organizations, was established last  December.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic by </F> Ante Gugo; place and date not given: "`Belgrade Decides -- War  or Peace'"]    [Text] We can say that Mate Granic is a politician who  marked the year coming to a close. Although he was appointed  foreign minister as late as 1 June, it was that part of politics  that marked global events. Unprecedented dynamism in meeting  world diplomats and heads of states enabled Granic to make  significant changes in the image of Croatia in the world, and  thanks to his persistence and the right dose of determination,  Resolutions 847 and 871 were adopted, unambiguously confirming  Croatia's right to establish full sovereignty over its entire  territory. His insistence on respecting international  humanitarian law, regardless of the fact that the world did not  view all sides from the same perspective regarding the issue of  convoys, made the world understand that Croatia sincerely  intends to establish peace. Although his efforts were disturbed  by injudicious moves, primarily in Herceg-Bosna, Granic showed  that, in a relatively short period of time, he acquired capital  that can grant credit to the bad moves of others. Consequently,  the destruction of the Old Bridge in Mostar did not have serious  repercussions on Croatia. The fact that he was received by the  United States Senate, and his ease in establishing contacts with  his Western counterparts, speaks for his credibility as the  representative of Croatian politics in the world.    [Gugo] At the end of this calendar year, could you summarize  Croatian foreign politics?    [Granic] Croatian foreign politics are characterized by  securing a better international position for our country. There  were many problems, the pressure of the international community  after the Maslenica operation to begin with, but especially due  to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We gave special  consideration to solving the problem of the UNPA [United Nations  Protected Area] zones. European integration processes and  settling the relations with our neighbors were a parallel task.  We obtained Resolutions 815, 820, 847, and 871, which  undoubtedly confirm the right of the Republic of Croatia to  sovereignty over its entire territory, i.e. within  internationally recognized borders. Furthermore, President  Tudjman launched a timely initiative. This period is probably  also characterized by the failure of the Geneva talks, which  contributed to reducing tensions toward us, for it finally  became obvious who does not want peace.  <H5>  "Help to Central Bosnia" </H5>   [Gugo] The latest round of the Geneva talks had been  announced quite optimistically, but there were no obvious  improvements. Why?    [Granic] There were many bilateral talks on various levels,  from peace mediators to foreign ministers. The Serbs were  expected to show more leniency and Alija Izetbegovic was  expected to show more determination to establish peace, which  did not happen. Simultaneously, two important things happened --  on one hand, Karadzic was inflexible regarding the agreement on  Sarajevo, thus triggering the rage of the international  community, and, on the other hand, Izetbegovic did not turn out  any better either. Refusing some rational solutions and  demanding more concessions, Izetbegovic brought the negotiations  to a dead end. What we have long been warning the international  community about has obviously finally come to the surface --  that a great Muslim offensive is imminent. Izetbegovic wants to  buy time and repeats demands to which we will never agree.    [Gugo] If the bilateral talks of the cochairmen of the  Geneva conference were cause for optimism, what has changed in  the meantime?    [Granic] At the first meeting, it was obvious that Milosevic  gave an election speech for the public in Serbia. That was the  main reason why no improvement was made. At the first plenary  session, Izetbegovic accused the entire international community  of being responsible for the suffering of his nation and for the  disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Already at that point it  was clear that no improvement was possible. At the second  meeting, Milosevic was pressured by threats of even stricter  sanctions, and he was much more prepared to talk. Karadzic was  the one who did not accept some solutions. We must not have any  illusions and view the two of them separately, for that was a  trick. In fact, they belong to one and the same Serbian side.  Alija Izetbegovic did not agree to some quite sensible and  realistic solutions. A very strong ministerial delegation  attempted to convince the Muslim side to accept sensible  solutions, but it did not succeed. We were not surprised by  that. We think that an agreement will soon be reached. On the  other side, the Muslims think that they can still gain something  by the military option and several factors are to their  advantage. The most important one is the insufficient threat of  the international community.    [Gugo] Can the Muslims achieve military victory in central  Bosnia?    [Granic] Croatian enclaves are in a very bad position and  helping them is one of our priority goals. The essence of our  strategy is the survival of the Croats in central Bosnia and  Sarajevo, and we need all the help we can get to realize that.  We expect -- and the same holds for the entire European Union  -- a Muslim state in which there will also be space for the  Croats, just as there will be space for the Muslims in the  Croatian republic. All of democratic Europe will support that  type of secular state, but no one, in these parts, wants a  fundamentalists county like that which some closest associates  of Alija Izetbegovic want to create.  <H5>  "We Will Not Give Neum" </H5>   [Gugo] Our public was very disturbed by the alleged proposal  of President Tudjman that the Muslims be given 5 km of the coast  at Prevlaka. What is the background of such a move?    [Granic] We offered the approach to the sea to the Muslims,  and that is something the international community asks from us.  However, they exclusively demand access to the sea. The Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina favored the creation of the union, i.e.  they wanted a reciprocal protection of rights within units in  the Union. It is well-known that the Serbs and the Muslims  signed an agreement on the referendum for the exclusion from the  Union. Such an act was accepted by the international community.  The Croats must be prepared for both options, both for the  disintegration and for the survival of the Union, but they will  not do anything to prejudice any solution. At one point, the  Muslims accepted the port on the Neretva River, a tourist  complex under joint administration in the area of Klek, and the  highway from Stolac to Neum. Afterwards, they expanded their  demand to require sovereignty over Neum, to which we will never  agree, for that would entail the dismembering of the Croatian  ethnic territory. The cochairmen proposed an exchange of  territory in the area of Prevlaka. President Tudjman left the  possibility open, but only in case of establishing a lasting  peace on the entire territory of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  As you see, there is no peace, and the Croats will not accept  being cut off at Neum.    [Gugo] Does such an option not lead us into the trap of  informally canceling resolutions that say that borders must not  be changed?    [Granic] There was talk of exchanging territories among  recognized and sovereign countries by agreement.    [Gugo] Can we expect to see the war end soon on occupied  territories of the Republic of Croatia?    [Granic] At the meeting of the European Union, Serbia  accepted the modus vivendi, which was publicly confirmed by  Minister Jovanovic. That means that we must first establish a  lasting cease-fire, and then open up communications. Then we  must organize the "London II" conference, which will solve the  questions of local autonomy. Only after that, at the "London  III" conference, provided that a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina  is found, lifting sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro would be  considered, as well as their inclusion into the international  community. Actually, we must implement Resolutions 847 and 871.  The Serbs are aware that the implementation of the peace plan  is, in practice, also tied to lifting sanctions. At the latest  session of the European Union, Russian Minister Churkin proposed  that lifting sanctions be tied only to the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which encountered serious resistance.  Indeed, he also proposed the immediate mutual recognition of  Serbia and Croatia and the establishment of diplomatic  relations. Lifting sanctions is, for us, totally unacceptable  before the establishment of lasting peace. The fact is that  Serbia is in the stage of preparing its own public to accept the  peace plan for Croatia.    [Gugo] How long could that last?    [Granic] Any kind of Cyprus syndrome is out of the question,  or the example of Germany, which waited for reunification for 50  years. We demand a dynamic process. Anyway, you can estimate  how long Milosevic can endure sanctions without serious social  upheaval.  <H5>  "Russia Is Not Against Croatia" </H5>   [Gugo] Is one justified in fearing that the arrival of  Greece at the head of the European Union will not contribute to  a rapid solution to the war crisis?    [Granic] That does not have to be true at all. The Greek  are not hiding their friendship with Serbia. We had many talks  with them and I believe that they, too, will see to it that the  war is over as soon as possible.    [Gugo] An extreme nationalist won the elections in Russia,  and he announced breaking the sanctions imposed on Serbia. Are  those threats founded and can they influence the present  situation?    [Granic] They cannot lift sanctions imposed on Serbia. At  the same time, a new constitution was introduced in Russia,  giving authority to President Yeltsin. On the other hand,  Zhirinovskiy is obviously not hiding his inclination toward  Serbia and the fact that they want to lift sanctions as soon as  possible. However, the view of official Russian politics does  not violate the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia.    [Gugo] Do you really believe that, in any variant, those who  pointed their weapons against Croatia, will allow two parts of  Croatia to be joined through the territory that they presently  control?    [Granic] UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] is here  to guarantee the success of that agreement. There are some  people who are against reaching and implementing any agreement.  Those are well-known facts. However, the position of Belgrade  is here most important, for everything depends on that. The  initiative of the European Union starts from the fact that  Belgrade is directly responsible for the situation in the UNPA  zones.    [Gugo] So, on one side, there is Milan Babic, who has had  conflicts with Belgrade and was disobedient before, and on the  other, UNPROFOR, which is totally incapable of doing anything  using force....    [Granic] With a clear stand of Belgrade regarding the UNPA  zones, UNPROFOR itself will act differently. Unfortunately,  even that does not guarantee the implementation of the peaceful  option and we must therefore strengthen our defense forces in  case the peace option is not possible.    [Gugo] That means that a military option is also being  considered?    [Granic] More precisely, we will not allow any calculations  or compromises with the Croatian territory. We will make no  concessions regarding that.    [Gugo] Prime Minister Valentic's economic program cannot be  realized without the integration of Croatia into European  institutions. What is the situation regarding that?    [Granic] It is true that we are interested in being granted  credit from the IMF, the World Bank, to enter the PHARE  [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program....  Signing the peace agreement will allow Croatia access to all  those institutions and we are capable of applying those programs  very soon. We will demand to begin talks on our membership of  European institutions, and we stand a good chance, for we  respect all set conditions. After all, we have fully complied  with everything we were asked to do regarding international  humanitarian law. Let us just look at how many convoys are  allowed free passage by the Croats, and what the Serb or the  Muslims did with the convoy headed to Nova Bila. Indeed, there  is an occasional act of sabotage, when we least need it.  Looking at the time of the events in Ahmici, Stupni Dol, or the  Old Bridge, it is obvious that those were sabotages against the  position of Croatia. And we will have to deal with that. The  Muslims committed many more terrible atrocities, but every  stupid move of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats costs us much more.  I do not intend to justify crimes done by some Croats, for they  cannot be justified and I condemn them, but I want to point out  that we went through many situations that were not to our  advantage. The Old Bridge in Mostar was destroyed at the time  when the image of Croatia in the world started to improve. The  world knows of our efforts to release prisoners. In the past 32  days, 284 convoys went through without any problem. The  international community expects us to behave like that, and,  whether some like it or not, we must respect international  humanitarian law. Our politics must be transparent and credible.  <H5>  "Changes at the Ministry" </H5>   [Gugo] Does that mean that we can soon expect Croatia to  become a member of European institutions?    [Granic] I believe that will mark the following year.  European integration processes are our primary goal. Moreover,  we would like to develop relations with major world powers and  try to establish good relations with countries of outstanding  economic development, like some Asian countries. We must also  think of our neighbors and fully define our mutual relations.  At the beginning of next year, there will be a ministerial  meeting with Italy, and I hope that some minor tensions will  disappear. We are especially interesting in developing good  relations with Slovenia. There are some problems, like Krsko  and Ljubljanska Banka, but expert groups are working and there  will probably have no problems in solving these to mutual  satisfaction. Regarding the Bay of Piran, I think that we have  not yet exhausted all means, and that must be done before the  arbitrage. Right after New Year, we will intensify our talks.    [Gugo] How much truth is there in rumors that we will soon  see some significant changes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?    [Granic] I do not know what precisely you are referring to,  but there will be some changes. According to the new law, our  Ministry will be organized, as it is customary in Europe, and  will have a state secretary, and some personnel changes have  already been made. We established a permanent financial expert  control in all embassies and consulates. From the month of  March, permanent post-graduate studies will begin for the  education of our personnel. We are working on improving the  communication network, which is one of the more important  factors in our Ministry. I believe that will contribute to  organizing a modern and efficient state ministry.</p>

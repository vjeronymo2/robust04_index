			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Federal Prime Minister Zeljko Simic </F> by Radio Valjevo correspondent Mirko Stojkanovic in Valjevo on  13 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Begin recording] [Stojkanovic] Deputy Federal Prime  Minister Zeljko Simic said this evening at the [Socialist Party  of Serbia] gathering in Valjevo that this is a crucial time for  resolving the (?economic) crisis and particularly the war in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  [FRY] can no longer view the world -- unfair though it is --  through the sights on a gun; it is time for it to intelligently  and wisely realize its strategic interests -- sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and citizens' liberties. Neither the  people nor the FRY political leadership will accept any  supporters of the war option. This was a chance to ask the  deputy federal prime minister just how close we are to peace,  what the agreement on the cessation of hostilities recently  signed in Geneva means, and what are the things that on one hand  bring us closer to, and on the other hand take us farther away  from the so desired peace?    [Simic] I would like to be extremely direct toward your  listeners and would say that we have taken a step forward,  because the coming month is going to test the behavior of all  three sides involved in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  with the clear hope that the Yugoslav leadership is investing in  the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs with the hope that it will  consistently adhere to the obligations taken in Geneva, and thus  show the international public that all of Serbhood [svekoliko  Srpstvo] favors peace rather than war, while the Muslim side --  which in the meantime has received immense support, both  military and political -- is the side -- and I am now going to  quote Mr. Alija Izetbegovic -- that will never agree to peace,  but will pursue the realization of its centuries-long dream of  creating a fundamentalist state on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina [sentence as heard]. Therefore, I believe  that this is a very important moment -- both tactically and  strategically speaking -- for the FRY and for all of Serbhood,  since the one-month cease-fire -- under the patronage of UN  secretary general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi -- is extremely  favorable because it allows the political positions and options  of all three sides involved in the war to crystallize, and on  the other hand enables the international public opinion to form  a balanced attitude toward Yugoslavia, and allows the full  expression of the truth about the foreign policy orientation and  the Yugoslav leadership's authentic option.    [Stojkanovic] The press is reporting that the armed  conflicts have been subsiding since the day the cease-fire went  into effect, but Alija Izetbegovic has told the Bosnian radio  that the Muslims -- if the West does not help them to resolve  the situation to their advantage -- will use a secret weapon.  He then mentioned the alliance with the Muslim countries  against the West. Does this take us farther away from peace?    [Simic] No. On the contrary, I believe that in a certain  sense this exposes -- the term is perhaps harsh but it is  fitting -- Mr. Alija Izetbegovic's position which the West has  been covering up for a long time. Therefore, it has been  covered up from the very beginning of the civil war, or more  precisely, since the Lisbon Conference which was held before the  civil war broke out, and when the Muslim side was offered a  settlement which was far more favorable than any of the ones  that followed. Of course, I am not gloating over this  statement, but I assess it as being politically very significant  because it exposes the intentions of the Muslim leadership under  Alija Izetbegovic, who, using the language of ultimatum,  continues to threaten. Moreover, he is now threatening his  recent or current allies, in a way that cannot be well received  by the international public.    [Stojkanovic] Mr. Simic, how would you assess the situation  that developed around FRY President Zoran Lilic's statement in  Novi Sad, that millions of FRY citizens cannot be hostages of  any political leader, either in the FRY, the Srpska republic, or  the republic of Serbian Krajina. This statement was later  followed by several statements, so we could even say that this  statement was to the disadvantage of the Srpska republic  negotiating team in Geneva. Is there danger of a conflict  developing between the two leaderships -- the Srpska republic  one and the FRY?    [Simic] FRY President Zoran Lilic's statement was an  extremely precise, direct, and I believe, politically extremely  wise. There was no way it could damage the Bosnian Serbs'  negotiating position in Geneva. In fact, it could only  strengthen it, insofar as the problem of the civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been artificially connected with  Yugoslavia's position. It has been artificially connected with  it insofar as the sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia without  any valid reasons. However, if this is the political reality,  then we must say that the interests of the people -- therefore,  the interests of all of Serbhood -- are above any willful  actions of any politician. There can be no comment on this. The  fact that the FRY president included himself among the potential  people who could -- through their actions -- disturb the  strategic goals of both this country and all of Serbhood, speaks  for the fact that there was no way that he could have been  attempting to fan or inspire any type of conflict. The  statement was given principally, with the aim of sobering both  the public and certain significant political individuals,  warning them that they could not place their personal interests,  or even their will, above the interests of primarily one state  that has its foundations, that is strong, that will be reborn  after the economic revival, that is on the way to being  reintegrated into the international community; therefore, no one  can play with this.

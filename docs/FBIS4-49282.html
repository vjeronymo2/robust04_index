			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (CNS) -- Governor of Anhui Mr. Fu  Xishou met the British ambassador to China Sir Robin McLaren  this afternoon and briefed him on economic development in the  province.    Mr. Fu told the British ambassador that reform and opening  to  the outside world had brought great development to the province.  Anhui has in recent years seen a greater economic and social  development. The gross national product (GDP) achieved in the  province grew by 17 percent in 1992. Economic exploitation in  Anhui went ahead at a rapid pace in 1993 and the GDP rose by 22  percent over the year before, ranking the province one of the  leading provinces in the country. He said that Anhui possessed  the conditions for economic development despite its geographical  location in the hinterland.    When asked by Sir Robin whether poverty still remained in  the  province, Mr. Fu frankly said that many rural areas within the  province had seen their living standard improved but some remote  mountain areas had not yet eliminated poverty and this involved  a population of nearly three million. Mr. Fu added that various  local governments were adopting measures to reverse the  backwardness in these areas.    The governor asked for overseas investment for better  exploitation in the province. He said that negotiations on 26  possible items for joint ventures was recently held with six of  them officially confirmed involving an investment value of up to  U.S.$100 million.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province, a  rising economic giant in south China, has achieved sustained  economic growth, a provincial government spokesman said here  today.    Addressing a news conference today, the spokesman said that  Guangdong scored a 15 percent increase in the gross domestic  product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- in  the first quarter of 1994.    He predicted that Guangdong's GDP will rise 16 percent in  the  first half of this year over the same period in 1993.    He cited the following figures to illustrate Guangdong's  rapid economic growth during the January-April period this year:    -- Industrial output value reached 125.3 billion yuan, up  22.5 percent;    -- Retail sales amounted to 51.86 billion yuan, a 32.5  percent increase, six percentage points higher than the nation's  average;    -- Exports soared 115 percent to 11.47 billion U.S. dollars;    -- Imports shot up 104 percent to 7.6 billion U.S. dollars;  and    -- Investments in fixed assets by state-owned enterprises  and  institutions totaled 21.6 billion yuan, up 40 percent, with  growth rate down 78 percentage points from the same period in  1993.    The spokesman said that the reform of the foreign trade  system had brought in a greater inflow of foreign investments  into Guangdong.    For example, Guangdong used a total of 4.09 billion U.S.  dollars in foreign funds in the first five months of 1994,  nearly 38 percent higher than in the same period last year.</p>

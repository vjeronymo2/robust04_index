			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Management: Acting the guru - John Cleese talks to Lucy Kellaway about his unlikely role of management trainer John Cleese is not your regular management guru. Gurus take themselves seriously, are pompous, present common sense as science and drop big names in business. By contrast, Cleese thinks the tricks of management are pretty obvious. He spends no time talking to businessmen, claiming he does not know any. He is as much the ordinary bloke as his towering fame will allow. He sits in his seriously rich Notting Hill house looking casual in a grey track suit, and is so adamant he knows nothing that his minder has to intervene. 'No, John,' she says, 'you are so perceptive. You look at a series of problems that are presented by a company, and your strength is saying I don't believe that is their problem, it is something deeper.' Her name is Tina Tietjen. Since she and a partner paid Pounds 50m in a management buy-out for his video training company, Video Arts, she has had a particular interest in selling Cleese's management skills. In this she has been supremely successful: Cleese, the British comedy actor who shot to fame with the Monty Python television series, has become the world's most popular management trainer. Millions of managers have watched him play the part of buffoon manager in training videos. In the US, thousands have flocked to hear him lecture on management, and many more thousands have paid Pounds 250 for a 30-minute video of the occasion. Even veteran guru Peter Drucker is not that big. Managers who have bought the videos are now buying the book. Co-written with his analyst Robyn Skynner, Life and How to Survive It coins the phrase 'healthy company', and argues that healthy companies resemble healthy families, only bigger. Management is an odd interest for a comic. How did it all begin? Cleese, as is now his way, immediately reaches for the psycho-analytical rather than the hysterical answer. It was because he was the only child of elderly parents and, therefore, was drawn towards teams, he begins. But surely it is a long way from being a lonely child to making training videos about how to make meetings more productive? 'Meetings with the Python team were a low-grade nightmare,' he says. 'So when someone asked me in 1976 to write a film about how to run an efficient meeting, I found it fascinating. And then once you've done one area you get interested in another and then there's an area in between.' Cleese lives by two of his central tenets: never to pretend he knows something when he does not, and to admit to making mistakes. This makes him frustratingly hard to pin down. 'People sometimes ask me what's going on in British industry and I say I don't know. There's no point pretending I do.' Tietjen starts to look anxious again and points out that John is a natural teacher. Cleese reluctantly admits that after giving his speech about the value of making mistakes he gets mobbed by managers saying: 'I wish you could tell my boss that.' The speech makes a distinction between 'the copper-bottomed mistakes like wearing a black bra under a white blouse' and those which are a fair try but just happen to be wrong. Does he think that people who have watched the videos have taken note? 'People who are quite reasonably healthy will learn things and will change,' he says, and as if to prove the point he cites a personal example. 'When I was first in showbiz I was frequently 10 minutes late for things. I realised that I was not leaving enough time to get there.' So he changed; simple as that. When Cleese admits to knowing anything, he puts it down to intuition. It is this that allows him to sort out a good team from a bad one. 'The first thing you notice is that you feel something isn't quite right. Then you do a bit of digging around to try to figure it out. If you use your intuition - which men in our society don't really use or trust very much - you can fairly easily see if people are communicating with each other in an open way, or if they both have hidden agendas.' He cites two recent films he has been involved in. One has been easy because everyone knew who was meant to be doing what. The other has been a dog's breakfast. 'You realise the thing is out of control, and everyone is making it up as they go along. I believe that if you can get egos out of the way, be straight with people, listen to what they say, it is amazing what can be achieved.' However this smooth-running, plain-dealing is not the norm. 'Most people try to create mythologies about themselves. They pretend they know when they don't know, get stuck in all these little acts.' Worst, he says, was Robert Maxwell, 'the most complete clown in Britain'. Cleese takes a dim view of most big businessmen: 'The sad thing about our culture is that it expects this sort of egotism from people at the top of companies. Their behaviour is very like five-year-olds. It is only the powerful people who can get away with it, and because they are so visible, they are seen as heros.' It is not just the big bosses who are inadequate. Many people are not in good enough psychological nick to be ready for the healthy company he and Skynner describe. 'A lot of people are not going to like it,' he says. 'If you want to go into a healthy company you better be fairly healthy yourself. If you come from a very distrustful, manipulating family and go into an organisation where people are open with each other it would drive you mad.' The difference between a healthy and unhealthy company, he and his shrink have figured out, is confidence. 'Not the bloated, sticking chest out strutting around confidence,' he says, his words creating a rare glimpse of the old manic Cleese. The confidence is the quiet confidence of a batsman. And how should companies acquire it? Not for the first time, he says: 'I don't know.'</p>

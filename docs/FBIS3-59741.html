			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric completed a synchrotron  radiation (SR) device which is being considered for use in  future generation semiconductor etching. The device was  completed in its Central Research Institute in Itami City. This  type of device is being put into use only by a limited number of  corporations, such as IBM in America and NTT. Currently, the  major domestic semiconductor manufacturers are using other  equipment at the national research institutes. It appears that  the use of this facility will greatly accelerate Mitsubishi  Electric's development of future generation semiconductors.    By using electromagnets, the SR device deflects the orbit of  high energy electrons accelerated nearly up to the speed of  light and produces highly intense linear SR in a direction  tangential to the orbit. The equipment consists of a LINAC  [linear accelerator] device to produce electrons; a synchrotron  to accelerate the electrons; and a superconducting SR ring which  produces radiation.    The SR facility developed and brought into use by Mitsubishi  Electric is a device that has the distinguishing features of  being compact and low cost for industrial use. In particular,  Mitsubishi succeeded in reducing the circumference of the  electron beam orbit in the recently completed superconducting SR  ring from more than 10 meters in conventional types to 9.2  meters, making it the smallest compact model in the world. The  amount of liquid helium consumption has been reduced to 3 liters  per hour which is a fraction of the quantity used in  conventional facilities.    It is estimated the entire cost of the synchrotron facility  is several billions of yen. Mitsubishi Electric's person in  charge of semiconductor development sees the possibility of the  economic feasibility of using the SR facility in real  semiconductor plants (because SR from a single SR unit can be  simultaneously supplied to a maximum number of 20 processing  units.)    It is expected that the SR will be used for DRAM (Dynamic  Random Access Memory) chips in the 256 megabit--1 gigabit range.  Hitachi Ltd. and other big semiconductor makers, using the  equipment at the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics,  Ministry of Education, are advancing in research and  development. Mitsubishi Electric is using the SR from the  completed SR facility to begin the development of semiconductors  within the company and is planning to promote the marketing of  the SR equipment.</p>

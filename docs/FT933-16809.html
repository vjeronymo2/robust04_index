			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: France Telecom bucks trend with surge to FFr3.3bn FRANCE-TELECOM, the state-controlled telecommunications group, bucked the gloomy trend in French industry by reporting a healthy increase in net profits, from FFr2bn in 1991 to FFr3.3bn (Dollars 570m) last year. The group, which claims to be the world's fourth largest telecommunications concern, ahead of the UK's British Telecom, saw consolidated sales rise 5.9 per cent from FFr115.8bn in 1991 to FFr122.6bn in 1992. Operating profits increased by 5.6 per cent over the same period, to FFr30.2bn last year. One of the main reasons for the improvement in France-Telecom's performance was the progress of its debt reduction programme. The group managed to reduce its net debt from FFr120.6bn at the end of 1991 to FFr111.6bn by the same stage in 1992. This reduction cut its financial costs from 9.7 per cent of turnover to 8.4 per cent. France-Telecom said it planned to reduce its debt further in 1993. Its hopes to meet its target of trimming financial costs to 7 per cent of turnover next year. The increase in net profits also reflects France-Telecom's productivity strategy. The group reduced its workforce from 156,100 to 155,300 last year. It also continued its policy of investing 4 per cent of turnover in research and development. Credit National, the French corporate banking group, is considering taking minority stakes in some of the state-controlled companies due to be sold in the government's privatisation drive. Mr Yves Lyon-Caen, chairman, yesterday said his group would be particularly interested in striking cross-shareholding agreements with suitable partners.</p>

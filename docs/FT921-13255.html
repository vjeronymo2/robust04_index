			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour says Britain's recession 'worst in EC' - Prime Minister's Questions LABOUR attempted yesterday to demolish repeated government claims that the present recession was international in scope, contrasting the shrinking British economy with growth in other European countries. The government hit back with a fresh assault on Labour's taxation and spending pledges. According to Mr John Major, the prime minister, the implication of such pledges was that either borrowing would rise to 'unprecedented' levels or taxes would be increased 'to a quite remarkable extent'. During a rowdy session of prime minister's questions, Mr Major said that Labour's policies would ensure 'a longstanding and deep recession in this country'. Labour had been 'rumbled' on its spending and tax plans and did not like it, he said. He denied that recessionary conditions were confined purely to Britain. Almost every industrialised country was experiencing 'economic problems', he said. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, attacked Britain's relative economic performance, claiming it was the worst in the Community in terms of unemployment, investment and production. While other European countries were growing, Britain's economy was 'shrinking' by 2 per cent, he said. That theme was also pursued at an earlier Labour press conference, when the party cited figures showing that business closures were running at 2,225 a week last year. 'All the figures which should be going up are still going down,' said Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary. 'All those that should be going down, including inflation, are still going up.' Budget submissions sent to the Treasury by industrialists showed overwhelming support for investment tax allowances, Mr Brown said, but ministers had ruled out such incentives. Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office junior minister, last night accused Labour MPs of making 'inflammatory' charges that the Asylum Bill to deter bogus applicants for political asylum in Britain was motivated by racist and electoral considerations. The Bill was given a third reading by a government majority of 82 (298-216) and now goes to the Lords.</p>

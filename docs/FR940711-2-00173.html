The HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will, wherever practicable, consider needs being met by all Federally assisted rental housing programs, including the FmHA Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program, but will, as a minimum, consider assistance provided under the Rental Voucher Program, the Rental Certificate Program, other Section 8 Programs, and the Public or Indian Housing Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with Notice PIH 91&hyph;45 (HUD), the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will notify FmHA of applications it receives and ask that FmHA provide advisory comments concerning the market for additional assisted housing or the possible impact the proposed units may have on FmHA projects. Applications for which FmHA has provided comments expressing concerns about market need or the continued stability of existing FmHA projects, with which HUD agrees, will receive zero points for this criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) Rating and Assessment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To receive points under this criterion, an application must propose funding in an area which has been previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underfunded or proportionately funded relative to the need for housing in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same allocation area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assignment of points is based on the degree to which the needs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the primary area specified in the application have been underfunded, taking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income renter households with housing problems. The determination of point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values will be based on a comparison of the percentage of housing need served  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the primary area specified in the application to the percentage of need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> served in the allocation area since the 1990 census. The percentages for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation areas and the primary areas are to be rounded to the nearest whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

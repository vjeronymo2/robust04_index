			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Bank charges probe demanded - At a Glance Nigel Griffiths, the Labour party's consumer spokesman, this week called on Michael Heseltine, Conservative trade and industry secretary, to investigate banks' charges after revelations that Royal Bank of Scotland has put staff on an incentive scheme to maximise revenue from charges to customers. Performance Plus was introduced on a trial basis from February to April and sets a target for each branch to raise its collection of charges for items such as returning 'bounced' cheques. Each branch has a second target to increase the number of customers opening savings accounts. Employees at a branch which meets one of the two targets will receive Pounds 40 a quarter, and those at a branch which meets both will get Pounds 100. Royal Bank of Scotland said it had identified a 'significant amount of leakage' caused by staff failing to impose standard charges. The Consumers' Association said that the news was worrying given the number of mistakes made by banks on customers' statements.</p>

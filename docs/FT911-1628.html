			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: US insurers find the going tough THE TOUGH climate facing US insurers on their home territory was amply demonstrated in first-quarter results from three large companies yesterday. American International Group, the New York-based group which writes a broad range of insurance cover, reported net income up to Dollars 375.4m (Pounds 218.7m) from Dollars 355.7m in the three month-period, but with earnings per share only ahead by 1.7 per cent, at Dollars 1.76. The company conceded that there were 'continuing difficulties in many segments of the domestic property-casualty industry', although it remained more cheerful about the longer-term outlook. Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, said: 'We have sharply curtailed our exposure in some classes of business where industry results have been extremely poor, including workers' compensation'. He cited the decision to stop writing new workers compensation business in Texas - at least temporarily - as one example. This, he said, contributed to flat premium growth in the quarter, with worldwide general insurance premiums written totalling Dollars 2.24bn in the quarter. Elsewhere, AIG - which said yesterday that it was part of an 'investment group' that is considering taking a stake in troubled US mutual insurer, Equitable Life - reported more encouraging trends. It said that speciality lines did well, while overseas the general insurance and life insurance businesses 'had very good results'. Results from the financial services division were also described as 'excellent'. The net income figure is scored after realised capital gains of Dollars 23.6m, halved from last time's Dollars 49.2m. Operating income from the general insurance operations rose by 13.1 per cent, and from the life side by 12 per cent. At USF&amp;G, the troubled Baltimore-based composite which is engaged in a major restructuring and has seen management changes recently, there was a first quarter net loss of Dollars 55m, against a Dollars 51m profit last time. However, USF&amp;G said that part of the damage resulted from a further Dollars 21m of restructuring charges, plus Dollars 20m for an unanticipated involuntary National Workers Reinsurance Pool assessment. After bearing the brunt of these two charges, the property-casualty side made a net loss of Dollars 15m. The life side broke even in the quarter, but there was a small loss from investment management. The net earnings figure came after nil realised gains on investments, compared with a Dollars 13m surplus in the previous year. General Re, meanwhile, saw net income edge upwards from Dollars 147.1m to Dollars 150.4m in the first quarter. Realised gains increased slightly, from Dollars 12m to Dollars 15.3m. Earnings per share stood at Dollars 1.70 (Dollars 1.64). The company, the largest reinsurance company in the US, said that the reinsurance market had remained competitive, but that it had managed 'moderate expansion', with retentions and pricing remaining stable.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1100 GMT on 25 February in its  regular 15-minute newscast carries several reports on the  situation in the republic.    Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "the Chetniks are  mindlessly attacking, obviously planning it to be do or die in  their blitzkrieg in which they plan to occupy the right bank of  the Una. Therefore, they are bringing in fresh manpower and  military hardware." Sadikovic says that "during last evening as  well as in the early morning hours, the artillery was destroying  Bihac, Cazin, and their suburbs. Several civilians have been  injured and the material damage is huge. There is no peace  along the separation lines with the remainders of the  paramilitary of the so-called Kladusa autonomy. After operating  at [word indistinct], the commune of Cazin, provocations  continued at other parts of the separation lines."    Hajrudin Sermic describes the situation in Maglaj as  "extremely dramatic. The attacks by Chetniks and Ustashas on  Maglaj are increasing by the minute and the encirclement is  tightening more and more. Everything that the aggressor  possesses is being used today; helicopters are flying over in an  unperturbed manner carrying out combat activity with guided  missiles on our fighters' positions. Tanks are coming ever  closer to the town and trucks and transport vehicle are  constantly bringing in manpower reinforcements. All this is  taking place at a (?critical) line of the (?Ploca)-Plana section  on the northern section with the generous aid of Ustashas  dressed up in Chetnik uniforms. Many of them have been  recognized and the [word indistinct] traffic of Chetniks and  Ustashas speaks of their coordinated action. There are some  dead fighters on our side and tanks are rolling over their  bodies. On behalf of 35,000 civilians of this town, we demand  that UNPROFOR forces enter Maglaj urgently and immediately and  prevent an unprecedented catastrophe."</p>

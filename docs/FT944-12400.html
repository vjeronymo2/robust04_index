			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / MPs to consider investigation of Guardian editor Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, faces an investigation by MPs into the newspaper's use of a doctored Commons letterhead during its inquiries into the payment of a Cabinet minister's hotel bill. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday cleared the way for an emergency Commons debate today, which is expected to lead to a vote on whether the newspaper should be the subject of a privileges committee probe. Her decision came after prime minister's questions, when former Tory ministers led a sustained assault on Mr Preston and the activities of investigative journalists. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'If it is commonly accepted in journalism that the end justifies any means, then I believe journalism will regret stooping to that particular standard.' Meanwhile, Labour MPs on the privileges committee rejoined the body for a private session to try to break the procedural deadlock over its 'cash-for-questions' inquiry. The seven had boycotted the hearings over the government's insistence that they be held in private. The committee broke up without resolving whether its inquiry would be conducted entirely in private. Sir Paul Beresford, the housing minister who is the latest target of press allegations, strongly denied any wrongdoing over combining government duties with part-time work as a dentist. Yesterday's developments at Westminster came as solicitors acting for Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods, wrote to Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, to call for an urgent decision on whether he would face criminal charges for his alleged attempts to 'blackmail' the government. Mr Major told MPs last week that an unnamed intermediary had made allegations against several ministers and requested a meeting between the prime minister and Mr Fayed to discuss the DTI report into his takeover of House of Fraser, Harrods' parent company. Today's debate is expected to be on a motion calling for The Guardian's actions to be investigated by the privileges committee. Announcing the debate to MPs yesterday, Miss Boothroyd said the 'essential' issue to be covered was: 'The alleged action of The Guardian newspaper in representing that a letter sent by it to the Ritz hotel in Paris was sent in the name of a member of this house.' The newspaper has admitted using a doctored Commons letterhead to seek details of a minister's bill incurred at the hotel, which is owned by Mr Fayed. Miss Boothroyd's decision followed an investigation by Sir Alan Urwick, Serjeant at Arms, ordered by her on Monday. Mr Major said MPs had a right to expect the highest standards from the press just as it demanded the highest standards from parliament.</p>

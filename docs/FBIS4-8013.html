			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 8 (ATA) -- In his interview with the  Greek agency ANA, President Berisha expressed the belief that  the Albanian-Greek relations will be further promoted in the  future.    "Albania and Greece have overcome crisis and are improving  relations following the visit of the Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias to Albania.... I believe that the strengthening of  the identity of the minority and their integration are very  important issues and should be carried forward. The Albanians  do not hate the minority people. They respect them. For this  reason, I believe that the Albanian-Greek relations will be  further promoted in the future.    The great number of the Albanian emigrants in Greece and the  existence of a Greek minority in Albania should serve as a  strong link between the two countries, he added.    The situation regarding the rights of the Greek minority has  been improved considerably after the days of communist regime,  President Berisha said and vowed to respect them fully,  including education, as envisaged in the charter of Copenhagen.    Regarding the status of the Orthodox Church in Albania, he  appreciated the performance of Archbishop Anastas, but  considered unfair the previous insistence of the Greek  Government on appointing the clergies in his own country.    In Albania, he added, the church is independent of the state  and any ethnic Greek can be elected to any post in the church.    Commenting on the relations between Greece and The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), President Berisha said  he does not support the Greek severe actions against FYROM and  considered the achievement of a compromise as possible. The  countries in the region "must understand that peace is very  important not only for the two countries but for all the others  in the region."    He denied that Albania seeks either to (?destabilize or) to  recompile the Balkan map through violence. He favours  discussion for a solution to the problem of the ethnic Albanian  in Kosova as well Albania's membership to the European Union.    The presence of the Americans, Berisha said, is an important  factor for the European stability.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: FOR KIDS;  </P> <P> FURNITURE FANTASIES  </P> <P> THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM with the Vienna Children's Museum Furniture  Collection: Kids may have a hard time keeping their parents away from it. Guy  Cnop, owner of Linea-Ligne Roset, says he's been playing with the colorful  furniture since the day it arrived at his shop.  </P> <P> The pegboard-like pieces (recommended for children ages 2 through 8) were  developed by E. Warlamis, a Greek architect living in Austria. The line,  exhibited at the Vienna Museum of Applied Arts, features three chairs ($112 to  $119) in the shapes of a hill, a house and a tree; a house cupboard ($468), and  a crescent-shape desk ($171). These are accompanied by an architecture game set  ($38) composed of 20 simple forms -- cubes, semicircles, cones, clouds, a tree  and a bird -- that children use to create unique environments by inserting them  (with pegs) into the perforated furniture. Children become landscapers and  urban planners, and the variety of their fantasy domains is limitless: from  bucolic scenes of rolling hills, clouds and medieval castles to futuristic  cities of skyscrapers, tunnels and rockets.  </P> <P> The pieces are available in either natural pine or bright red, yellow and  green. Chairs come in two seat heights (about 12 inches and 14 inches) and can  support the weight of an adult -- just in case.  </P> <P>  The Vienna Children's Museum Furniture Collection is sold at Linea-Ligne  Roset, 8840-A Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 273-5425.  </P> <P> BARBARA THORNBURG  </P></p>

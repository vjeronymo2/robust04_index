			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Warsaw grouper and speckled hind are rare and overfished. The Council recognizes that most harvest of warsaw and speckled hind is bycatch and that survival of released individuals is low. However, the Council is following stock rebuilding guidelines with regard to these species. The Council received public testimony that some fishermen may target these species at certain times during the year. The Council proposed the prohibition on sale to reduce directed fishing mortality, but allowed retention of one warsaw and one speckled hind per vessel per trip to minimize waste. Fishermen are encouraged to donate these fish to ``good causes,'' such as charitable organizations. Many marine species in the United States are subject to restrictions on sale, either seasonally or geographically. Both the market and law enforcement agencies have adjusted accounting procedures and other practices to implement such restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Partial Disapproval of Amendment 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 5, 1994, the Regional Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), partially disapproved Amendment 6. Specifically, the Regional Director disapproved Action 12 of the amendment, which would have required all permitted vessels to maintain and submit vessel logbooks. The Regional Director believes that the methods of obtaining necessary management data and the appropriate sampling system for such data are determinations properly made by NMFS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations at 50 CFR 646.5(a) require vessel logbooks to be maintained and submitted by all vessels fishing for wreckfish and for other permitted vessels selected by the Science and Research Director, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS. Currently all permitted vessels are selected to maintain and submit logbooks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vessel logbooks provide catch and effort data, which the Council believes are needed for quota monitoring, stock assessments, catch histories, and indications of shifts in fishing effort. NMFS agrees that catch and effort data via logbooks are needed for all of these purposes except for quota monitoring. In the snapper-grouper fishery, NMFS has chosen to use dealer reports for quota monitoring rather than vessel logbooks. These collections of information have been approved previously under Office of Management and Budget control numbers 0648&hyph;0016 (logbooks) and 0648&hyph;0013 (dealer reports). NMFS agrees with the Council that good and sufficient reasons continue to exist for the current requirement that all permitted vessels maintain and submit vessel logbooks. Accordingly, NMFS intends to continue to select all permitted vessels to maintain and submit logbooks. When NMFS believes that the 100-percent level of submission is no longer required, it will reduce the percentage of vessels required to maintain and submit logbooks, without the necessity of amending the FMP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes From the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a consequence of the partial disapproval of Amendment 6, discussed above, the proposed change to &sect;646.5(a)(1) is not included in this final rule and the proposed change to &sect;646.5(d) introductory text is modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regional Director determined that Amendment 6 is necessary for the conservation and management of the snapper-grouper fishery and that it is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law, with the exception of the measure that would have required all permitted vessels to maintain and submit vessel logbooks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (initial RFA) for this action. The initial RFA has been adopted as final without change. The final RFA concludes that this final rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as summarized in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commercial vessel trip limits established in &sect;646.25 of this final rule are intended to prolong the commercial seasons for snowy grouper and golden tilefish under the newly established commercial quotas. Prolonging the seasons will have considerable economic benefits for the fisheries. Delay in implementing these trip limits will reduce significantly the potential benefits. However, immediate implementation might adversely affect commercial fishermen when this final rule is published because they may be at sea. Accordingly, to maximize the potential economic benefits of the trip limits without undue adverse effect on fishermen now on fishing trips, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds for good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act that the effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;646.25 should not be delayed beyond 10 days from the date of publication of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 646  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles Karnella, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 646 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 646_SNAPPER-GROUPER FISHERY OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

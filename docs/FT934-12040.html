			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Guardian Group in talks to raise further finance GUARDIAN Group, the USM-quoted building and environmental services company formerly known as Associated Energy Services, is in discussions to raise further finance, said Mr John Broad, the chairman. Its potential could only be realised if it acquired adequate funds both for future growth and to deal with 'the remaining difficulties of the past', he added. At the same time the company announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 420,103 for the seven months to June 30 1992. For all of 1991 there were losses of Pounds 840,098. Mr Broad said he would inform shareholders of the results for the year to June 30 1993 'at the earliest possible date.' The company continued to survive only because of the support given by its main shareholder, Guardian Foundations, he said. The shares lost 1 1/4 p to 7 3/4 p. Attributable losses came through at Pounds 388,345 (Pounds 1.26m), a rise from the unaudited accounts because of a further loss relevant to Clevedon Homes, audit fees, redundancy and reorganisation costs and inter-company write-offs. Losses per share were 0.36p (0.89p for 12 months).</p>

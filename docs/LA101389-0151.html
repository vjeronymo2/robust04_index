			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIETERS' TOP CONCERN IS FITNESS, SURVEY SHOWS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: MOST PEOPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY, AS THROUGHOUT THE U.S., USED TO EAT LESS  TO LOOK GOOD, BUT THESE DAYS THEY ARE CUTTING DOWN TO FEEL GOOD.  </P> <P> Today's dieters are shedding pounds primarily to improve their health, not to  improve their looks -- a reversal of the reasons for losing weight five years  ago, a recent Orange County survey reveals.  </P> <P> The survey, conducted by Weight Watchers of Orange County, appears to reflect  the public's growing awareness that being overweight can contribute to heart  disease and other health problems, a spokeswoman said Thursday.  </P> <P> The survey, which was conducted in September among 535 Weight Watcher clients,  asked the question, "What is your main reason for losing weight?" The answer  given most often -- by 22% -- was to improve health. Five years ago, in the  same survey, health ranked third -- or 13% -- among the dieters. In last  month's survey, losing weight to improve appearance ranked fourth out of five  reasons, while five years ago, that was the most-often mentioned reason.  </P> <P> "When we conducted the last similar survey, people seemed more concerned with  how they were perceived by others. They desired to lose weight for more  external reasons," said Kathleen Roberto, public information director for the  Weight Watchers of Orange County. "Today there seems to be more of a  consciousness of health. Appearance is taking a back seat."  </P> <P> Roberto attributed the change in attitude to the emphasis placed on fitness and  health by American society, along with Weight Watchers' health programs and  with recent reports that link obesity to a number of ailments, including heart  disease.  </P> <P> After health, increasing energy and stamina ranked second among reasons for  losing weight (17%), according to the recent survey. Taking more control of  one's life (15%), improving appearance (14%) and increasing self-esteem (9%)  rounded out the rest of the answers.  </P> <P> Five years ago, the reasons were improving appearance (21%), pleasing spouse or  others (13%), improving health (13%), advancing career (12%) and taking control  of one's life (7%).  </P> <P> "I do have a feeling that society's leaning toward health issues has played a  part in the change of attitudes," Roberto said. "In the '80s, people were more  interested in career advancement and personal appearance. But in the coming  decade, health and family issues are being stressed. People are more concerned  with intrinsic influences, rather than a desire to please others."  </P> <P> Diane Parr agrees with that. Thirteen years ago, the 42-year-old woman from  Orange began her up-and-down battle to shed pounds, but she was not successful  until she decided she wanted to lose weight not to look better, but to feel  better.  </P> <P> "I just noticed such a change in how I felt when I began eating the right  foods, and even in how I looked, as far as my complexion was concerned, after  drinking the recommended amount of water," Parr said. "I was constantly losing  20 pounds, then gaining 25 back, until I started actually eating the right  foods and exercising for my body's health sake."  </P> <P> Marilyn Schnabel of Tustin admits that changing her attitude about weight loss  made dropping the pounds and keeping a healthly heart much easier.  </P> <P> "It just gets to a point when you realize that your body isn't going to last  forever," Schnabel said. "So you start cutting down on the sugar and the fatty  foods and start trying to do many different exercises to aid your condition."  </P></p>

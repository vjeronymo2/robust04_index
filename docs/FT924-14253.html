			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: Bargains across the water - Sterling may have slumped against the dollar, but buying from the US still makes sense if you know what you want AS THE dollar, the pound and the yen, not to mention the lira, the peseta and the escudo zig-zag . . . sorry, float . . . around the world's markets, those who keep their wits about them and move fast will find that there are spectacular bargains to be had. Now that credit cards, faxes and answering machines are an established part of most commercial life there is hardly a country in the world, or an hour in the day, when the shopaholic is out of danger. From a sitting-room in the Outer Hebrides, a farmhouse in Wagga Wagga or even a hut in Timbuktu, goodies can be summoned from Bloomingdales in Manhattan, discount stores in the mid-West of the US, from emporia in Singapore, boutiques in Hong Kong. All you need is your flexible friend and a telephone or fax. The most accessible market of all to those of us who live in Britain is the US, where a sophisticated infrastructure of toll-free phones, credit card friendliness and a culture of making shopping care-free means it is almost as easy to shop in Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit as London, Edinburgh or Reading. The man who has done most of the legwork for those who fancy taking advantage of lower US prices without forking out the air fare is Richard McBrien, whose pamphlet, Buying Direct From the USA, is the bible of the business. A new edition is published this week. Apart from the list of mail order companies, with their telephone numbers (some toll-free), he also gives British equivalents of American clothes and shoes sizes, electric voltages, and a rundown of shipping costs, insurance, duty and VAT. Though the palmy days of the two-dollar pound are for the moment past (as I write it stands at Dollars 1.69) McBrien is still convinced that, for whole categories of goods, buying from the US makes sense. Those who travel frequently to the US will already have wondered at the low prices of clothing, sportswear (golf clubs, tennis balls, tennis racquets, ski-wear are half price or less compared with the UK), cameras, CDs, electronics and computers, but there are other good buys. Contact lenses, for instance, are light and easy to post - you can just fax your prescription to the National Contact Lens Center, Santa Rosa Optometry Center, 3527 Bonita Vista Drive, Santa Rosa, CA 95404. A colleague bought a French horn from Giardinellis of 7845 Maltlage Drive, Liverpool, NY 13090. (tel: 315 652 4792; fax: 315 652 4534) for about half the UK price, and though shipping would have added to the cost (he brought it home himself) he still reckons it was an exceptionally good buy. Certain cult names such as Patagonia have only limited distribution in the UK so those who want goods that are not yet in the shops might like to browse through the full brochure - beware, though, that the prices which seem so cheap at first do not look so attractive when postage, duty and VAT are added. Rayban Wayfarers sunglasses, another cult item in certain circles, sell for something like Pounds 69 in the UK but cost Dollars 60 in the US and have the advantage of being easy to post. Another attraction is the chance to buy items which are not available over here at all - things such as Sheplers Western goods, shirts, mountaineering, skiing and other outdoor gear. Then there are more esoteric goods such as woodworking tools (but beware that electrical goods may not work in the UK unless the voltage can be switched) or model kits which, according to McBrien, are particularly well-priced in the US. And for those who cannot live without a 'liquid gold sizzling jumpsuit', Bloomingdales will sell you one for just Dollars 135. The best value of all turned out to be goods such as computers and software. A Microsoft Word for Windows software package costs the equivalent of about Pounds 188 when ordered from Express Technology. With a Pounds 9 postage and packing charge but no duty added it works out at well under half the average retail price in the UK of Pounds 395. As an exercise we rang many of the companies listed in the third edition of McBrien's Buying Direct From The USA. We were often faced with answer machines (he has excellent advice on how to telephone as economically as possible) and, more often than not, an agreement to send a catalogue was not followed by action, so you need to persevere. Mail order companies come and go and telephone numbers change, which is why McBrien aims to update his pamphlet every six weeks. The big established companies such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales or Patagonia were, as a rule, more efficient than the less established names. Of many items that we checked out, it emerged that though initial savings seem to be huge, the cost of postage and packing, insurance and duty can make it uneconomical after all. So remember you should not do it all on automatic pilot - you should watch the dollar's movement against the pound and do some careful arithmetic before deciding if it is worth it. A reader who got carried away by the LL Bean catalogue and ordered three turtleneck sweaters (two for the knock-down bargain price of Dollars 8) and a pair of trousers for a total of Dollars 78 (Pounds 43.80) found that shipping via Federal Express cost Dollars 35. 'When the goods arrived,' her letter goes on, 'Federal Express required a payment of Pounds 21.37 for import duty and VAT, an amount which I thought extraordinary considering the dollar value of the goods. On calling Federal Express for an explanation, I was told that the total value of goods and shipping, ie Dollars 113, was converted to Pounds 62.94. Duty at 14 per cent was calculated on this amount. The duty was then added, bringing a total of Pounds 71.75, and VAT at 17.5 per cent was imposed.' She adds ruefully: 'The clothes were probably still good value, largely due to the sale price for the turtlenecks, but I am not sure if I will be ordering anything further unless there are some changes to the charges levied.' Buying Direct from the USA by Richard McBrien costs Pounds 12.95 and can be ordered from Running Heads International, Grove House, 82 East Dulwich Grove, London SE22 8TW. Telephone and fax 071-738-4096. Coming in January is International Shopping - yearly subscription of Pounds 45 or Pounds 3.50 an issue - which will cover the rest of the world - invaluable for those who want presents delivered to cousins in Australia, friends in Hong Kong or mothers in Canada. Just 'phone, quote your credit card number and the present can be on its way. If you do not want to write or ring each company directly an organisation called Shop the World by Mail, PO Box 5549, Cary, North Carolina 27512, USA; Fax 1-(919) 481-9369; will, for a fee, send you the catalogues from almost every country in the world.

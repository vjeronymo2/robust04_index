			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 22, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis met Tuesday [22 March] with the country's 14-member  delegation that reached the March 15 troop withdrawal agreement  with Russia.    The group discussed the recent public opinion poll on the  troop withdrawal and the prolonged functioning of the former  Soviet radar at Skrunda in Latvia.    According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents want Russia  to withdraw the Skrunda base together with the other remaining  troops.    The situation may have two explanations -- either the people  really protest the signature of like agreements or they lack  information on what the favorable solution of the problem could  give to Latvia. The participants of the meeting agreed that the  government should work to better inform the public about its  work and intentions.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets FRANKFURT Results are due from two defensive stocks, Henkel in household goods on Monday and Gehe in pharmaceuticals on Wednesday. The Estimate Directory registers consensus forecasts of a fall of 3 per cent each in earnings per share for 1993 but looks for much bigger things from the building and construction group, Bilfinger &amp; Berger, from which an earnings lift of 66 per cent is expected - although analysts are more circumspect about 1994. The average prediction is an earnings rise of only 2 per cent AMSTERDAM First-quarter figures come from Amev, the insurance company, and Fortis, the financial services group, on Thursday. Hoare Govett estimates Amev's net income will rise 9 per cent to Fl 118m, and earnings per share 8 per cent to Fl 1.66. The brokers say the consolidation of the Belgian banking and insurance group, ASLK, for the first time will have a large impact on Fortis's net income. MILAN Today begins the last full week of the June account and investors will probably be holding back liquidity for the cash calls over the July and August accounts from Mediobanca and Ifil, and the privatisation of INA. Brokers expect volume to remain low and the Comit index to trade between 700 and 750 over the summer. HELSINKI Finnish equities were lifted last week by a 136 per cent jump in operating profits at Nokia, the electronics and industrial conglomerate. Traders are hoping that progress reports this week will extend the process: on Monday, from KOP, Finland's leading commercial bank; on Tuesday from Huhtamaki, the consumer products combine; and on Friday from Instrumentarium, which divides into health care, optical retailing, catering equipment and electronics distribution. TOKYO Enthusiasm for last week's breakthrough, with the Nikkei 225 index clearing the 21,000 mark in high volume, receded slightly on Thursday and Friday and left sentiment nicely balanced. Most traders were optimistic by the weekend, but there was general agreement that domestic institutions and individual investors were far from ready to return to the market as net buyers.</p>

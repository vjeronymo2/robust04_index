			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chang Weimin] </F>   [Text] Recently improved conditions ensure that large  petroleum resources in the inland provinces of Shaanxi and  Sichuan will be developed quickly, according to a senior  petroleum official.    Highlighting the development are operations in the northern  part of Shaanxi Province, where blocks totaling 40,000 square  kilometres contain an estimated 1 billion tons of oil.    Preparations for development in Sichuan Province have also  been progressing, according to executives with the China  National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), which oversees on-shore oil  operations.    In an interview, a senior official with the CNPC specified  the improved conditions in northern Shaanxi:        -  Better relations between State-chartered oil firms and  regional operators. The relations necessary for quick  development were cemented by an agreement signed early this  month by CNPC and provincial authorities. The agreement binds  the CNPC and governments and enterprises in the province to join  together to accelerate oil development. They will also  co-operate to beef up protection of oil resources. Before long,  the official said, millions of tons of oil are expected to be  produced in the region each year. A large portion of the output  is to be pumped by joint operations involving the CNPC, regional  authorities and enterprises.    -  The availability of technology for  developing oil there. Petroleum development started in the  330,000-square-kilometre Shaan-Gan-Ning Basin 90 years ago, but  only 2 percent of the resources has been recovered because of  inadequate technology.    -  Enough evidence of easy drilling for oil  lies only 500 to 1,500 metres underground, compared with several  times that depth elsewhere in the country.        With the newly signed agreement, the CNPC official said,  long-awaited large oilfields will be built in the area before  long.    Over the past 18 months, hundreds of work units have rushed  to drill wells there to extract oil that legally belongs to the  State. These work units, inexperienced in oil operations, sought  quick profits and had no long-term commitment to protecting the  resources.    Their operations were inefficient and hindered overall  planning, the official said.</p>

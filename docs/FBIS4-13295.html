			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F> unidentified correspondents at the Presidential Palace in B'abda  on 19 Apr--recorded]    [Text] [Samahah] At the invitation of his excellency the  president of the Republic, after his agreement with the prime  minister, the Council of Ministers held an extraordinary meeting  in the Presidential Palace in B'abda this evening.    The Council of Ministers was informed in detail of the  circumstances surrounding the assassination of Shaykh Talib  Suhayl in his home. There was an appropriate investigation into  the crime, evidence was found, and testimony was taken.    As shown in the minutes of the meeting between the Iraqi  charge d'affaires, at his request, with defendants Khalid 'Ulwan  Khalaf and Muhammad Faris Kadhim in the presence of the Beirut  police commander and his two aides, the two defendants confessed  that they committed the crime on orders faxed to them from  Baghdad. Both of them are active employees of the Iraqi  Intelligence Directorate.    Despite hearing the two defendants' confession that they had  carried out the crime on the orders of their leaders in Baghdad,  the Foreign Ministry was notified by the Iraqi charge d'affaires  that his government objects to lifting the immunity of these two  employees.    In view of his insistence on not handing over the third and  fourth defendants, who both work for the embassy's intelligence  service; to avoid the occurrence of such crimes on our  territories; and out of concern for insuring the safety of  Lebanese citizens and all those residing in Lebanon, after due  deliberation the Lebanese Government regrets that this approach  was taken toward Lebanon now that it has restored peace and  security. Some parties--including regrettably, an Arab state  like Iraq--insist on violating all the established rules and  norms by treating Lebanon as though it was an arena for foreign  intelligence entities. This violates the Vienna agreement,  which obliges diplomats to respect the laws of the countries  where they are accredited. Therefore, the Lebanese Government  has made the following decisions:    1. To sever diplomatic ties with the Iraqi state and to  order the Foreign Ministry to request the Iraqi charge  d'affaires and embassy staff to depart this country within 72  hours; and to reiterate the Lebanese Government's demand to hand  over all the persons wanted in connection with this crime;    2. To ask the justice minister to emphasize the need for  the competent judicial authorities to follow up on the  investigations and expose whoever is connected to this crime and  the activity of this apparatus, be they Lebanese or any other  nationality.    3. Lebanon, which values the fraternal relations with the  brotherly Iraqi people, rejects any tampering with its  sovereignty, security and stability, and any violation of  diplomatic norms. The Lebanese Government will inform Arab and  international quarters of its decisions in this regard.    The cabinet also discussed the rising tension in the south  as  a result of the repeated Israeli aggression against the  defenseless residents of the southern cities and villages. His  excellency the prime minister reviewed the recent developments  and the contacts in this regard in a bid to deter Israel's  aggression. The Cabinet reiterated its full support for the  southerners and the need to provide all the necessary  requirements for their steadfastness in the face of this  aggression, stressing that all facilities will be made available  to them to enhance their steadfastness and help them remain  there.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Samahah] It is premature to answer this question. However,  it is clear from the statement that there are some people  residing in Lebanon who have committed a crime on Lebanese  territory. A certain state, by issuing certain orders, has  carried out aggression against Lebanon.    [Correspondent] What about the Lebanese community in Iraq  following the severing of ties?    [Samahah] The status of the Lebanese community in Iraq  should  be that of a community living in a country that is supposed to  respect international law and treat those living on its  territory in accordance with international law and all  international agreements.    [Correspondent] Does the Lebanese Government intend to  [words  indistinct]?    [Samahah] You can find the answer to this question in our  statement. We are still calling for the third and fourth  defendants to be handed over to Lebanese judicial authorities.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] affect the joint  interests  of the two countries?    [Samahah] Following the aggression that has taken place, I  believe that the matter has gone beyond concern over the joint  interests and become a flagrant and direct aggression against  Lebanon.    [Correspondent] How would you describe the situation  following the attacks on Sidon, the recent escalation, and the  U.S. message that Lebanon has received? Do you expect an  escalation?    [Samahah] Whenever an Israeli Government faces an internal  political problem or whenever world public opinion or the  world's decisionmaking centers tend to sympathize with Arab  rights, particularly Lebanon's, to regain their territories, the  situation in the south becomes tense and Israel constantly  escalates its aggression from the its occupied area in the south  against the people, land, and property in the liberated  territory.    [Correspondent] Is it true that there was a U.S. warning  of a possible Israeli attack against the south?    [Samahah] The United States tried to explain what is  happening in the south and to calm the situation through  contacts with Lebanon and Israel.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Samahah] The Lebanese Government's response is very clear.  We have no responsibility regarding the occupation. We have a  responsibility to end it. Therefore, we have repeatedly  demanded that UN Security Council Resolution 425 be implemented.  When we regain sovereignty over our land in the south and the  western al-Biqa', the security issue will be resolved. We are  not the aggressors. Israel is occupying our land, and is  attacking other parts of Lebanon from the occupied area. Any  approach to us or any accusation made against us is  unacceptable. We are not Israel's policemen. The international  community must serve as a force to bring justice and restore the  complete rights of Lebanon, the other Arab states, and the  Palestinian people.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Samahah] We are awaiting the outcome of the investigation.    [Correspondent] Have you decided which Arab state will care  for Lebanon's interests in Iraq after the break in relations?    [Samahah] No decision has yet been made in this regard. The  Foreign Ministry will pursue this matter.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, with regard to [words  indistinct]?    [Samahah] The officials responsible for these stations are  fully aware of the controls, what a news report on economic  activity means, and where the line should be drawn. So far no  one has committed any violation in this regard. I am confident  that all the media officials are capable, are aware of the  seriousness of this period, and are aware of the importance of  respecting the Council of Minister's decision. Let us cooperate  to create a serious and secure atmosphere in the country. We  are surrounded by major concerns at this time, and face grave  dangers, such as the recent Iraqi attack, what is happening in  the south, what is happening at home regarding the confiscation  of large quantities of weapons and ammunition from various  parties in various parts of Lebanon.    This process will continue. We are working on the media law,  which we hope will not take long. Then matters will return to  normal with the exercise of all liberties. The exercise of  liberties goes on today. The Lebanese print media is operating  normally within the law; and through them all Lebanese can  express their views. This is in addition to the official media.    Our citizens want to be free mentally and psychologically of  the state of war that has existed until recently and move to a  state of law and order. They want to exercise their liberties  and democracy under laws that are prepared by the Government and  are legislated by the Chamber of Deputies for the good and  interest of the Lebanese people. The Lebanese Constitution is  based on respect of freedoms and respect of belief, personal  freedom, expression.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Samahah, in English] The Lebanese Government has just cut  its diplomatic relations with the Iraq state, and the minister  of foreign affairs will tell the Iraqi diplomats tomorrow  morning that they have 72 hours to be out of the Lebanese  territories. We think that the Iraqi Government giving orders  to some of its personnel in Lebanon to kill Arab citizens living  in Lebanon has committed, has perpetrated, an aggression to  Lebanon from one side, and has violated the Vienna Accord from  another side. Thank you.</p>

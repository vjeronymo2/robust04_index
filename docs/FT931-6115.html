			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Deficit 'will outlast recession': Eddie George, incoming Bank of England governor, is blunt about budget deficit but buoyant about City's standing BRITAIN is likely to face a sizeable underlying budget deficit even after its economy recovers from the recession, Mr Eddie George, the incoming governor of the Bank of England, warned yesterday in Tokyo. Mr George said the government would have to address the structural deficit. The only question was whether it did so immediately, with the economy still fragile, or waited until recovery was under way. Mr George, the central bank's deputy governor, will take over from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton in July. His remarks confirm the Bank's view that the government will have to embark on a sustained programme of fiscal consolidation even if recent cuts in interest rates and the depreciation of sterling spark a strong recovery. In the first 10 months of the current financial year, the budget deficit stood at Pounds 21.6bn compared with a surplus of Pounds 14.7bn in the whole of 1988-89. Some City analysts believe the deficit could rise to more than 10 per cent of gross domestic production within five years. Mr George, speaking before giving a lecture in Tokyo, said: 'I suspect a substantial underlying deficit will emerge which the government will, in time, have to address. The question is whether it addresses it now when the economy is still fragile or later when the economy is stronger.' He said it was difficult to establish how much of Britain's growing deficit was due to the recession, which has pushed up social security and unemployment spending, and how much to a structural deterioration in government finances. Mr George said a large part of the deficit, which reflected the recession, would disappear once the economy recovered. He added: 'The conditions are in place for that and the deficit should diminish of its own accord.' Britain would start from a strong position, with a relatively light rate of indebtedness as a proportion of gross domestic product, which meant that it could be in a better position than most European countries to meet the Maastricht convergence criterion for economic and monetary union. The British economy had never been more competitive, Mr George said. The task ahead was to maintain the competitive advantage provided by sterling's recent devaluation. He said British costs were the lowest by international standards that he could remember for 25 years. He expected sterling to appreciate gradually as other countries reduced interest rates.</p>

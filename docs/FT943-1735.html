			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Thomson Financial in trade confirmation deal Thomson Financial Services, a provider of software, research and analysis for the securities industry, has signed an agreement to become the sole provider of electronic trade confirmation services for Sicovam, the French central depository for securities. Trade confirmation occurs between counterparties immediately after a bargain has been agreed. Full settlement of securities cannot be completed without trade confirmation and electronic confirmation cuts transactions costs significantly. Sicovam is owned by French financial institutions and the Paris Bourse. Although it already provides electronic trade confirmation for bargains struck between brokers, it does not do so for bargains between French brokers and their institutional or foreign counterparties. French securities trans - actions settle three days after each bargain is struck, a system which has dramatically raised the costs of trade confirmation for firms which still use manual systems. The deal is also significant for Thomson, which has been seeking a toe-hold for its electronic trade confirmation services in Europe. In the UK market, its leading competitor for the service is the London Stock Exchange's Seaqual.</p>

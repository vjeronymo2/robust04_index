			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON PLAYS AT SAN JOSE STATE  </P> <P> The longest losing streak in Cal State Fullerton football history is expected  to continue tonight at 6 when the Titans play at San Jose State in a Big West  Conference game.  </P> <P> Fullerton, which has lost eight in a row since a season-opening victory over  Sonoma State, has won five of the last seven games against the Spartans,  including a 58-13 victory in 1988 and a 28-14 win last season.  </P> <P> But San Jose State (5-2-1, 4-0 in conference play) is an overwhelming favorite.  The Spartans are four points away from an undefeated season. They tied  25th-ranked Louisville, 10-10, lost to seventh-ranked Washington, 20-17, and  lost to California, 35-34.

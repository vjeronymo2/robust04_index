			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Bangemann hits back at critics EC INDUSTRY commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann yesterday attacked critics who claim he is tampering with the working of the free market. He was speaking at a news conference outlining Commission plans to make the European car and aircraft industries more competitive. Mr Bangemann insisted that industrial and competition policy went hand in hand but criticised competition 'ayatollahs' who assumed that more competitors always meant more competition. 'Sometimes that is nonsense. You could have very vivid competition between three competitors and no competition at all between 100,' he told journalists. Several of Mr Bangemann's colleagues, including Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, and the social and regional funding commissioners, had sought changes to the Commission's paper on the car industry. In the event the amendments have been minor. Mr Bangemann defended his proposals for more on-the-job training of car workers to reduce the risk of redundancies. Some of his colleagues are worried such a move would drain existing EC funds - targeted on long-term unemployment and training of young people - into the coffers of private car manufacturers. 'Could you please explain why it is that we have to sit around and wait . . . until a person is (defined as) long-term unemployed and only then are we able to act?' he asked. 'I think it's completely nonsensical to do that.' Mr Bangemann refused to comment on Sir Leon's parallel paper on EC car prices, publication of which has been postponed, but indicated they had resolved some of their differences over a 'friendly lunch' on Tuesday. Sir Leon's car price study originally appeared to contradict the Bangemann paper, especially on the sensitive question of what to do about exclusive car dealerships in the EC. Sir Leon mainly blames the system, which is exempt from competition rules until 1995, for the price differences on new cars across Europe. He wants dealers to prove that the system is efficient. The car industry paper produced yesterday takes a neutral line on whether the system should be maintained until the end of the century, while the EC market is opened to Japanese car imports. Following minor amendments, the paper says that 'provided it works satisfactorily and efficiently (the system) would help in the management of the transitional period'. Irritated at accusations that the Commission was intervening in areas better left to companies, Mr Bangemann apologised ironically for trying to fulfil his role as industry commissioner.

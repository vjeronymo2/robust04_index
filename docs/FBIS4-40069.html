			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent F. Tavrovskiy; from the </F> "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] Here is a sensational report we have received from  the ITAR-TASS news agency today. This is what it says. The  North Korean Foreign Ministry has stated that North Korea is to  pull out of the International Atomic Energy Agency immediately  and is set to pursue its independent nuclear program in the  future.    [Tavrovskiy] The declaration made public by the North Korean  Foreign Ministry says that the reason for adopting it was the  recent decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency to  stop technical aid to North Korea. Pyongyang confirmed that  North Korea's membership of the Nonproliferation Treaty has been  suspended. Moreover, North Korea is refusing to allow  international observers to inspect its nuclear sites in the  future. At the same time, the IAEA said that it had received no  notification as yet from North Korea about its decision to  resign from the agency.    Perhaps, after North Korea's step today, sanctions which the  United States, Japan, and South Korea want will be inevitable.  At the same time, Pyongyang says that if the sanctions are  imposed, a terrible war will be waged on the Korean peninsula.    There is no doubt that the actions of the North Korean  regime  must be condemned. Nevertheless, I would like to say that South  Africa and Israel may well have a nuclear bomb as well. It is  quite possible that Libya and Pakistan also possess it. So when  North Korea blames the IAEA of double-standards, its words carry  a certain grain of truth. The best way out of the current  situation may be the Russian proposal for an international  conference for nuclear security in the Korean peninsula with all  the interested parties taking part.</p>

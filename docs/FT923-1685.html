			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Observer: Celling point America's 900,000 prison inmates are 'brand loyal' consumers and have significant discretionary spending power. So says Joe Strahl; and he should know  - he used to be a supply manager for a prison in Illinois. Strahl plans to launch a magazine called Prison Life next month hoping the Dollars 3.95 cover will soak up some of the estimated Dollars 1,100 plus inmates spend a year. The first cover story seems designed with the longer term reader in mind. It's headed 'Manson get off his back: the inequities of prison parole'. . . .</p>

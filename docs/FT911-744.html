			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Martini's talent revealed Italian Art in the 20th Century at the Royal Academy in 1989 brought to London four sculptures by Arturo Martini; 'On Classic Ground' at the Tate last year, a further seven. The Accademia Italiana brings us 49 in an impressive exhibition, shown previously at the Hotel de Ville, Paris. It is nothing short of a revelation to non-Italians. The Italians, too, have been slow in their reappraisal of one of the most influential and innovative sculptors of the first half of the century: many of the works here had not been exhibited since the 1920s before the major retrospective at the Palazzo Reale in Milan in 1985 or the centenary celebrations at Aosta two years ago. Only in the last decade has the early 20th century Classicism of the renegades of the avant-garde seen serious critical re-evaluation. Martini takes his bow here in 1920, the date of his first one-man show - organised by Carra - and the beginning of his association with the Roman journal Valori Plastici which championed the return to Classical order. His interpretation of that order was idiosyncratic and intuitive. He sought a primitive clarity and purity from his native past, drawing on the forms of the 14th and 15th century Italian Primitives and the 2nd century Etruscans, and on the timelessness of peasant life and popular myth. 'The Etruscans made their statues the way our women make ravioli,' Martini declared. The same could be said of him. Massive, simplified forms, even when in low relief, suggest the volume and rotundity of figures by Giotto and Masaccio. Bronzes have the delicacy and the sharply outlined features of Quattrocento busts An 'Etruscan' terracotta chimaera turns to bear its teeth. Simple peasants in archaic dress are rooted into Mother Earth and gaze towards the heavens, in 'The Stars'. The compact bulk of 'Fertility' recalls Picasso's nudes of 1906 that similarly derive their forms from the ancient sculpture of the Iberian peninsula. Allusion is favoured above narrative, but his sculpture is not without sentiment. Lovers are melded into single figures, or sit numbed and separated by untimely death. The Prodigal Son is reconciled with his father in an overtly Hellenistic bronze of 1926 which Martini considered among his finest achievements. He has emphasised the tension and the pathos: 'a Greek could not have done it,' he said. Eroticism frequently rears not so much its head as its bottom. It is tempting to relate his predilection for the female posterior to a childhood memory of watching a prostitute lift up her skirt and squat in a canal: 'A vision of her large behind exploded in front of me, white, on her two trunk-like thighs. It was a temple, an ecstasy.' His terracotta sunbather - which again brings to mind Picasso and his monumental bathers - is Woman luxuriating in the sun and opening up her body to embrace it. She is as voluptuous as anything by Maillol. Eroticism is rampant in 'She-Wolf'. Title and posture allude to the symbol of Rome who suckled the twins, and to the creature of Sicilian myth of devouring sensuality. She is also Woman depraved, at once deeply and fatally desirable and repulsive. Martini described himself as the greatest seismograph of his age who let himself be influenced by the natural oscillations of his time. Undoubtedly he was eclectic in his choice of subject matter, technique and material. Here he shows himself sensitive to a variety of media, from varnished plaster to polychrome terracotta and wood, bronze, stone, and marble. The varnished plaster bas-relief 'The Lovers' makes effective but subtle use of cast shadow. A silky fluidity of line is found for the 'Dead Lover', and that sensual, gleaming surface reappears again in the glorious - at times almost Mannerist - series of small mythological bronzes of the 1930s. But it is his experimentation and feeling for stone that often produce the most exciting results. In 'The Convalescent', the frail figure of the young girl is an essential part of the massive boulder of grey, pitted Vicenza stone that is her wheelchair. The porous Finale stone of 'Thirst' is rougher and more expressive still. Its rough-hewn quality is reminiscent of Michelangelo's 'Slave', but Martini also saw the lava bodies excavated at Pompeii in the 1930s. This sculpture could almost be a wind-eroded outcrop of rock. Cool marble is used for the chilly 'Narcissus' who peers into the water beneath the crook of his arm to admire his own reflection. His figure is streamlined, taut and inviolate. Vicenza stone is selected again for what is the climax of this exhibition: 'The Dead at Bligny of 1935', which alludes to the involvement of Italian soldiers at the 1918 battle. The pose of the soldier is that of the small bronze 'The Hundred Metre Sprinter' made earlier that year. It has simply been turned upside down to serve a new end. The exhibition, sponsored by the Commune di Milano, continues at the Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate, SW7, until June 23.</p>

Speaking in Zimbabwe, Mr. Robaina said Cuba was  looking for markets for its raw materials, and for new supplies  of oil to replace imports from the former Soviet Union. The  Cuban foreign minister, who arrived in Harare from the Angolan  capital, Luanda, denied reports that Cuba planned to negotiate  the supply of arms to Angola.</p>

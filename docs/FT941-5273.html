			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Japan companies to slash capital spending Japanese companies are planning to cut capital spending even more steeply this year than last, leading to the longest investment decline in the post-war period. A respected survey of corporate borrowers by the Industrial Bank of Japan predicted that capital investment will fall by 6.1 per cent in the year to March 1995. Japan's economic gloom has for the first time spread from manufacturing into service industries, according to the survey of 3,689 IBJ clients. This comes after a 5.6 per cent decline in the current fiscal year, already the biggest since the IBJ started taking the survey in 1969. The bank found 'extreme bearishness' in most sectors for the first time in this recession. Service companies say capital spending will fall 0.4 per cent this year and 4.6 per cent in the coming 12 months. Manufacturers expect spending to fall 17.7 per cent in the current year and 10.3 per cent next. This suggests that recent increases in industrial machinery orders, one of the few bright spots in the economic gloom, are only a weak indicator of recovery. Machinery orders rose 31.8 per cent in January from the same month the previous year, the third monthly increase running, the Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers said yesterday. Corporate demand for credit continues to be weak, according to separate figures from the federation of bankers' associations of Japan. Outstanding loans by Japan's 11 city banks fell 0.7 per cent last month, from February 1993, for the second month running. The lending balance dipped in January for the first time since the federation began collecting records 40 years ago.</p>

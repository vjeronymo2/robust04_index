			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE WHEEL  </P> <P> Are women better drivers than men?  </P> <P> Well, a recent Los Angeles Times computer analysis of the driving records of  179,000 Californians indicated that women generally are much safer drivers than  men their age.  </P> <P> Sixteen-year-old girls had a ticket rate lower than boys their age. Although  the worst drivers were 18-year-olds of both sexes, women tended to have fewer  accidents than men at other age levels.  </P> <P> Hardly portents of evil.  </P> <P> Except to Jon Winokur of Pacific Palisades, author of "The Portable  Curmudgeon," "A Curmudgeon's Garden of Love" and clearly California's reigning  grouch.  </P> <P> "Portents of evil? Portents? They already are," he grumbled. "Only last week,  on Olympic in West Los Angeles, I saw a woman driving while talking on the  telephone and putting on her makeup.  </P> <P> "That's a quinella I've not see before. I can only presume she was driving with  her knees."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back at the record books.  </P> <P> They list one English woman who passed a driving test after 40 attempts, but  had spent so much money on driving lessons she couldn't afford a car. Then  there was the Arkansas lady who passed her written test after 104 tries.  </P> <P> But hold the chortles.  </P> <P> According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the world's worst driver is a  Texan who in 1966 received 10 tickets, drove on the wrong side of the road four  times, was involved in four hit-and-runs and caused six other accidents within  20 minutes.  </P> <P> Quite a guy.

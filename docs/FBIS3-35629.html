The plan also envisages a  2.3 percent growth in industrial output and a 7.1 percent in the  farming sector.    Consumer production is to be increased by 5.7 percent with  export revenues being planned at the level of $1.3 Bn.    The cabinet is given two weeks in which to approve the  volume  of state orders and contracts and inform appropriate ministries,  departments and local governments.    Chairman of the planning, budget and price commission Andrey  Pecherov told parliament that this year's government guidelines  had been changed to the detriment of "market methods" though  this was necessary in the emerging conditions.    For his part, Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy warned  against fearing the administrative methods of economic  management saying "no country in the world has abided without  them, particularly at the time of crisis." He called on  deputies to allow the National Bank to provide the government  with a loan of 12 Tn karbovantsy to be repaid in the second half  of this year.    After four rounds of voting, the government-proposed budget  was defeated. Some deputies described as utopian the  government's offer of a non-deficit budget.    Head of the defence and security commission Valentin Lemish  said the proposed defence spending of 16.9 Tn karbovantsy or 4.8  of total expenditure did not cover the defence ministry's needs.</p>

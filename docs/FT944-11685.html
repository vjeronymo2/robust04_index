			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Chilean financial group opts for Santiago share offering Bicecorp, the Chilean financial services group, is aiming to increase its capital base through an initial public offering of shares this month. However, unlike other Chilean groups, it has chosen to raise the money in the Santiago market, rather than New York - in spite of the likelihood that the New York market would place a higher valuation on the issue. Mr Eliodoro Matte, Bicecorp's president, calculates that his company's shares will be valued in Santiago at about 14 times prospective 1994 earnings. In New York - using past flotations for banking groups such as Banco O'Higgins as a guide - he believes the multiple would be nearer 18. Mr Matte gives two reasons for selling the shares through the more conservative Santiago exchange. First, for a closed corporation such as Bicecorp, the jump to New York Stock Exchange standards of disclosure is a substantial one. Second, he believes the price of the company's shares will be less likely to be suffer from big shifts of sentiment in New York. Bicecorp may be interested in a New York listing in the future, but for now it believes Santiago-based investors are likely to have firmer hands. This is in part because Chilean law stipulates that foreigners must hold on to investments in Chile for at least a year. Bicecorp, a diversified financial services group which holds the Banco BICE investment bank and the largest stockbroker in Chile, is the first group to be designated a bank holding company in Chile. The group - in which the London-based Rothschild group of Sir Evelyn Rothschild has a substantial stake - is selling new shares equivalent to 16 per cent of its capital and expects to raise about Dollars 35m. The offering will dilute the stake of Rothschild - which does much of its Latin American business in co-operation with BICE - to 34.17 per cent from 40.68 per cent, and that of Mr Matte's Grupo Matte to 47.67 per cent from 56.75 per cent. Rothschild has held a stake in BICE since it was founded in 1979, and boosted the stake to more than 40 per cent in 1987. The share issue - which will be used to increase the capital of the bank to international standards and to boost its life insurance business - will begin trading in Santiago on November 14. The shares will be priced a few days before that; the minimum set by the board is just under Dollars 4 a share. The offering is being made through Bankers Trust's Chilean broking subsidiary, Larrain Vial, and BICE Corredores. Mr Matte said he hoped two-thirds of the shares would be placed with Chilean and foreign institutions (Chilean pension funds are excluded from buying new issues), and the remainder with Chilean individuals, who get tax incentives to subscribe for new shares.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Securum marks a Swedish milestone - International loans The SKr20bn refinancing package announced last week by Securum, the state-owned Swedish company set up to liquidate the failed loans of Nordbanken, was big by any standards. From a company less than two years old, it was spectacular. The operation is a milestone in Sweden's progress out of the crisis that overwhelmed its banking sector in 1992. Significant state intervention was required to restore confidence. 'Securum has been the main symbol of the Swedish banking crisis,' says Mr Anders Nyren, the group's chief financial officer. 'For the company to be able to refinance itself in the international markets so soon after it was set up shows the progress which has been made.' Securum was established in early 1993 after taking on SKr60bn in failed loans from Nordbanken, which collapsed into state arms in 1992 as the biggest casualty of Sweden's banking crisis. It has converted bad credits into some SKr44bn worth of assets, which it intends to sell off gradually over the next 10 years to maximise returns to the taxpayer. It has changed from being a finance company to an investment, industrial and real estate holding company. The transformation was the starting point for the refinancing which will allow it to pay back most of the loans it has received from Nordbanken. The package involves an international and a domestic tranche. Under the international tranche, Chemical Bank and Enskilda Corporate will arrange a Dollars 1.4bn amortising five-year syndicated term loan. Pricing is Libor plus 25 basis points. After a two-year grace period, the company expects to pay down about half of the loan over the following three years. At the end of the period, the remaining portion will either be refinanced or paid back using proceeds from asset disposals. The domestic portion falls into two parts, a SKr5bn subordinated term loan and a SKr5bn callable subordinated private placement, both running over 10 years. The arranging banks, Enskilda Corporate and Nordbanken, are expected to provide most of the term loan themselves. Terms are Stibor (Stockholm inter-bank offered rate) plus 'a few basis points' (in practice, less than five). The private placement comprises a five-year fixed interest rate bond. If market conditions move against the company before the rate is set in a few weeks time, it has a back-up facility to draw down funds on a Stibor basis. After five years, the bond rate will be re-set. The domestic/international structure reflects Securum's balance sheet with its 60/40 per cent asset split between Sweden and abroad. For the international tranche, a syndicated loan was preferred to a bond issue because Securum does not have a credit rating and a bond was considered less flexible. A crucial element in the total package is the backing provided by the Swedish state. The SKr10bn domestic portion of the deal will be formally guaranteed by the Kingdom of Sweden, which is transferring a pledge that underpins Securum's existing Nordbanken loan. The international tranche is covered by the blanket support measures which the government introduced in late 1992 to retain confidence in the banking sector. The state role undoubtedly helped Securum obtain competitive terms, although not to the extent that it was considered sovereign risk. The terms also reflect Securum's better than expected financial performance in the first 18 months of its life and the situation in the Swedish market, where the banks are flush with cash following recapitalisation and weak loan demand. Indeed, Securum believes the terms it secured in the domestic market are at least as favourable as if it had stuck with Nordbanken, even though Nordbanken has provided its loan on a cost-of-funds basis. Combining the term loan and the private placement elements, Securum expects to end up with a basic interest rate of a few basis points below Stibor. On a worst-case scenario, it expects the rate to work out at Stibor plus one and half basis points. If the international tranche is included in the calculation, the company expects its overall funding costs to be 'very marginally' higher than they are today. Initial market reactions to the package were positive. 'It's priced according to the market and it's well structured,' said one Swedish banking source, who believed it would be successful because it gives international banks, excluded from some recent relationship-driven deals, the opportunity to get into the Swedish market. The deal is strategically important for Securum in several ways: it provides visibility, it broadens its borrowing base and it allows it to build up contacts with a range of international lenders. It should also assist the government's plans to privatise Nordbanken - a move expected sometime next year - by reducing the bank's uncomfortably large exposure to a single client.</p>

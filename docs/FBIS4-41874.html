			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Bakina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- "North Korea has more  plutonium than it has reported", Director of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans Blix said in Moscow on  Wednesday.    He told TASS that his agency aims to clarify the total  amount  of radioactive waste in North Korea and the location of its  burial places.    Blix hopes that Pyongyang "will raise the curtain of  mystery"  over the fate of the radioactive fuel from its 5 mgwatt reactor  and said talks are currently being held with North Korea on the  problem.    The IAEA director played down fears about the scope of  illegal exports of radioactive waste stolen by criminal groups.  He said that 95 per cent of reported cases turned out to be  pure inventions. However, some cases did take place and were  thoroughly investigated. Blix added that he had already held  negotiations with nuclear powers and agreed with them that it is  necessary to cut short criminal attempts to smuggle out  radioactive waste. He believes a special organisation  resembling the FBI might be set up for the purpose.    Dwelling on the future of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant  in Ukraine where the worst nuclear disaster occurred in 1986,  Blix said that the Ukrainian Government wants to keep the plant  running because of economic problems and that the leaderships of  Western Europe are ready to help it. However, in future the  obsolete reactors of the plant are to be replaced, he added.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Mayhew hints at resurrecting internment Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave his strongest hint yet that the government is considering internment as part of its response to the upsurge in sectarian violence in the province. His comments came as the UK government signalled that a meeting between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, this week could give new impetus to efforts to forge a lasting settlement in Ulster. Downing Street made clear it had not ruled out reaching a framework agreement on new constitutional arrangements in time for the next Anglo-Irish summit next month. On Friday Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, gave a gloomier assessment, warning that the document was unlikely to be completed in time for the summit. As the first victims of the latest outbreak of sectarian violence were buried, Mr Gerry Adams added his voice to those urging republicans not to retaliate for Saturday night's shooting in which six Roman Catholic men were killed by loyalists. The president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, appealed to 'those I represent' for calm and restraint. He said republican leaders would reconvene to discuss Sinn Fein's response to last year's Downing Street Declaration 'within days'. With pressure again mounting on London and Dublin to show that their efforts are making headway, officials representing the two governments are understood to be working from the same draft of the proposed framework agreement. But important differences are said to remain over what the document will say on future north-south institutions and Dublin's constitutional claim over the province. This is seen in Whitehall as the main trade-off that will be at the core of any agreement. Although London is anxious to encourage Dublin to move further towards rescinding its territorial claim, officials see little point in granting concessions on north-south relations that would be rejected out of hand by unionists. The two sides are also divided on whether the document should simply provide a starting point for new political talks, in line with London's wishes, or set out a specific blueprint for the province's future. Mr Reynolds used a speech in the US yesterday to underline Dublin's readiness to back constitutional changes, provided this was part of 'a balanced constitutional accommodation'. Questioned in Lisburn, where the British army in Northern Ireland is headquartered, Sir Patrick said it was 'not for nothing' that the government asked MPs to renew a provision for internment every year. He said the provision had been retained because the government believed circumstances could be 'envisaged' in which it would be 'necessary to use that power'. Ministers have come under pressure from unionists and Tory backbenchers to intern suspected terrorist ringleaders as part of their response to Saturday's shooting. Government insiders believe such a move is still some way off, however, not least because of the difficulties it could present the Irish government, whose co-operation would be required if the exercise is to be effective.</p>

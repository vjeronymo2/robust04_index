			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (12): US desktop leaders start to regain high ground - How IBM and Compaq are fighting back Two of the traditional US leaders in desktop computing have made great strides in the mobile computing sector over the past 12 months. Compaq, which pioneered the portable PC market, and IBM, a company distinguished by many past portable failures, are finally achieving side-by-side success with their battery-operated ventures. Compaq has aimed in the past year to regain the technological high ground from competitors such as Toshiba. In September, it launched its most innovative notebook computer to date: the Compaq Concerto. This system features an Intel 486SL processor (running at 25 or 33 Mhz), 4 Mb of RAM, 120 Mb hard disk, a detachable keyboard, the ability to accept commands and data input from keyboard, pen and mouse - and two expansion slots that conform to the PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association) standard. Perhaps even more importantly, the system was priced at Dollars 2,499 - with a docking station option for only Dollars 200 more. The set of features combined with competitive pricing has helped Compaq to a significant mobile computer hardware market share. Compaq has also announced plans to release its first subnotebook system early this year - and to bring out a 'Mobile Companion' handheld system based on the WinPad technology developed jointly with Microsoft and Intel. Both should offer the Houston-based computer maker a chance to have an impact on markets that it has so far shunned, giving smaller competitors such as Tandy, Gateway 2000 and IBM's Ambra division a chance to pioneer the demand for these systems. The highest volume of these new systems is expected to be a 3.9lb sub-notebook version of the Compaq Contura - which is likely to offer battery life of up to five hours and sell for less than Dollars 2,000. Like the Concerto, it will be based on the low-power Intel 486SL processor. It is easy to see why Compaq wants to get into the subnotebook market. According to US market research firm Workgroup Technologies, US shipments of subnotebook systems have demonstrated an annual compound growth rate of almost 87 per cent since 1992 and are expected to hit the 2m mark this year. With average prices of between Dollars 1,500 and Dollars 2,000 a unit, that suggests that subnotebook systems will form a market worth between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn in the US alone this year. IBM, meanwhile, has already made an impact on this growing subnotebook sector with its ThinkPad range of systems. The basic ThinkPad 500 weighs only 3.8lb, comes with a 25 or 50 Mhz 486SLC2 processor, promises battery life of up to six hours and sells for less than Dollars 2,000. Despite critical praise and high demand for this system, IBM reported late last year that the ThinkPad 500 was initially plagued by production difficulties and was now suffering battery problems - and also that, as a result, production of the machines would be halted temporarily. Production of ThinkPad systems has now restarted, with IBM hoping that, meanwhile, it has not lost too much momentum in the market. At the other end of the mobile computer market, IBM has another new ThinkPad  -the 750C. This 6.3lb notebook system not only includes a crisp, 10.5 inch TFT active matrix colour LCD screen, 4 Mb of memory and a 170 Mb hard disk - but also features two PCMCIA Type II (or one PCMCIA Type III) expansion slots and built-in audio capabilities. This allows the ThinkPad to run multimedia applications - although the lack of a CD-ROM player will limit the number of multimedia software packages that can actually be installed on it. IBM does, however, offer an optional external unit for connecting a CD-ROM player. The built-in sound system also allows voice messages to be recorded on the computer - so that it could double as a limited function portable dictating machine. Pricing on the system is still high - though not out of line for a system with its features. At Dollars 4,699, it is not destined to become a high-volume system, but it is winning critical praise. The real point about the ThinkPad mobile computers is that they suggest, for the first time since IBM starting producing portable computers in 1985 (with the disastrous IBM PC Portable), that Big Blue is putting creative thought into their design. The fact that its portable computers are receiving favourable press compared to existing market leaders - and that IBM has largely abandoned the price structures that made its systems ridiculously expensive for many years - all point to future success for IBM in this market.</p>

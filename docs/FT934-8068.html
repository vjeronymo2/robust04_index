			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BAe sells data processing operations BRITISH AEROSPACE is selling its data processing operations to Computer Sciences Corporation, a US computing services company. The contract, Europe's largest data processing outsourcing deal, is expected to be worth a minium of Pounds 900m over 10 years to the US company. BAe said its costs savings would be 'substantial' but declined to give exact figures. Outsourcing, where an outside organisation takes over a company's computers and data processing staff and provides an agreed level of service against an agreed fee, is growing in popularity as companies increasingly concentrate on core activities. BAe said it would retain responsibility for its information technology strategy together with 'sensitive' computer systems. CSC would take control of the data centres, networks, applications software and distributed computing systems used by its business units including Military Aircraft, Royal Ordnance, British Aerospace Systems and Equipment, the headquarters organisation and the Sowerby Research Centre. It is understood that the final short list for the contract included EDS of the US, a subsidiary of General Motors, and IBM. Last week EDS won the first of the government's 'market testing' outsourcing contracts from CSC with the purchase of Dvoit, the data processing arm of the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Centre. The BAe agreement dwarfs CSC's deal earlier this year with BHS, worth Pounds 100m over 10 years, but it is still smaller than its deal last year with General Dynamics of the US which is worth Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn). Mr Ron Mackintosh, chief executive of CSC Europe, said he believed that the company's expertise in the aerospace business had been the key factor in winning the deal. CSC would carry out three months of due diligence with BAe; the contract was expected to be signed in the spring of 1994. It will involve the sale of BAe's data processing assets to CSC for about Pounds 75m. Some 1,250 staff will be transferred to CSC together with IBM, ICL and Digital Equipment computers from a variety of sites through the UK. MSF, the technician's union, said BAe staff were 'bitterly disappointed' by the deal which would be a real threat to the security of the business. Mr Ron Ralph, BAe officer for the north-west, said BAe had put short term financial considerations in front of long term security. MSF was concerned for the future of the staff who would be transferred and would be seeking early meetings with BAe and CSC. BAe said yesterday it had 'placed the highest priority on protecting the interests of the employees who will be transferred to CSC', and had emphasised the need to maintain equivalent terms and conditions together with comparable training and development programmes and career opportunities. Mr Mackintosh said redundancies would be 'minimal'. No decisions would be taken until the completion of due diligence. CSC is a leading computing services company employing some 26,000 people with revenues of Dollars 2.5bn. It has been making assiduous efforts to grow in Europe through acquisition. The BAe deal means it will expand from 750 people in the UK to over 2,000. It will have more than 3,000 staff in Europe. It expects revenues of about Dollars 150m from the first year of the BAe contract, giving it total revenues in Europe of over Dollars 400m.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Board named for business school MANCHESTER University has persuaded Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, and Mr James Ross, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, to help re-establish Manchester Business School's reputation after last year's row over its future. Both will serve on the school's new board, announced yesterday, with Mr Ross as chairman. The board's predecessor body - a council of 14 business leaders and former Whitehall mandarins - resigned 13 months ago after Professor Tom Cannon, the school's director, left amid recriminations about the structure of the school. The university dissolved the council. The new board's first job will be to address a deficit at the previously profitable school. Financial health partly depends on reputation, which in Manchester's case ranks with Harvard in the US, Insead in France, and London and Cranfield in the UK because of the quality of its postgraduate management education. Documents leaked to the Financial Times show a deficit of Pounds 326,700 at the end of March - Pounds 706,700 worse than a then-budgeted surplus of Pounds 380,000. Professor Martin Harris, Manchester University's vice-chancellor, said yesterday not all this could be attributed to the row - there was a general downturn in demand for places on postgraduate courses because of the recession. Professor Tony Cockerell, acting director of the school, said cost-cutting should have improved finances by the end of this term. The school is hoping to be near break-even on the academic year. Prof Cannon left after a long row over proposals to federate the business school with the School of Management at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and the university's department of accounting. The federation has still not been formed. Also on the new business school board will be Mr Joe Dwek, chairman of Bodycote International; Mr Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester Ship Canal; Ms Kzimiera Kanto, finance director of Central Independent Television; Mr Andrew Gardner, chairman of Boyden World Corporation; Mr Martin Bell, finance director of Turner and Newall; Mr Tain Macdonald, chairman of SHL Systemhouse Europe; and Mr Peter Dell, chairman of Ernst &amp; Young Recruitment Network Practices.</p>

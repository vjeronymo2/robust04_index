			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that without  secret talks with Syria, a peace agreement cannot be reached.  In an interview with the Cairo newspaper AL-AHRAM, Rabin says  Israel had tried to arrange secret meetings with Syrian leaders,  but they had refused. In the interview, Rabin accused Syria of  talking peace, while simultaneously supporting Palestinian  organizations opposed to negotiations.    Major General Ilan Biran, who today takes over as the head  of  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, has presented  Prime Minister Rabin with a working paper on security  arrangements on the Golan. Biran discussed the issue with the  prime minister and with Chief of Staff Baraq on Friday and on a  previous occasion. [passage omitted]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 17 April  reports: "Israel has expressed its displeasure over the harsh  criticism Syria had leveled at Oman for its willingness to host  an Israeli delegation. Our correspondent in Washington Arye  Golan reports that Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's  ambassador to the United States, spoke to U.S. coordinator  Dennis Ross on the matter, and told him that the Syrian remarks  do not contribute to the establishment of a proper atmosphere in  view of the upcoming Middle East tour by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, and toward the resumption of the peace  talks."]    The Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem says there were  contacts involving Syria, after katyusha rockets landed in  Israel, during the early hours of Friday morning. Jerusalem  says those contacts brought quiet to the Israeli side of the  border over the Sabbath, even if katyushas did land in southern  Lebanon.    [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 17 April carries a  report by Ron Ben-Yishay on pages 1 and 15, adding: "Over the  weekend, the Israeli Government relayed a warning to Hizballah  and Syria that if murderous attacks on the SLA [South Lebanese  Army] and Lebanese civilians in the security zone continue, the  IDF will feel free to ignore the understandings made after  Operation Accountability last summer." The report adds that  "there is growing concern among Israel's top security echelons  that the SLA might gradually disintegrate, physically and  morally, and that the security zone in south Lebanon might  crumble."]    Also at the Prime Minister's Office, there is expectation  for  more progress with the PLO on Gaza-Jericho first, as the  Israelis prepare for the resumption of those talks today. If  the Palestinians raise the issue of the closure of the  territories imposed a week and a half ago, an official in  Jerusalem said last night they will be told that the possibility  of lifting restrictions has been and will continue to be checked  on a constant basis, including at this morning's cabinet meeting.    There is no reaction in Jerusalem to King Husayn's news  conference on Hamas. Prime Minister Rabin's media adviser 'Oded  Ben-'Ami says Israel will know whether in fact Jordan has acted  against Hamas operations in the country, based on whether or not  we hear from the Hamas people in Jordan again. For now, says  Ben-'Ami, we have said what we wanted to say.</p>

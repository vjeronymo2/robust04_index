			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / NY Senate race sets new standards in seediness EVERYONE knows that New York politics can be among the roughest and meanest in the US. But even by New York standards the four-way Democratic Senate primary race - culminating in today's vote - will go down as one of the most vitriolic campaigns in many years. The winner of this melee will challenge Mr Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a right-wing politician from suburban Long Island, who has thus far tramped about the US citing the fact that he has been rebuked rather than censured by the Senate ethics committee as proof that he has been exonerated of past influence-peddling charges. Mr D'Amato is considered vulnerable this year, not least because of his chequered record. But the Democrats have engaged in so much mud-slinging that there is unlikely to be much high ground left to be gained by his opponent. Although her substantial early lead has nearly evaporated, the front-runner among the Democrats is 56-year-old Ms Geraldine Ferraro, the former congresswomen from the Queens who in the 1984 presidential election served as Mr Walter Mondale's controversial running mate. Ms Ferraro's troubles first began during the 1984 campaign when allegations were made about the legality of her husband's business dealings. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour after the campaign. An unabashed supporter of capital punishment, Ms Ferraro styles herself as a no-nonsense feminist with a working-class background. It is the negative campaigning of her rivals that has raised the possibility that she may not make it after all. Advertisments by rivals have accused Ms Ferraro's landlord husband of ties to the Mafia and have repeatedly alleged he rented a house to a child pornographer. Ms Ferraro's keenest challenger, New York State attorney-general Mr Robert Abrams, has not been hesitant to make use of the controversy. Neither has Ms Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswomen and New York's current comptroller. Oddly enough the only candidate who has not attacked Ms Ferraro over ethics is the normally demagogic Rev Al Sharpton. He arrived at a televised debate last week with a symbolic bucket of mud for his colleagues. The debate among the Senate Democratic primary candidates became so heated that the moderator kept intervening to say: 'Ladies, ladies, ladies, Ms Holtzman, Ms Ferraro. . .' Issues have thus taken a back seat to insults, which means that even if Ms Ferraro does win today, she is unlikely to be the unblemished sort of challenger who can make much of the various investigations of Mr D'Amato. The seediness of this year's New York Senate race looks set to continue. Jurek Martin adds from Washington; Another race of interest concerns Congressman Stephen Solarz, the Democratic foreign policy expert. His old safe House of Representatives seat in Brooklyn has been redrawn  - with the purpose of promoting Hispanic representation in Congress - and he may be vulnerable to the challenge of Ms Elizabeth Colon, an advocate of Puerto Rican interests.</p>

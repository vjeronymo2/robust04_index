The Chester Soaring Association also objected to lowering the Class B airspace area floor southwest and southeast of the airport from 8,000 feet MSL to 6,000 feet MSL. It also shared the opinion of the Soaring Society of America that lowering the floor of the Class B airspace area will render the Chester Soaring site unusable for competition. The proposed design was submitted by the ad hoc committee as a means of containing aircraft descending on base leg, within the Class B airspace area while conducting simultaneous instrument approaches. While the FAA understands the concerns of the soaring community, those concerns can be accommodated only to the extent that they do not compromise the FAA's ability to manage efficiently the Charlotte Class B airspace area and provide the optimum level of safety to the flying public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments were considered in developing the proposal to modify the Class B airspace area. If these modifications are adopted, the revised Charlotte Class B airspace area chart will depict VFR flyways and specific access instructions to facilitate alternatives to flight within the Class B airspace area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA proposes to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the existing Charlotte Class B airspace area, based on safety and operational needs. The FAA's responsibility is to manage efficiently the airspace surrounding the Charlotte area while providing the optimum level of safety to the flying public. The number of enplaned passengers at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport was 7,784,047 in 1991 and 8,425,447 in 1992, an increase of 8.2 percent. The airport operations were 440,956 in 1991 and 466,351 in 1992, more than a 5.8 percent increase in traffic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 91.131 of part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.131) prescribes rules for aircraft operating in airspace designated as a Class B airspace area. The Class B airspace area rule provides, in part, that prior to entering the Class B airspace area, any pilot at any airport within the Class B airspace area or flying through the Class B airspace area must: (1) Obtain appropriate authorization from ATC; (2) comply with applicable procedures established by ATC for pilot training operations at an airport within a Class B airspace area; and (3) hold at least a private pilot certificate or meet the requirements of &sect;61.95 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 61.95), if the aircraft is operated by a student pilot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person operating an aircraft within a Class B airspace area must have the aircraft equipped with an operable two-way radio capable of communications with ATC on appropriate frequencies for that Class B airspace area, and the applicable operating transponder and automatic altitude-reporting equipment specified in paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;91.215 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all large, turbine-powered aircraft operating to or from a Class B airspace area-primary airport must be operated at or above the designated floors of the Class B airspace area while within the lateral limits of the Class B airspace area. The pilot of any aircraft departing from an airport located within the surface area of a Class B airspace area is required to receive a clearance from ATC prior to takeoff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All aircraft operating within a Class B airspace area are required to comply with all ATC clearances and instructions. However, ATC may authorize deviations from any of the operating requirements of the rule when safety considerations justify the deviation. Ultralight vehicle operations and parachute jumps in a Class B airspace area may only be conducted under the terms of an ATC authorization. Definitions and operating requirements applicable to Class B airspace area may be found in 14 CFR 71.41, 91.1, 91.117, 91.131, 91.215, SFAR No. 62, and appendix D to part 91 of the FAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard configuration of a Class B airspace area consists of 3 concentric circles centered on the primary airport extending to 10, 20, and 30 nautical miles respectively. Generally, the vertical limits of the Class B airspace are 10,000 feet MSL, with the floor established at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriate to containment of operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteria may be necessary contingent upon terrain, adjacent regulatory airspace, and other factors unique to the terminal area. The site specific airspace configuration proposed herein is the result of an extensive FAA study, conducted after obtaining public input through an ad hoc committee, informal airspace meetings and written comments. Copies of the report of this study are contained in the FAA docket and are available on request. The FAA has determined that the proposed alteration of airspace for the Charlotte Class B airspace area would be consistent with Class B airspace area objectives. The proposed configuration considers the present terminal area flight operations and terrain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

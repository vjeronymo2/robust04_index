			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXERCISE IN POLLUTED AIR HARD ON HEART, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> People who exercise in highly polluted air may be risking heart attacks,  according to the most extensive test of the effects of carbon monoxide on  humans, published Saturday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  </P> <P> Although the research concentrated on men and women with histories of heart  disease, it found that carbon monoxide emissions from cars and industrial sites  are a potential risk for anyone who exercises outdoors.  </P> <P> "It would be prudent to avoid exercise in areas that are polluted because it is  just not healthy. And it's possibly quite hazardous," study director David  Sheps, of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, said in an  interview.  </P> <P> In the study, 41 men and women who had histories of heart problems were  subjected to cardiac, lung and blood tests while at rest and while riding a  stationary bicycle. The volunteers then sat, idle, for several minutes in rooms  with 100 and 200 parts per million carbon monoxide, after which they exercised  and were tested again.  </P> <P> Volunteers exposed to carbon monoxide before or during exercise were three  times more likely to suffer abnormal heartbeats or other cardiac irregularities  associated with heart attack. Dangerous irregularities arose even when they sat  still, breathing the carbon monoxide-rich air. Exercising or simply breathing  in a carbon monoxide-rich environment also increased the rate of ischemia  (blocked blood vessels) in all volunteers.  </P></p>

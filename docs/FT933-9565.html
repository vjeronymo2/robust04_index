			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mt Edon/Burmine The proposed three-way merger between Europa Minerals, a small UK mining finance house, and two Australian companies with which it already has close associations, Austmin and Burmine, is looking increasingly problematical after a further intervention by Mount Edon, another Australian concern. Mount Edon, which is backed by Swiss money, already owns 18 per cent of Europa and recently made an approach which might lead to an offer for the rest. Now it has turned to Burmine, which some analysts believe might be its prime target, and paid about ADollars 3.3m for an 8.8 per cent stake. Europa owns 41.8 per cent of Burmine and Austmin holds 19.8 per cent of Europa.</p>

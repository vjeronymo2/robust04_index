			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Banks give Isosceles time for refinancing AFTER A meeting of Isosceles' lenders and shareholders a standstill agreement between the heavily indebted company, which owns the Gateway food retail group, and its banks is expected to be signed before Christmas. The standstill would give the group, which has debt of Pounds 1.3bn, time to complete a refinancing designed to give it a suitable financial structure. This is likely to involve swapping a large part of the debt into equity. Without a standstill, allowing Isosceles not to pay interest or make capital repayments of its debt, the group could go into receivership. The problem has become more pressing as suppliers were nervous about giving Gateway credit. Some suggested that they would not deliver stock for the Christmas trading week without reassurance from the group's bankers. One supplier said 'frankly we were all getting rather worried' but added that with a standstill in place suppliers would be more relaxed. It is also likely that Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, chief executive of Isosceles and Gateway, will leave the group within the next two weeks. He only took on the role at Gateway in October when Mr Bob Willett resigned. Headhunters have already started the search for another chief executive. The group's 38 banks, chaired by Midland Bank, which took over that role from SG Warburg three weeks ago, met on Thursday at the offices of Hill Samuel, the merchant bank which was appointed to advise the company last month. The meeting lasted until midnight. The mood of the meeting was said to be more pragmatic and constructive, with shareholders accepting the need for dilution of their equity. Wasserstein Perella, the New York firm which holds 30 per cent of Isosceles' shares in its buy-out fund, is said now to accept that its stake will be diluted. Many of the group's equity holders have already written off their investments, although Wasserstein Perella has yet to do so. Last week 3i, the venture capital group, wrote down its Pounds 28m mezzanine investment in Isosceles too. Other mezzanine lenders are likely to follow. The standstill will give Isosceles, formed in 1989 through a Pounds 2.1bn takeover, time to review its trading strategy with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the management consultant which has already started work. Isosceles has already had two refinancings. The first, completed at Christmas 1990, added Pounds 150m of equity to the Pounds 200m put in originally. A further Pounds 87m of equity was provided through the conversion of part of the Pounds 375m mezzanine debt. This summer a second restructuring allowed deferral of Pounds 48m of mezzanine interest, the conversion of preference shares into ordinary shares, and the resetting of the banks' covenants.</p>

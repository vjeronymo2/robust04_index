			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEATING GRAND JURY CONSIDERED OTHER S&amp;L INDICTMENTS  </P> <P> The state grand jury that indicted Charles H. Keating Jr. and three others on  securities fraud also considered charging several other employees of Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan and its parent firm with wrongdoing, recently released grand  jury transcripts reveal.  </P> <P> But to keep the complex case manageable, prosecutors advised the 22-member  panel to limit the indictment to the top officials of Lincoln and Phoenix-based  American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> "We want to go after the people truly responsible for this behavior in a way  that promises some possibility of success in a time frame soon enough to be  meaningful to the victims," Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas  Papageorge told the grand jurors.  </P> <P> The result was a 42-count indictment in mid-September for alleged securities  fraud against Keating, former American Continental President Judy J. Wischer  and Robin S. Symes and Ray C. Fidel, both former presidents of Irvine-based  Lincoln.  </P> <P> On Friday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito set aside 22 counts of  the indictment because many of the charges did not clearly state the alleged  wrongdoing. The judge gave the prosecutors until Nov. 19 to rewrite the  indictment.  </P> <P> The indictment charges the defendants with falsely stating and failing to state  the true risks associated with the sale of $200 million in American Continental  bonds to more than 17,000 investors. Those bonds became worthless after the  company filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989, and regulators seized  Lincoln the next day. Regulators estimate that Lincoln's collapse will cost  taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> The grand jury transcripts, which were released Friday, give a picture of the  prosecutor's strategy. The state wanted to keep the indictment narrow to make  it understandable to a trial court jury.  </P> <P> Toward that end, prosecutors decided to drop their original effort to seek  charges of conspiracy and grand theft by false pretenses because the charges  were too complex and difficult to prove, the grand jury transcripts show.  </P> <P> At the closing arguments before the grand jury on Sept. 11, prosecutors came  with a proposed indictment in hand naming Keating and three others. They argued  against expanding the case to include more defendants or more charges.  </P> <P> One of the grand jurors, Glenn Buchanan of Sherman Oaks, confirmed in an  interview Monday that the panel considered including several other Lincoln and  American Continental officials in the indictment but finally agreed with the  prosecutor's approach.  </P> <P> Buchanan said grand jurors considered bringing charges against American  Continental executives Robert J. Kielty, Andrew Ligget and Jack D. Atchison and  Lincoln executive Dariush Razavi, a top aide to Fidel. The grand jury discussed  indicting at least two others.  </P> <P> While none of the people identified by Buchanan have been indicted, their names  appear often in the 4,500 pages of grand jury testimony publicly released. They  could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Before joining American Continental at a salary of nearly $1 million, Atchison  had been a partner at the accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co. in Phoenix  and was head of the audit team that produced the last two American Continental  financial statements.  </P> <P> Those statements, much criticized by thrift regulators, were largely what the  state Department of Corporations relied on in approving the sale of American  Continental bonds, even though the state agency's staff had developed a strong  case for denying approval of the bond sale.  </P> <P> The grand jury also wanted to delve more into the role of state regulators in  the sale of nearly $200 million worth of debt securities at Irvine-based  Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches, he said.  </P> <P> Buchanan said a minority of grand jurors wanted to bring in more regulators to  determine the state's role in approving the sale of the bonds, but proposals to  subpoena them were defeated. A separate investigation by the Sacramento  district attorney's office is looking into possible wrongdoing involving state  officials.  </P> <P> The grand jury also narrowly voted down a proposal to subpoena U.S. Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.), he said, to testify about his relationship with Keating,  former chairman of American Continental.  </P> <P> In August, near the end of the investigation, the grand jury came close to  issuing a subpoena for Cranston, Buchanan said, but instead sent a letter  simply requesting him to appear. The senator's lawyer responded at the time  that Cranston, who was out of the country at the time, was too busy and could  not provide meaningful information.  </P></p>

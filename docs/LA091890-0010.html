			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTRADITION OF DOCTOR  </P> <P> In your Aug. 13 editorial, "Judicial Reversal, Political Problem," you suggest  that the United States could request the formal extradition of Dr. Humberto  Alvarez Machain, who has been indicted in connection with the torture-murder of  Drug Enforcement Special Agent Enrique Camarena. Although the U.S. and Mexico  have entered into an extradition treaty, that agreement does not upset Mexican  law or the historic interpretation of that law by Mexican officials.  </P> <P> The greatest problem in our extradition relations with Mexico is that Mexico  does not extradite its citizens to face criminal charges brought in the U.S.  Pursuant to Mexican law, extradition of its citizens is barred except in  "exceptional cases." We know of no instance in which this has occurred, nor are  we aware of what Mexico might view as circumstances sufficient to justify the  exercise of this authority.  </P> <P> Consequently, the extradition option you raise is not available to the United  States in order to bring Dr. Alvarez Machain to trial.  </P> <P> JOHN C. KEENEY  </P> <P> Acting Assistant Attorney General  </P> <P> Criminal Division, U.S. Dept. of Justice  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

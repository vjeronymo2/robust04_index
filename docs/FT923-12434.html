			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Motorway brings some real countryside within reach / Finding some attractive property nestling in the pleasant landscape along the M40 corridor DRIVERS have taken a while to appreciate the attractions of the M40, the alternative route from London to Birmingham via Oxford, Banbury and Warwick. When it opened in January 1991 traffic was sparse. But long before then the road had had an impact on the property market in the 'M40 corridor'. In 1988, prices leapt 5 per cent above the 35-40 per cent general increase in the South East, as buyers anticipated that the new road would make the beautiful, little-known country of north Oxfordshire, south Northamptonshire and south Warwickshire a delightful  - and undervalued - place to live in and commute from. Today, the M40 - a less exhausting drive than the M1 - is busy. Even so, it still offers a fast route for people who live near it. From Banbury it takes 80-90 minutes to reach London's West End and less than an hour to Birmingham. Tim Hammond, a pharmaceutical consultant based at Pinner, recently moved from St Albans to an old farmhouse near Bicester when he found that his family could live in real country, in a better value house, only a 60-75 minutes' journey from his office. 'Every ten miles out of London along the M40 corridor, you get that much more house for your money', says relocation agent Patrick Doyne of Stacks (0608-661594), until you meet the demand pushing down from Birmingham. Slowly the M40 is transforming the country in a 20 mile radius of Banbury and, says Ian McConnel of Savills: 'If you have a good house, new on the market and realistically priced, someone will snap it up'. In Culworth, eight miles north east, both the Manor House and Wheatsheaf House found immediate buyers last month, paying the sensible asking prices. The countryside is packed with places to visit, from Blenheim Palace and Stowe to the Rollright Stones. There are spired churches set against large skies and in Lois Weedon graveyard is the monument of the poet Edith Sitwell with her hands sculpted in bronze by Henry Moore. Horses rule many lives in the M40 corridor and on the roads are a constant deterrent from driving too fast. Hunting is with the Heythrop, Warwickshire, Grafton or Bicester - when you may meet the FT's Robin Lane Fox. There are drawbacks. There is a dearth of places to eat, the maps in The Good Food Guide show a large blank round Banbury. The Department of Transport has renumbered the roads to encourage people on to the M40. This does not confuse the locals, but it has made all the maps out of date. The M40 has also encouraged crimes against property, as burglars - like housebuyers - have spotted how quickly they can drive from Newcastle or Bristol and do the robbery. They are back on the motorway before the burglar alarm has been switched off. Motorway noise is another trouble: 600-700 claims wait with the District Valuer in Oxford, for reduction in the value of property because of motorway noise, under part 1 of the Land Compensation Act. Inquire carefully if you are buying near the road. Ask also if village bypasses are planned - several are in train in Northamptonshire - and how the land around you is zoned for development when speculative builders start work again in a few years. In the mid-80s many villagers sold their kitchen gardens for huge sums as 'infill' building plots. Today realistic prices are 30-40 per cent below the August 1988 level. Cottages are always available. Lane Fox in Banbury (0295-273592) has a tiny essence-of-England thatched cottage in the small village of Thenford at Pounds 110,000, with the extra attractions that it is four miles from the motorway, and Michael Heseltine is village squire. In Weston, near Brackley, Lane Fox is offering the Post Cottage at Pounds 128,000, a Northamptonshire vernacular building in limestone with darker ironstone banding typical of the local style. In Fritwell, near Bicester it has a refreshingly un-vernacular Georgian box-shaped, sash-windowed cottage at Pounds 179,500, and in Adderbury, a smart village outside Banbury with a noble church often used for concerts, Adkin (0295-277781) is selling the former village school at Pounds 195,000. Thirty minutes closer to London, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Oxford (0865-790077) offers Creeper Cottage at Pounds 215,000 in Great Milton, home of Raymond Blanc's Manoir aux Quat' Saisons restaurant. The next price level includes grand houses in larger villages, such as Deddington, where Savills (0295-263535) offers The Little House, or Priors Marston near Daventry where Lane Fox has Hillview House, both at Pounds 250,000. In Woodstock, near the gates of Blenheim, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley is selling the elegant, Georgian Old Town House at Pounds 475,000. Halifax in Banbury (0295-271199) has Aston Farmhouse, with a Northamptonshire banded facade, in Aston-le-Walls at Pounds 300,000. Right at the top of the range are two splendid country houses. Poundon House near Bicester (Savills, Pounds 1.25m) is grand Queen Anne, and Catesby House near Daventry is Jacobean, incorporating Tudor linenfold panelling and a genuine Jacobean staircase (Jackson-Stops in Northampton, 0604-32991, Pounds 725,000). Cluttons offers an estate at Stoke Lyne, two miles from exit 10 on the M40, at Pounds 1.4m as a whole, or for sale in parts. The biggest attraction for the better off may be the old Morrell family house and estate at Broughton Grange west of Banbury, which has been in the family for 200 years. One owner was Philip Morrell MP, husband of Lady Ottoline of Bloomsbury Group fame, but he and his wife did not live there. They were busy entertaining Maynard Keynes, Duncan Grant, DH Lawrence and the rest at Garsington which is itself near the M40 outside Oxford. Savills is offering Broughton Grange for Pounds 950,000.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Gardening: Storm-smashed Tresco proves there is life on earth after death - Robin Lane Fox visits the Isles of Scilly and finds that a horticultural paradise is being regained, slowly I HAVE JUST spent two days, walking through a paradise which is recovering from disaster. Disasters are not supposed to happen in paradise and they make me desperate but, in future, I will remember Tresco - the proof that there is life on earth after death. For more than 100 years there have been huge, private gardens dotted out in the Atlantic at Tresco abbey on the Isles of Scilly . In 1893, the Gardeners' Chronicle wrote: 'Never have the fine sub-tropical gardens of Tresco presented such a remarkable appearance as at the present time, nor has its equal been seen in any other part of the United Kingdom, perhaps not in Europe.' In those days, there was no helicopter to shorten the journey - although there was a railway to Penzance, which was possibly no slower than the modern version on a bad day. Nonetheless, for years I never went there. The flora sounded completely alien and needed an Arthur Hellyer to understand it. I dislike palms, and some of the old photos implied a style of seaside bedding which looked as if it was training for Britain in Bloom. Paradise repaid the compliment and managed happily without me until I planned to catch a boat in 1987. It forestalled me by falling to pieces: a freak month of snow and chilly wind beset the gardens and murdered the flora, which had never known such conditions before. The famous flame trees died by the score and more than 90 per cent of the rarities from the Antipodes were destroyed. The staff tried to rally under the leadership of Mike Nelhams, then only 30 but appointed as head gardener a short time before. By 1990, progress had been promising and I planned again for a visit. But paradises do not like atheists: a stupendous gale in January that year wiped out the tall cover, ripped through the boundary trees and disposed of the garden's backbone. If I had been in charge, I would have resigned the following morning. Not so Nelhams (or Tresco's present owner, Robert Dorrien Smith). Perhaps it was fortunate that disaster befell two men young enough to be resilient. While the older, life-long staff were distraught, Nelhams could see the chance for a resurrection - rather than a mindless restoration - with the scope for variation and possible improvement. Such is Tresco's collection that it is easy to forget the place was funded entirely privately. A century ago its founder, Augustus Smith, was known for being almost too covetous of plants and 'gifts' from the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew, in London. His successor maintained equally wide contacts - among them, the great garden at La Mortola, the child of the Hanbury family who were planting in a remarkably similar style. Since 1987, Tresco has been begging once again from Kew and ordering seeds from the newly-revived La Mortola list. English Heritage has made a generous commitment to an agreed five-year plan, which could cost up to Pounds 400,000 eventually and involves massive clearing and replanting several thousand trees on the adjoining hill. Otherwise, Tresco has to fund itself to the tune of about Pounds 90,000. Up to Pounds 20,000 comes from its notable plant stall and most of the rest from visitors' fees. There might be rather more if a stop could be put to French visitors' occasional habit of rear entry. The less thoughtful of them still land on the beach and - as I discovered while inspecting the nursery - enter illicitly, like Norman raiders, over the low garden wall. The rest of you should certainly go through the gate and enjoy what is on show already. Masses of plants are in flower; the famous hedges of holm oak are still in place; the Canary Island palms seem quite untroubled; and rarities from Mexico have proved much tougher than expected. On almost every point, my mind's-eye view of Tresco has been refuted. I had thought the place was an unstructured jungle; that the plants were all steamy cacti; and that you had only to plant a cutting and the Gulf Stream, the soil and the humidity would hurry it to maturity within three years. Admittedly, there is a plant from Tresco in the Guinness Book of Records: once, a yucca Whipplei grew more than 12 ft in only 14 days. The growth, however, was its flower stem. Elsewhere, progress is much slower. The garden is very dry: the soil is less than 2 ft deep above much of the granite and the staff of only four full-timers cannot water seriously in 12 acres of flower-bed. It rises steeply from lower to upper terraces and the climate varies from cool to hot and barren. Even before 1987, it took a flame tree 30 years to reach a significant height. Almost every year since the 1880s, diarists have been referring to sea gales and the losses of a few significant trees; 1990 differed in degree, not kind, but the loss of the windbreaks has been doubly awful. The lower layers are now exposed to new winds and drought and the views are no compensation. 'If I can see a view,' Nelhams told me, 'it means that the wind can see me.' Tresco's core is a pair of long, straight walks, less than 10 ft wide, which cross at right angles and run its entire length and width. They remind me at once of the similar backbone to great Italian Renaissance gardens; the Villa Medici, for instance, in Rome. Tresco's first owner must have seen them, a model for his plan which is wonderfully formal at its centre. Even before the storms, there were old friends among the exotics. Huge trees of camellias rub shoulders with rare banksias; honeysuckle is mixed among rarities from New Zealand; the abutilons are a fabulous sight with their white and mauve flowers; the subtly winding path on the upper terrace runs between a steep rockery, set with familiar pelargoniums and non-rock plants. The soft plantings and the tender echiums are looking spectacular this weekend, bearing great spikes of flower like erect foxes' brushes in shades of violet and blue; if you can find it, echium Webbii is the most brilliant blue wonder, but only for a frost-free garden. At Tresco, Nelhams told me, 'the usual rules of colour planning do not apply.' And, as the sun set on the lovely homerias on the upper terrace, I eavesdropped on two tourists, startled by the echoes of their own Australia. 'If only the whole island looked like this garden,' they told each other, wistfully, 'we could imagine we were back at home.' To my eye, it is a mercy that it never will. Forty years from now, with luck, my old age and your children will together appreciate Paradise Regained. Tresco owes a huge debt to the Nelhams' optimism, the backing of the family, and the devoted work of the few gardeners. One of the most important recoveries in British gardening history looks as if it will succeed. But we must pray for more winters like 1992 and rapid success for the new Heritage windbreaks.</p>

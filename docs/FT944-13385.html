			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains eliminated following gilts auction - Market report Strong selling of stock index futures at the close of trading yesterday hit a UK stock market where early gains had already been almost eliminated following a very poor response to the auction of Pounds 2.5bn of five-year British government bonds. The FT-SE 100 Index slipped below the 3,000 mark again in the final minutes and traders expressed pessimism ahead of this morning's opening. Equities were helped at first by a brightening of the currency scene after the French Economic Minister professed readiness to join in any dollar support plans and the governor of the Bank of Japan rejected suggestions that the US was acquiescing in a weak dollar. With long-dated UK bonds firmer in line with other bond markets on the improved dollar sentiment, the Footsie had gained 28.8 points by mid-morning. But 3,029.7 proved to be the day's high point as first reports from the gilts auction reached the stock market. The market's advance was quickly routed. A brief rally as Federal bonds responded to a gain of only 0.1 per cent in US durable goods orders for September proved a false dawn and markets turned off again in London and New York as interest rate worries resurfaced in nervous equity markets. By the close, when losses in UK gilts were half a point down on the day, the FT-SE 100 Share Index was a net 1 point off at 2,999.9. The sudden rush of selling in the futures market drove the December futures contract on the FT-SE Index down to 2,993. Some traders perceived a turn for the worse in futures trading over the past few sessions. London dealers warned that the UK market could face a difficult opening this morning after the auction of five year Federal notes overnight; the Bundesbank policy council meets today and tomorrow brings the gross domestic product statistics in the US. The Dow Industrial Average was 9 points down when London closed for the day. The withdrawal of buying support across the full range of the market brought a further fall of 7.4 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which closed 3,467.2. Business in non-Footsie stocks made up around 60 per cent of the day's total of 517.4m shares through the Seaq electronic network, itself a dip of just over 9 per cent from the previous session. The UK market faces important trading statements today from several blue chip companies likely to provide a lead for the market. The insurance sector performed well for most of yesterday's session, with dealers taking the view that the generally negative report on pension fund sales from the Securities Investment Board largely taken into share prices already. Oil shares also performed well as good results from the US oil firms outweighed any worries over the US currency. Recommendations from stockbroking analysts brought a number of firm spots across the range. Consumer and retail issues stood up well in spite of the warning on inflationary pressures this week from the Confederation of British Industry. The London securities arm of UBS warned clients that while the CBI survey took place against a background of continued strong growth in the UK economy, the recent gross domestic product statistics had suggested that the pace of growth was slowing. Moreover, said UBS, the survey's references to capacity shortages and unit cost pressures suggested that the medium term outlook for inflation could be 'distinctly gloomy.' However, Paribas Capital Markets, forecasting Footsie at 3,300 at the end of the year, believes that base rates will remain at current levels until then. It claims that market perceptions that that significant increases in inflation and interest rates are threatened is 'right in principle but likely .. to be hopelessly wrong in degree.'</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Nokia mobile phone debut Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications group, yesterday became the first European manufacturer to start selling cellular phones in Japan, write Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo and Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The move marks the entry of Europe's largest mobile phone manufacturer into the world's second-largest mobile phone market. It follows last month's deregulation when it became possible to sell mobile phones in Japan for the first time. Previously it was only possible to lease them. The Finnish group has delivery agreements with two operators in Tokyo and Kyoto, with a third accord, in the Nagoya region, due to come into force in July. Last year Nokia and Mitsui, the Japanese trading house, established a joint venture to import Nokia's phones. Last week it signed up Casio, the maker of watches and calculators, to supply its customer support services. Nokia expects mobile phone sales in Japan to reach between 1.3m and 1.4m this year, including 300,000 digital phone sales. It aims to capture around 25 per cent of the digital market.

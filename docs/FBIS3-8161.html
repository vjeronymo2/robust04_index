			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release by Traian Chebeleu, spokesman for Romania's </F> Presidency, issued in Bucharest on 28 February: "But ROMANIA  LIBERA Continues To Lie"]    [Text] The daily ROMANIA LIBERA on 28 February 1994  published an article entitled "Accused of Espionage -- a Great  Dilemma for the Romanian Secret Services; The Key Man Is  Intelligence General Nikos Grylakis," signed by Sorin Rosca  Stanescu.    Giving absolute credit to the recent accusations made by  Deputy Traian Basescu [of the Democratic Party (National  Salvation Front)], which it considers as the pure truth, ROMANIA  LIBERA -- with a persistence worthy of a better case -- wants to  involve the presidency and its representatives in the affair of  the sale of the Romanian fleet [illegally sold to Greek  businessman Stellos Katounis, owner of the shipping company  Forum Maritime]. This time, the "cause" is served by Sorin  Rosca Stanescu, who, probably out of the desire to return to  ROMANIA LIBERA en-force, only proves that he has not forgotten  the practices used by the old Securitate, whose reliable  informer he had been.    The article claims that "representatives of the executive  branch" and the presidential institution have supplied secret  information regarding the Petromin fleet to Greek intelligence  General Nikos Grylakis. In this connection, Democratic Party  Deputy Basescu named two names: Minister of Transport Paul  Teodoru and Vasile Ionel, President Ion Iliescu's adviser.  "Until now, the representatives of the government, as well as  those of the presidential institution, have not officially  denied anything," the article claims, adding that General  Grylakis has "influenced President Iliescu's election," for  which he "received a medal in Bucharest in 1993; Iliescu does  not deny this."    Romanian President Ion Iliescu has often stated his opinion  on the Petromin-Forum Maritime affair, but to maintain its  accusations of indifference and silence ROMANIA LIBERA chooses  to deliberately ignore this thing. We recall that on 24 June  1993, when he was first time asked about the contract between  the Petromin and Forum Maritime companies, President Ion Iliescu  said: "This is not one of my prerogatives; I am not obliged,  nor do I think it is necessary for me to deal with these  problems that belong to the national economic sphere. I do not  have the necessary instruments for that or the necessary  qualifications. There is no presidential department in charge  of these matters, which do not fall under the competence of the  presidential institution. This is a matter to be dealt with by  the trade companies or public corporations involved in these  affairs and by the relevant government officials, ministries,  and economic-financial control bodies. I do not deny that there  might be suspicions in connection with the seriousness and  professionalism with which the respective negotiations were  conducted. All this should be examined." (From the press  communique of the presidential spokesman No. 164/1993)    In the meantime, the Romanian press gave details about the  Petromin-Forum Maritime affair, so that on 23 July 1993, the  presidential spokesman summed up President Ion Iliescu's  viewpoint on this subject in two points:    "1. The Petromin-Forum Maritime contract should be examined  by the bodies set up for this purpose, namely the respective  parliamentary and government commissions, so that a normal  contract can be concluded which does not disadvantage the  Romanian state.    "2. The situation of all contracts previously concluded by  Petromin should be clarified and the results of the enquiry  should be published, with the relevant bodies being notified if  needed."    ROMANIA LIBERA's claim that General Grylakis "influenced  President Iliescu's election" is ridiculous, to say the least,  so it does not deserve any comment. Regarding the alleged medal  awarded by Romania's president to General Grylakis, Sorin Rosca  Stanescu should have known that the practice of awarding medals  was discontinued in our country after the December 1989  revolution. As a matter of fact, the spokesman mentioned that  thing on another occasion, in answer to a question about a  similar allegation made by daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. (From the  spokesman's press communique N. 213/1993)    Regarding the accusations made by Deputy Traian Basescu,  according to which General Vasile Ionel would have supplied a  file with secret data to the Greek general, we reprint here the  answer given by the presidential adviser to the daily ULTIMUL  CUVANT on 28 February 1994: "It is the statement of a man who  does not assume responsibility for what he is saying. I will  disappoint Mr. Basescu and those inclined to believe him by  responsibly stating that I do not know what they are talking  about." A first logical question is why would such a commercial  transaction -- over the Petromin fleet -- have to involve files  with secret data and the interference of an official from the  presidency?    Of course, it is easy to realize that there are various  quarters interested in sowing as much confusion as possible in  this respect and divert attention from what has to be clarified,  namely the ways and means through which part of the Petromin  fleet was sold abroad.    Romania's president considers that the legal system is the  only one capable of ascertaining the truth of these accusations;  consequently, he hopes that the legal bodies will shed some  light on what is called "the Petromin affair." Any rumors or  "information" deliberately launched in this connection can only  encumber the normal proceedings of the inquiry -- the press  communique released by the spokesman of the Romanian presidency  concludes.</p>

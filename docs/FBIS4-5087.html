			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan's Desire To Become Military Power Unchanged"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa never let a chance pass by without claiming  that "Japan would never be a military power" and "Japan should  set the pace in worldwide arms cut." He is straining every nerve  to convince the Asian nations in particular that Japan will not  choose to be a military power. Commenting on this, a NODONG  SINMUN analyst today says: But what Japan is doing totally  gainsays this. In fact, its armed forces are being beefed up  and its conversion into a military power is being hastened.    The analyst points out:    The Japanese Government decided to allocate 45,000 million  dollars to military expenditure this year.    It must not be overlooked that Japan is arming the  "self-defence forces" with long-range attack weapons.    Nuclear armament is an immediate main goal in converting  Japan into a military power. Having completed material and  technical preparations for the manufacture of nuclear weapons,  Japan developed and launched even a nuclear-capable space rocket.    After paving the way for the dispatch of troops overseas,  Japan has taken a mobilisation posture so that it may send  large combat units anywhere and any time.    In categorically denying Japan's scheme to convert itself  into a military power, the Japanese authorities seek to lull the  concern of the Asian peoples over the danger of its aggression  and dull their caution.    It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese ruling quarters  to become a military power and realise their old dream of "the  greater east Asia coprosperity sphere" with strength.    The Asian people are watching the movement of Japan with  heightened vigilance.    The conversion of Japan into a military power and its  overseas aggression will lead it to self-destruction.    Japan must act with discretion, not forgetting the lesson of  history.</p>

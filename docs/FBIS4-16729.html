			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander of Georgian Interior troops, Vladimir  Chikovani, has accused Abkhazia of causing the impasse in the  talks on the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the zone of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. The recent round of talks was held  in Geneva.    In an interview with Interfax, Chikovani, who took part in  the talks, said that the Abkhazian delegation occupied an  "obstinate and unconstructive stand" and demanded the UN troops  deployment along the confrontation line on the Inguri River.  The Georgian troops, he said, are demanded by Abkhazia to be  withdrawn eight kilometers away from the river.    Such demands, said Chikovani, run counter to commonsense and  cannot guarantee the safety of refugees.    The Georgian side favors the deployment of peacekeepers  along  the entire territory of Abkhazia, including along the border  with Russia which passes along the Psou River.</p>

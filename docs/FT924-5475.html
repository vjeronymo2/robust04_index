			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to fight rivals' plans for new network AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) has raised objections to an agreement between MCI Communications and Stentor, a consortium of Canadian telephone service companies, to create the first integrated North American telephone network. AT&amp;T said it had asked the US Federal Communications Commission to investigate if the agreement, announced in September, violated policy against exclusive arrangements between US and foreign telephone companies. MCI is the second-largest long-distance telephone service provider in the US, after AT&amp;T. The Stentor consortium includes nine of Canada's telephone companies, including Bell Canada. AT&amp;T also said yesterday it had notified MCI and Stentor that their proposed use of MCI's 'intelligent network' software in Canada could violate AT&amp;T patents. Stentor is to pay MCI a one-time fee of Dollars 150m for rights to use this software as part of the alliance agreement. The US and Canadian groups also agreed to develop further 'intelligent network' services. AT&amp;T claims, however, that the MCI software violates patents covering technology enabling services such as toll-free numbers, credit card verification and those allowing businesses to create private telephone links using public network lines. The longstanding patent dispute between AT&amp;T and MCI has taken on a new dimension with MCI's agreement with Stentor. 'We will not allow MCI to get a free ride on AT&amp;T's Dollars 3bn annual investment in research and development,' said Ms Judith A. Maynes, vice-president (law) for AT&amp;T. MCI responded to AT&amp;T's assertions with a strongly-worded statement accusing AT&amp;T of 'trying to restrain competition around the world.' Commenting on AT&amp;T's patent infringement claims , MCI said that its intelligent network technology is not 'reliant on any AT&amp;T hardware or software'.</p>

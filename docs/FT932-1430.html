			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank advances PROFITS at Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest bank, grew at 'a double-digit rate' in the first five months of the year, the bank's chief executive said yesterday, writes David Waller. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen did not go into details, but said that the growth  - which follows an increase in operating profits of more than a quarter in the first three months of the year - was more due to strong trading gains than an increase in interest income. The comment shows the continuing prosperity of the German banking sector in terms of total operating profits, which include gains from own account securities dealing. But the figure takes no account of provisions against bad and doubtful debts. Commerzbank's shares have risen against the market in recent weeks. Although the bank, almost alone among big German financial institutions, could be vulnerable to a takeover, Mr Kohlhaussen said yesterday there were was no evidence that a third party was accumulating shares.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Court hears EU Gatt case Member states of the European Union and the European Commission yesterday came before judges at the European Court of Justice for a case, the outcome of which should allow the EU to ratify the Uruguay Round trade accord before the January 1 1995 deadline. The commission asked the court for its opinion after a disagreement with member states over who has the power to negotiate in certain trade areas - such as transport, services, and intellectual property rights. The commission has argued it should ratify the Uruguay Round, under those articles of the Rome and Maastricht treaties that give it exclusive authority to negotiate on trade. But member states yesterday argued there was a limit as to how far the commission could claim to have exclusive competence in these areas. The judges are expected to give their opinion on what constitutes the correct legal basis for ratification on November 15.</p>

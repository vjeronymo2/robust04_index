			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW PRESIDENT OF WHITTIER COLLEGE IS WIDELY HAILED  </P> <P> James L. Ash Jr., selected last week to be president of Whittier College, is  described by colleagues as one of the brightest, most creative administrators  in higher education.  </P> <P> Ash is now vice provost for student affairs at the University of Miami, a  private university of 13,000 students in Coral Gables, Fla.  </P> <P> The 43-year-old historian, an ordained Presbyterian minister, is credited with  raising student enrollment in the university's honors program from 200 to  1,300. He also drew praise for helping set up a residential dormitory program  modeled after programs at America's Ivy League colleges, which borrowed the  idea from England's Oxford and Cambridge universities.  </P> <P> Ash will become Whittier's 12th president in July, succeeding Eugene S. Mills,  63. Mills announced last fall that he will retire in June after a decade as  president of the small but venerable college, which has been suffering from  declining enrollment and chronic budget problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vote Was Unanimous  </P> <P> Trustees of the 101-year-old college and its 500-student law school voted  unanimously at a special meeting Wednesday night to give the post to Ash.  </P> <P> He says he was not looking for a job.  </P> <P> "I was minding my own business in Miami," he said, when he received a call  asking if he would be interested. "And the more I discovered, the more I was  convinced that Whittier College was an academic jewel."  </P> <P> In a brief telephone interview from Miami, Ash said: "The challenges are the  same challenges that every liberal arts college faces in the next five years in  this country." Two of the most important challenges, he said, are retaining a  quality faculty and overcoming what he calls "unfavorable demographics," a  shrinking pool of college-age youngsters.  </P> <P> The next three years, he said, represent a valley in college admissions because  there will be fewer people turning 18 and starting college than in previous  years. And, as the older academic generation retires and the Ph.D. glut that  characterized the 1970s and '80s disappears, he said, there is fierce  competition for bright young faculty members. Universities are raiding smaller  colleges that hired the faculty members during the glut.  </P> <P> Ash acknowledged, too, that Whittier, compared to many other private colleges,  has a meager endowment. But the man who always takes a positive approach to  problems, according to one Miami colleague, put a positive face on the  fund-raising aspect of his new job.  </P> <P> "Part of my responsibility will be to give the Southern California community a  chance to participate in the strengthening of one of their major resources,"  Ash said.  </P> <P> He said he will maintain Whittier's generous scholarship policies, which some  Whittier administrators have acknowledged contributed to the college's budget  problems.  </P> <P> At Miami, Ash teaches one class a semester and says he will do the same at  Whittier, although maybe not the first year. Ash joined the university in 1977  as an assistant professor of religious studies. He later served as chairman of  the religious studies department.  </P> <P> He holds a Ph.D. in American social, religious and intellectual history, a  master's degree from the University of Chicago, and a master's degree in  theology from Southern Methodist University. He is a native of Texas and did  his undergraduate work at Abilene Christian University.  </P> <P> He wrote "Protestantism in the American University," published by Southern  Methodist University Press, and is finishing another book, "Primitivism in  American Religion."  </P> <P> "That's what I do to keep intellectually alive and it's more like fun than  work," Ash said of his writing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wife Has Dean's Job  </P> <P> His wife, Patricia Bryan Ash, will give up her job as assistant dean at the  University of Miami Law School, to move to California. The couple have two  daughters, ages 11 and 13.  </P> <P> Colleagues and students who were contacted at Miami last week viewed Ash's  impending departure with regret.  </P> <P> "You run into people in your lifetime that have that kind of personality and  seem to . . . inspire others," said David Kling, Ash's assistant at Miami.  "That's why he's good for Whittier, because Whittier needs a shot in the arm."  </P> <P> "It is a tremendous gain for Whittier," said Deborah Perry, associate provost  and dean of enrollments at Miami, where Ash is credited with transforming  university enrollment by boosting the number of honors students, and with  helping create the residential college system in which faculty families were  moved into student living quarters, where seminars were held and learning labs  were established.  </P> <P> "Rather than just being a place to sleep, (the dorm) became a place to live and  learn," Perry said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bright and Creative  </P> <P> "He is one of the brightest, most creative higher education administrators in  the country today," she said. "With Jim's guidance," she said, "the university  has been able to bring itself into a stable enrollment environment."  </P> <P> To draw more honors students to the university, she said, Ash expanded the  course offerings in the honors program and drew the best professors on campus  into it.  </P> <P> Twice, students have named him professor of the year, said Robert S. Marshall,  assistant news editor of the university newspaper. "He's very respected by  everyone on campus who comes in contact with him," Marshall said.  </P></p>

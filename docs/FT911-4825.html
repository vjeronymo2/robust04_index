			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: EIS builds up bid cash with Pounds 18m rights - Profits advance of 13% to Pounds 12m represents 20th year of growth EIS GROUP, the specialist engineer, is stoking up its acquisition fund with an Pounds 18.3m rights issue that will add to cash already held. The group, which has made 14 purchases over the past five years, also announced its 20th year of profit growth with a pre-tax figure ahead by almost 13 per cent from Pounds 11.95m to Pounds 13.48m in 1990 on turnover up 13 per cent at Pounds 177.52m. The shares rose 3p to 330p on the announcement of the 1-for-4 issue, at 265p per share. It is two years since EIS's last rights issue which raised Pounds 12.5m. Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said that on that occasion the group had slipped into debt of about Pounds 2m after a series of acquisitions. This time the cash raised would help avoid short-term borrowings. 'We like to have cash, and not just when interest rates are high. It's useful when negotiating with vendors, particularly outside the UK,' he said. Many of its acquisitions would continue to be overseas. Last year the group made 34 per cent of its sales and just over half its pre-tax profit in the UK, with other EC countries accounting for 32 per cent of turnover, America 17 per cent and Asia 11 per cent. Net cash held by the group declined from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 5m. Interest income was Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 965,000). Acquisitions absorbed Pounds 4m and brought in Pounds 4m debt. Capital spending, notably on computer-controlled machine tools and computer-aided design equipment, rose to Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 6.9m). All three division improved their contributions. In the Flexibox seals and couplings group, operating profit increased to Pounds 4.67m (Pounds 4.16m) on sales of Pounds 45.86m (Pounds 40.12m). Process equipment made Pounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.04m) on sales of Pounds 86.08m (Pounds 77.29m), in spite of a halt in exports to Iraq and Kuwait which led to a Pounds 505,000 extraordinary provision. The reorganised aircraft and precision engineering division improved to Pounds 3.17m after a decline to Pounds 2.63m in 1989. Mr Haslehurst said action to ward off the effects of recession had included maximising exports and reducing costs. Earnings per share, affected by the 1989 share issue, rose 8 per cent to 29.949p (27.685p). A proposed final dividend of 8.375p makes a total of 11.4p (10.45p). COMMENT EIS is full of old-fashioned virtues such as rigorous cash management, investment to improve productivity and a painstaking approach to acquisition. The decision to launch a rights issue when it still has cash in the bank is typical of its conservative approach. The policy has worked like clockwork so far. Through the 1980s, it had a rights issue every two or three years, always in April, and the resultant purchases have proved their worth. It will, however, be tough for it to continue earnings per share growth this year, even if pre-tax profit advances to about Pounds 15m. A prospective p/e of 11.2 puts it on a small premium to the engineering sector. Further progress in the price will depend on the scope of future acquisitions.</p>

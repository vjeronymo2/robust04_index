			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Shanghai] </F>   [Text] China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, is  preparing to make his traditional televised appearance to convey  New Year's greetings to the people of Shanghai next month,  according to sources in the eastern metropolis.    Mr Deng, 89, is expected to make a short speech before a  specially invited audience of Shanghai government and Communist  Party leaders on Lunar New Year's Eve, February 9.    According to sources in the municipal Government, the  patriarch's speech will focus on the need for government  officials to "further liberate their thinking" and "overcome the  fear of making mistakes".    Such "thought liberation" is necessary if Shanghai is to  maintain its spectacular development of the past three years and  regain its place as financial and commercial capital of the Asia  Pacific region, Mr Deng is expected to say.    In his meetings with Shanghai Party secretary Wu Bangguo and  Mayor Huang Ju at the secluded Xijiao State Guesthouse during  the past few weeks, Mr Deng is said to have expressed  satisfaction with the pace of economic reform and development in  Shanghai in the past year.    But he voiced concern that some cadres were still being too  hesitant, sources said.    "Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that some cadres are still  worrying about whether reforms are capitalist or socialist and  that they should liberate their thinking on this point," one  well placed source said.    "He said it doesn't matter if you make mistakes because  mistakes can be rectified," the source said.    The patriarch's planned New Year's Eve address will probably  be his only formal public appearance in Shanghai this winter.    Apart from a short visit with his daughter and private  secretary Deng Rong to the newly-completed Yangpu suspension  bridge linking northern Shanghai with Pudong and a trip to the  top of the Jinjiang Tower Hotel, Mr Deng has not made any  sightseeing excursions since arriving in Shanghai in December.    The patriarch, who is said to be in poor health, spends most  of his time resting at the Xijiao State Guesthouse in the west  of the city.    His only regular outing is to the Huadong Hospital to  receive  medical treatment, sources said.    He is said to visit the hospital every morning at 10.30 for  a  massage and acupuncture treatment before returning to his  guesthouse.    Mr Deng and his entourage travel between the hospital and  the  guesthouse in an unmarked minivan.</p>

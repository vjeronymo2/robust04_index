While meeting with National People's Congress deputies from  Hainan, Gansu and Henan Provinces, Jiang emphasized the  importance of proceeding from specific local conditions and  accelerating China's economic growth in a "down-to-earth" manner.    "China has a huge population, vast territories and uneven  economic development between different regions," said Jiang, who  is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee.    He said that the state will take effective measures to  narrow  the economic gap between the coastal areas and the central and  western regions.    While the state increases assistance for central and western  regions, developed areas should try to help underdeveloped  regions, he noted.    The leader called on officials and people in central and  western regions to catch up with developed regions through  self-reliance.    "Our goal is to achieve common development and prosperity,"  he said.    He also emphasized the importance of paying close attention  to unity in areas inhabited by people of various minority  nationalities.    He called on people of all nationalities to hold high the  banner of patriotism and socialism and work hard for the  prosperity of the Chinese nation.</p>

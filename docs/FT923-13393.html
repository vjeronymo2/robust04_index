			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Turn of UK investors to support gilts programme - Changes in funding patterns DESPITE anecdotal evidence to the contrary, domestic institutions rather than overseas investors are now supporting the UK government's borrowing programme. With a forecast public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 32bn, net issues of gilt-edged securities are likely to reach at least Pounds 27bn by March 1993. Many analysts expect net issuance to top Pounds 30bn as the economy deteriorates through the second half of this year. Substantial overseas buying is required to support new issuance of gilts on this scale. UK investment institutions - mainly pension funds and life insurance companies - are expected to receive cash inflows of around Pounds 38bn this year. Historically, they invest less than 10 per cent in sterling bonds. The evidence of 1991 suggested the international appetite for sterling bonds was strong. With sterling linked within the European exchange rate mechanism, the currency risk of holding sterling bonds is reduced for a continental European investor. Overseas buyers took Pounds 6bn gilts in the course of the year, against Pounds 9bn sold to UK investors. The pattern continued in the first quarter of this year. Overseas buyers took Pounds 1.8bn, domestic investors Pounds 3.1bn. However, since the UK general election on April 9, the official statistics have tilted in favour of UK investors. Gilts sales to domestic investors totalled Pounds 7.6bn in April and May, against just Pounds 836m to overseas investors. Analysts point out the statistics are not wholly reliable. Mr Peter Fellner, analyst at NatWest Capital Markets, estimated a Pounds 100m monthly margin of error. For example, overseas funds managed by a UK fund manager may be booked as a domestic sale. The pattern of buying in April and May has also corrected an imbalance accumulated in the run-up to the election. 'UK institutions went into the election very short of gilts,' commented Mr John Kendall, UK economist at Barings. 'We saw a correction in the weeks after April 9.' The correction has been accentuated by the Bank of England's decision to issue long-dated gilts, which do not usually attract overseas buying. The last auction, Pounds 2.75bn stock maturing 2012, underlined the strategy. Analysts link overseas buying of gilts to the position of sterling within the ERM. Although the mechanism has moderated the risk of wild fluctuations in the pound's value, investment returns are still subject to currency risk while sterling is within a wide 6 per cent divergence band. With sterling trading above its DM2.95 central rate, continental European investors see little incentive to buy gilts. When sterling is near the bottom of its permitted ERM bands - as it was in the first quarter of the year - currency risk is far less. On this argument, overseas buying will return if sterling falls on the foreign exchange markets. The danger is that the weakness of sterling is now kindling speculation about a devaluation within the ERM. This could discourage overseas buyers. The behaviour of domestic institutions partly reflects the poor performance of equities. However, there is little evidence of switching out of shares and into gilts. According to gilts traders, most bond purchases have been funded out of new money - other than some modest switching into index-linked gilts when guaranteed real yields were around 4.25 per cent. There is plenty of scope for purchases of gilts before portfolio weightings are even back to the levels of 1980. For example, the average pension fund had around 20 per cent in gilts in 1980 including index-linked paper, against around 7 to 8 per cent currently.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Clearing the debts Having sold off most of the family silver, the government is finally getting down to the teaspoons. That is one way - and not necessarily an uncharitable one - of looking at yesterday's detailed proposals to sell off Pounds 1bn of UK privatised company debt. The move will not have taken the markets by surprise since it has been clear for some time that no other means were at hand to achieve the Pounds 8bn target for privatisation proceeds published in last November's autumn statement. Whether the operation is better from the taxpayer's standpoint than another Pounds 1bn gilt auction, though, is another matter. No one should be fooled that, while technically reducing the PSBR, this is anything other than a clever wheeze to fund the UK budget deficit. The structure of the offer to some extent mirrors techniques used in the last BT share sale, with different types of investor competing against each other for available stock. In this case, BT will compete against the market in one pool, electricity companies against themselves in a second pool. In the same way that there was an inducement for the retail investor in the BT secondary share sale, the Treasury's baseline bid price for repurchase will be adjusted for tax. In the case of the electricity companies, this provides an incentive to bid now rather than wait until next year when it will not be available. A lively auction is certainly on the cards. Given the popularity of UK fixed interest, there may yet be scope for one of the City's under-employed but enterprising financiers to repackage the lot and provide a tempting spread over gilts. On the other hand, the companies themselves will doubtless welcome an opportunity to refinance with less demanding covenants and gain new control over the shape of their balance sheets. They may even believe government promises about inflation and wish to switch to shorter-term funding.</p>

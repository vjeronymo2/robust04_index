			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THIN trading as institutional buyers sat on the sidelines in advance of today's Bundesbank meeting produced a fairly featureless day in the futures market, writes Christopher Price. The March contract on the FT-SE Index opened weakly at 2,853 and was quickly sold down, with independent traders leading the way. However, a bout of positive news from the currency markets, where short sterling was reported strong, led to a squeeze and March rallied. It reached a high for the day of 2,869 by noon. The rest of the day's trading was conducted in a narrow 20-point range, with many of the big institutional buyers taking a back seat in anticipation of the Bundesbank meeting in Germany today. While the market does not seriously expect a rate cut, it is hoping for some indications of the direction of German monetary policy. March drifted in the dull afternoon session, closing at 2,847, down 3 from the previous day and at an estimated 7-point premium to fair value of around 14. Volume was an unexceptional 5,132 contracts. A more lively options market saw 29,100 contracts transacted, 8,462 of which were in the FT-SE 100. BP was the top traded stock option with 4,141 lots dealt. This was followed by British Airways on 1,400, British Aerospace on 1,329 and Pilkington on 1,240.</p>

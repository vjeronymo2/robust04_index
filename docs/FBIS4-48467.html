			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has called on the international  community to initiate a comprehensive program to deal with the  increasing influx of refugees in the Kagera and Kigoma regions.  This program would involve the refugees themselves, as well as  the regions inhabitants. This call was made today by the deputy  prime minister and minister for home affairs, the Honorable  Augustine Mrema, while he was receiving a donation of 12  vehicles from the Russian Government. These vehicles will be  used in helping refugees in the Kagera and Kigoma regions.    Mrema stressed that the problem of refugees in these regions  is gigantic, and that it required a proper strategy and program  to handle it. Mrema thanked the Russian Government for its  assistance, and also thanked other countries which had extended  various kinds of help for the refugees, most of whom are  Rwandans running away from the civil war raging in their  country. Twenty other vehicles, donated by the Russian  Government, are due in the country during the middle of next  month. The ceremony was also attended by Russian Ambassador  (Klimatov).</p>

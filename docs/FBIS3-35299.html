			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad -- PETRA -- Taha Yasin Ramadan, Iraqi vice  president and member of the Revolution Command Council, has said  that the next few months will be decisive because there are no  more large obstacles or basic difficulties facing the  implementation of Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution  687, which deals with lifting the embargo on Iraq acccording to  a specified timetable. He said his country is waiting to see  what the UN Security Council and other international quarters  concerned with peace, security, and rights, will do, especially  since dialogue and talks between Iraq and the United Nations are  proceeding in a good and objective manner.    In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY in Baghdad,  Ramadan denied the accusation leveled at his country every now  and then that it is obstructing the work of international  inspection teams. He said: What we want to see first is an  evaluation of things within the framework of UN Security Council  Resolution 687 despite its unfairness as it was imposed in the  time of tyranny and hegemony. He noted that Iraq accepted  Resolution 715 which was not mentioned previously, adding that  this resolution calls for installing long-term monitoring  cameras. He said: We believed that this was the only thing  that would obstruct the talks and settlement of differences with  the United Nations. He stressed that the maneuvers and  accusations against Iraq, which usually precede reviewing the  decision to lift the blockade, are false accusations.    Ramadan said that the imposition of the blockade was not  just  a punishment for an act of encroachment; namely, entering  Kuwait, but is aimed against Iraq, its entity, accomplishments,  potentials, and resources. He added that the sanctions imposed  on Iraq -- which encroached on every inch of its land and which  deprived its people of food, water, medicine, and all basic  needs -- also aim at creating confusion and chaos in addition to  fabricating lies one time after another. The objective, he  added, is to implement their schemes and fabricate accusations  that Iraq dropped chemical weapons on the shiites in the  marshlands, southern Iraq. Iraq has called on the inspection  teams and the states of the world to visit the area and verify  our statements.    Asked about a scheduled visit by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister  Tariq 'Aziz to the United Nations during the next few days and  the issues to be focused on during his talks, Ramadan said that  the essential point in Iraq's program is to reach a formula to  fully lift the economic embargo on Iraq, whether all at once or  gradually. He said: Our stand vis-a-vis this matter is firm.  We do not accept partial things, because the economic embargo  is not on oil only. We categorically reject the formula which  they are trying to impose on us. He said: They want us to sell  limited quantities of oil. We consider this a blatant  interference in our national sovereignty and with our  potentials. This is one of the most controversial points.  Furthermore, we firmly believe that this unjust formula which  they are trying to impose on us will become a curtain for them  to hide behind while continuing to impose the embargo. Although  we do not deny the importance of oil as one of the major pillars  of our country's economy, the other economic potentials, which  existed in the past and which will appear in the future, are not  less important. In addition to the natural resources which  exist in Iraq, we became capable of production in the  industrial, agricultural, mineral, and human fields.    Ramadan denied the rumors that Iraq possesses a number of  long-range nuclear missiles installed by the United States in  Kuwait to strike at the Soviet Union before it was divided. He  said that these baseless rumors aim at showing that Iraq still  possesses such weapons, and consequently, it should be pursued  and pressure on it should continue.    He stressed that a number of countries such as Spain,  Greece,  Switzerland, Britain, and Australia have released part of the  Iraqi assets to finance the purchase of food and medicine  supplies. He expressed his regret, however, that some Arab  countries have not yet released the Iraqi assets they hold.    He announced that his country is willing to forget the past,  to deal with and normalize relations with any party, even with  the United States, based on its principles and convictions and  according to new calculations that take everything that has  happened into consideration.</p>

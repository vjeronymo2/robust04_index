			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Deryabin: The Peace Treaty Can </F> Be Discussed"]    [Text] Russia's ambassador in Helsinki, Yuriy Deryabin,  said that it could be a good idea to scrutinize the contents of  the Paris Treaty. Deryabin urges a debate on the peace treaty  and on relations between Finland and Russia in two newspaper  interviews.    The Russian ambassador was interview by SUOMEN KUVALEHTI on  Friday [18 February] and ILTALEHTI on Saturday.    In SUOMEN KUVALEHTI Deryabin said that there is no reason to  depart from the peace treaty of 1949. He also stressed that the  Russian government has no proposals for changes preapared.  Deryabin was expressing his own personal view.    He also said that Russia is currently looking at Finland's  response to the note about the two organizations, IKL [National  Patriotic League] and Suur-Suomi [Greater Finland].    It is Deryabin's view that some sort of psychological  problem  is currently disturbing relations between Finland and Russia.  It seems as if people in Finland do not trust Russia.    Of the EU [European Union] negotiations Deryabin said that  membership could bring with it certain legal problems with  regard to Aland's demilitarized status. Aland's position is  defined in the Paris agreement. Deryabin does not think that  membership will have a negative effect on relations between  Finland and Russia. He said that special arrangements for trade  between Russia and Finland are possible.    But Deryabin does not want to see Finland as a member of  NATO. An enlargement of NATO in such a way that Russia is left  outside would mean that Russia would be isolated, "with all the  consequences this brings with it, including those in the field  of domestic politics."    For countries which are worried about their security  Deryabin  proposed some other alternative -- security guarantees from NATO  and Russia, for example.    In the interview in ILTALEHTI Deryabin stressed that if the  Paris peace treaty is changed, Britain should also be consulted.  Like the Soviet Union Britain enjoys a special position under  the terms of the treaty. When the debate about the note flared  up, Deryabin also had discussions with the British ambassador in  Helsinki.    According to Deryabin, Russia approves the unilateral  interpretation of paragraph III of the treaty which Finland made  in 1990 according to which Finland may acquire more defense  materiel than the peace treaty actually permits.    In ILTALEHTI Deryabin justified the note about the two  organizations with the argument that "major events often start  off as minor events" and referred, for example, to the new  right-wing extremist parties that have been founded in Germany  and Sweden.    In the Paris Treaty of 1947 the popular patriotic IKL  movement, civic guard organizations  [skyddskaarorganisationerna], and women's voluntary defense  services were banned. Deryabin stressed that his questions only  relate to the IKL.</p>

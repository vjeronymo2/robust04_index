			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Trust in funds deal ABERDEEN TRUST, the fund management group, announced yesterday that it will take over from Invesco MIM the management of funds held by Century, the life assurance group, worth Pounds 430m. Invesco admitted that the news came as a blow, but added: 'This is not a surprise to us, and the move has been factored into our calculations.' Century includes the life funds of NEL, which was sold by Invesco to UNUM, the US-based disability insurer, in July 1990. UNUM sold the UK life, pension and mortgage business of NEL to Century in January this year. Invesco said that it had anticipated that NEL funds might move to a new manager when it first made the sale. However, the move comes at an unwelcome time for Invesco following the announcement of sharply lower profits earlier this month, due to a Pounds 9m write-off associated with the troubled Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust. Lord Stevens of Ludgate stepped down as chief executive in July. Aberdeen has agreed to pay Century Pounds 5.6m in respect of the fund management contracts. Of this, Pounds 3m is payable immediately, and the remaining Pounds 2.6m by December 31. If the contracts are terminated, Century will be liable to repay Pounds 5.2m to Aberdeen within seven days. Mr Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen, said the move was made to secure new distribution channels for the group's funds. The full details of the move have still not been settled, but it seems likely it will significantly expand Aberdeen's funds under management, which currently stand at Pounds 1.1bn.</p>

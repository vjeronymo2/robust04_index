			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT TOPICS: HIGH LIFE / A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> CHEAP THRILLS: PINCHING PENNIES FOR FUN AND PROFIT  </P> <P> The Oakland Tribune, last year, asked readers to submit their favorite and even  quirkiest money-saving habits and practices.  </P> <P> A Berkeley couple said that they save dental floss on a bathroom hook to be  used another day and a Richmond man said he refreezes used ice cubes, backwash  and all.  </P> <P> One person, unbelievable as it may seem, said, "I regulate my bodily functions  so that I go to the bathroom during work hours. This saves on water, tissue and  time. I can spend my hours at home doing something constructive, like cutting  off expiration dates on coupons."  </P> <P> Hot Topics wonders: "What's your favorite or strangest money-saving habit or  practice?"  </P> <P> "Whenever I go to fast-food restaurants, I bring the same cup. Then I make sure  no one is looking when I go to get a drink."  </P> <P> Dennis Shaffer, 16, junior, El Toro  </P> <P> "I stick the money in my running shorts and it gets so sweaty that people won't  take it."  </P> <P> Tammie Keller, 17, senior, Marina  </P> <P> "Probably the longest time I've saved money was about one week, and that was  just because I lost it and then found it again."  </P> <P> Sheresa Nunez, 15, freshman, Saddleback  </P> <P> "I take all the change out of my pocket and put it into a coin bank. I also  hide my bank card so I don't withdraw any money from my account."  </P> <P> Bill Sinn, 17, senior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "Since I don't have a car, I can't spend any money."  </P> <P> Vinh Tran, 17, senior, Woodbridge  </P> <P> "My friends and I bring our own food and drinks to the movies. We also stay and  see more than one movie off one ticket."  </P> <P> Stephanie Beltran, 15, sophomore, Santa Margarita  </P> <P> "I go shopping often because if you go shopping every weekend, you can get  really good deals. I got a $36 shirt from the Gap for $6.95."  </P> <P> Tia Malkin, 17, senior, El Toro  </P> <P> "I try not to eat out as much."  </P> <P> Jerry Jen, 17, senior, Marina  </P> <P> "I save it in a big roll of ones, so it looks like I have more money."  </P> <P> Mark Blake, 16, junior, Santa Margarita  </P> <P> "When I start to buy something, I always talk myself out of buying it. I walk  around the store with it until I put it back."  </P> <P> Kristie Siegele, 18, senior, Marina  </P> <P> "I give the money I get to my sister, so that I won't spend it. But then I  always end up getting it back from her because I hate not having money.  Everything I see I want, so money doesn't stick around very long."  </P> <P> Thuy Tong, 17, senior, Saddleback  </P> <P> "I don't cash my checks until the end of the month."  </P> <P> Tina Carrillo, 17, senior, El Toro  </P> <P> "I have shelves high up on the walls. They are covered with dolls and books.  Behind a couple of dolls, I hide a mug, and whenever I have a couple of extra  dollars, I stash them in the mug. Whenever I need money, I can usually find  some there. Sometimes I forget how much money there is in it, and it is a nice  surprise to find more than I expected."  </P> <P> Karen Ashton, 16, junior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "I just don't take any money with me, so then I won't spend it."  </P> <P> Karen Schwam, 17, senior, Woodbridge  </P> <P> "I take $20 from my paycheck and put it behind my mother's picture."  </P> <P> Paul Ambroze, 16, junior, Santa Margarita  </P> <P> "I'll go home for lunch and I'll try not to drive around a lot, so I don't have  to pay for gas."  </P> <P> Paul Wrona, 17, senior, El Toro  </P> <P> "I ask my parents for cash."  </P> <P> John Jones, 14, freshman, Marina  </P> <P> "I put money in a maroon, ceramic pig with my name on the side.

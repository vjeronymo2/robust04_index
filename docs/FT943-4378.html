			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / MPs say aid for renewable energy gives poor value The government's Pounds 340m of subsidies for renewable energy programmes, such as wind power and 'hot rocks', has been attacked as poor value by a cross-party committee of MPs. The Commons public accounts committee said yesterday: 'It is very doubtful that the relatively modest increases in new electricity generation justify the large sums spent.' The report accepts that the programme has yielded useful information about green power, and supports the UK's international obligation to develop clean power sources. But it expresses reservations about the value of the subsidies administered by the Department of Trade and Industry, which will rise to Pounds 150m a year. The subsidies are made through the non-fossil fuel obligation, an official programme which obliges electricity companies to buy a proportion of their power from sources other than coal, oil and gas. The extra cost is covered by a levy on domestic electricity bills. The report points out that fewer than half the projects approved in the first two rounds of subsidies are actually producing electricity; half the projects in the second round may never start at all because they have been blocked by local planning objections, for example in the case of wind farms. The MPs say they are 'disappointed' that in spite of Pounds 54m being spent on wind energy programmes, 84 per cent of installed wind turbine capacity in the UK is provided by foreign manufacturers. The report also attacks subsidies for 'hot rocks' - drawing heat from deep in the earth. Even though Pounds 40m has been spent on this programme, there is no technology capable of exploiting this resource at a reasonable cost in the foreseeable future. Targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved without expanding the nuclear power industry to replace coal-fired power stations, the Association of Nuclear-free Local Authorities says in a submission to the government's nuclear review. The submission was prepared for the association by Cambridge Econometrics.</p>

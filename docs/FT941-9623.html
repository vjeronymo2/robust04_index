			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / People: Stenhammar ruffles more feathers Olof Stenhammar, founder of the options exchange OM and one of Sweden's foremost entrepreneurs, seems to enjoy ruffling feathers at his old adversary, the Stockholm Stock Exchange, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. SSE executives were less than thrilled when Stenhammar launched his company in the mid-1980s; as they saw it, he was treading very much on their own patch. They are unlikely to be any more enthusiastic about his latest move. OM has bought 13.4 per cent of the exchange - one of the few to have been privatised - and is now its biggest single shareholder. Stenhammar plays down talk of an eventual takeover, saying merely that the move is a 'very good investment'. But whether it will result in greater collaboration between the two has yet to be seen. Stenhammar, 53, showed entrepreneurial tendencies early on, selling plastic swimming pools to fund his university studies. When he moved into the options world - an idea he got while working as a broker in the US - OM was the first privately-owned profit-orientated exchange in the world. In addition to its Swedish activities, the group is very active internationally, including ownership of the OMLX exchange in London. There is, however, one cloud on the horizon. Stenhammar and two colleagues are currently being investigated by the state prosecutor over allegations of insider trading. They bought a block of shares in OM just three weeks before it announced interim figures last year, shares which promptly rose in value on the day the figures were published. Stenhammar's defence is that OM is an unusually transparent group, because it reports turnover figures every day, and therefore he didn't know anything more than the market. One member of Sweden's close-knit financial community says the episode shows Stenhammar's judgment is not what it used to be. For example, when he launched OM, he lined up Sweden's powerful Wallenberg dynasty as shareholders to ensure success.</p>

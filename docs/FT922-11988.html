			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: American Brands shows improvement to Dollars 245m AMERICAN Brands, the US tobacco and drinks group, said fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies, principally sterling, had adversely affected income by Dollars 11m, or 5 cents a share, in the latest quarter, AP-DJ reports. However, the group lifted first-quarter net income to Dollars 245.2m, from Dollars 216m in the 1991 quarter. Earnings per share increased Dollars 1.18, compared with Dollars 1.06. Revenues were Dollars 3.83bn, compared with Dollars 3.86bn. Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Each of our five core businesses, as well as our specialty businesses group, reported higher operating income in the quarter and an increase in operating margin. 'These results were achieved despite continued weak world economies, higher taxes on tobacco and distilled spirits and the stronger US dollar,' Mr Alley added. American Brands said profits from tobacco, its largest core business, were slightly ahead of year-earlier levels, in spite of a stronger dollar and an increase in UK cigarette taxes. The company's American Tobacco unit posted record revenues and operating income, up 9 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. Total cigarette unit sales rose 2.6 per cent, including exports, while domestic cigarette sales rose 0.5 per cent. The Franklin Life Insurance unit posted a 26 per cent increase in operating income as a result of higher realised gains on investments. Operating income in distilled spirits rose 41 per cent, reflecting the acquisition by Jim Beam Brands of seven brands from Seagram.</p>

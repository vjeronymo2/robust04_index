			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE MIGHT BE A COURT, BUT SOME READERS SAY SHE SHOULD NOT JUDGE  </P> <P> Margaret Court says Martina Navratilova is a poor role model for young tennis  players.  </P> <P> Although Ms. Court professes to be a born-again Christian, she seems to have  forgotten Matthew 7:1: "Judge not, that ye be not judged." Martina has  displayed skill, determination and grace over the years. What more could be  asked of a role model for young athletes?  </P> <P> JULIE RAFFETY  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

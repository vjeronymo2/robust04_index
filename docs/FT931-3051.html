			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): Exports expected to spur drive for recovery This section contains articles from the Financial Statement and Budget Report for 1993-94, issued after the chancellor's speech. The report, known as the 'Red Book', gives the government's economic forecasts to mid-1994, sets out the latest version of the Medium Term Financial Strategy and outlines the proposed tax changes in the Budget. SINCE last summer, activity has fallen sharply in continental Europe and Japan, but there has been a stronger than expected recovery in the US. GDP in the G7 economies is estimated to have increased by 1.5 per cent in 1992. Activity in Europe and Japan is likely to remain weak, and G7 GDP growth may be no more than 1.5 per cent again in 1993. With plenty of spare capacity, G7 inflation is forecast to remain below 3 per cent. GDP in the UK was somewhat stronger in the second half of 1992 than anticipated in the Autumn Statement, rising by  1/4 per cent on the first half. While non-oil GDP fell by  1/2 per cent in 1992 as a whole, it was broadly flat over the year to the fourth quarter. There remain considerable uncertainties and a wide range of views about the prospects for 1993. The forecasts from the Panel of Independent Forecasters range from growth of 1/4 to 2 per cent with an average of a little above 1 per cent. The Treasury forecast is very similar, at 1 1/4 per cent,  1/4 percentage point more than in the Autumn Statement, reflecting the higher than expected level of GDP in the second half of 1992. Growth is projected to pick up through the year, reaching 3 per cent in the year to the first half of 1994 (2 1/4 per cent non-oil). In the Treasury forecast, the recovery is expected to come both from an increase in domestic demand, principally consumer spending, and exports. Trade performance improves significantly on 1992, although net trade makes virtually no contribution to GDP growth because imports rise as domestic demand increases. Further progress has been made on inflation, with underlying RPI inflation down to 3 1/4 per cent in January. There remain powerful underlying disinflationary pressures and, apart from petrol prices, there is as yet little evidence of any effect on retail prices from the lower exchange rate. Underlying earnings growth fell to 4 3/4 per cent in December and should fall further in 1993 as the effect of recent low settlements feeds through. Employment fell sharply and unemployment continued to rise in the second half of 1992. These trends are forecast to moderate in 1993, but with unemployment a lagging indicator, it may be some time before it begins to fall back. The current account deficit rose to Pounds 12 billion in 1992 from Pounds 6.5 billion in the previous year, with the visibles deficit rising and the invisibles surplus falling. The visibles deficit is forecast to increase further in 1993, largely due to a deterioration in the terms of trade but also to sluggish growth in some of the UK's main trading partners. While there may be some improvement in the invisibles position, the current account deficit is projected to widen to Pounds 17.5 billion. This is broadly in line with the majority view of the Independent Panel, though somewhat above the average. The sterling index has averaged 78 1/2 so far this year, 15 per cent lower than in the three months before ERM suspension. Base rates at the beginning of March were 4 per cent lower than at the beginning of September. This easing of monetary policy underpins the forecast of recovery. M0 growth has been within its target range for most of 1992-93, though above it in February. M4 growth has recently been below its monitoring range. The estimated outturn for the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1992-93 is Pounds 35 billion, well up on last year's Budget forecast but lower than in the Autumn Statement. The PSBR is forecast to be Pounds 50 billion in 1993-94. The forecast is based on the conventional assumption that sterling remains close to recent levels, and assumes that oil prices average Dollars 18 a barrel. WORLD ECONOMY After stabilising in the summer, industrial production in the G7 was again falling by the end of last year, as continued weakness in Japan and continental Europe more than offset a strengthening of activity in North America. In the latest three months, industrial production in the US was up 3 per cent on a year earlier, compared with a fall of over 3 per cent in the major continental European economies and 7 per cent in Japan. Business confidence in the US has risen, but in Europe it is falling sharply and in Japan it is at its lowest level since 1976. Recent movements in industrial production have been mirrored in GDP. By the second half of the year, GDP was falling in Japan, France and Italy, while in Germany, it has fallen by a cumulative 1 1/2 per cent from its peak in the first quarter. By contrast, in the fourth quarter of 1992, US GDP grew at its fastest rate for five years. In G7 as a whole, GDP is estimated to have risen by 1 1/2 per cent in 1992, following growth of only  3/4 per cent in 1991. The marked divergence in activity across the G7 is partly a consequence of recent developments in monetary and fiscal policy. In the US, real short-term interest rates have been under 1 per cent for the last year. This is in marked contrast to continental Europe where, despite some slight easing since the currency turmoil in September, real short-term rates are still very high, at around 6 per cent. And in many European countries, discretionary fiscal tightening has accompanied the monetary squeeze. But in Japan there has been a substantial monetary easing and a large fiscal package has been announced though, so far, this has failed to stem the decline in activity. In most countries, abundant spare capacity has maintained downward pressure on inflation. Since June, inflation has fallen by around 1 percentage point in Japan, France and Italy and has stabilised at just over 3 per cent in the US. But in Germany, inflation picked up in the second half of 1992 and, following the 1 per cent rise in VAT at the beginning of this year, it is now 4 1/4 per cent. Average consumer price inflation in the G7 countries is just under 3 per cent. Despite the continued overall weakness of G7 activity, non-oil commodity prices have risen by over 10 per cent since October as the prospect of stronger US activity became apparent. However, in real terms, non-oil commodity prices remain close to their lowest level since the early 1970s. Oil prices have been relatively stable since the end of the Gulf war. Since December, the Brent price has averaged around Dollars 18 a barrel and it is assumed in the forecast to remain at that level. G7 GDP growth in 1993 is forecast to be 1 1/2 per cent, the same as in 1992 and only slightly below the Autumn Statement forecast of 1 3/4 per cent. However, there have been some significant changes to the prospects for individual countries. In the US, growth of 3 1/4 per cent is now forecast for 1993 compared with 2 1/4 per cent last November. This upward revision partly reflects a stronger outturn for the second half of 1992 than had been expected. But also, against a background of stronger business and consumer confidence, it now appears that reasonably robust growth will be maintained through 1993. It will be helped by the small fiscal stimulus included in President Clinton's budget package and by the fall in long-term interest rates following the announcement of medium-term deficit reduction measures. The forecast for GNP growth in Japan in 1993, at 1 per cent, is well below forecasts by the OECD and the IMF at the end of last year. This reflects the continued slide in indicators of activity in recent months, and the lack of any forward indicators yet pointing to recovery. The net stimulus from the fiscal package announced in August is likely to be considerably less than originally thought. Its impact has, in any case, been affected by the prolonged delay before its approval by the Diet. In the three largest continental European economies, the expectation is, on average, for a fall in GDP of around  3/4 per cent in 1993, following growth of only 1 1/4 per cent in 1992. In Germany, GDP has fallen for three quarters, and no pick-up is expected until the second half of the year as high real interest rates and the need for fiscal consolidation continue to depress business and consumer confidence. GDP in Germany could fall by 1 1/2 per cent in 1993 as a whole. Growth in Italy and France will be affected directly by the weakness of activity in Germany, but also by the high real interest rates and discretionary fiscal tightening across Europe. Although commodity prices have picked up in recent months, output in the G7 is well below trend and the growth in demand is expected to remain weak in 1993. Hence, the prospect is for inflation to remain subdued. Consumer price inflation in the G7 is forecast to fall from 2 3/4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992 to around 2 1/2 per cent by the fourth quarter of this year, and to remain at that level in the first half of 1994. Despite the slowdown in industrial countries, world trade has held up remarkably well, helped in part by buoyant Far Eastern markets. World trade in manufactures is estimated to have grown by 4 1/2 per cent in 1992 and a similar rate of growth is forecast for 1993. However, growth of UK export markets, which are weighted more heavily towards Europe, is forecast to fall from 4 1/2 per cent in 1992 to 3 3/4 per cent in 1993. DEMAND AND OUTPUT GDP rose slightly in the second half of 1992, a stronger performance than anticipated in the Autumn Statement. It edged up in both the third and fourth quarters, but non-oil GDP fell marginally. In 1992 as a whole, GDP was  1/2 per cent down on 1991, though it was broadly unchanged between the fourth quarters of 1991 and 1992. A small increase in domestic demand was more than offset by a fall in net trade volumes. Within GDP, oil output recovered strongly in the second half of 1992 and rose 3 1/4 per cent in the year as a whole. Other energy output also recovered in the second half of the year. Manufacturing output fell back a little in the fourth quarter, though not as much as suggested by business surveys in the summer and autumn, and it was  1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier. Construction output fell in 1992 but not as much as in 1991. Service sector output was little changed. The four percentage point cut in base rates since early September, the fall in the value of sterling and the measures announced in the Autumn Statement, have enhanced the prospects for recovery. Business optimism has improved and there are signs of strengthening consumer demand. Nevertheless downside risks remain to the central forecast. Consumer demand may remain hesitant, held back by high levels of debt relative to income and to house prices, and by the fear of unemployment. And the outlook for the continental European economies is very subdued. Moreover business surveys have indicated false dawns before, notably in the autumn of 1991 and the spring of 1992. On this occasion, however, the improvement in confidence follows a tangible easing of policy: there is therefore a better chance that it will translate into higher activity and prove more durable. The forecast for GDP growth in 1993 is 1 1/4 per cent, broadly in line with the average of forecasts by the Independent Panel, but slightly more than in the Autumn Statement reflecting higher than expected output in the second half of 1992. Growth in the year to the second half of 1993 is unchanged from the Autumn Statement at 1 3/4 per cent. It is forecast to pick up further to 3 per cent (2 1/4 per cent non-oil) in the first half of 1994. Manufacturing output is forecast to rise more rapidly than GDP during the course of 1993 because of the impact of improved competitiveness. The main contributions to growth in 1993 are expected to come from consumers' expenditure, up 1 1/4 per cent, and exports, up 5 1/2 per cent. Stocks are also forecast to make a contribution to GDP growth, with destocking coming to an end during the course of the year. PERSONAL SECTOR Consumers' expenditure has moved ahead since the first quarter of 1992, rising by 1 1/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter. Recent consumption indicators have turned out much as expected. But real personal disposable income was much stronger than forecast, increasing by 2 1/4 per cent in 1992 despite a sharp fall in employment. As a result, the saving ratio rose 1 3/4 points in 1992, to 11 1/2 per cent. Personal sector spending has been closely linked with housing market developments in the past few years. Although both turnover and prices fell sharply in the autumn of 1992, this now looks to have been the effect of the stamp duty concession, which ended in mid-August and which shifted activity into the summer. Sentiment in the housing market has clearly improved in recent months, with help from the lower level of interest rates, the reduced level of repossessions and the measures announced in the Autumn Statement to take empty properties off the market. Surveys of estate agents and housebuilders suggest greater activity in the early part of 1993, but this has not yet been reflected in official housing market turnover statistics. House prices, though 7 1/4 per cent lower than a year ago according to the Halifax measure, have fallen by only 1 per cent in the last four months. The house price/earnings ratio is now back to 1986 levels, and below its average of the last 25 years. While the market is currently weak by earlier standards, both prices and turnover may start to rise during the year. Personal sector spending is likely to continue to be restrained by the desire for further balance sheet adjustment and by the fear of unemployment. However, consumer confidence has picked up since the Autumn Statement and the interest rate cuts since ERM suspension have made current levels of debt easier to service. Retail sales have continued their upward trend, and survey and other evidence from distributors also suggests a pick-up in spending in the early months of the year. It therefore seems likely that there have been further increases in consumption so far in the first quarter similar to those in the second half of 1992. Moreover spending is unlikely yet to have reacted fully to the surprisingly strong growth of real incomes in 1992. Thus, despite projected slower growth of real personal disposable income in 1993 of  3/4 per cent, consumer spending is forecast to grow by 1 1/4 per cent. This implies a fall in the saving ratio from its high 1992 level. Personal sector investment in dwellings - which includes home improvements as well as the purchase of new properties - might be little changed in 1993, following a fall of 2 per cent in 1992. The personal sector's financial balance is expected to remain in surplus in 1993 - about 6 3/4 per cent of personal disposable income. The debt/income ratio fell in 1992; it is expected to fall again in 1993 but by less than in 1992. The debt/income ratio by mid-1994 could be about 7 percentage points below its peak in 1991. COMPANY SECTOR Faced with falling turnover and downward pressure on profit margins through the recession, companies have reacted by cutting costs, particularly by shedding labour. As a result industrial and commercial companies' profits (net of stock appreciation) have barely risen since 1990. At the same time dividends have continued to increase, rising 20 per cent in the past two years. But with lower tax payments - down by over a quarter between 1990 and 1992 - and falling short-term interest payments, particularly in 1992, company saving (undistributed income) rose by over 6 per cent between 1991 and 1992. Profitability of non-North Sea industrial and commercial companies, as measured by the real rate of return, is forecast to pick up in 1993 as demand rises, firms continue tight control of labour costs, and pressure on margins eases. And with lower tax and short-term interest payments, company saving can be expected to increase sharply. Business investment has held up well during the recession. Following a 9 per cent fall in 1991, it fell by only 2 per cent in 1992, despite weak profitability, and actually rose between the second halves of 1991 and 1992. Manufacturing investment has risen for three consecutive quarters to the fourth quarter of 1992. Given the degree of spare capacity and companies' continuing financial deficit, a sharp rebound in business investment in 1993 is unlikely. The temporary increase in capital allowances announced in the Autumn Statement will boost investment in 1993, and the CBI survey balances for business optimism and investment intentions recovered quite strongly between October and January. Non-oil business investment is forecast to rise modestly in 1993, by 1 per cent on 1992. However, with North Sea investment expected to fall, total business investment is forecast to fall by  1/2 per cent in 1993. Business investment rises through 1993 as recovery gathers pace and profitability improves, with growth of 2 per cent in the year to the first half of 1994. The trough in business investment as a share of GDP is likely to occur in the first half of 1994, at a level well above those seen between 1970 and the mid-1980s. General government investment rose by 9 per cent in volume terms in 1992. It is forecast to rise by 5 per cent in 1993 mainly due to increased local authorities' investment following the temporary relaxation of the rules for spending out of capital receipts announced in the Autumn Statement. The forecast for whole economy fixed investment in 1993 is a small increase of  1/2 per cent. This is above the forecasts made by most members of the Independent Panel, which point to a fall in 1993. But given the uncertainties and the volatility of investment the difference is well within the margins of error; and two panel members are expecting investment to increase by more than the Treasury forecast. Destocking continued in 1992, although at a slower pace than in 1991. The rate of destocking is forecast to slow further through 1993, with a return to stockbuilding expected in the second half of the year. Stockbuilding is forecast to add  1/4 percentage point to GDP growth in 1993, and 1 1/4 points in the year to the first half of 1994. For 1993 the Treasury forecast is similar to most forecasts made by members of the Independent Panel. Industrial and commercial companies cut their financial deficit to about 1 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1992 from 2 per cent in 1991, and 3 3/4 per cent in 1990. With saving increasing sharply, investment rising only slowly, and further destocking, industrial and commercial companies are expected to move into financial surplus in 1993. The cumulative fall in employment of nearly 2m to September 1992 from its peak in June 1990 has been reflected in a strong productivity performance. Despite the weakness of output, non-oil productivity has been rising since early 1991, increasing by 2 1/2 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1992. Over the year to the fourth quarter of 1992 manufacturing productivity rose by 6 per cent. These rates of productivity growth are much faster than normal at this stage of the cycle. UNEMPLOYMENT Unemployment has risen considerably less than the fall in employment - by about 1.4m to January 1993 from its low point in April 1990 - reflecting falling workforce participation. Following a further round of job losses in the second half of 1992 the rate of increase in unemployment rose, having moderated earlier. The rate of increase should start to slow down again as the economy recovers; though since the level of unemployment typically lags behind the cycle in activity it will be some time before it starts to fall again. The current account deficit was Pounds 12bn in 1992, compared with Pounds 6 1/2 bn in 1991. The visible trade deficit rose to Pounds 14bn, as a result of an adverse movement in trade volumes, with import volumes rising twice as fast as exports. However, exports were rising more strongly than imports towards the end of the year. Although the terms of trade deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 1992 following sterling's depreciation, they were  1/2 per cent better in 1992 as a whole than in 1991. In 1991 the invisibles surplus benefited from contributions from abroad towards the UK's Gulf War costs and from exceptionally low net transfers to the EC. It is not surprising therefore that the surplus fell in 1992. But at Pounds 2bn it was much lower than anticipated in last year's Budget forecast: estimates both of the level of the surplus in 1991 and of the UK's net stock of overseas assets have been revised down since then. LABOUR COSTS Manufacturing unit labour costs were unchanged in the fourth quarter of 1992 compared with a year earlier as earnings growth continued to slow and productivity growth picked up. By contrast, competitors' unit labour costs probably grew by 3 1/4 per cent. This underlying improvement in competitiveness is likely to continue in 1993, with UK unit labour costs set to fall while competitor countries' costs continue to rise. The gap between UK and overseas unit labour cost growth is forecast to improve competitiveness on its own by about 4 per cent in 1993. The lower exchange rate compared with most of last year will enhance this underlying improvement, so that actual cost competitiveness may be about 20 per cent better in mid-1993 than a year earlier. Price competitiveness is also forecast to improve in 1993, but not by as much as cost competitiveness because exporters are likely to rebuild their profit margins. Non-oil export volumes were on an upward trend during 1992 reaching record levels in the fourth quarter. They rose 2 1/2 per cent in the year as a whole. The growth of world trade in manufactured goods (which account for around 90 per cent of UK non-oil exports) is expected to be similar in 1993 to 1992, although the growth in UK export markets is forecast to fall from 4 1/2 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent. But better competitiveness means that exports should grow faster than this in 1993, although there is a good deal of uncertainty about the speed with which improved competitiveness will affect export volumes. Manufactured exports could rise by 7 1/2 per cent in 1993, over 3 per cent faster than world trade and twice as fast as UK export market growth. Exports should continue to benefit from the improved competitiveness beyond 1993 with further increases in the UK's share of world trade. Exports of all goods are forecast to rise 6 1/2 per cent in 1993 and just over 10 per cent in the year to the first half of 1994. While import growth outstripped demand growth last year, the rise in import penetration was not out of line with its long-term trend. The specialisation of world production has led to a rise in import penetration in the UK as in other countries. The counterpart of rising import penetration due to increased specialisation is faster growth of world trade than world activity, and with it the faster growth of UK exports than GDP. A further rise in import penetration is to be expected in 1993, though the improvements to competitiveness, which benefit firms competing with imports just as much as exporters, should keep it down. The volume of imports of goods is expected to rise by 5 1/2 per cent in 1993, a little less than in 1992 despite stronger domestic demand. Normally after a large fall in the exchange rate import prices rise faster than export prices, and this is evident in the monthly figures available since ERM suspension. The resulting terms of trade loss, expected to be nearly 5 per cent for non-oil goods comparing 1993 with the whole of 1992, has a significant adverse effect on the visible trade deficit, more than accounting for the deterioration in 1993. However, in large part it arises because UK exporters hold back from raising their prices in the interest of selling more to their customers. The higher volumes that result will work to offset the adverse terms of trade effect, but will take some time to come through. Similarly improved competitiveness will tend to reduce import volumes, further offsetting the terms of trade loss. As export prices catch up, there is the prospect of some improvement in the terms of trade in the first half of 1994. IMPORTS Oil and gas production rose 3 1/4 per cent in 1992. It is expected to rise by 6 per cent in 1993 as new fields begin production and as output resumes from those fields affected by the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988. Output is expected to be near the centre of the DTI's Brown Book range, which shows a further sharp increase in 1994. Net oil exports are expected to rise in 1993 with export volumes over 3 per cent higher and import volumes  1/2 per cent higher than in 1992. The oil surplus is expected to rise to nearly Pounds 2bn in 1993. The surplus on interest, profits and dividends (IPD) rose from Pounds 1/2 bn in 1991 to Pounds 3bn in 1992. However, several exceptional factors account for much of this turnround: IPD was depressed in 1991 because of Gulf War effects on oil companies' profits; and during 1992 there were exceptional currency market earnings associated with the turmoil in September. Continuing current account deficits will reduce the UK's net stock of overseas as sets and therefore the IPD balance over the years ahead. Against this, the lower exchange rate will raise the sterling value of foreign currency assets and receipts. The UK's net stock of overseas assets is estimated to have fallen from Pounds 11bn at the end of 1991 to near zero in the middle of 1992. By the end of the year it had risen to Pounds 37bn, as exchange rate revaluations more than offset the effect of the current account deficit. Like goods, the services balance will benefit from the improved competitiveness, though adverse terms of trade effects may dominate in 1993. The volumes of both exports and imports are forecast to rise quite strongly during 1993, exports more so than imports. But because they start from rather depressed levels in the second half of 1992, growth between 1992 and 1993 as a whole is quite modest, 1 per cent for exports and  1/2 per cent for imports. The balance of transfers is expected to change little between 1992 and 1993. Overall, the surplus on invisibles might be Pounds 3 1/2 bn in 1993, up from Pounds 2bn in 1992. The current account deficit is expected to rise to Pounds 17 1/2 bn in 1993 , with the recovery in the invisibles surplus more than offset by the increase in the visibles deficit. Although the forecast is above the average of the Independent Panel's forecasts, five of the seven panel members expect the deficit to be in the range Pounds 16 1/2 bn to Pounds 20bn. The weakness of demand has kept strong downward pressure on inflation, despite the lower exchange rate. Underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), was 3.2 per cent in January  -down 2 1/2 percentage points since April 1992. As yet, with the exception of petrol prices, there is little obvious sign of inflationary pressures at the retail level as a result of sterling's depreciation. Since last September retail goods price inflation has continued to fall somewhat faster than retail services price inflation. All-items RPI inflation has fallen more rapidly than the underlying rate in recent months, and to a significantly lower level, reflecting the effect of mortgage rate reductions. The all-items rate in January was 1.7 per cent, the lowest rate since September 1967. Producer output price inflation, excluding food, drink and tobacco, was a little higher in January and February, at 2.7 per cent, than the low point of 2.4 per cent reached in late 1992. This perhaps reflects the beginnings of the impact of the lower exchange rate on output prices. But producer output price inflation remains low by historical standards: 1992 apart, the rate was last below 2.7 per cent in May 1969. Producer input prices, on the other hand, have clearly been affected by the lower exchange rate, albeit somewhat less than expected, with the index 8 1/4 per cent higher in February than last August. Even so the pressure on producers' profit margins has been eased by the sharp decline in unit wage cost growth: in the fourth quarter of 1992 unit wage costs in manufacturing were unchanged on a year earlier. NEW GROUND Whole economy underlying earnings growth has continued to break new ground by the standards of the past 25 years. In December it fell to 4 3/4 per cent, having fallen sharply since showing signs of stickiness at around 7 1/2 per cent early in 1992. And under the influence of falling inflation, weak demand for labour, and financial pressures on companies, pay settlements have clearly resumed a downward path since last summer. CBI data point to recent settlements in both manufacturing and services falling to an average of under 3 per cent, compared with around 5 per cent a year or so earlier. Low headline inflation and a slack labour market indicate that earnings growth may continue to fall for some time yet, though a recovery in profits may progressively exert some upward pressure on earnings. With subdued earnings growth and further gains in productivity growth, unit labour costs are forecast to increase only marginally in 1993 in the private sector, and to fall in manufacturing. Manufacturers' input price inflation is expected to pick up further during much of 1993, largely reflecting higher import costs as a result of the lower exchange rate. Manufacturers are also likely to take advantage of increased demand partly by rebuilding their profit margins. These factors are expected slightly to outweigh the effects of lower unit labour costs on producer output prices. The net result is that producer output price inflation is forecast to rise to 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, before falling back to 3 1/2 per cent in the second quarter of 1994 as import price inflation recedes. However, underlying RPI inflation is not expected to rise as much from its current level. Although retail goods price inflation is likely to pick up as the effects of the lower exchange rate feed through, services price inflation, which typically responds more slowly to changes in economic activity, should continue to come down. Underlying RPI inflation is forecast to be 3 3/4 per cent in both the fourth quarter of 1993 and the second quarter of 1994. This includes the effects of the measures announced in the Budget. Compared with the Autumn Statement forecast, which allowed for increased motoring taxes to recoup the cost of abolishing car tax, the Budget is expected directly to add around  1/4 per cent to the level of the RPI excluding MIPs in 1993, and a further  1/2 per cent by the second quarter of 1994. For the fourth quarter of 1993 the Treasury forecast is just below the average of forecasts made by the Independent Panel. However, three members of the panel have forecasts at or below 3 1/2 per cent. For given underlying inflation, the all-items RPI inflation rate will depend on what happens to mortgage rates. The forecast of underlying inflation implies that if mortgage rates remained unchanged from present levels, all-items RPI inflation would be 2 1/2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993. A one percentage point change in mortgage rates changes the level of the all-items RPI by just over  1/2 per cent, other things being equal. The relatively flat profile of the forecast for underlying inflation contrasts with the path forecast for the GDP deflator, which measures the price of domestic value added (principally unit labour costs and profits per unit of output). The GDP deflator is now expected to rise by 3 1/2 per cent in 1992-93. But in 1993-94 it is forecast to rise by only 2 3/4 per cent, partly reflecting the effect of the lower exchange rate on the terms of trade. It is also held down by low public sector pay growth as a result of the limit on settlements announced in the Autumn Statement. STERLING Sterling was suspended from the ERM on September 16 last year. Since then, it has traded at an average level of DM2.44, or 15 per cent below its average level during 1992 prior to suspension. Against a basket of currencies, it has averaged 13 per cent lower, with the sterling index within the range 76 to 82 1/2 since mid-October. Base rates, at 6 per cent, are four percentage points lower than before sterling's membership of the ERM was suspended, and UK short-term interest rates are the lowest in the EC. They were 10 1/2 per cent one year ago. Mortgage rates have come down by less, to just under 8 per cent compared with 11 1/2 per cent at the beginning of last year. At current levels they are the lowest since the early 1970s. Long-term interest rates have continued to fall. Ten-year yields averaged 8 per cent in February, over 1 per cent below their level a year earlier, and nearly 4 per cent lower than their average 1990 level. Since ERM suspension, the yield gap has switched over, with short rates below long rates for the first time since 1988. Equity prices were depressed in the run-up to the currency turbulence in September, but have since recovered strongly. In February they were 24 per cent above their average level in August. Dividend yields have fallen correspondingly, though they remain close to average levels in the mid-1980s. Commercial property rentals and residential house prices remain depressed. Although house prices in February were 7 1/4 per cent below their level a year earlier (on the Halifax measure) they have fallen only 1 per cent in the last four months. Annual growth of M0 was between 1 1/2 per cent and 3 per cent throughout 1992, comfortably within its 0 per cent to 4 per cent target range. Towards the end of the year, however, M0's shorter term growth rates increased strongly, and its 12-month growth rate exceeded 4 per cent in February. M0's relatively strong growth - and its correspondingly low velocity growth - may be a consequence of the falls in interest rates during the year, which reduce the incentive to economise on cash. M4 growth, in contrast to M0, has continued to fall. It was 3.2 per cent in January, below the monitoring range of 4 per cent to 8 per cent announced in the Autumn Statement. CREDIT The growth of M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the private sector - has, like M4, continued to decline over the past year. M4 lending's annual growth was 4.2 per cent in January. Personal sector borrowing has been depressed by weak activity in the housing market and the desire to reduce debt. Lending to industrial and commercial companies has been similarly depressed, growing by less than 1 per cent in each of the past two years. The accompanying table compares the main elements of the forecast published in the 1992 FSBR with the outturns for 1992 or the latest estimates for 1992-93. GDP fell unexpectedly in 1992. Domestic demand and exports were weaker than forecast although the errors here were no bigger than the averages from past forecasts. But imports were stronger than projected, largely due to a shift in the composition of demand towards manufactures. This was also reflected in a larger current account deficit than forecast. The counterpart of weaker than anticipated activity has been faster progress on inflation. And the public sector borrowing requirement is likely to be well above last year's FSBR forecast. All forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties. Recent Treasury forecasts have emphasised that these are most acute when the economy is at or close to a turning point, and that remains true on this occasion. The recent movements in the exchange rate have added to the uncertainty. The forecast is based on the conventional assumption that the exchange rate remains close to recent levels. The forecasts presented here are central forecasts, a balance of upside and downside risks. The accompanying table shows average errors from past FSBR forecasts.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                RETAIL AND PRODUCER OUTPUT PRICE INFLATION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Per cent changes on year earlier                                                Forecasts                                                ------------------------                                      1992 Q4   1993 Q4   1994 Q2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RPI excluding MIPs                  3 3/4     3 3/4        3 3/4 Producer output prices1             2 1/2     4            3 1/2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Excluding food, drink and tobacco  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC PROSPECTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Percent changes on previous year                                 unless otherwise stated                                         Forecast           Av. errors                                         -----------------   from past                                 1992    1993      1994 H1  forecasts(1)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GDP and domestic demand at constant prices Domestic demand of which:       1/2     1 1/4     3          1 1/4   Consumers' expenditure(2)     1/4     1 1/4     1 3/4      1 1/4   General government consumption(2)                  -1/4    1/4       1 1/4      1 1/4   Fixed investment              -3/4    1/2       2 3/4      2 3/4   Change in stockbuilding(3)    1/2     1/4       1 1/4      1/4 Exports of goods and services   2       5 1/2     10 1/2     1 1/4 Imports of goods and services   5 1/4   4 3/4     9 1/4      2 Gross domestic product          -1/2    1 1/4     3  1 Non-oil GDP                     -1/2    1         2 1/4      1 Manufacturing output            -3/4    1 1/2     2 3/4      1 Balance of payments current account   Pounds billion                -12     -17 1/2   -18 1/2(4) 4 3/4   per cent of GDP               -2      -2 3/4    -2 3/4     3/4 Inflation RPI excluding mortgage interest payments (fourth quarter)       3 3/4   3 3/4     3 3/4(5)   3/4 Producer output prices (fourth quarter)(6)             2 1/2   4         3 1/2(5)   3/4 GDP deflator at market prices (financial year)                3 1/2   2 3/4                1 Money GDP at market prices (financial year)   Pounds billion                599     628   percentage change             3 1/4   4 3/4                1 1/2 PSBR (financial year)   Pounds billion                35      50                   6 1/2   per cent of GDP               5 3/4   8                    1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Average errors regardless of sign over past ten years; they apply to the forecasts for 1993 or 1993-94.(2) See footnote 1 to Table (3). 9.3 Per cent of GDP.(4) At an annual rate.(5) Q2.

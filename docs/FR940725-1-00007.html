Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The international risk-based capital standards (Basle Accord) <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  include a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items, including interest and exchange rate contracts, to broad risk categories based primarily on credit risk. The FDIC adopted in 1989 similar frameworks to assess the capital adequacy of state nonmember banks. Banks must hold capital against their overall credit risk, that is, generally, against the risk that a loss will be incurred if a counterparty defaults on a transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Basle Accord is a risk-based framework that was proposed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle Supervisors' Committee) and endorsed by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G&hyph;10) countries in July 1988. The Basle Supervisors' Committee is comprised of representatives of the central banks and supervisory authorities from the G&hyph;10 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Luxembourg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the risk-based capital framework, off-balance sheet items are incorporated into risk-weighted assets by first determining the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amounts for the items and then assigning the credit equivalent amounts to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. For many types of off-balance sheet transactions, the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount is determined by multiplying the face amount of the item by a credit conversion factor. For interest and exchange rate contracts however, credit equivalent amounts are determined by summing two amounts: the current exposure and the estimated potential future exposure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less and instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin are excluded from the risk-based ratio calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current exposure (sometimes referred to as replacement cost) of a contract is derived from its market value. In most instances the initial market value of a contract is zero. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A bank should mark-to-market all of its rate contracts to reflect the current market value of the transaction in light of changes in the market price of the contracts or in the underlying interest or exchange rates. Unless the market value of a contract is zero, one party will always have a positive mark-to-market value for the contract, while the other party (counterparty) will have a negative mark-to-market value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An options contract has a positive value at inception, which reflects the premium paid by the purchaser. The value of the option may be reduced due to market movements but it cannot become negative. Therefore, unless an option has zero value, the purchaser of the option contract will always have some credit exposure, which may be greater than or less than the original purchase price, and the seller of the option contract will never have credit exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A bank holding a contract with a positive mark-to-market value is ``in-the-money,'' that is, it would have the right to receive payment from the counterparty if the contract were terminated. Thus, a bank that is in-the-money on a contract is exposed to counterparty credit risk, since the counterparty could fail to make the expected payment. The potential loss is equal to the cost of replacing the terminated contract with a new contract that would generate the same expected cash flows under the existing market conditions. Therefore, the in-the-money institution's current exposure on the contract is equal to the market value of the contract. An institution holding a contract with a negative mark-to-market value, on the other hand, is ``out-of-the-money'' on that contract, that is, if the contract were terminated, the institution would have an obligation to pay the counterparty. The institution with the negative mark-to-market value has no counterparty credit exposure because it is not entitled to any payment from the counterparty in the case of counterparty default. Consequently, a contract with a negative market value is assigned a current exposure of zero. A current exposure of zero is also assigned to a contract with a market value of zero, since neither party would suffer a loss in the event of contract termination. In summary, the current exposure of a rate contract equals either the positive market value of the contract or zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second part of the credit equivalent amount for rate contracts, the estimated potential future exposure (often referred to as the add-on), is an amount that represents the potential future credit exposure of a contract over its remaining life. This exposure is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the underlying contract by a credit conversion factor that is determined by the remaining maturity of the contract and the type of contract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The potential future credit exposure is calculated for all contracts, regardless of whether the mark-to-market value is zero, positive, or negative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For interest rate contracts with a remaining maturity of one year or less, the factor is 0% and for those over one year, the factor is .5%. For exchange rate contracts with a maturity of one year or less, the factor is 1% and for those over one year the factor is 5%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity and are generally more volatile, they carry a higher conversion factor. No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single-currency interest-rate swaps in which payments are made based on two floating indices (basis swaps).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential future exposure is added to the current exposure to arrive at a credit equivalent amount. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the appropriate risk category, according to the counterparty or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. The maximum risk weight applied to such rate contracts is 50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This method of determining credit equivalent amounts for rate contracts is known as the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> current exposure method, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  which is used by most international banks. The Basle Accord permits, subject to each country's discretion, an alternative method for determining the credit equivalent amount known as the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> original exposure method. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Under this method, the capital charge is derived by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor, which varies according to the original maturity of the contract and whether it is an interest or exchange rate contract. The conversion factors, which are greater than those used under the current exposure method, make no distinction between current exposure and potential future exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

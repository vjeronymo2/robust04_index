But there is  help. Donald Hooper, owner of Vintage Plumbing &amp; Sanitary Specialties of  Northridge, is a self-proclaimed "architectural-antiques salvager." "I  concentrate on ornamental and unusual high-end stuff," Hooper explains. He has  amassed an extensive collection of restored fancy pedestal lavatories,  pull-chain toilets, claw-foot bath tubs and reproduction showers and faucets.  The majority of Vintage Plumbing customers are redoing bathrooms, trading  sterile modernism for an appealing period ambiance. Hooper also repairs and  restores original, irreplaceable fixtures to pristine condition.  </P> <P>  Vintage Plumbing &amp; Sanitary Specialties, 9645 Sylvia Ave., Northridge,  (818) 772-6353.  </P> <P> Claudia Kunin MARTIN ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

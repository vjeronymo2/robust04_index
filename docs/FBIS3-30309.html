The agreement implies that Hungary,  undergoing a process of integration into Europe, establishes a  new and more advanced type of relationship with the European  Union and its member states.    "Now that the European agreement comes into force, the  government considers it necessary to reaffirm that integration  into Europe is a historical command for Hungary, a command  stemming from its traditions of thousands of years. There is no  alternative to this process, which became possible only after  the change in regime.    "This agreemeent provides a favorable framework for the  acceleration of economic and social modernization.    "Hungary's integration into Europe is one of the most  efficient safeguards for the country's security.    "Accordingly, joining the European Union as a full member is  a strategic objective, and a foreign, security, and economic  policy priority for the Hungarian government.    "Attaining this aim is a national program which determines  Hungary's internal development and the country's place and role  in Europe.    "To realize this national program, the government strives to  exploit all the possibilities offered by the European Agreement,  and develop constructive cooperation with the European Union  member countries and other associate countries in Eastern and  Central Europe.    "The Hungarian Government is aware that reaching the level  of  development required for integration is a complex task which  necessitates further significant steps in economic  transformation and the related social care.    "Fulfilling the economic policy tasks aimed at meeting the  requirements of integration is a precondition for the  modernization of the Hungarian national economy and the  country's long-term stability amd social peace.    "In this effort of historic importance, the government  reckons with the creative contribution and support of all  citizens.    "The government expresses the conviction that Hungary will  strengthen and enrich the process of European unification with  its political, historical and cultural heritage forming an  integral part of European heritage, national characteristics,  internal development since the change in regime, and  contribution to stability in Europe."</p>

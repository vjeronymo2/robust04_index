			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian farmers to plant record rape area CANADIAN FARMERS are set to plant a record acreage of oilseed rape this spring in response to a strong run-up in prices and steadily rising US demand for rapeseed oil. Barring unforeseen setbacks, such as the early frost which damaged about 20 per cent of last year's crop, next season's prairie harvest could offset the expected tumble in European Community production. According to early estimates, European output will fall by at least 500,000 tonnes this year to a maximum of 5.7m tonnes, the lowest in four years. An official at the Canola Council in Winnipeg - canola is the Canadian name for oilseed rape - estimates that this year's plantings in Canada will rise from 3.15m hectares (7.8m acres) in 1992 to between 3.44m and 3.64m ha. With a yield of 23 bushels an acre the crop could be as high as 4.8m tonnes, up from 3.68m tonnes in 1992. Last year's harvest was initially estimated at 4.5m tonnes, but frost cut the area harvested to 2.83m ha. The popularity of the crop is partly due to low wheat prices, but also reflects high canola prices prevailing on the Winnipeg commodity exchange. The March contract closed at CDollars 333.50 (Pounds 184) a tonne on Wednesday, up from a low of CDollars 275 a tonne last August. The March price has been as high as CDollars 349 a tonne in recent months. Mr Nick Underwood, the Canola Council's crop production co-ordinator, said that farmers 'can lock in next year's production at good prices'. The most recent surge in prices has been caused by an acute shortage of the top two grades of canola, as a result of damage caused by last August's frost. A trader at ScotiaMcLoeod in Winnipeg said that prices would probably drop later in the year if the expected high plantings materialised. However, the canola market is also expected to be buoyed over the longer term by firm US demand for canola oil. Canada's annual canola oil exports to the US have soared from 100,000 tonnes to 260,000 tonnes over the past five years. Canola oil received Food and Drug Administration clearance as a 'generally-recognised-as-safe' product in 1985. It has been promoted since then as the vegetable oil with the lowest saturated fats content on the US market. Procter &amp; Gamble and Hunt &amp; Wesson are among the large manufacturers which now sell canola oil, either by itself or blended with other vegetable oils. Such well-known brand names as Mazola and Crisco now include some canola oil in addition to their traditional ingredients. The Canola Council predicts that the total crush in Canada will rise from the 1.5m-tonne average over the past five years to 2.2m tonnes by the end of the decade.</p>

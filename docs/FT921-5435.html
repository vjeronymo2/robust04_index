			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: PaineWebber salesmen tune in to Zeitgeist - The securities brokerage's changing strategy for the 1990s YOU only have to look at PaineWebber's current television commercials to see how much the atmosphere on Wall Street has changed since the Roaring Eighties. The spots show mini-dramas - mother-daughter anxieties, early retirement, kids off to college, ageing parents heading for the nursing home - with a punchline that says secure futures were achieved because of timely and sympathetic interventions by the PaineWebber salesman. The firm's slogan for the campaign is: 'We invest in relationships.' This image of wholesome reliability is very much in tune with the times, and it is one that is breeding success. Today, PaineWebber is the fifth largest securities brokerage in the US with a network of 4,700 brokers, and last year it rode buoyant stock and bond markets to earn record after-tax profits of Dollars 150.7m. Yet PaineWebber's route to success over the past decade has been somewhat circuitous, taking in a botched merger and an advance into, then a retreat from, investment banking. Along the way it got involved in some injudicious arbitrage and banking deals, including one calamitous bridge loan to Federated Department Stores in 1988 which forced the company to take an undisclosed reserve to cover future losses. PaineWebber has also drawn back from venture capital and trading on its own account. Yet, while others made megabucks in the debt-driven deal-making of the 1980s, PaineWebber was searching for more reliable pastures. As a result, for most of that period, the company looked plain dull. Today, however, it seems PaineWebber may have cleaned out its weaker businesses and focused on its strengths just in time to cash in on the new Zeitgeist. This, at least, is the view of Mr Donald Marron, who has been the company's chief executive since 1980. 'In the 1980s, people talked about the consumer products they wanted. Now they talk a lot about saving and investment.' The American population, he says, is ageing and, pressed by falling real incomes since the late 1980s, faces a change in the pensions outlook and the burden of the highest health costs in the world. The US, says Mr Marron, has become a nation of savers. So why has this not shown up in the savings ratio figures? 'Because they measure the wrong things,' he says. At the same time, Americans have also seen their most straightforward route to protecting savings against inflation - the easily purchased certificate of deposit - undermined by tumbling real interest rates. With house prices also weak, conditions could not have been better for the smiling stockbroker to suggest a nice line in mutual funds or a new retirement account. This new demand for equity-based savings products has not just enriched the brokers and fund managers, it has also contributed hugely to the boom in stock prices. PaineWebber is certainly not the only firm to have done well in these circumstances. Others, from the giant Merrill Lynch to more specialised firms such as AG Edwards and discount brokerage Charles Schwab, have also enjoyed sharp earnings growth. But Mr Marron argues that his own firm has a strategy which will enable it to continue its relative prosperity, and permit it to grow more rapidly outside the US as well. The company already has a Japanese link through insurance group Yasuda Mutual Life, which owns an 11.7 per cent stake in PaineWebber. Now Mr Marron is interested in finding an European partner. 'The basic idea would be to exchange distribution systems. We could distribute their products and they could distribute ours.' PaineWebber already claims to be one of the top three London-based distributors of US equities to institutions. The underlying game plan is to increase the quality of PaineWebber's revenues, retaining a strong balance sheet, focusing more carefully upon what the customer wants, and preferring business lines which offer recurrent fee income - less glamorous than other parts of the securities business, but perhaps more reliable. At the same time, PaineWebber is working hard to control costs. Overall, 1991 was a good year for the firm in this respect, although the biggest category of expenses, employee compensation, rose by almost 19 per cent, mainly because buoyant stock prices and the rush of individual investors to the market fuelled a sharp rise in performance-related pay. In practice, the strategy's success will be determined by how good the company is at devising new products and services - what Mr Marron calls the 'manufacturing' side of the business - and selling them to individual investors and savers and to financial institutions - the 'distribution' side. It is highly competitive, but Mr Marron says foreign competition has eased up somewhat, the savings and loans remain in disgrace, and the banks seriously weakened. One benchmark of progress is the rate at which the total volume of assets controlled by PaineWebber has grown. As the chart shows, the curve has been satisfactory in recent years, reaching Dollars 93.2bn in 1991. It is this figure which PaineWebber sets alongside its salaries bill, pointing out that the average investment executive in 1991 was covering Dollars 20.6m of assets - double the level of five years earlier. Mr Marron says of the costs outlook, that PaineWebber can extract further economies of scale from its New Jersey computer complex, but that elsewhere: 'I don't see any big decline from here. Costs are where they are.' He would, however, like to bolster the size of the company's retail operations. PaineWebber is also busy training and retraining staff for the mission of managing Main Street's savings, preparing the company for the economic recovery. 'When the economy turns, there will be more leverage than we all think, because there's been a big cultural change,' Mr Marron says. 'All businesses are more aware of costs and more aware of focusing on higher profit margin activities.' Yet despite the bullish stock market, the booming broking business and improved economic outlook, Mr Marron does not foresee a return to high-living on Wall Street. 'I think we will look back at the late 1980s and say that it was a warped period in our industry,' he says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 7 (AFP) -- European Community  mediator Lord Owen was evasive Monday on the possibility of  launching air strikes to retaliate against the weekend mortar  attack in Sarajevo saying that only "a fool" would want such  action. "Nobody but a fool wants air strikes but on the other  hand nobody but a fool can go on tolerating the situation in  which as many people can lose their lives as it happened  Saturday in Sarajevo," Owen said following a meeting with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The mortar attack  Saturday occurred in a crowded Sarajevo market killing 68 people  and injuring about 200.    Owen said his meeting with Milosevic centered on what could  be done to avoid a similar tragedy in the future. He added that  the meeting to be held Thursday in Geneva between Bosnia's three  warring parties -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- "is not a  meeting to discuss global peace settlement but to discuss  confidence building measures." He said these measures would  include setting up a "hot line" between the Serbs and Moslems  that would lead to a demilitarization of the Sarajevo region.</p>

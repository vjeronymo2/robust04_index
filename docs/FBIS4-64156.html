			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a statement by the Supreme Kenges of the  Republic of Kazakhstan:    Recognizing that there is no alternative to the  comprehensive  reform of social relations, the state, and the economy and  expressing readiness for a constructive dialogue with the  president, the executive branch, and the judicial powers and  wishing to achieve a compromise and consensus between various  political forces which reflect the social and national interests  of citizens of the republic, and noting that the government,  having declared a course toward the market economy, in fact  impedes and blocks it, and this has led to an economic chaos,  the Supreme Kenges adopts this statement as a basis for its  immediate work.    The government has failed to work out a national reform  program which could have become a basis for the consolidation of  society. This made the constructive interaction of the branches  of power impossible. It also made it impossible to carry out an  integral and logically complete legislative policy. In this  connection the democratically elected Supreme Kenges, reflecting  the will of the majority of voters expressed by the latter  during many preelection meetings, must express a lack of  confidence in the government's social, economic, and legal  policy.    In this situation the only possibility of avoiding a  complete  paralysis of power is to hold constructive dialogue between all  of its branches, and with social and political forces in order  to set up a national program of reform and to form a government  capable of fulfilling this program. Before the adoption of an  agreed program, the Supreme Kenges must focus its attention on  the following issues:    First, examination of the president's decrees adopted in  absentia of the legislative body of power.    Second, implementation of the budget and confirmation of the  current fiscal year budget.    Third, implementation of the control function.    Fourth, international agreement subject to ratification.    Fifth, expansion and strengthening of interparliamentary  relations.    Sixth, examination of laws adopted in the first reading by  the Supreme Kenges of the 12th convocation and returned by the  president for reexamination.    The Supreme Kenges considers as a priority the task of  immediate and maximum possible protection of the population, the  more accurate targetting and efficiency of this protection. The  Supreme Kenges intends to take a number of legal measures in  order resolutely to protect the producers of goods, to restrict  by law the authority of the executive power over state property,  to expand the independence of enterprises of all forms of  ownership. These measures are necessary only to decrease the  consequences of the crisis for the population and the economy,  to remove the lack of a systematic approach to law making which  is harming the state, and to ensure stability for law making in  the Republic of Kazakhstan.    The Supreme Kenges expresses its hope of agreement between  the branches of power and social and political forces. The  Supreme Kenges proposes immediately to begin consultations  between representatives of the president, the Supreme Kenges,  and other state organs, political parties, and other social  associations in order to work out conditions of work on a  concerted program of reform.</p>

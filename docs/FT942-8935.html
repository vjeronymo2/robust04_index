			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons Allied-Lyons' annual results produced a predictable combination of strength in spirits and retailing, offset by weakness in beer. Though the joint venture with Carlsberg is improving after a disappointing start, it remains a drag on performance. The underlying contribution from beer to last year's earnings fell by 14 per cent even including the interest on the Pounds 135m cash payment from Carlsberg when the venture was set up. That will only reinforce the belief that brewing, like food, lacks a long-term future within the group. Meanwhile, though, Allied's management seems finally set to reap the benefits of the transformations it has wrought in spirits and retailing. Like Grand Metropolitan, Allied has had its disappointments in the US spirits market, but it is making inroads in eastern Europe and Domecq should bring opportunities in South America. Similarly the improving quality of its pub estate and a greater focus on food helped produce a 7 per cent increase in underlying profits from retailing. The test will be whether Allied can use this growing strength to generate more cash. Gearing fell only slightly last year to 70 per cent. Domecq produced only Pounds 9m in net cash last year, but this was after payment of Pounds 25m in dividends and there may be scope to reduce the Pounds 38m negative cash contribution from working capital. If it can start reducing its debt by generating cash from operations as well as disposals, Allied will be able to claim its strategy has been vindicated.</p>

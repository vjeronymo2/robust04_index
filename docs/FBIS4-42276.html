			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evren Deger: "Problems in the Trillions-Worth </F> Wireless Communication Systems Project"]    [Text] Ankara--The General Staff has ordered that the  acquisition of the HF/SSB wireless communication systems, which  are manufactured in Turkey under the plan to modernize the  Turkish Armed Forces, be suspended. It has been reported that  General Ahmet Corekci, deputy chief of the General Staff, has  issued an order on behalf of Gen. Dogan Gures, chief of the  General Staff, suspending the acquisition of the wireless  communication systems because they do not meet the needs of the  Armed Forces. Consequently, the military forces have rejected  the systems, which are manufactured by the British Marconi Firm  and its Turkish partners, Cihan Electronics Company and Elit  Electronics Firm, in accordance with the contract they signed in  1990.    The Armed Forces acquired 919 communication systems under  the  project, which will cost 4.8 trillion Turkish lira. However,  considering the problems in the systems, Gen. Corekci, acting on  behalf of Gen. Gures, suspended the acquisition of the units  until further notice on 16 December 1993. The military sources  and the officials of the Undersecretariat for the Defense  Industry [UDI] have said that the acquisition of the systems has  not yet been resumed and that talks are being held on the Armed  Forces' problems. They also expressed the hope that the talks  will yield results in a short time.    Gen. Corekci's order described the problems in the  communication systems as follows:    "The 400-watt and 100-watt systems, which were installed in  the facilities of the Ankara Regional Communications Unit  Command, were observed to affect each other on various  frequencies. Communications were distorted by interference.    "The tests that were later carried out to clarify the  problem  confirmed that the communication systems installed in the same  facilities affected each other. Meanwhile, it was established  that changing frequencies in the systems caused problems.    "Although the list of technical specifications and the  contract for the manufacturing of the systems do not contain  provisions indicating that the units may be installed and used  close to each other, the operation of the HF/SSB wireless  communication systems by the military requires it.    "It is believed that the manufacturing firm should consider  that principle in manufacturing its systems. In view of that,  the manufacturing firm should make the necessary modifications  without any additional charge as soon as possible. Otherwise,  the firm will be regarded as violating the principles of  goodwill."    Gen. Corekci's order, which was conveyed to the UDI, listed  the measures that should be taken to meet the needs as follows:    ``1. Every necessary arrangement must be made to prevent the  wireless communication systems from affecting each other and to  resolve the problems related to frequency changes.    ``2. The acquisition procedures for the systems, which have  been tested and stored in depots, will not be finalized until  the existing problems are resolved.    ``3. Furthermore, acquisition tests and the final  acquisition of the systems will be suspended until the  manufacturing firm's modifications are approved by the Armed  Forces.    ``4. The modifications to eliminate the problems must not  change the performance of the systems.    ``5. The military units will continue to use the wireless  communication systems, which are already on the Armed Forces'  inventory. However, the manufacturing firm will make the  necessary modifications in them as soon as the work on resolving  the problems is concluded.''</p>

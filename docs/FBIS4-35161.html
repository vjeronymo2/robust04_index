			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 29 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- A group of six former  commanders of the former Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] today  rejected the occupation by former contras of an OAS organization  headquarters and of the Colombian Embassy in Managua to protest  alleged non compliance with the agreement signed in 1990 for  their disarmament.    The six former commanders, who said they represent the  chiefs  of the four war fronts of the defunct contra group, said during  a news conference that the occupations are lead by Enrique  Quinonez, "who never was a legitimate RN member."    They also appealed to the true former members of the  Resistance, who are currently at the OAS International  Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) building and  those who are at the embassy, to "not engage in actions that  damage the organization's image."    In addition, they asked the government to comply with "what  is lacking" in the agreements (Toncontin, Honduras; Olof Palme;  and Hotel Las Mercedes) signed between 1989 and 1990 for the  overall reintegration process of the demobilized and of the  former contras.    Rodolfo Ampie, alias "comandante Invisible;" Luis Angel  Lopez, alias "comandante Leonel;" Edgar Molinares, alias  "comandante Richard;" Salvador Talavera, alias "comandante  Esteban;" Jorge Avalos, alias "comandante Avalos;" and Erving  Barberena, alias "comandante Oscar" are the former RN commanders  who appealed to the occupiers to "think over their attitudes."    According to "comandante Invisible," Violeta Chamorro's  government has only complied with 40 percent of the agreements  on the delivery of over 400,000 manzanas of land (571,428  hectareas) to former contras.    More than 1,000,000 manzanas (1.4 million hectareas), as  well  as houses, work tools, and urban lots for the construction of  homes are still pending delivery.    Other former contra chiefs indicated that at "Reparto 380"  and "Hialiah" [temporary living facilities] in this capital the  demobilized have not received materials for the construction of  housing, while in the "Villa Reconciliacion," the houses lack  electricity and potable water.    In addition, they pointed out that thousands of former  contras, after returning to their places of origin and finding  themselves without jobs, left behind their families again to go  to Managua with the hope of solving their problems, but this has  not happened.    The peaceful occupation for the second day of the CIAV-OAS  is  being lead by disabled commander Lorenzo Seledon, alias  "Chispero," while the action at the Colombian Embassy is being  lead by Jose Luis Arguello Montiel, alias "commander 002."    Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta accused the occupants  of  the diplomatic mission of committing crimes of extortion,  threats, coercion, and kidnapping. He said the government will  not negotiate with these people.    This afternoon, a lengthy meeting was held at the CIAV-OAS  headquarters. Present at the meeting was Monsignor Eddy  Montenegro, who was representing Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.  However, no representative of the Violeta Chamorro government  was present. Also present at the meeting were Argentine  diplomat Sergio Caramagna, CIAV-OAS general coordinator; Enrique  Quinonez, representing the RN Superior Council, which consist of  57 leaders of the demobilized rank and file; and "Chispero."  However, results from the meeting were scarce.    Today, approximately 20 demobilized and former contras  occupied the offices of the Nicaraguan Institute of the Agrarian  Reform in Chinandega, in the western part of the country, in  support of the similar actions in Managua.</p>

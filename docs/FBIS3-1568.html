			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng will stress  stability and central authority in his Government Work Report to  be presented to the National People's Congress when it opens on  March 10.    While the final draft of the 15,000-character report is  still  being fine-tuned, informed sources said the premier would urge  the nation's officials and citizens to strike a balance between  reform, development and stability. Top priority will be put on  shoring up the centre's authority in the macro-level adjustment  and control over the economy, a point that had been made by  senior leaders Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun in Shanghai last month.    The sources said barring 11th-hour changes, Mr. Li would  recommend a GNP growth rate for 1994 of nine per cent, with the  rates for industrial and agricultural development fixed at  respectively 15 percent and at least 3.5 percent. Inflation  should be kept within 10 percent.    The premier will reiterate the national goal for 1994 that  had been laid down by the Politburo recently: "Seize the  opportunities; deepen reform; expand the open door policy;  promote development, and guarantee stability."    An informed source said: "The accent will be on stability,  ensuring that reforms already unveiled late last year would be  implemented without exacerbating socio-political problems."    "There will not be any new exhortation to quicken reform or  development in view of the leadership's fears that too heady a  pace might precipitate hyper-inflation, unemployment and  challenges to the administration."    Following the recent remarks by Mr. Deng and Mr. Chen,  premier Li will draw attention to the fact that "without central  authority nothing can be achieved (in economic development)".  Mr. Li will call on the regional leaders to put the overall  national situation before local concerns. The premier will  specifically warn against provinces and cities competing with  each other in boosting their already very ambitious development  targets.    Chinese economists who have seen parts of the draft report  said it would be divided into seven sections. They will include  the state of the economy and the political situation; economic  reforms that will be carried out this year; the priorities for  development with special emphasis on agriculture, the  relationship between the centre and the regions, the need to  balance economic reform with the construction of spiritual  civilisation; reforms of the political and administrative  structures; social objectives, particularly developments in  education and technology; international affairs, including  policy towards Hong Kong and Taiwan.    A senior economist said: "Li Peng will not mention new  economic reform initiatives beyond those already unveiled at the  party Central Committee plenum last November. However, in view  of the fact that reforms, including the new taxation system,  have been bogged down because of opposition from regional cadres  and other power blocs, the premier will underscore Beijing's  commitment to their forceful implementation."    Areas of economic reform that will receive special emphasis  include putting into place a modern enterprise system and  rationalising the investment and banking system. "Premier Li  will give further support to market experiments, particularly  the conversion of state enterprises into shareholding  companies," the economist said. "However, in view of the fear  of rising unemployment as a result of state concerns laying off  workers to improve efficiency, he will underscore Beijing's  readiness to go on supporting those government enterprises that  are not yet ready to undergo radical restructuring."    In his report, the premier expresses confidence that the  overhauling of the investment and banking system will cure the  problem of excessive fixed-assets investments by both local  governments and enterprises.    He will reiterate that the limit for fixed-assets  investments  of all levels for 1994 will be 1,300 billion yuan (HK$ 1,154  billion), and that "the ceiling absolutely cannot be breached".    New initiatives will be unveiled in the fight against  inflation, deemed the prime problem of the economy. The  measures will include regular inspections of price levels,  punishments against speculators and the setting of price  guidelines for essential commodities including grain and staple  foodstuffs.    Pride of place will be given to agriculture, with a revival  of the old goal of putting grain production as the key link of  the economy. Mr. Li will reassure the nation's farmers of  increased state investment as well as the fact that as a result  of factors including the raising of the procurement price of  produce, per capital income in rural areas will be boosted by at  least five percent. The premier will urge local administrations  to devote more resources and acreage to farming. He will  strongly attack the phenomenon of the reckless decimation of  farm land for the creation of a unrealistically large number of  industrial and real-estate development zones.    In view of the dramatically rising crime rate that the heads  of the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate  will detail in their efforts to the NPC, Mr. Li will pledge that  more resources be devoted for fighting crime.    The report underlines the importance of a strong defence and  security apparatus in view of the fact that while the Cold War  has ended, regional flashpoints have been on the increase and  that infiltration into China by hostile foreign forces has gone  on unabated. The premier is expected to recommend a budget  boost for the People's Liberation Army of about 13 percent.    Chinese sources said there would be a sub-section on Hong  Kong policy, where the premier was expected to reaffirm  Beijing's commitment to maintaining the territory's stability  and prosperity after the total collapse of talks with the Hong  Kong-British administration on political development.    The premier is expected to call for the strengthening of the  role of the Preliminary Working Committee as well as quickening  the pace of its work in uniting patriotic forces in Hong Kong  and ensuring a smooth transition to 1997.    Throughout the report the premier salutes Beijing's firm  commitment to developing Mr. Deng's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the construction of a socialist  market economy.    However, the patriarch's instructions on a high-speed model  for reform and development have been shelved.</p>

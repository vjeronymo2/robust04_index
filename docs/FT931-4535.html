			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (9): It began with a man called Cuthbert - Insurance Protection IN THE rapids of risk management, domestic credit insurance has been a somewhat forgotten tributary, quietly providing some traders with cover against losses due to insolvency or protracted default by the buyers of their goods. Credit insurance was invented at the turn of the century by Mr Cuthbert Heath, the innovative underwriter who in the late 19th century steered Lloyd's of London away from its exclusive concentration on insuring ships. In 1936, however, the then ruling Committee of Lloyd's banned underwriters from writing credit insurance, following concern over a fraud case in the 1920s which centred on imaginary Swedish buses and taxis and saw underwriters liable for Pounds 367,000. This left the field clear for Trade Indemnity, which still remains overwhelmingly the market leader in domestic credit insurance, and of which Mr Heath was a founding member in March 1918. The domestic credit insurance market was worth Pounds 140m in 1992 and TI's share was 82 per cent, according to Datamonitor, a market research firm. TI believes it insures 15 per cent of all UK companies that could use credit insurance. In the same year Datamonitor estimated that Panfinancial, a conglomerate formed by Japanese, Swedish and Finnish insurers in the early 1980s, had 9 per cent, with the Belgian company Namur accounting for 7 per cent. NCM (UK), which first entered the market for domestic credit insurance in April 1992, had only about 2 per cent of the UK's domestic credit insurance but its presence is significant. The Dutch private sector credit insurer is dominant in the UK export credit insurance market. In 1992 NCM had 70 per cent of business worth Pounds 85m following its purchase of the short-term business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department in December 1991. The Dutch insurer Aegon and the French insurer Assurances Generales de France (AGF) have also established footholds in an industry experiencing a period of fairly rapid change. Mr Bryan Squibb, sales director of the specialist brokers, the Credit Insurance Association (CIA), said: 'Things have changed dramatically. NCM is pushing case-for-case against TI. Last year TI was forced to push up its rates and that allowed NCM to go in and write a number of domestic policies. The competition has forced everyone to respond with aggressive policies which is great for customers.' The growing number of insolvencies in the UK means the market is expanding as more companies seek to buy policies. CIA says 'extensive' research it commissioned from an independent agency indicates strong concerns about credit risk and the risk of non-payment among medium and large companies. Three out of four respondents were experiencing problems in obtaining payment within agreed credit periods. Twin benchmarks in the development of the industry were the failures of Lowndes Queensway, the retail group, and Coloroll, the home furnishings group, in the summer of 1990. Insured credit losses stemming from the Coloroll collapse amounted to between Pounds 9m and Pounds 20m. The other side of this picture is that in such parlous trading conditions insurers face losses as claims increase. In more buoyant times credit insurers are almost unique in the broader insurance market because they routinely return profits on premium income rather than relying on investments. This, and the potential for expansion in the market, are perhaps both reasons that Lloyd's has been reconsidering its credit insurance ban and why some large continental European insurers have recently entered the market. Since 1990 European legislation has allowed credit insurers limited freedom to trade across borders. And technological innovation in the field is introducing new products which can be cheaper and are available to smaller companies. In general customers pay less than 1 per cent of turnover, depending on the sector they operate in and how well they are judged to control credit risks. The arrival in the industry of Infocheck's computerised on-line credit insurance policies has, however, created a new product range, some of which is specifically aimed at smaller companies. The traditional 'whole turnover' credit insurance normally protects all sales under a single policy. The policy provides the credit manager with financial advice on all principal customers. Generally the insured will self-insure an element of each credit limit. Indemnity is typically 80 to 85 per cent. The risk posed by each buyer varies so the credit insurer may wish to vary the credit limit. For this reason credit insurers stress the financial advice and management side of their service. They say credit insurance is a discipline on, and a back-up to, credit control. Many companies put their futures at risk because they are unaware that their credit may be up to 40 per cent of their current assets, they say. The other main traditional type of policy is excess of loss or 'catastrophe' insurance. The insured will agree a 'first loss' or non qualifying loss designed to eliminate predictable lower level losses. A very large 'layer' of cover is then purchased in excess of this self insured proportion. In 1991 Infocheck began offering computerised variations of these traditional products and others under two credit insurance policies, both underwritten by AMA Underwriting Agencies. These are both essentially spin-offs from their UK business information database. One of the policies is aimed at companies with insurable turnover of more than Pounds 2m and the other at those falling under that limit. Once the policy is in place the customer can access Infocheck's on-line information system and extract information about buyers. At the end of the information a credit limit is presented and the customer asked to accept or reject it. If the customer accepts it coverage is immediate. This was initially dismissed by more established players in the market as crude compared with their traditional bespoke approach which depends on the specialist experience of underwriters who consider each customer individually. It is understood, however, that most of the big companies are now considering similar on-line facilities.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: UB bid talk gains ground THERE WAS no let-up yest-erday in the takeover talk surrounding United Biscuits as speculators rushed to buy stock amid a rash of rumours fuelled by widespread suggestions in the weekend press. As UB shares opened sharply higher, market attention focused on Cadbury Schweppes as the prime predatory suspect, its shares coming under pressure on speculation that a massive rights issue might be required to mount such a bid. Food analysts have put a price tag of around Pounds 3.5bn on UB. The rise in UB shares was sustained throughout the day, with the size of individual deals suggesting that smaller speculators dominated the buying. Investor zeal was spurred by the view of one leading securities house that UB's break-up value in a hostile bid would be 600p a share. In spite of the small lots being bought, there was further stake-building speculation. On Friday, when bid rumour began to gather, there was talk that one leading securities house was building a stake for Hanson, another alleged predator. Yesterday, dealers said one foreign bank was in the market bidding for 10m UB shares, although final turnover of 8.3m suggested it had been unsuccessful. UB, nevertheless, recorded its largest daily trading volume since last September, and the equivalent of a further 1.6m shares were dealt in the options market. UB finished 29 stronger at 428p. Food manufacturing specialists remained sceptical about the affair. Mr Carl Short at Nomura said: 'The whole thing looks like smoke without fire. None of the companies that are being mentioned as potential bidders sound plausible at this point.' Other experts said that although informal discussions are thought to have taken place between UB and Cadbury executives, the feedback from both companies was dismissive. One analyst commented: 'It all points to a ramp in the share price.' Analysts' scepticism allowed Cadbury shares to partially recover, closing a net 8 adrift at 471p. Hanson was 3 easier at 235p.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Merger costs hurt results at KNP BT KNP BT, the Netherlands' leading paper and packaging group, reports provisional after-tax net losses for 1993 of Fl 320m (Dollars 163.3m). The group, which emerged from a three-way domestic merger last March, attributes the weak performance to extraordinary costs associated with integration, capacity downsizing and disposals, in a year otherwise dominated by continued overcapacity and recession. The preliminary operating result was put at a loss of Fl 23m. Definitive figures and 1993 turnover will be announced on March 23. Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman, predicted a strong recovery for 1994, particularly in the paper production sector, where the group recently merged its activities with those of Leykam-Murztaler, the lossmaking Austrian group which KNP BT acquired last December. Mr van Oordt's optimism is based on a recent firming of prices in some segments of the paper market, as well as a lower cost base achieved at the cost of extensive restructuring. In an unrelated development earlier this week, the group announced plans to sell two Asian graphic distribution subsidiaries - BTI of Korea and Modern Printing Equipment of Hong Kong - to the Danish-based East Asiatic group for an unspecified sum. The sale is part of KNP BT's attempt to unwind its conflicting interests in graphic machinery which, after the merger, included competing Heidelberger and MAN/Roland distribution franchises. KNP BT will now represent MAN/Roland in Asia via its Votra distribution unit.</p>

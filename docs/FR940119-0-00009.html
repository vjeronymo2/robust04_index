			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States are currently given the opportunity to pay back the difference between regular and enhanced funding for a partial system (i.e. certification component only) and then move forward to develop a ``complete'' new system. As of (insert effective date of final rule), States will no longer be given the opportunity to pay back this difference. The Department will fund to ``complete'' system development but will not permit paybacks that allow the State to replace at enhanced levels a component already funded at the enhanced level which is no longer useful in the new system design. For example, a State has received enhanced funding for a certification component and completes component development. At a later date, the State re-evaluates automation activity and a decision is made to automate the issuance function, and to redo the certification component. In this situation, the Department may allow enhanced funding for the issuance component but will not allow funding at the enhanced level for a new certification component. Finally, if a ``complete'' system was funded at the enhanced level, a replacement system is not eligible for enhanced funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will reimburse States at the enhanced level, if appropriate, for ``planning efforts'' that did not lead to implementation of a system. The purpose of the planning effort is to ensure that the ultimate system development effort is a viable one. Therefore, a State may qualify a second time for enhanced funding for planning if the previous planning effort was not successful. However, a State will not be eligible for enhanced funding for the actual implementation efforts for the second time if the initial implementation effort failed to develop a ``complete'' system that meets all applicable standards. Paybacks by States for failed implementation attempts will no longer be approved as of (insert the effective date of the final rule).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Funding for Preparation of the Planning Advance Planning Document (PAPD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed rule provided clarification that the 50 percent rate of Federal Financial Participation (FFP) would be allowed for State administrative expense incurred during preparation of the PAPD. Two commenters felt that the preparation of a PAPD should be funded at the enhanced rate since the preparation took more time than suggested in the regulations and resulted in a document more extensive than 6&hyph;10 pages. One commenter suggested that a clear description of specific costs eligible for enhanced funding would help to adequately differentiate between preparation of the PAPD and the actual planning phase activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is maintaining the requirement that the preparation of the PAPD by States be funded at the regular FFP rate of 50 percent. The PAPD is intended to be a brief written plan of action which describes the State agency's intended activities and proposed budget for planning phase activities as well as an estimate of the total project costs. At a minimum, the State agency is required to include information set forth in 7 CFR 277.18(d) in the PAPD submission. Planning phase activities will be reimbursed at the enhanced rate only if the PAPD was approved at that rate. Planning phase activities that are eligible for reimbursement at the enhanced funding rate are identified in 7 CFR 277.18(g) of these regulations. In addition, the Department would like to clarify language in paragraph 277.18(g)(8)(iv) of that section which may have contributed to the confusion surrounding the level of FFP allowed for the preparation of a PAPD. The second sentence in this paragraph has been changed to read as follows: ``The cost of planning activities which were approved for enhanced funding under a Planning APD may be funded at the 63 percent level regardless of final approval or denial of the Implementation APD''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the Department had failed to provide recipient protections in ADP systems through the proposed rule and requested that the Department republish the rule to include provisions for this concept. Through this rule the Department is addressing only the automation funding provision of the Public Law 101&hyph;624. Public Law 101&hyph;624 also contains provisions concerning standards for automated systems that include concerns about recipient protection. However, this rule does not implement those provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sino-American Trade Tends Toward </F> Normalization"]    [Text] Sino-American relations have shown signs of  progress since Clinton met Jiang Zemin in Seattle in last  November. Treasury Secretary Bentsen was assigned by Clinton to  visit Beijing, which was a vigorous step to promote the  normalization of Sino-American relations.    As everyone knows, the Sino-American Joint Economic  Commission was suspended by the U.S. side after 1989. The last  session was held in 1987, and the commission has been suspended  for seven years. The Sino-American Joint Economic Commission is  a very important organization for economic cooperation, which  gives an impetus to technological cooperation between the two  countries through intergovernmental planning, coordination, and  promotion. For example, in the past, cooperative plans in such  fields as metallurgy, telecommunications, electronics,  machinery, and building materials were signed in the Joint  Economic Commission. Moreover, both sides briefed the other  party on economic development strategies, monetary strategy, and  foreign investment policies to allow Chinese and U.S.  businessmen to make complementary investment and open up new  investment fields, thus leading to huge growth in the volume of  bilateral trade. The convening of the Joint Economic Commission  also helped both sides understand impediments to economic and  trade cooperation and to remove some obsolete legislation and  administrative measures, thus leading to vigorous growth in  trade.    China and the United States are different in terms of their  social systems, as well as in politics, culture, and history.  If they are sensible enough to lay these differences aside and  work according to the laws of economics, they can achieve what  both sides want. Closer cooperation will not only benefit a  certain party but both sides. Today, sensible figures in the  United States have already noticed that U.S. economic interests  are a top priority, while human rights diplomacy only comes  second, and what is primary should be distinguished from what is  secondary. It is not difficult for both sides to cooperate with  each other as long as efforts are made to "seek common ground  while reserving differences."    Bentsen is influential in Congress, and he is also an  important cabinet member of the Clinton administration. He has  visited China to hold a dialogue with Chinese leaders and to  have a concrete understanding of the real situation of China.  His visit is favorable to the healthy development of  Sino-American relations. Therefore, Premier Li Peng said when  meeting with Bentsen, "China and the United States should seize  the opportunity to do something in a down-to-earth manner to  facilitate, as soon as possible, the normal development of our  bilateral relations."    Solid work refers to the Sino-American Joint Economic  Commission co-chaired by Bentsen and the Chinese finance  minister, in which both sides will study methods to expand  economic cooperation and trade. The Chinese side is very much  interested in introducing advanced technology and equipment from  the United States and is also willing to open up its market,  whereas the United States expects China to reduce tariffs and  open its service sector to give U.S. businessmen more investment  opportunities. Bentsen said: "The fact that President Clinton  assigned me to visit China indicates that the United States  attaches importance to the development of U.S.-Chinese relations  and wishes to seek a way to further develop Sino-American  relations, particularly economic and trade relations." Hence,  in the next three days, it will be most important to know what  issues the Economic Commission will discuss and what results  they will achieve. The Chinese side is ready for cooperation,  and the U.S. side has also indicated that "the United States  should take part in the economic development process of Asia,  and of China in particular." An attitude of positive  cooperation between China and the United States will help, in a  frank and sincere way, remove some obsolete and artificially  imposed obstacles, expand the volume of bilateral trade, and  reach a consensus.    Both Chinese and U.S. politicians acknowledge that a strong  and prosperous China is advantageous to the United States and to  the world as well.    This is not a formalistic gesture but an accurate analysis  of  current political and economic developments in the world. The  outside world once tried to hasten the process of  "democratization" and economic privatization of the former  Soviet Union, hoping that a country with a planned economy could  change into a capitalist country within a short period of time.  Consequently, this gave rise to the "bombardment of the  parliament" and such "democratic freaks" as Zhirinovsky and led  to economic collapse, which is unfavorable to development of the  global economy and to stability and security of Europe.    However, only in Asia has a situation of political stability  and rapid economic growth emerged, and China has become a major  factor in Asia's economic development. China's economic  development is beneficial to Asia as well as to the world. As  huge amounts of U.S. capital come to the East, U.S. Treasury  Secretary Bentsen's visit to China will accelerate the process  of opening up the China market to U.S. investors, which will  also bring about greater development in economic and trade  cooperation between China and the United States.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Gould renews attack on Smith Mr Bryan Gould yesterday renewed his attack on Mr John Smith's leadership of the Labour party within a day of announcing he was quitting politics to return to his native New Zealand, David Owen writes. The former shadow cabinet member, who was once a candidate for the party leadership, argued that Labour bore a share of the blame for the recent recession. Launching a pamphlet calling for a more radical approach to economic policy, he urged Labour to 'stop giving the Tories a free run' and to 'make the case for a new and real commitment to full employment'. In a document that he agreed was his 'swansong', Mr Gould urged Labour to adopt a 22-point policy checklist. This included identifying full employment, not stable prices, as the central aim of monetary policy, reducing interest rates by between 2 and 3 percentage points and increasing taxes on the 'very rich'. His attack was immediately pounced on by Mr Gerry Malone, the Conservative deputy chairman, who said Mr Gould was leaving Labour 'disillusioned by John Smith's timid leadership'.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Transatlantic influences trip bourses into decline Transatlantic news was not good for Continental equities yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Fidelity Investments' nil payout for its Magellan Fund hit shares around the world; and European bond markets, in consolidation, heard the Salomon Brothers chief economist predict that the Fed will boost short-term interest rates by 100 to 150 basis points by the middle of next year. Turning to Europe, Salomon saw growth there exceeding expectations, prompting Germany's Bundesbank to tighten in the first half of 1995. FRANKFURT started comfortably, but Fidelity rumours, poorer than expected results from Dresdner Bank and options-oriented selling in Siemens combined to leave the Dax index down 24.99 to 2,046.33; there was little recovery after hours. Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM5.3bn. Dresdner's problems in derivatives, reflected in its own-account trading losses against a profit last year, left the shares down DM7.50 to DM408.50 in the Ibis and soured Commerzbank, down DM7.60 to DM320, and Deutsche Bank, DM12.10 off at DM735.90 ahead of its own 10-month figures today. Siemens recovered from a session close of DM598.50, down DM12.50, to DM601, off DM8, after hours, stilling fears of a further drop after breaking down through the DM600 technical support level. The other main losses were in automotive stocks and engineers: Conti lost DM5.50 at DM213 after some selling recommendations, and MAM DM14 at DM398; Deutsche Babcock, after a disappointing look at 1995 last week, retreated DM5.50 to DM201.50, Linde DM20 to DM888 and Mannesmann DM8.40 to DM402.80. MILAN fell 2.3 per cent as the market became embroiled in the fraught run-up to the resignation of Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the graft busting magistrate who became a national hero for his sustained assault on corruption in high places. The Comit index shed 14.44 to 615.36 amid worries of further political uncertainty if Mr Di Pietro blamed pressure from Rome for his departure. In the event, shares picked up from their lows after his resignation letter was viewed as even-handed, criticising political pressure from all sides. Some analysts also drew comfort from news that Mr Di Pietro had requested a prison sentence in a corruption case for Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League and a coalition partner: they suggested that the development might persuade Mr Bossi to temper future criticism of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister. Against the lower trend, Montedison was unchanged at L1,138 after the European Court rejected an appeal by Union Carbide against the proposed joint venture with Shell. PARIS worsened in the morning as the Fidelity news upset sentiment, but recovered its composure later. The CAC-40 index finished with a loss of 4.70 at 1,968.95, off a session low of 1,952 and just off a high of 1,970. Smith Barney, of the US, initiated coverage of the two major oil stocks, Elf Aquitaine, off FFr1.00 at FFr386.40, and Total, down FFr3.90 to FFr328. The broker said that it was recommending a neutral position in the former, but put out a buy note on Total, based on its depth of management expertise, strong balance sheet and exposure to growth markets in the Far East. ZURICH picked up from the day's lows, which were a response to concerns about higher money market rates, after a better than expected early performance from Wall Street in the aftermath of the Magellan Fund news. The SMI index finished 21.9 down at 2,589.1, after a low of 2,581.7 although trading volumes remained thin. Financials were mixed, with CS Holding losing SFr10 to SFr541 and UBS bearers SFr16 lower at SFr1,134, amid suggestions that investors were switching to the insurance sector. Swiss Re led the insurers higher, picking up SFr14 to SFr787 as some dealers said that the company was buying back its own shares. AMSTERDAM followed the downward trend and the Aex index gave up 2.17 to 411.18. Kleinwort Benson yesterday upgraded the Netherlands from neutral to overweight, based on an expected revival of consumer confidence in 1995 and given the market's strong exposure to international consumer stocks. In contrast the broker reduced its exposure to the Dutch chemicals sector based on general worries regarding long-term valuations and concern that 'the present boom in basic chemicals could be reversed in the first half of next year'. Ahold gave up 20 cents to Fl 61.20 following an impressive rise on Monday after third quarter figures, and, among the internationals, Royal Dutch slipped Fl 1.90 to Fl 186.90. STOCKHOLM fell sharply, declines in Ericsson and Astra leading as the Affarsvarlden general index lost 17.90 or 1.2 per cent to 1,483.10 in turnover of SKr2.6bn. The two heavyweight stocks were affected by separate downgrades. Ericsson, down SKr12.50 to SKr409 in the B shares, attracted a number of sell notes. Astra, off SKr5 to SKr193, was affected by a note from Merrill Lynch. Ms Janet Dyson, Merrill's pharmaceuticals analyst, changed her opinion from 'buy' to 'take profits in the short term' on news that the US FDA was to suspend a review of the company's Asthma drug, Pulmicort Turbuhaler, pending further information. This suspension was likely to lead to a delay in the drug's approval of at least three months, with the consequent knock on effect on earnings by 1996, she added. COPENHAGEN was depressed additionally by reports of financial problems at the Danish shipping and shipbuilding group, B &amp; W, and the failure of a rescue plan. B &amp; W B shares dropped DKr10 to DKr45, down from a year's high of DKr533 in February, as the KFX index declined 1.16 to 93.34.

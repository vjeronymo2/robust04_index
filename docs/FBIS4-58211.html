			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article from the "Brothers" page] </F>   [Text] Daniel Akodi [name as transliterated],  representative of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement  [SPLM] in the Middle East, has stressed that the congress that  the SPLM recently held in south Sudan discussed 23 papers on the  future situation in the south and what the SPLM should do about  it. He noted that ad hoc committees have been formed to discuss  these papers and work out their final views on how to administer  the liberated areas in the south.    In an exclusive statement to the "Brothers," (Akodi) pointed  out that the SPLM believes that since it controls large areas in  southern Sudan, the al-Nubah mountains, and (al-Anqasta), it  must increase its attention to the infrastructure in these  areas. He said: As events developed, the SPLM thought that  there was a need to establish a civil administration with  organizations from the bottom to the top at the level of  villages, groups of villages, and larger areas. A national  council will supervise all these areas. At the same time, the  SPLM seeks to marshal the masses in the south so that they can  confront the challenges facing them. On the military level,  agreement was reached to form a military council to formulate  military strategy. These are the issues that were discussed at  the SPLM congress. He added: We in the SPLM did not at all  mean these measures to mean that we are seceding, as several  Arab papers reported.    Regarding reports in the Sudanese regime's newspapers' that  these measures were merely designed to cover up the SPLM's  military defeats, Akodi said: Quite the contrary. The Sudanese  Government did not score any important military victories during  the dry season. The SPLM is now trying suicidal operations,  having massed all its forces in the south in an attempt to  tighten its control on the Nimule area, where pitched battles  are raging. I believe that the ruling regime in Khartoum has  completely failed to achieve any of its military goals, despite  massing huge forces unprecedented in size since the civil war  started in Sudan. This confirms that the regime's newspaper  reports are false. The government forces failed to score any  military victories. As a matter of fact, the SPLM has military  resources to strike at the heart of the government forces. We  are currently planning such moves.    Regarding the term "New Sudan," which appeared in the  communique released by the SPLM congress and which makes the  opposition in the north fear that the SPLM is splitting away  from the grouping under a new name, Akodi said: We in the SPLM  are concerned about the grouping; our relations with the  opposition forces in the north are very good. All that we mean  by "New Sudan" is a Sudan based on new foundations and new  concepts that will guarantee personal freedom to the citizens  regardless of religion, race, ethnic affiliation, sex, or color.    Akodi continued: We in the northern and southern opposition  groups agree on all the basics. The movement, which has been  fighting since the time of al-Numayri's, Siwar al-Dhahab,  through the party government that involved Umma, the Democratic  Unionist Party, and the Sudanese People's Federal Party, has  opted to join the alliance embracing these parties due to its  firm belief that major northern parties have basically changed  their position on the issue of southern Sudan. We all have a  clear vision of how to build a secularist, democratic, united,  new Sudan. We in the people's movement have no disputes or  disagreements concerning the objectives of the National  Democratic Grouping [NDG] in the north. There is full harmony  among us and we have a clear collective vision of Sudan's future  after the fall of the National Islamic Front [NIF].    Akodi added: It is absolutely wrong to view the measures the  movement adopted recently as a step toward breaking away. The  movement absolutely believes that if the NIS regime falls, all  democratic powers in Sudan will sit together to plan the  country's political future. When this happens, everybody will  eventually agree on how to achieve peaceful coexistence between  the north and south after 28 years of civil war.    Hence, he added, what the press said does not mean that the  movement has drifted away from the basic principles of the NDG  charters it signed.    Asked whether the SPLM is seeking military support from  northern elements in the NDG, Akodi said: We believe that all  the NDG factions should join efforts to overthrow the ruling  regime. This does not necessarily mean that all northern groups  must undertake military action within the ranks of the SPLM. We  believe that these elements can undertake a massive media  campaign and urge and mobilize the northern masses to speed up  the overthrow of the NIS. This is what both the north and south  have agreed on in the NDG.    As a military power, we do our duty in this connection.  However, we do not object to northern military action if this  is possible, even if it is on a small scale. This would give  the southerners a big incentive to reaffirm their national  affiliation.</p>

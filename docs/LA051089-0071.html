			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL BACKS MALL IN AREA OF HISTORIC HOMES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a plan to  build a government subsidized shopping center in an enclave of historic homes  near USC, a subject of bitter wrangling for two years.  </P> <P> The neighborhood, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, contains  one of the city's most impressive stands of Craftsman-style bungalows and late  19th-Century Victorian houses. It also is a depressed area where unemployment  is twice as high as the citywide average and where the median income is nearly  30% lower than the countywide average, according to official reports.  </P> <P> At one time, the proposed shopping center threatened to displace at least 20  homes and dramatically alter the character of the neighborhood. The plan  approved by the City Council would require the removal of seven to nine homes.  It would allow the Community Redevelopment Agency to choose the developer of  the shopping center and underwrite some of the costs of building it.  </P> <P> The project has been heavily lobbied for by developer Danny Bakewell and the  Boys Market grocery chain.  </P> <P> The council's unanimous vote for the shopping center in the North University  Park area followed a series of acrimonious public hearings and  behind-the-scenes-negotiations between City Councilman Robert Farrell, who  represents the area, and homeowner representatives. The two sides appeared to  have reached an accord before Tuesday's vote. When it was over, however, some  people argued that Farrell had not lived up to his end of the bargain.  </P> <P> The size of the shopping center, the fate of at least two architecturally  significant houses, and the neighborhood's say-so over the design of the center  all were matters discussed with Farrell. Representatives of the West Adams  Heritage Assn., the principal group negotiating with Farrell, wanted those  issues resolved in their favor in return for dropping their resistance to the  shopping center.  </P> <P> They had hoped the council would incorporate their desires into the action, but  that did not happen. Instead, the council's vote leaves many details relating  to the scope of the project and neighborhood control over its design to future  negotiations.  </P> <P> "What we want is a center that balances commercial and residential needs," said  David Raposa, vice president of the West Adams Heritage Assn.  </P> <P> Another group, Friends of Menlo Avenue, remains opposed to the project because  it could commit as much as $3 million in public funds, administered by the CRA,  to a private project that should pay for itself. That view reflects a growing  criticism of the CRA that it, operating at the behest of the mayor and various  council members, is bankrolling deals that have more political than public  value.  </P> <P> Farrell was jubilant after Tuesday's council vote, describing it as a "win-win  situation" and commending the West Adams Heritage Assn. for cooperating with  him and saying they have nothing to worry about.  </P> <P> "They wanted a more explicit commitment, but I think if they had more  experience with the processes at City Hall they would have understood that they  weren't being denied anything by what happened today," Farrell said.  </P> <P> He said he was committed to meeting their desire for a design review committee.  </P> <P> "If a guy gives his word to you, if he says you're going to have something,  you're going to have it," Farrell said.  </P></p>

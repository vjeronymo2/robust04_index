			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Downsize seeks new employment - Buzzword Downsizing joined the language as a management term in 1987, 20 years after the related word downscale (and upscale) made its debut in advertising. While downscale had to do with a reduction of inanimate things (operations, fees), downsize is all about getting rid of people. An organisation is downsized when it sheds employees. Middle management  - by definition most managers - has suffered in the 1990s from delayering and flattening, a vertical image of organisational structure which makes the redundancies seem scientifically inevitable. This is a less organic outlook than the 'leaner and fitter' images of the 1980s, or the less appealing pastoral image of 'dead wood' from the 1970s. However, downsize is busy finding new employment for itself, trying out new usages. It need not be about shrinking a workforce. It can mean shrinking a company by getting rid of its workers, or reducing its technical requirements: 'As they try to 'downsize' their computer systems from mainframes to networks of PCs and high-powered computer workstations, Japanese companies are desperate for advice.' (Economist, September 1993). Managers can downsize their perks: 'Mercedes-Benz and BMW survived because chairmen could 'downsize' to a 3-series or a 190.' (Times, April 1994). Then in the 1990s came the PC term - in both senses - rightsizing, with a ring of political correctness but which in computer terminology means matching the solution to the job: 'Firms are embarked on a process the IT industry calls 'downsizing' or 'rightsizing', shifting traditional IT tasks away from yesterday's creaking leviathans on to the new, faster and cheaper networks of modern computers.' (Sunday Times, February 94). Rightsizing with personnel has an air of rectitude about it: a slim workforce rather than slim workers. The irony at the root of the -sizing words is that size comes from assize, a 13th century English word for the ordinance for payment of tax; in the 14th century it became a fixed standard of food, and so sizeable was born and the idea of quantity stayed with the word. Downsizing and rightsizing return to the roots of the word size because they are bound up with cost.</p>

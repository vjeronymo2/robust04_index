			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Food and Drink: More bargains from Australia - Appetisers Majestic Wine warehouses have some significant reductions on Australian wines this month - notably Cape Mentelle Cabernet Merlot 1991 for just Pounds 6.99, the red wine expression of the man behind Cloudy Bay, from fruit long-ripened on the south western tip of Australia. Bibendum wine merchants meanwhile (071-722-5577) has a keenly priced range from Victoria under the Red Cliffs label. Best buy is the Coonawarra Cabernet 1991 at Pounds 4.99, although probably even better value for the sheer quality, subtlety and potential is their Cabernet-based Yeringberg 1990 at Pounds 13.75 a bottle. This historic Yarra Valley winery has never performed better. ***** It might be snowing this month in England but why not at least toast the prospect of warmer days? A good value choice is Bright Brothers Sauvignon Blanc 1993 made from fully ripe grapes grown on an estate in Portugal's Ribatejo by Australian Peter Bright. It will be in 170 Sainsbury's stores by April 11 and, at Pounds 3.39, is a steal. ***** Scottish Food Proms takes place in Glasgow from April 18-25. It begins with a gala dinner for 250 but then widens its scope to take in chef talks, demonstrations and the launch of the Scottish Food Education Project in which over 40 Scottish schools will be taking part. Among the Scottish chefs taking place will be David Wilson from the Peat Inn, Nick Nairn from the Braeval Old Mill and John Webber from Kinnaird House.

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Azerbaijan premier sacked President Giadar Aliyev of Azerbaijan yesterday sacked Mr Suret Huseinov as prime minister, threatening further instability in the Caucasian state. Earlier in the week President Aliyev had accused Mr Huseinov of siding with opposition forces trying to incite a coup. Mr Huseinov vigorously denied the charge and declared his support for President Aliyev while standing uneasily by his side at a public meeting in Baku this week. The Interfax newsagency reported that seven rebels had been killed this week when Azerbaijani government troops crushed an uprising in Gence, Azerbaijan's second city, which was also Mr Huseinov's power base. Last year Mr Huseinov, a wealthy businessman, successfully fomented an uprising against the then president and forged an unstable power-sharing deal with President Aliyev. Russia yesterday continued to deny it was in any way involved in the crisis, saying it regarded Azerbaijan as a friendly partner in the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

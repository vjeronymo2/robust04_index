			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Veterans of Long March leave stage THE parliamentary session beginning today marks the end of an era for China's veteran communist leaders who joined the Long March to safe bases in northern China in 1934 to 'live to fight another day', writes Tony Walker. It will be the first time since the founding of the People's Republic in October 1949 that Long March veterans will be absent from top-ranking state posts, including the presidency, premiership and chairman of the Central Military Commission. The official Beijing Review reported that 'veteran revolutionaries' President Yang Shangkun and Mr Wan Li, chairman of the National People's Congress, intended to retire. Mr Wan made a farewell appearance yesterday at the Congress presidium, which prepares parliamentary sessions. The Beijing Review said that Mr Yang, 86, and Mr Wan, 77, were making way for 'young blood'.</p>

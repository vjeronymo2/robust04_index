			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Son Ki-yong] </F>   [Text] With the North Korean nuclear row heading for a  showdown in the United Nations Security Council, South Korean  officials expressed dissatisfaction over the United States'  fruitless diplomatic gestures to North Korea.    "Washington has so far made a series of concessions to  Pyongyang without getting anything substantial in return," an  official said.    Seoul dropped its demand, the exchange of special envoys, to  help expedite Washington-Pyongyang talks and virtually gave a  mandate to Washington to discuss the nuclear row with Pyongyang  on a bilateral basis, minimizing its intervention for a quick  solution to the nuclear impasse.    But North Korea showed no signs of yielding to international  pressure aimed at seeking its nuclear transparency and has  completed half of the refuelling of the five-megawatt reactor,  whose inspection is decisive to determining whether the North  has diverted nuclear materials.    Meanwhile, the United States first threatened to cancel any  talks with North Korea if it goes ahead with the refuelling of  the reactor. But it retreated from the position when Pyongyang  started the controversial refuelling.    "As the United States yields to Pyongyang step by step  without taking any punitive measures, North Korea is no longer  taking U.S. threats as serious," the official said.    The official added that the time has come to employ a  "stick"  as a show of force, which will also give the United States an  edge in future negotiations with North Korea.    His remarks were made in the same context with those by  Deputy Premier Yi Hong-ku. Yi said in a recent meeting with  newspaper editors that the declaration of a nuclear-free  peninsula will be nullified if North Korea is confirmed to  possess nuclear bombs.    The deputy premier later told lawmakers that his remarks  were  motivated at pressing the United States and the International  Atomic Energy Agency to make further efforts to persuade  Pyongyang to drop its nuclear weapons program.    Now that Seoul and Washington are moving to bring the  nuclear  issue to the U.N. Security Council, officials said that it is  required to coordinate positions between them and set up a new  approach to avoid a catastrophe.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, returning from an early  morning meeting of security-related ministers, summoned U.S.  Amb. James Laney to his office and discussed measures to cope  with the new developments.    In the meeting, President Kim instructed Han to consult with  the four major countries involved, the United States, Japan,  Russia and China as the Security Council is set to meet today to  discuss actions against Pyongyang.    Han told Amb. Laney about what was discussed in a morning  meeting of security-related ministers, presided over by  President Kim Yong- sam at Chongwadae.    "Before President Kim's visit to Russia, we held in-depth  discussions on various issues," Han told Laney at the start of  the meeting.    A ministry spokesman said later that Han and Laney agreed to  closely coordinate their policies.    "Han and Laney shared the view that the North Korean nuclear  issue is entering the serious stage," the spokesman said.    They agreed to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear  issue but warned North Korea against eroding the basis for  negotiations, he added.    If North Korea doesn't stop the refuelling right now, the  foundation for negotiations will be completely shattered, he  added.</p>

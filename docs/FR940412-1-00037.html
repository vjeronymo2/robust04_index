			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Under the Uniform System of Accounts, both balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and account groupings are designed, in general, to embrace all activities, both pool and nonpool, in which the Association engages. Except for transactions which are of sufficient magnitude to distort current year operating results, prior year transactions are recorded in the same accounts as current year transactions of a like nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In order to afford each Association flexibility to establish ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet its individual needs, a minimum number of accounts are prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts. Each Association, in maintaining its accounting records, must use the prescribed chart of accounts. If additional accounts are necessary, the new accounts must be consistent with the prescribed chart of accounts classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.115  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> System of accounts coding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A five digit control number is assigned for each balance sheet and profit and loss account. Each account is numbered sequentially, within blocks, designating basic balance sheet and profit and loss classifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.120  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The general books of account and all books, records, and supporting memoranda shall be maintained in such manner as to provide, at any time, full information relating to any account. Supporting memoranda must provide sufficient information to verify the nature and character of each entry and its proper classification under the prescribed Uniform System of Accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each Association shall maintain all records necessary to show the history of, or facts regarding, each accounting or financial transaction. These records include but are not limited to, organization tables and charts, internal accounting manuals and revisions, minutes books, stock books, reports, cost distributions and other accounting work sheets, correspondence, and memoranda.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Each Association shall maintain all books, records and memoranda in a manner that will readily permit audit and examination by the Director or the Director's representatives at any time. All books, records and memoranda shall be protected from loss, theft, or damage by fire, flood or otherwise, and shall be retained for 10 years unless otherwise authorized by the Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.125  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Accounting entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each Association shall be a separate accounting entity. However, the records shall be maintained with sufficient particularity to allocate items to each pilotage pool operation or nonpool operation and to support the equitable proration of items which are common to two or more pilotage pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.130  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Interpretation of accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions concerning accounts or reports required by this part should be submitted to the Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.135  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Address for reports and correspondence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reports, statements, and correspondence required by this part shall be submitted to the Director at the address listed in &sect;401.110(a)(9) of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_General Accounting Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.200  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Bases of allocation between pool and nonpool operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Profit and loss items and assets common to two or more pools or to nonpool operations shall be allocated equitably to each pool and to nonpool operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Changes in methods of allocating items between pools shall only be made as of the beginning of each calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.205  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Accounting period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each Association subject to this part shall maintain its accounts on a calendar year basis unless otherwise approved by the Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each Association shall keep its financial accounts and records on a full accrual basis. All transactions, as nearly as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be reflected in the Association's books for the accounting period, matching revenues earned with the costs attaching thereto.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Expenses incurred during the current accounting year which demonstrably benefit operations to be performed during subsequent accounting years to a significant extent shall be deferred and amortized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.210  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Liability accruals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Charges shall be made against income and accruals made for only those liabilities for which a definitely demonstrable obligation exists. Where a definite obligation has been incurred and the precise liability has not been determined, an estimate may be made of the currently existing liability on such actuarial or other bases as can be justified from available information, provided that balances are reevaluated and adjusted at least once each accounting year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.215  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Federal income tax accruals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All income taxes shall be accrued by proportionate charges or credits to income each accounting period in such manner as will allocate the charges for taxes, or the tax credits for losses, to the periods in which the related profits or losses respectively, are reflected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The accrual of income taxes for each accounting period requires that each Association take up in its accounts an amount equivalent to the actual tax liability applicable to the period as computed or estimated on the basis of income tax laws and regulations then in effect, except where the Association computes depreciation for tax purposes at rates which differ from straight-line depreciation based upon the estimated life of the asset. In all cases, regardless of the amount of depreciation which is reported to Federal, State, and local tax authorities for tax purposes, each Associations' financial reports to the Director shall reflect adjustment of cost to reflect straight-line depreciation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;403.220  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Delayed items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All items affecting net income, including income adjustments, shall be recorded in appropriate profit and loss accounts and reflected on the income statement and shall not be entered directly to retained earnings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The fast breeder reactor (FBR) development program  experts' subcommittee is working on final compilation of future  FBR development policy, and Subgroup Two (chaired by Hiroshi  Murata, executive director of the Japan Atomic Energy Relations  Organization) of the long-term plan experts' subcommittee, which  has been deliberating on the fuel cycle, will meet on 29  September 1993 to move quickly to wrap up the work of the  subgroup by the end of the year.    Future work on the fuel cycle will be determined greatly by  the demonstration FBR program. In the FBR experts' subcommittee,  selection of type of the first demonstration reactor was  narrowed down to the top entry type, and the feasibility of the  technology has been studied mainly by this subcommittee's basic  survey subgroup. Results of this study are to be reported at the  FBR subcommittee on 22 September. If work on the draft of the  subcommittee's interim wrap-up has advanced sufficiently, a  draft report of the interim wrap-up may be presented as well.    With regard to the demonstration FBR program, the current  long-term plan for development and use of nuclear energy says  that construction will begin in the latter half of the 1990s,  but no concrete policy has been set. Finalization of the report  will depend on the degree of specificity of the plans presented  by the electric power companies, who will be the main entities  involved in the building and operation of the demonstration FBR.  Although the construction date will become clear in the course  of coordination of the plans, it appears that the intention is  to leave construction cost as an issue for future deliberation.  As for R&amp;D, prospects are good that the roles of the  government  and the private sector, including technological development at  the large-scale research facility in the Oarai Engineering  Center of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development  Corporation (PNC), will be decided. Subcommittee wrap-up is  expected to be around October or November.    Paralleling this work by the FBR experts' subcommittee,  Subgroup Two of the long-term plan experts' subcommittee also is  hurrying to complete its work. Subgroup Two is to review the  plutonium supply and demand balance that was released 2 years  ago, based on the demonstration FBR development program  presented by the FBR subcommittee, and already has presented a  table of estimates at the August meeting of the subgroup.    According to that table of estimates, there will be a delay  in commencement of operation of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant  if demonstration FBR development proceeds according to the  current long-term plan for development and use of nuclear  energy, but plutonium supply and demand will be balanced because  of delays in construction of the ``Monju'' and the demonstration  advanced thermal reactor (ATR). This will be reestimated in the  future when operation of the demonstration FBR begins.  Incidentally, the majority view is that the date of commencement  of operation of the demonstration FBR will be somewhat later  than given in the current long-term plan. The wrap-up of  Subgroup Two is expected to be done within the year.</p>

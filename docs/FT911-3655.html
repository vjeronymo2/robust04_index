			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: Airbus chief vows to fight off Gatt challenge by US THE European Commission will use 'every legal weapon' at its disposal to defend the interests of Airbus in its aircraft subsidies dispute with the US, Mr Jean Pierson, the head of the European aircraft consortium, said yesterday. The long-standing trade dispute has entered an important new phase with the US taking the issue before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The US claims the European consortium has received direct subsidies totalling Dollars 25.9bn which have distorted trade in commercial aircraft. But Mr Pierson, in an address to the Cranfield School of Management, vigorously rebutted the US claims and called for a more balanced redistribution of the world civil aircraft market. 'Airbus stands today as the only recourse against the monopoly of the civil aerospace industry by US manufacturers,' Mr Pierson said. 'It must carefully protect its hard-won positions in the strictest respect of international agreements,' he added. Mr Pierson claimed that the latest US attacks against Airbus coincided with the European consortium's twin strategy of capturing a third of the world airliner market by 2010 and developing a 700-seater aircraft to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the jumbo airliner market. He also suggested that the American attacks had intensified with the approach of the first flight next October of the new long distance, four-engined Airbus A340 aircraft which will increase competition for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in the long-haul airliner market. Despite the aircraft industry's current difficulties, Mr Pierson expected air traffic to show at least 5 per cent growth a year during the next 20 years, requiring the delivery of 12,300 new aircraft between now and 2010. 'This represents some Dollars 680bn worth of business of which Airbus firmly intends to capture a third,' he said. Responding to the latest US complaints, Mr Pierson said the European side had recently made a number of proposals to redraft some of the contentious articles of the Gatt civil aircraft agreement code. Europe, for example, had agreed to limit to 45 per cent direct government support for research and development of new Airbus programmes. 'From 100 per cent for the early Airbus programmes, launch aid has been reduced to 60 per cent for our latest programme, the A330/A340 and to nil for the A321,' Mr Pierson said. In return, Europe wanted total transparency in the indirect support the US manufacturers receive from their government. However, this proposal had been turned down by the US administration. Mr Pierson claimed Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had received Dollars 23bn in indirect supports from government agencies between 1978-87. The US, however, disputes this. Mr Pierson stressed that the European consortium's target was to finance future programmes from internal funds. 'We have done so for the A321. As we start delivering a complete range of aircraft from 1993 onwards, we will be in a better position to compete with Boeing on an equal footing,' he said.</p>

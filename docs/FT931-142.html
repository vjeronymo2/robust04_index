			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Toiletries lift Jeyes 33% JEYES, the manufacturer of hygiene and cleaning products, yesterday reported a 33 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.6m for the year to January 2. Mr Jimmy Moir, managing director, said Jeyes had benefited from a particularly sharp rise in the sales of moist toilet paper, hygienic wipes and toilet cleaners. Overall sales rose 45 per cent to Pounds 89.4m, of which Pounds 18.5m was due to the acquisitions of Globol, a German air freshener and toiletries manufacturer, and of Quickies, the wipes brand. Global contributed about Pounds 500,000 to operating profits of Pounds 6.3m compared with Pounds 4.9m, with a further Pounds 250,000 coming from Quickies. Mr Moir said the current year would be one of reorganisation and consolidation. No large acquisitions were planned although the company had its eye on a few bolt-on purchases. The company had invested Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 2.7m) in capital expenditure. The final dividend is a proposed 4.5p making a total of 7.6p (6.4p), payable from earnings of 21.5p (18.5p) per share.</p>

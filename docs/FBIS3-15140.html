			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia has stated that the proposal that its troops  be withdrawn from Estonia by 31 August has become redundant and  that the troop withdrawal (?will continue) according to a  timetable to be determined by the Russian side. Vasiliy Svirin,  leader of the Russian delegation [at 17th round of  Estonian-Russian talks], made a statement to this effect at a  news conference today. Viewing the outcome of yet another round  of talks between Estonia and Russia, Svirin said that they  satisfy neither the Russian nor the Estonian side. For the  Russian side the first priority is the situation of its  compatriots in Estonia, but these issues were practically not  even discussed because of the Estonian side's position.  Explaining the change of view on the date for the withdrawal  that was previously put forward by the Russian side, the Russian  delegation leader said that this results from statements by the  Estonian side (?which is now avoiding putting this in writing).  Svirin mentioned the readiness to finance the building of  housing for Russian servicemen, the giving up of mutual  compensation, and the agreement ensuring social guarantees for  retired Russian servicemen.    Speaking about the border between Estonia and Russia, Svirin  said that the issue is clear for Russia: the border is where it  runs at present. Estonia, however, is making territorial claims  on Russia, Svirin claimed. Russia does not see it as possible  to resolve the border issue through an international court. If  the Estonian side does not wish to set down markers along the  border Russia will do so unilaterally, Svirin added. At the  same time Svirin stated that the Russian side intends to  continue the talks in order to achieve friendly and [word  indistinct]] cooperation and mutual understanding.    Commenting on the statement made by the leader of the  Russian  Federation's delegation at the news conference, Estonian  delegation leader Vaino Reinart said that the Estonian side does  not wish to break off the talks, either. The statement read out  just now may, however, lead to the talks being broken off and  Estonia changing her delegation [words indistinct]. Reinart  noted that the Russian side did not agree to hand over to the  Estonian side a list of Russian citizens living in Estonia,  making a reference to [words indistinct]. Estonia proposed  that on the subject of the Estonian-Russian border the  International Court in The Hague should be approached. The  Russian delegation rejected the proposal unambiguously, said  Reinart. He went on to state that the Estonian Government is  due to discuss the [word indistinct] outcome of the 17th round  of talks in the near future.</p>

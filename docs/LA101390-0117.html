			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW JONES FREEZES SALARIES AND IMPOSES OTHER CUTS;  </P> <P> * PUBLISHING: THE COMPANY THAT OWNS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WILL ALSO ELIMINATE  TEMPORARY JOBS AND CUT ITS NEWS SPACE.  </P> <P> Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, is freezing budgets  for capital spending and salaries and imposing other news and business cutbacks  to cope with weak financial results and the sluggish economy.  </P> <P> The cuts, announced in an internal memo to managers Thursday, followed weeks of  rumors about a possible retrenchment and triggered concern over possible future  layoffs at the media and financial-industry giant.  </P> <P> The memo, a copy of which was obtained Friday, also said Dow Jones will reduce  management bonuses next year, eliminate all temporary help, try to eliminate  all editorial staff relocations and reduce space devoted to news in the  Journal.  </P> <P> Dow Jones earlier in the week announced a 17.5% drop in third-quarter profit,  reflecting a steady downturn attributed principally to the company's  acquisition of the financial information service Telerate Inc.  </P> <P> The internal memo from Dow Jones Chairman Warren H. Phillips and Publisher and  President Peter R. Kann freezes all capital expenditures immediately and holds  all 1991 department budgets -- including total salary costs -- at 1990 levels.  Accounting for inflation, the budget cut would amount to more than 5% for 1991.  </P> <P> Dow Jones will sell its corporate jet and reduce its aviation staff, and sell  excess land purchased for Journal printing plant expansion and printing presses  in storage, the memo said.  </P> <P> The memo said Dow Jones would reduce Journal special report inserts and table  plans for a Journal magazine.  </P> <P> Among its other problems, Dow Jones has been hurt by the recession plaguing  Wall Street since the 1987 stock market crash.  </P> <P> Operating income at Dow Jones' business publications, which include the Journal  and Barron's weekly, dropped 80% in the second quarter. Advertising linage at  the Journal dropped 16% in the period.  </P></p>

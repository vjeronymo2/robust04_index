			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: An accessible Elliott Carter - Broadcast music For Radio 3 listeners still on their way to work, with car radios or Walkmans, on weekday mornings after 9 the 'Composer of the Week' is generally a safe bet. The accredited Greats can be sliced into specialised five-morning exhibits (Bach at Cothen, say, or Mozart's quintets, or Stravinsky's choral pieces); other weeks can feature less familiar but digestible composers - Chausson, or Biber, or the lesser colleagues in Schumann's circle, nothing tougher than Britten or Bartok. All this week, however, Radio 3 is treating innocent ears to a radical modernist, the American Elliott Carter. Just a day younger than the late Olivier Messiaen, he turned 85 on Saturday (as Berlioz turned 190); but Carter is still formidably hale and genial, and laden with new commissions. Yet between the reverence accorded to him among serious musicians, and the bare acquaintance with his name that most concert-goers have, the gap remains enormous. In the days when I still read The Times, Bernard Levin used regularly to invoke Carter's name as the very emblem of rebarbative modern music. Lutoslawski and Tippett, who are also old enough to have published a body of more easily 'accessible' music before they located their most original veins, enjoy much broader acclaim. To any listener new to Carter, and with meagre experience of 'progressive' musical developments since about 1950, the works of his splendid late maturity may seem opaque thickets. There is a lot of intense polyphony, and a lot of drama, but without standard, recognisable guidelines; not knowing what you're meant to listen for, you may retreat baffled. It is like meeting Beethoven's late quartets without knowing any Mozart or Haydn. But the series devised for Radio 3 this week by Misha Donat (which really started last Thursday night, with Carter's 1969 Concerto for Orchestra) has a judicious, enticing virtue, and a further bonus. The special virtue is that it enlists early, 'easier' Carter each day to set us up for the denser stuff - something that would be difficult and expensive within a live concert programme. The earlier pieces, all from the war years, share an American breeziness (with notable ingenuity, but no very striking individual voice) with the out-of-doors terms of Copland and Piston - but also the rangy contrapuntal lines Carter developed whilst studying in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. From today to Wednesday, each programme culminates in one of the grand transitional works which take the ideal of free-running counterpoint far out: the piano and cello-and-piano sonatas, and the towering First String Quartet of 1951. Those all trade upon just enough post-Romantic rhetoric to give us reassuring signposts, but also attune us to constant platform-hopping between one passionate line and another, simultaneous but only loosely and fluidly - and yet most calculatedly - connected with it. Though the intricate whole seems to teem far beyond what we can take in, it draws us into ever closer listening, with ever-increasing rewards. In Carter's music, as he himself declares in these broadcasts (his crusty, sensible commentary is the special bonus here), the distinct voices 'are free people; this is a world of free individuals joining together to do something - in their own way, and not all marching in goosestep together, the way they do in older music.' Deeply American, that; but the exercise Carter gives it is vitally exhilarating, demanding a new, athletic kind of musical attention. As the pubescent hero of the American TV series Soap declared, after losing his virginity to his schoolmarm, 'It's like discovering you've got a third arm]'</p>

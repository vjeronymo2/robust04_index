			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 24 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today cracked some jokes about his Cuban counterpart Fidel  Castro. He said Castro "is becoming more modern: He changed his  combat fatigues for a light shirt [guayabera]" during the recent  summit of Ibero-American heads of state and heads of government  in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.    In response to a journalist's question on the Cuban leader's  change of dress, Menem said: "It is a good omen that leads us to  believe Cuba will soon be democratized."    Menem emphasized that he responded with a joke the  journalist's question because "this style of dress suits him  well and makes him look younger."    "I said it with all respect and with all my affection for  the  president of Cuba," said Menem, who for the first time used the  word "president" for Castro. He previously referred to him as  "the commander."    Menem later told the journalists that, during his meeting  with U.S. President Bill Clinton, "the Cuban issue was not  discussed."    Menem held informal talks with Castro in Colombia. He  referred to the Cuban issue during a news conference at the  Argentine Embassy in this city after meeting with Clinton at the  White House.</p>

But they don't seem to be scared by the threat that "Seoul  will be turned into a sea of flames if war breaks out,"  attributed to a North Korean delegate at an inter-Korea meeting  last week at the truce village of Panmunjom.    They believe that if the North dares a preemptive attack  against the South it will suffer quick destruction.    "Yes, that's right," said a military source who wanted to  remain unnamed. "By the time they drop many bombs on Seoul,  Pyongyang will be turned into a desert," he said, citing the  very aggressive and retaliatory counterattack plan of South  Korean and U.S. forces.    He was referring to Operation Plan 5027 of the South  Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command (CFC), or "Oplan 5027."  Under the plan, also called "USFK 5027" and "CFC 5027," the  combined defending forces of the two countries will occupy  Pyongyang and Wonsan on the east coast of North Korea within two  weeks of a North Korean invasion, neutralizing the Stalinist  regime and thus unifying the Korean Peninsula.    "In case of a North Korean preemptive attack," said the  source, "the combined defending forces will not give up Seoul or  restrict themselves to repelling the enemy forces north of  Seoul; they will advance to toppling the North Korean regime and  thus regain the northern territory."    Such an aggressive counterattack plan had remained  classified  for years. But Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, in a testimony  before the National Assembly, Wednesday confirmed the existence  of such plans, saying that Seoul will make use of a North Korean  invasion to fight national reunification.    "We have a strategic concept that in case North Koreans  launch a preemptive attack we will use our retaliatory  operations into an opportunity of national reunification," Yi  said before the parliamentary Defense Committee.    Military experts said the operational concept of the CFC has  changed from a defensive one, under which South Korean and U.S.  forces were supposed to check the advance of invading forces  north of Seoul, or along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Under an  even earlier operational plan, the defending forces were to  retreat to the south of Seoul, waiting for U.S. reinforcements  before launching counterattacks.    "But under CFC 5027, a preemptive attack by the North would  mean the collapse of the Stalinist regime and national  unification," explained a military expert.    The CFC 5027 assumes a five-phase war scenario. In the first  phase, the CFC, confirming signs of a North Korean attack,  requests deployment of the U.S. flexible deterrence option  (FDO), or quick deployed reinforcements, to the South.    Defcon III is invoked and the defending forces are on  standby, awaiting further orders.    In the second phase, North Korean forces launch artillery  attacks on the South Korean forces deployed along the DMZ,  infiltrates special warfare troops into Seoul and other cities  to harass the rear. Major roads are filled with South Korean  refugees, serving as an obstacle for the CFC operations.    North Korean ground troops cross the border, and Scud and  Nodong missiles hit Seoul and other major cities and military  facilities in the South. CFC forces battle invading forces,  hitting and devastating key military areas in the North. U.S.  carrier battle groups join the attack against the rear of the  North and Patriot missiles guard against Scud and Nodong  missiles. The North Koreans are checked north of Seoul.    In the third phase the main forces of the North Korean  troops  are destroyed. The defending forces cross the DMZ and march  northward, amid amphibious landing operations conducted on North  Korean shores. CFC forces further advance to Chongchon River,  north of Pyongyang. CFC has yet to decide whether to march  further to the Yalu River that divides North Korea and China.    In the fourth phase, Pyongyang is occupied and CFC forces  control local residents.    In the last phase, the Korean Peninsula is reunified under  the leadership of South Korea.    In this aggressive operational plan, major damage and  casualties on both sides are expected. But Defense Minister  Yi's willingness to make use of a North Korean invasion as a  chance for national unification is widely accepted as a timely  manifestation of Seoul's confidence in its defense preparedness.  It's also a strong warning to the North not to run the risk.    But nevertheless, a problem lies in the possibility that the  North Korean regime may knowingly run the risk, not because it  thinks it can communize the South by force, but as a means of  solving chronic and explosive internal problems, such as the  failing economy.</p>

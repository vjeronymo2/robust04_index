			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Muppet family files suit against Disney THE planned marriage between the creators of Miss Piggy and Mickey Mouse ended in the law courts yesterday when Henson Associates, a family-run company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit against Walt Disney, accusing Disney of knowingly violating copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets. The relationship between Disney and Henson dates to 1989, when the Hollywood studio tentatively agreed to acquire the Henson film library and the rights to some of Henson's most popular characters, including Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog, in a deal valued at Dollars 150m. But the arrangement started to fall apart after Jim Henson's untimely death last year, thoughnegotiations for a licensing agreement covering a Muppet movie due to open on May 4 and a Muppet stage show continued until this month. According to Henson, the negotiations failed because Disney insisted on exclusive control of all Muppet characters in the two productions in order to further its domination of the theme park market. Disney, said yesterday the suit represented 'an enormous distortion of the facts.' It said 'each Disney concession was met by another Henson demand until finally it became impossible and the negotiations to acquire the Henson company ended.'.</p>

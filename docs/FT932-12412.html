			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Zenith records deficit of Dollars 21.8m in first quarter ZENITH Electronics, the last US manufacturer of television sets, suffered a loss of Dollars 21.8m in the first quarter, or 72 cents a share. The loss is slightly lower than last year's deficit of Dollars 28.6m, or 98 cents. The operating loss narrowed to Dollars 18.6m in the quarter, from Dollars 25.9m a year ago, while revenues improved in the quarter to Dollars 290.5m, compared with Dollars 265.2m. The sales increase came mainly from shipments of colour televisions. However, losses mounted because television prices continued to decline in the quarter. Lower pricing offset higher sales volume and corporate cost reductions, according to Mr Jerry Pearlman, Zenith president. The company had said it intended to cut costs by Dollars 75m this year, following cost reductions of more than Dollars 50m in 1992. Zenith is consolidating operations in Mexico, where the majority of its television sets are assembled. First-quarter results include more than Dollars 5m in royalty income from tuning system licences, the company said. Zenith this month received a commitment for Dollars 90m in new revolving credit, which will give the company breathing room to continue with its restructuring plan.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Bank 'should be free' on policy THE BANK of England should be free to set monetary policy independent of the Treasury, with the sole objective of pursuing price stability, while coming under much greater parliamentary scrutiny, a high-level independent panel says today. In a report published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, the panel chooses a middle way between the German Bundesbank model and that of the New Zealand Reserve Bank for a more independent UK central bank. It builds on the increased responsibility given to the Bank for achieving price stability since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. Noting that the new system 'has so far had an easy ride', the report's authors, chaired by Lord Roll of Ipsden, the president of S G Warburg Group, say that now is the best time to equip Britain with a stronger monetary anchor before inflation reappears. The best available anchor is a more independent Bank of England. The 12-man panel consists of academics, City luminaries, former central bankers and erstwhile finance ministry officials from Britain and abroad, including an expert in constitutional law and a former Bundesbank director. The panel has attempted to take account of the UK's history of high inflation in recent decades and its powerful parliamentary institutions. It has therefore rejected the German approach to central bank independence, which relies on the Bundesbank's strong counter-inflation reputation that gives it a free hand in implementing policy, and the New Zealand system of a legal framework of contracts to govern the setting of targets and conduct of policy. Instead, the panel emphasises transparency, monitoring and accountability. The panel proposes that: Price stability should be the Bank's sole statutory objective and the Bank, not the Treasury, should formulate and announce a medium-term target for inflation. The Bank should have full control of short-term interest rates. The Bank's conduct of monetary policy should be subject to routine parliamentary review, primarily through the Commons Treasury and civil service committee. The Bank should also submit its inflation target to parliament via the chancellor, who would be expected to comment on the Bank's actions. The Bank would be expected to explain how far its monetary policy options were constrained by government fiscal policies. The Bank should have no powers to lend money to the government. Sterling's exchange rate should be primarily left to the foreign-exchange markets. In a crisis the government must have the power to overrule the Bank and take over economic policy, including monetary policy, for a limited period of time. But such a temporary suspension of the Bank's objectives would require parliamentary approval. The report explicitly rules out small overrides of targets, which it says would be a recipe for 'target drift'. The Treasury said yesterday that the report was an interesting contribution to what would be a lengthy debate on the future of the Bank and that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would not pass judgment before the debate was concluded. Although Mr Clarke has given the Bank more freedom to attack inflation, he made it clear at the Confederation of British Industry's conference in Harrogate this week that he was not convinced that it should be independent. Officials at the Bank pointed out that its priority was to achieve price stability, and independence would only be possible if the British people and parliament wanted it. The next stage in talks about the Bank will come with the publication of the Commons committee's report. Independent and Accountable: a new mandate for the Bank of England.

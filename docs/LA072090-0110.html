			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE / INTERNATIONAL TRADE: REPORT AIMED AT PC FIRMS PURSUING PIECE OF  EUROPE  </P> <P> For computer companies muddling through the stacks of business and joint  venture proposals from Eastern European companies, picking a suitable market  and reliable business partner can be a headache. A new quarterly publication is  hoping to point the way for computer makers to reach the right markets.  </P> <P> Microcomputer Marketing, a quarterly report published by Microcomputer  Consultants Inc. of Irvine, says that besides the Soviet Union and East  Germany, only three East Bloc countries have the potential for developing trade  ties with the U.S. personal computer industry: Poland, Czechoslovakia and  Hungary.  </P> <P> It will be easier for PC makers to enter the three markets as a supplier to  local assembly plants, the report advised, because the governments impose high  tariffs on assembled computers. More important, certain restrictions imposed by  the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls still apply until  the countries put in place export control mechanisms suggested by the  Paris-based group, which administers export controls for Western countries.  </P> <P> Most personal computers sold in these Eastern European countries are  IBM-compatible machines manufactured in the Far East and often assembled by  Polish, Hungarian and Czech PC suppliers.  </P></p>

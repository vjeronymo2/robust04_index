			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better slow - and authoritative Sir, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the supply of new cars was indeed slow ('Monopoly panel rapped as toothless', July 26), but it was very thorough. It cost the UK motor industry millions of pounds to supply the MMC with the information it sought. The evidence enabled the MMC to conclude, with authority, that the motor industry was not abusing its market power or operating against the public interest. Surely a large, highly complex industry employing three-quarters of a million people requires thorough consideration by an independent panel of experts if massive damage to Britain's industrial structure is to be avoided. This must be better than precipitate action by other bodies, like the Consumers' Association, which appear to have already made up their minds before they start an investigation. Mike Hollingworth, head of policy, Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, Forbes House, Halkin Street, London SW1</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Zhengrong: "Progress in Sino-U.S. Relations"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent decision to  renew China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status and to  de-link the future MFN renewal from human rights issues has  cleared away a major obstacle in bilateral trade relations, and  created a good turning point for normal development of Sino-US  relations.    As Chinese officials have pointed out, Clinton's decision  would create favorable conditions for further expanding trade  and economic cooperation between the two countries, helping  improve and develop bilateral relations in the fundamental  interest of the two nations.    Over the past several years, decision making concerning the  US policy toward China has been filled with a series of  complicated contradictions. On the one hand, the idealist trend  calls for the US government to put more stress on ideological  goals and on human rights issues. On the other hand, realistic  or practical demands require a kind of pragmatical, sustainable  long-term approach towards China, with more consideration for  America's economic and strategic interests. The United States  wishes to see a unified and stable China, because a weak or  troubled China may bring about regional instability in the  Asian-Pacific Region. The United States also sees an  increasingly strong China as a potential opponent.    Under these circumstances, the issue of MFN status,  originally a subject of foreign relations, had evolved into one  of the focuses of America's domestic political struggle. The  annual review of China's MFN status became not only an annoyance  to China, but a wrench American politicians used to throw in  each others' works, which caused considerable bother in both  countries business communities.    There are several factors contributing to the US  government's  change on its China policy. First, the US government realized  that it is dealing with an accelerated economy in the world.  The United States has growing economic interests in China,  where the economic trend is providing enormous opportunities for  trade and investment. Economic consideration has always been a  top priority for the pragmatic US government decision-makers.    Second, the past decade has seen much progress China has  made  [sentence as published]. Its foreign and reform policies have  steadily improved, and this progress is not seen to be slowing  down in the near future.    Moreover, it is widely recognized that China's strategic  role  in the post-Cold War world didn't decrease but increased, which  is supported by its progressively stronger economy.    The two countries also have many common interests in a  number  of global issues such as nonproliferation of high arms  technologies and environmental protection.    Pressure on the US government for separating trade from  nontrade related issues was mounted not only from the economic  circle, but from numerous politicians and diplomats. It was  widely recognized that the annual review of China's MFN status  was a double-edged sword which could have cut into both parties'  economic interests.    However, since Americans have a long standing tradition of  idealism, and proselityzing their own morals throughout the  world, it is not easy for them to give up the attempt to  influence China, probably through means other than trade under  the pretext of human rights. However, things changed hands, and  a bright cooperative future is seen to be rising from the dust  of long-time foot stomping.    The issue of human rights in essence reflects some people's  dissatisfaction with China's political system to a large degree.  However, China's system, which has survived nearly 45 years of  various trials and hardships, will certainly not be changed by  any other than China's own.    Due to different levels of social development, the United  Statics and China have many differences in human rights views.  As a developing country, what concerns China most is how to  provide adequate food and clothing to its 1.2 billion people.  In fact, it has to put more stress on the rights of survival  and development, because China still has about 80 million people  living at substandard levels, mainly concentrated in remote and  poor areas. But the problem of poverty in the United States is  not of the magnitude as China.    So if not viewed with an understanding attitude, the United  States will have difficulty understanding China's viewpoints in  regards to human rights. Of course, China is willing to discuss  relevant issues with the United States and other Western  countries, but is not receptive to foreign pressure.    To sum it up, consideration of economic and strategic  interests have surmounted the political quarrels in the US  decision making. We are looking forward to future Sino-US  relations, after the positive step taken by President Bill  Clinton, a practical, productive, fore-sightfull stand in the  interests of Sino-American relations, that will be essential to  the stable and growing maturity of Sino-US relations.</p>

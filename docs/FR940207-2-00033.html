Means, President of Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI), on behalf of the New York Telephone Co. In its Motion, RRI requested reconsideration of an April 13, 1993 Decision and Order that dismissed NY Telephone's refund Application on the ground that it was filed after the March 1, 1993 deadline for submissions in the Gulf proceeding. See Gulf Oil Corp./Bresett,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23 DOE &para;85,031 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering RRI's Motion, the DOE determined that RRI had not presented any compelling reason that would warrant acceptance of the late Application. In addition, the DOE determined that RRI's conduct in connection with the Application did not meet the standards applicable to participants in agency proceedings. Accordingly, the DOE determined that RRI should take specified remedial measures designed to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct in question. Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration was denied, and RRI was ordered to take the specified measures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yankee Oil Co., Inc.;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.L.

(Yankee), and modified a refund previously granted to F.L. Roberts &amp; Co., Inc. (Roberts). In August 1978, Yankee had sold some of its assets, including its supply contract with Texaco, to Roberts. In considering the Yankee claim, the DOE found that Roberts had been granted a refund based upon purchases of Texaco products made by Yankee prior to May 1976. Roberts conceded that it was not eligible for a refund based upon these purchases but argued that it was eligible for a refund based upon purchases made after April 1976, when Yankee signed a supply contract with Texaco. The DOE held that the right to a refund is an asset separate from the supply contract and was not transferred to Roberts by the transfer of the supply contract. However, Roberts was eligible for a refund based upon Texaco products purchased beginning in August 1978. Therefore the Roberts refund was reduced by the amount of the refund it had incorrectly received in an earlier Decision. As a result, Roberts was granted a refund of $11,381 ($8,300 principal plus $3,081 interest). Yankee was granted a refund of $48,206 ($35,156 principal plus $13,050 interest) based upon purchases made from March 1973 until August 1978.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

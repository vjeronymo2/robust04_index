Responding to Senate passage of a bill that would allow U.S.  retaliation against financial services, Toshiomi Uragami,  chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, told a news  conference that he has heard no complaints from foreign life  insurers about barriers to the Japanese market.    Uragami noted the 10 foreign companies in the association  and  said he was certain that Japan is running a trade deficit with  the United States in the insurance sector.    The fair trade in financial services, passed Thursday by the  U.S. upper house and expected to pass the House of  Representatives to become law, was amended before passage to  include insurance firms among those subject to retaliation.    Insurance is also a candidate for possible sanctions under  the recently revived Super 301 provision in U.S. Trade Law and  is one of three priority sectors in bilateral trade framework  talks.    Asked about the effect on U.S. markets if Japanese life  insurers pull out, Uragami said the impact of Japanese money  fleeing currency and other risks would be limited because  Japanese investors have been squeezing their dollar-based assets  for the past two years.    They have also hedged their holdings against exchange and  other risks, he said. Uragami, who is also president of  Sumitomo Life Insurance Co., said two years ago that one-fourth  of his company's assets were in dollars but now the portion is  down to 9 percent, of which 4 percent is hedged.    Japanese institutional investors used to cover fund  shortages  in U.S. treasury and other capital markets, but Uragami said  that influence has faded somewhat.    He indicated that he thinks U.S. officials do not consider  the possibility of fleeing Japanese investment to be a big  danger for the market.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Elektra' according to Ezra Pound - Theatre Translation flowed near Ezra Pound's heart. For more than 50 years it occupied him, and enriched his other work. It floods through his Cantos; his versions of Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian, Anglo-Saxon, Provencal and Chinese poetry amount to a large part of his output. And his 1954 rendition of Sophocles's tragedy Women of Trachis, as has long been recognised, is in the vanguard of radical translation, with its modern colloquial energy, its freedom from conventional grammar, and its patches of speech printed in upper-case. (See, for example, Herakles's last words: 'Come at it that way, my boy, what/ SPLENDOUR, IT ALL COHERES.') Pound had already tackled another Sophocles play, the Elektra, in 1949, while first recovering from nervous breakdown and mental instability in St Elizabeths Hospital, Washington DC He undertook it with enthusiasm. But he put the translation under the name of his assistant Rudd Fleming, an American professor and novelist, for his pro-fascist war record had left him in a legal situation then so precarious that he did not wish to be known as sane enough to be able to translate Sophocles. Only in 1989 was it published as Pound's version - and in 1990 in the UK (Faber &amp; Faber). Last week, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama gave this Elektra its first British staging. Regrettably, the production, directed by Chattie Salaman, went overboard in trying to reveal the Pound in the play. The setting is St Elizabeths; Pound and other pyjama-clad inmates turn into the main Greek characters, with white-clad medics doubling as chorus. Before the play starts, the inmates softly keep asking Pound (as he types) 'What part ob yu iz deh poEM?' (a line he put into Canto 104). Salaman took this concept from Richard Reid's scholarly introduction to the Faber edition, and then added yet further complexities. The characters, though usually donning Greek-style attire and make-up, spoke in accents from the American South. This helps, for those are the main accents of Pound's text. How else could you deliver such lines as 'This is what we're agoin' to do,/ listen sharp and check up if/ I miss any bullseyes.'? (Also, to us, this makes a connection to O'Neill's Southern Mourning Becomes Electra.) But why did Salaman sometimes dress Orestes &amp; Co. like folk from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, with theme music to match? And why split the role of Elektra in two - one actress black, dressed in white, one white dressed in black? No interesting dichotomy in the role is revealed. The members of the young cast managed their American accents, and their extensive amount of singing and chanting, pretty well. They could not always make Pound's colloquialisms sound serious; it would take a mature actor to bring off the sober irony of Orestes's 'You won't have any more trouble with Mother' after his matricide. But, in most respects, they revealed the difficult text to advantage. Pound's metres made their full impact: for which Salaman and the composer, Alessandro Timossi, (working in a wide range of styles) deserve praise. Pound's Elektra, though it remains highly eccentric, brings out the neurotic urgency in Sophocles's drama. (Electra: 'I'm not dead yet, it's a dirty life/ but my own./ It annoys 'em. That honours the dead,/if the dead get any joy out of that.' And 'Slave-driver more than a mother I'd call you/ and a rotten life I have with you and your fellow-feeder/ put all the low jobs onto me'). If only the production had tried to add fewer layers of meaning, and to tell us less about Pound and more about Elektra, it would have been truer to both Pound and Sophocles.</p>

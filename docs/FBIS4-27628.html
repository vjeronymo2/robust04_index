			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Choe Kyu-sik] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 25 May, that our government will  conduct an overall reexamination of its policy toward the North  in connection with North Korea's nuclear development, thereby  readjusting our position toward "the declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."    The government has worked out such a policy under  circumstances in which the prevailing opinion is that "the  declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" has  virtually become scrap paper because North Korea possesses a  nuclear reprocessing facility referred to as a radiochemical  laboratory, in Yongbyon, and in preparation against the  eventuality that might be created if North Korea is revealed to  have already developed two or three nuclear bombs following the  measurement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor.    In this connection, at the Foreign Affairs-National  Unification Committee of the National Assembly on 23 May, Yi  Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for national unification, said:  "If North Korea should continue to maintain the radiochemical  laboratory, which is known to be a nuclear reprocessing  facility, we cannot but reevaluate the declaration of the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula from a new angle."    The government is going to focus on the question raised by  Deputy Prime Minister Yi at the Unification-National Security  Policy Coordination meeting to be held on 27 May before making  public a new government position.    Prior to this meeting, the government is said to also be  undertaking a working-level policy finetuning procedure by  convening a strategic planning team meeting for unification and  national security composed of chiefs of relevant agencies'  offices and bureaus on 26 May.    One high-ranking government official said: "Deputy Prime  Minister Yi's remarks are based on a basic principle, but his  remarks are loaded with meaning. The government is of the  opinion that it should lay a clearer and more detailed policy  before the public this time. Now is not, however, the time to  declare the nullification of the declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. His remarks emphasize  ensuring the nuclear transparency of North Korea. The  government also needs to send out a strong warning message to  North Korea for its on-going nuclear development. The United  States has the position that the special inspections of North  Korea's nuclear development should be settled at the third round  of North-U.S. high-level talks. We cannot rule out the  possibility that even if North Korea is revealed to already  possess two or three nuclear bombs, the United States will not  be able to do anything because of its adherence to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty system. We need to readjust our  position in preparation against this situation."</p>

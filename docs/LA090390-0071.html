			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> A TRIPLE TREAT: DONEGAN, WILSON AND REEVES AT UCLA  </P> <P> A triple treat of jazz music was served up in healthy doses Saturday night by a  triple threat of jazz talent at L.A. Jazz '90, the third such festival  presented by the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation.  </P> <P> Though the crowd at UCLA's Royce Hall was small, those in attendance were  treated to a pair of legends (Dorothy Donegan, Gerald Wilson) and a  legend-in-the-making (Dianne Reeves), each of whom demonstrated his or her  crafts with style and originality.  </P> <P> The opening set was provided by Donegan, whose lusty, hard-swinging piano style  can turn a ditty like "Tea for Two" into a mainstream jazz masterpiece. At 66,  she's not lost one iota of her drive, spirit or imagination, as she capably  demonstrated during a too-short set that included a simple blues that grew into  a rollicking boogie-woogie, with enough musical quotes and references to fill  an encyclopedia.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, what was lost to the audience was the verbal side of Donegan.  Working inexplicably without a microphone, her asides and frequent outbursts  didn't reach past the first few rows.  </P> <P> Reeves, whose range of musical styles is as broad as her vocal range (three and  a half octaves), stuck to jazz during a brief set that left the audience  wanting for more. Opening with Cole Porter's "Love for Sale," Reeves embarked  on a seven-minute excursion into the song's jazz potential, leaving no stone  unturned.  </P> <P> Reeves, who was reunited with pianist Billy Childs and bassist Tony Dumas for  this event, worked beautifully with the band as they explored a pair of ballads  ("Softly as in a Morning Sunrise," "For All We Know") and a magnificently  rendered "The Nearness of You." Her closing number, the Max Roach-Abbey Lincoln  opus, "Freedom Day," was a vocal tour de force and a fine showcase for the  exceptional drumming talents of Terry Lynn Carrington.  </P> <P> Gerald Wilson, whose Orchestra of the '90s was given the closing spot, proved  as capable a promoter/instructor as he is a composer/arranger. The  septuagenarian Wilson, whose career has spanned most of the history of the  music, discomforted with his eagerness to point out his own achievements.  </P> <P> But the music soared and familiar tunes like "Blues for YNA," "Teri" and  "Jenna" showcased not only the leader's talent but also those of his 17-man  orchestra, especially those of trumpeter Oscar Brashear, whose reading of  "Carlos" was simply mesmerizing.  </P></p>

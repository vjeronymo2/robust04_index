			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali  Alatas, who suffered a minor heart attack last week, is said to  be recovering but will remain hospitalized for some time.    Alatas, 61, has been removed from Medistra Hospital's  Intensive Cardiac Care Unit since Saturday to a private room,  the hospital's public relations officer said yesterday.    Roos Jusuf Razak told THE JAKARTA POST that Alatas needed  plenty of rest and was not in a condition to receive any  visitors.    The minister was admitted to the hospital on May 22. Doctors  then said he was suffering from fatigue and had to rest for the  next two weeks.    "Mrs. Alatas has been trying to limit the number of  visitors.  Now, only the minister's family has been permitted to see him.  The family apologizes for this," Roos said.    On Monday, however, President Suharto made a visit and  became  the only guest allowed in besides his family, she said.    Roos said that Mrs. Alatas, who has been accompanying her  husband since he entered the hospital, has continually received  guests and messages of sympathy from around the world.    A security guard at the hospital said Alatas' guests  included  officials from foreign embassies and government officials. He  said Alatas also received "hundreds of bouquets" and more than a  guests- book full of visitors.    Alatas' spokesman Irawan Abidin told THE JAKARTA POST there  had not been any confirmation from the minister's doctors on  when Alatas was permitted to leave the hospital.    "For now, we will keep to the doctor's initial prescription,  in which he was ordered a two-week rest," he said.    Dr. Pattiasina of the Gatot Subroto Central Army Hospital  who  has the authority to give information on Alatas' health, refused  to give details.    "He is doing fine," he said shortly, adding that he was  given  strict orders not to say more.    "I've been receiving reporters since last week, but I did  not  tell them anything," he said heroically. "In fact, I got tired  of them and threw one out of my office."</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Shephard cool on nursery vouchers Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, has played down speculation that the government would use a voucher system to fund its projected expansion of nursery education to cover all four-year-olds, John Authers writes. Speaking to The Independent newspaper, she said voucher systems were 'unwieldy' and said: 'You don't want the machinery to overshadow the policy.' Mr John Major gave a strong hint last week that the government would use vouchers when he told the Conservative party conference that nursery funding 'must promote diversity and parental choice' and must not crowd out 'private and voluntary provision'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok -- Foreign Affairs Minister Sqd Ldr  [Squadron Leader] Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said that all sides  must bear responsibility for the disappearance of a Russian  diplomat.    Sqd Ldr Prasong pointed out that it is the responsibility of  the police to the search and investigate the case, saying he was  not directly in charge of the affair.    The Russian embassy has asked for cooperation from Foreign  Ministry on this matter, he said.    He said he had provided Interior Minister Gen Chawalit  Yongchaiyut with the information in order to help the foreign  ministry.    If Thai police couldn't find the missing third secretary  Igor  Makeyev, all must take responsibility, as it will tarnish the  country's image because foreigners may view Thailand as an  unsafe country.    The foreign minister said officers suggestions that the  Russian envoy had already left the country was only an  assumption because his passport was found to have been left in  Thailand.    He warned those who discussed such issue to be careful in  what they say because it might cause confusion.</p>

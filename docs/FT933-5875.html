			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Mr Grumpy at the door: Alice Rawsthorn and Michael Skapinker ask whether Disney's European adventure will have a fairytale ending As the head of a group famed for its marketing of fantasy, Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, has little difficulty finding cheer where others see only gloom. But even he seems taken aback by this summer's wave of media coverage about the financial problems of Euro Disney, the group's theme park which opened near Paris last year. Most worrying for the group and its shareholders is that some observers have begun to ask the previously unthinkable: will Euro Disney have to close for the winter or, worse, might it have to close altogether? Mr Eisner said yesterday that he might consider closing the park for a limited period during the winter under certain circumstances. He might agree to partial closure, he said, 'if Euro Disney came to me and said it was economically advisable and wouldn't be negative for perception. Disneyland in California used to close on Mondays and Tuesdays before I became chairman.' Partial closure, however, is not his favoured option. 'I don't believe the park should close for a single day,' he says. 'Euro Disney closed the Newport Bay Hotel for a while last winter and I think that sent the wrong signal.' When Euro Disney opened in April last year, accompanied by a two-hour live television broadcast to 30 countries and a Dollars 10m TV advertising campaign, closure was the last thing on the company's mind. The fanfare invited intense scrutiny - so the company is in no position to complain about the detailed attention given to Europe's biggest leisure attraction. But Mr Eisner is irritated by the focus on Euro Disney's problems rather than its potential. 'Every little pimple is written about. Euro Disney is a great product and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't love it. But down the road, discussion of the economic issues could affect public perception of the product. It hasn't happened yet, but if we don't turn it round, it might.' The economic issues warrant discussion. Euro Disney lost FFr339m (Pounds 39m) in its last financial year to September 30 and is on course for a further loss of more than FFr1.8bn this year. Its net debt has risen from FFr18.5bn to FFr20.3bn since the start of the current financial year. Euro Disney is now in danger of running out of cash. Walt Disney has promised to provide financial support while the two companies try to restructure Euro Disney's finances. In the meantime, Walt Disney faces heavy losses on its 49 per cent stake in Euro Disney. It lost Dollars 30.9m on the holding in the third quarter of the current financial year alone and would have lost Dollars 48.8m under its old accounting rules. Mr Eisner does have some advantages, notably Wall Street's faith in Walt Disney as a whole. As it attempts to resolve its problems at Euro Disney, the group can rely on its strong track record in producing hit movies and its schedule of new films for 1994 and beyond. Mr Christopher Dixon, an analyst at New York broker Paine Webber, believes Euro Disney will succeed as the economy improves in France and Europe. Meanwhile, Walt Disney's third-quarter results, to the end of June, saw a reasonably healthy 10 per cent increase in underlying earnings per share compared with 1992, although revenues from filmed entertainment dropped and the company has not had a box office hit in the US this summer. Wall Street is expecting strong earnings momentum next year, when Disney will be greatly expanding its film production. However, the group's association with Euro Disney's heavily publicised problems risks damaging its gilded reputation with investors. How did Disney, one of the world's most successful leisure and entertainment groups, manage to get its European park so badly wrong? From the start, questions were asked about Disney's ability to repeat its US success in Europe. The Paris climate was unsuitable, critics said, and visitors would not come during the winter. The cost of running a park in Europe was high, they added, and the prices would reflect that. Many potential visitors might prefer to go to Walt Disney World in Florida, where the price per night was no higher and the sun was more likely to shine. In addition to these potential problems, Euro Disney had the misfortune to open just as Europe entered its worst recession since the war. In its first year, Euro Disney fared reasonably well in terms of attendance, hitting its target of 11m visitors at the end of April, just over a fortnight later than expected. However, income from catering, merchandise and hotels was well below expectations. In the spring and summer of this year, trading deteriorated still further. It was only this summer, Mr Eisner says, that the gravity of the situation became apparent. He says: 'It didn't hit until May and June. We realised then that attendance was not up to last year's levels and that per capita expenditure was substantially down.' Added to the ravages of the recession was the strength of the French franc which had risen sharply against some European currencies following last September's exchange rate crisis. Attendance from countries with weaker currencies, notably the UK and Italy, fell sharply. The cost of servicing Euro Disney's debt ballooned, partly because, until recently, French interest rates have been higher than initial budget forecasts. Euro Disney was also forced to postpone construction plans, thereby depriving the company of potential capital gains with which it had originally planned to reduce its borrowings. One obvious answer to Euro Disney's difficulties is to cut costs. The company has made significant cuts in the past 18 months, particularly in staffing levels. When it opened, staffing costs exceeded the planned budget, Mr Eisner says. 'There was this absolute feeling of 'let's get this show on the road',' he says. 'I don't know whether we overspent then, because it should pay off over the next two or three decades. But it took us a while to recover financially from having too much fat and satisfying every little whim.' Mr Eisner envisages further cuts, but is vague about where they will fall. 'There will be some tidying up, but only to the extent that we don't damage the experience for our customers. We're looking at all the various areas.' In the meantime, Mr Eisner hopes to increase attendance by continuing to cut ticket prices for local residents and by capitalising on the franc's recent fall against other European currencies by marketing the park in other countries, notably the UK. These initiatives, Mr Eisner hopes, will be helped by further falls in the franc's value and by an improvement in Europe's economic outlook, particularly in France. 'We ought to be able to achieve a lot through better trading,' he says. However, Euro Disney's financial condition is so fragile that even a dramatic improvement in its operations is unlikely to do more than partially alleviate its difficulties. Mr Eisner says that Euro Disney has not, so far, had to call on Walt Disney's offer of financial support. But observers suspect that Euro Disney may have to do so by November, when attendance falls off as the chilly winter season sets in and cash flow comes under strain. This suggests that, whatever improvements it makes in its operations, the company will need an injection of new capital as part of a formal restructuring. Euro Disney and its US parent are now in the early stages of assembling a financial restructuring package. Here, too, Mr Eisner refuses to be specific. 'All I can say is that we're examining every option,' he says. He describes a possible rights issue as 'one of a list of 10 very good ideas'. Mr Eisner hopes to finalise the restructuring plan over coming months and present it to shareholders by next March. 'I wouldn't like to be talking about it this time next year,' he says. 'The sooner it is completed the better - not for financial reasons, but for public relations reasons.' Additional reporting by Martin Dickson in New York</p>

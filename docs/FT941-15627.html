			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Germany to relax dual-use curbs The German cabinet yesterday approved a series of proposals to pave the way for Germany to comply with European rules on the export of equipment which could be used for military purposes. The move illustrates the willingness of the German government to allow German companies to export dual use industrial goods which can potentially be used for both civilian and defence purposes. Germany and Britain have some of the strictest export rules for dual-use goods in Europe. Germany tightened its legislation three years ago after German chemical companies were found to have been exporting to goods to Libya which were used to produce chemical weapons. German companies have been lobbying to have such strict requirements relaxed, arguing that they are placing German exporters at a disadvantage. Members of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), both in the parliament and in the government, have increasingly thrown their weight behind a relaxation of arms exports rules. The cabinet proposals aim to change the German jurisdiction so it can be adapted to an EU directive on the export of dual-use goods. The directive, currently under discussion in Brussels, is expected to follow less stringent requirements applied by other EU states.</p>

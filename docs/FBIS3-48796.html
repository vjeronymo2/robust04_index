			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura plans to  publish a book entitled "Japan: A Small But Brilliant Nation"  ["Chisaku-Tomo Kirari-to Hikaru Kuni: Nippon"] early this week.  Takemura, who has been noted for being at odds with Ichiro  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  over political stance and strategies, intends his new book to be  an antithesis to Ozawa's "ordinary country" [futsu-no kuni]  argument on which the latter elaborates in his book entitled "A  Plan To Rebuild Japan" ["Nihon Kaizo Keikaku"]. Takemura's book  will be a follow up to a magazine article published early this  month in which he unfolded his "anti-Ozawa declaration." In the  backdrop of expected political turmoil with the rejection of the  political reform bills at the upper house plenary session, there  have been rumors that Ozawa plans to "remove Takemura." Under  such circumstances, Takemura's book is expected to create new  ripples in political circles.    Takemura directly challenges Ozawa's assertions in the fifth  chapter of his book where he explains his views on where Japan  ought to be in the world. Here, Takemura does not mention  Ozawa's name, but says: "It has been argued that to preserve  world peace, Japan should make military contributions  appropriate to its national strength. To state my conclusion  first, I do not agree with this idea." He also says: "I  believe what the world earnestly desires of Japan is its active  participation in nonmilitary contributions." He thus challenged  Ozawa's "futsu-no kuni" argument.    As concrete ways in which Japan can make nonmilitary  contributions, Takemura proposes a "green peacekeeping  operations" project in which young Japanese can serve to work on  "covering the earth's continents once again with greenery." In  so saying, he stresses Japan should strive to become an  environment-oriented nation.    Meanwhile, regarding the ruling coalition government's  internal situation, Takemura says: "Discussion is openly held  on a major portion of the policy area." However, he adds:  "Personal relations cannot necessarily be judged on what  appears on the surface. It is quite possible that antagonism,  discord, and internal strife could occur due to conflicting  interests and emotional troubles." Thus, Takemura's book draws  attention as it gives a gloomy forecast of Japanese politics in  view of a further regrouping of the political parties.</p>

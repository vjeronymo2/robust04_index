			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UN official to deliver warning to Saddam THE head of the UN commission overseeing the destruction of Iraq's most dangerous weapons is going to Baghdad to warn of serious consequences if President Saddam Hussein continues to defy Security Council resolutions, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent in New York. Mr Rolf Ekeus was directed last night to make the trip after he reported at a closed-door council meeting that Iraq continued to display 'serious, grave, even appalling disdain' for the world body and its decisions. He will undertake the mission amid continuing speculation about possible US measures to overthrow Mr Saddam. Mr Ekeus has constantly complained of Iraqi duplicity in its attempts to hide weapons of mass destruction and failure to meet even some of the most elementary obligations in mandatory UN resolutions. Baghdad says the requirements are excessively intrusive and violate its sovereignty. Meanwhile Iraq has told the UN it plans to send a high-level delegation to New York to plead in the Council for the lifting of sanctions. The Iraqis seem certain to claim that sanctions are hurting old people, women and children. However, Mr Saddam's refusal to accept UN terms set last August for a limited lifting of the oil embargo to provide funds for medicines and other humanitarian supplies will not help his case. President George Bush and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, both emphasised during last month's Security Council summit session that sanctions must continue. Mr Bush said they could not be removed while Mr Saddam remained in power.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Reed slims stake in BSkyB venture REED INTERNATIONAL, one of the big five backers of British Sky Broadcasting, said yesterday that it would not invest any more money in the satellite television venture. As a result Mr Ian Irvine, Reed deputy chief executive, resigned as both chairman and a director of BSkyB. He will be replaced as chairman by Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times. The decision by Reed, which has committed more than Pounds 180m in equity, loans and guarantees to BSkyB, was revealed to a BSkyB board meeting. Reed's 10 per cent stake in BSkyB will now be diluted to around 4 per cent and the company said last night it would write down at least its equity stake in the venture - Pounds 34m net of tax. Mr Peter Davis, Reed's chairman and chief executive, said last night he was confident about the long-term potential for satellite television in the UK and the viability of BSkyB. 'However, the board does not wish to increase its investment further in BSkyB as we prefer to invest in our core publishing and information businesses where we have more direct management control.' The issue came to a head over plans to raise a further Pounds 200m for the venture following last November's merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television. The four main BSB shareholders - Granada, Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, Chargeurs and Reed - were expected to put up about Pounds 100m with Mr Murdoch being responsible for the other half. The Reed board decision not to go ahead was unanimous. Granada will put up its original share of the Pounds 100m package and Pearson and Chargeurs will take up the slack left by Reed. The Pearson and Chargeurs stake will rise to around 15 per cent each. Agreement on the Pounds 200m package - Mr Murdoch will put up his share in a mixture of cash and value such as film rights - is expected to be completed at the beginning of next week. Reed's decision was partly motivated by fears that the current fund-raising of Pounds 200m might not be enough to see the venture through to profitability. The decision not to participate in further funding was taken in spite of the fact that Mr Davis and Mr Irvine were instrumental in bringing BSB and Sky together for what turned out to be successful merger talks. In fact, Reed may have encouraged the merger in order to safeguard the future of its Pounds 130m in guarantees and a Pounds 17m loan. The Reed decision comes at a time when satellite dish sales are rising. Market research carried out for Satellite TV Finance, a specialist FT newsletter, also suggests that 54 per cent of subscribers to the old Sky Movie channel will also buy BSB's Movie channel.

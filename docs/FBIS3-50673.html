			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Arnulfist Party [PA]  presidential hopeful, met this afternoon with President  Guillermo Endara Galimany. They discussed the government  alliance and its prospects for the presidential elections. PA  members said their hopes to head the presidential ticket has  strengthened. The issue of the alliance was discussed during a  meeting held this afternoon at the Palace of the Herons between  President Guillermo Endara Galimany and Mireya Moscoso de Gruber.    [Begin recording] [Moscoso de Gruber] We obviously talked  about the government alliance. I told the president that the PA  wants to maintain this alliance. I informed him we will soon  talk to Molirena [Liberal Nationalist Republican Movement] so  they decide whether they want to remain in this alliance with  the PA or wish to abandon the alliance.    [Ortega] Would any other political group, such as  Solidarity,  join this alliance?    [Moscoso de Gruber] We have been talking to some parties. We  have also spoken to Solidarity representatives, but I think they  are waiting to see what will happen with the government  alliance. So far we have only talked without reaching any  special commitments.    [Ortega] It should be pointed out that [former Comptroller  General] Ruben Dario Carles' presidential candidacy has been  endorsed by Morena [National Renewal Movement]. To what degree  does this pose an obstacle to your aspirations to be top leaders  of the PA?    [Moscoso de Gruber] No, Morena has every right to nominate  Mr. Carles for the presidency. We, the Arnulfists, are going to  nominate our candidate on 23 January. It is no obstacle for us  that Morena nominated Carles.    [Ortega] Finally, it has been learned some political parties  have hidden weapons. How do Arnulfists view this? Do they feel  threatened by this irregular situation?    [Moscoso de Gruber] It is regrettable that at this point it  is said some political parties maintain weapons, which they will  definitely use in the upcoming elections. It is regrettable  they would try to disrupt peace in the next elections. We want  the upcoming elections to be peaceful, although from what we  said in April in the city of Boquete, I thought at that time  that the next elections would not be peaceful. We believe  Panamanians want peace, free elections, and to live in a  democratic country. [end recording]    Mireya Moscoso de Gruber highlighted once more that she will  not give up leading the presidential ticket. She also noted  that once the campaign begins, her popularity and that of the PA  will increase and the results of polls will change completely.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Directors size up new rules: Company compliance with the Cadbury code the definitive rulebook on good corporate governance - and already corporations are keen to show their compliance. From June 30 every company whose shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange will be required, as a condition of listing, to disclose in its annual report the extent to which it complies with the code drawn up by the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, which bears the name of its chairman, Sir Adrian Cadbury. The committee has made 19 recommendations intended to improve the functioning of corporate boards of directors. Although company annual reports for 1993 will most reflect the changes required, some companies are already expressing in their 1992 accounts their intention to follow best practice. Ms Gina Cole, secretary to the committee, said: 'If there is mass non-compliance, the government may wish to step in.' She said the committee would have to look behind published statements to see whether companies really were complying with the code. Not surprisingly, one company which has stated its good intentions is Cadbury Schweppes, the company of which Sir Adrian was chairman. It says in its 1992 annual report: 'The company complies with 17 of the 19 items of the code.' It says it will consider compliance with items covering the effectiveness of a company's systems of internal controls, and with directors reporting that a business is a going concern 'when guidelines for those two items have been developed'. The annual report also describes the roles of the audit, remuneration and nominations committees, all of which are chaired - as recommended by the Cadbury committee - by a non-executive director. Also making reference to best corporate governance practice is M&amp;G Group, the UK's largest unit trust manager. M&amp;G, as an institutional shareholder, has taken a vigorous line on corporate governance matters and its chief executive, Mr Paddy Linaker, had urged the Cadbury committee to take a tougher stance on some issues than it did. M&amp;G's 1992 accounts spell out the composition of the audit, remuneration and executive committees and their reporting functions and say that executive directors are employed under one-year rolling contracts of employment. The committee had recommended a change in the Companies Act to cut to three years from five the maximum length of a director's contract. Also announcing their compliance with the code in their 1992 annual reports are British Gas, the management consultants Holmes and Marchant Group, the freight group NFC, and Wellcome. Grand Metropolitan, which violates one of the central recommendations of the Cadbury report - the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive  -also includes a compliance statement. The committee had said that separation of the top roles was desirable but not absolutely necessary if the proper checks and balances were in place. Grand Met's statement, from its non-executive deputy chairman, does not mention the combination of the roles. It does say though that the company complies with 16 of the 19 recommendations.</p>

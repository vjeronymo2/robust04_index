			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW HAS BAD START II JITTERS  </P> <P> Suddenly the two superpowers are stumbling again over arms-control numbers.  Last month President Bush proposed a ban on land-based mobile missiles with  more than one warhead. Then Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent word to  Washington last week that he could not bargain away the only big missiles he is  able to hide and leave America's submarines free to prowl the seas with  multiple-warhead missiles.  </P> <P> The START II impasse arises out of two very different military traditions. The  Soviet Union has always viewed intercontinental missiles much like very big  artillery pieces. Because artillery is based on land, most of the Soviet  nuclear force is based on land. The U.S. deployment pattern is markedly  different because the Air Force and the Navy are competing for a piece of the  nuclear action. The latest proposals of the first START treaty would leave only  about 10% of U.S. warheads based on land, with the rest deployed on bombers or  in subs. Under the same plan, Moscow would have more land-based missiles than  any other kind.  </P> <P> Each generation of submarine missiles is more accurate than the last and  today's super subs are no easier to find than they ever were. This is a potent  deterrent to a surprise Soviet attack because it would leave the entire sub  force available to retaliate. Searching for a similar sense of security, the  Soviets have begun deploying missiles that can be moved around and hidden on  land almost as effectively as submarines are at sea. But Trident subs can also  be first-strike weapons because their new missiles are so accurate they could  cripple Soviet missiles in their silos. This is what Moscow cannot accept.  </P> <P> Despite the fresh climate in Europe and the Soviet Union, Moscow is not going  to jump at an offer that has a clear bias in Washington's favor. If we want to  ban multi-warhead land-based missiles because that would favor America, we will  have to give something to Moscow in return. That much about arms control  negotiations is not about to change.  </P> <P> SUBMARINE NUKES  </P> <P> Number of nuclear warheads on U.S. and U.S.S.R. nuclear submarine fleets:  </P> <P> Soviet Union: 3,632  </P> <P> United States: 5,024  </P> <P> Source: Arms Control Assn.  </P></p>

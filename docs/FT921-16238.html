			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Gold and currency reserves up Dollars 382m THE underlying level of Britain's gold and foreign currency reserves rose by Dollars 382m (Pounds 212.2m) last month, boosting the government's resources to defend the pound. The rise, which was larger than expected, takes into account proceeds of Dollars 335m from sales to the public of BT shares, and Dollars 100m from other countries in payments towards the costs of the Gulf war. It is thought the Bank of England intervened modestly on currency markets in December to support sterling, spending Dollars 50m from the reserves. More intervention might become necessary should the pound continue its weak showing of recent weeks. The overall level of the reserves, which takes into account areas such as Treasury bill transactions, rose by Dollars 211m in December, bringing the total at the end of 1991 to Dollars 44.13bn.</p>

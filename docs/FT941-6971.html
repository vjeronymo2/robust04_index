			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: Heady brew of beer and capitalism - Michael Thompson-Noel finds that even a teetotaller can have fun in the old breweries of Bohemia Even a teetotaller can enjoy a knees-up in a brewery in Bohemia. I haven't tasted alcohol since 1983, when I became a learner-driver, but I still like to watch other people drinking. Especially to excess. Annihilating brain cells with flairful indifference. This party was under way in the hospitality room of the recently modernised Regent brewery in Trebon, in the Czech Republic, about three hours south of Prague, not far from the Austrian and German borders. The brewery was founded in 1379, prospered in the middle ages, and was once owned by Prince Schwarzenberg. The beer flowed. An excellent three-man combo, part of the brewery's brass band, played blood-rousing drinking songs. And the brewery's manager, immensely proud of his beer, twirled around in raptures of delight, making little speeches, beating time to the music, flirting with the PR, badgering the servers to serve the beer faster and beaming his delight at welcoming to his brewery a small group from England. The group was visiting the area at the invitation of another Bohemian brewery in nearby Ceske Budejovice (formerly Budweis). In 20 years' time, Prague, the Czech capital, may have reclaimed its position as one of Europe's most cultured cities. It is a marvellous place; go there now. But if you want to see how capitalism and democracy are bursting into colour in the dawning Czech spring, you could do worse than south Bohemia, especially the area around Trebon and Ceske Budejovice. There are plenty of cheap hotels, some of them more than comfortable. Plenty of sights to see. And a foaming river of beer. The food is intriguingly dire  -not for want of ingredients; the problem is the cooking - but cannot fail to improve. Anyway, this close to the Austrian border there are numerous fine coffee dives and plenty of cream cake. The previous day we had toured the Samson brewery (est. 1795) in Ceske Budejovice. Samson, still owned locally, is interesting for the foreign friends it is making and for its success in pumping up the volume of exports of Czech lager. Its Zamek brand of premium-strength lager is imported into Britain by Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries, otherwise known as Banks's. Fran Hayes, Zamek's UK brand manager, reckons that by 2000 premium lager will account for a quarter of all UK beer sales, and says: 'Zamek has been positioned to be recognised as a major participant in the beer market, coming as it does from the land of the lager experts.' Lager was invented by the Czechs, in Pilsen in 1842. As a result, the marketing effort in Britain can claim that Zamek is a distillation of 'Czechness,' its strong, golden taste - I am taking this on trust - deriving from a combination of 'fragrant Zamek hops, locally grown malted barley, exceptionally soft Czech water and a special strain of yeast.' Not that the Czechs need help consuming the stuff. They drink 36 gallons of beer per head per year, the world's highest such consumption. They have been brewing beer in Ceske Budejovice since 1254. It is an airy and pleasant town - capital of south Bohemia, population just below 100,000, thriving tourism, two universities, a re-established tramway system and a scientific library, which replaced the former museum of the workers' revolution. Some good hotels and restaurants, too, including the Hotel Zvon: excellent and not expensive. Very little in the Czech Republic is expensive, especially food and lodging or the crystal glassware you can buy almost everywhere. Not far away is Cesky Krumlov, a splendid medieval town which is now Unesco-listed. Tourists flock there and can hardly be disappointed, especially by the castle, which has a famous ballroom and a superb late Baroque theatre. This is a great town for festivals: music, theatre, dance and exhibitions. From June 17-19 it stages its annual festival of the five-petalled rose, which includes music, parades, a folk market, night shows and something called 'live chess.' On a much smaller scale, I was greatly taken with Trebon and its surrounding forests, moorland, lakes and fish-ponds. Fish farming, particularly carp farming, started locally in the 13th century; the art of fish breeding is said to have reached its peak three centuries later, under the rule of the last lord of the Rosenberg family. An information guide to Trebon makes slightly bleak reading. 'Have you decided to spend your holidays in Trebon?' it asks. 'Maybe you are in town for the first time and thus we would like to make easier your decision where to go in leisure time. Of many possibilities we have chosen: Walk to Opatovicky mill. Walk along Zlata stoka canal. Walk to the hillock. Walk to the Rosenberg fish-pond. Walk around the Svet fish-pond.' Trebon is far more appealing than that, with plenty of accommodation, from hotels to private homes. Numerous tour operators and agents organise holidays in the Czech Republic. It has good roads and is easy to get about. Information: tourist office at the Czech embassy in London: 30 Kensington Palace Gardens, W8 4QY, tel: 071-243 7981/2.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Why not simply stop working? - Machines are changing our social order by freeing up the human brain Why do we work? Whenever I ask myself this question, which is frequently, the obvious and simple answers come to mind, such as to feed and clothe the family. It is, however, a question usually addressed privately because it is not easily voiced openly in a society where unemployment is rife and where work has become the chief focus of human activity. It was heartening to hear last week, therefore, someone not only attempting to answer this question historically but also examining its broader implications. Alain Cotta, professor of economics at Paris Dauphine University, told delegates of Hay mangement consultants' international conference in Prague that work was a 'very new concept', less than two centuries old. He was speaking about work in the sense of something sought out as an edifying pastime that brought with it social status. Before the industrial revolution only those people with no other choice worked, and the more they worked, the lower their social status. He said: 'Social order was then based on a hierarchy inverse to that based on work.' 'Work was not even permitted at all at the ultimate summit as this would have meant going against the social status which had been attained,' he said. Only later did the work concept become the key to merit and meritocracy, claiming the status of moral value. 'As soon as it was introduced on the social scene by industry, work suddenly claimed all the honours,' said Cotta. He quoted the 19th century German philosopher Hegel's warning that work 'suspends desires' and directs energies towards the production of goods. In accepting work in mechanised industry, people were themselves becoming part of the new machine state, taking orders from a chief or boss, something which Elias Canetti, the Nobel prize winner, once compared to 'pins driven in our flesh', he said. Hegel's observation that machine would replace muscle and in so doing create machines of people, was right, Cotta concluded, but a new process was taking the transformation further, he suggested, taking over the nerve cells or neurons. He called it the 'neuron prosthesis'. Cotta said: 'More than half the people are now employed in sectors where they create, release, transfer, receive and utilise information. The crossing of the frontier between muscle and neuron may have as many consequences as the rise of industry.' Cotta is putting his finger on the information and technological revolution that is overtaking the industrialised world. He is suggesting that work has turned full circle to the point that 'people are now looking forward to filling their time instead of producing. Man is trying to free himself from the original painful constraints of work.' He not only points out what many of us have resentfully accepted - that industry has increased the time spent at work, separating people from their domestic and social life - but says that arguments against work today focus not on its duration but on the subordination of individuals to orders. Here, he may be trailing developments. Far from subordinating the employee, the advent of delayering and empowerment in the workplace has led to the emasculation of the middle manager and is even challenging the influence of higher management. Cotta identifies the emergence of three groups of people in society differentiated by their relations to work. The largest is the middle class, defined as 'all the individuals for whom work remains to be endured and is their only way to earn a living - but not a reason for living'. He has no category for the traditional working class. The second are those excluded from work because of the ever increasing levels of education, qualification and technology, or because they have retired on a pension or excluded themselves voluntarily, living on benefits or private income. The last group, he says, comprises people who have chosen to work, including those in the professions. While these three social groups are at present stable he asks whether progress may induce further the condemnation of work and the attraction of two extremes: exclusion and predilection. What, asks Cotta, is going to happen to his middle class? 'Once the level of development can ensure a decent life where work requires minimal efforts, if not none, its schedules being considerably reduced and made flexible, the charms of the 'exclusion' become more evident. Why not simply stop working?' Work then, he argues, could once again be a key factor of social evolution. Social dynamics would be motivated by two powerful attractions: 'the sentence to death of work or the assertion that it can be the reason for living.' Now for something completely familiar. Day Associates, which compiled the above table said that 5 per cent was being widely quoted by City institutions as their budget for base salary increases for 1995. Year on year from August to August, said Day, City clerical salaries, including bonuses, rose on average by 8.8 per cent while management salaries rose by 15.2 per cent in the same period. The table shows a selection of data from its latest quarterly survey of pay and benefits of 315 jobs in 135 banks and finance houses. The first three columns show average basic salaries for various rankings in the same type of job, followed by the average basic salary, and then bonus paid as a percentage of basic salary. Finally, the last two columns indicate the percentage of people with car allowances and the average amount.

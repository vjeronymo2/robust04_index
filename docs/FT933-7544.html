			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Canal Plus in TV move CANAL Plus, the French media group, is expanding its television production interests by taking full control of Medialab, a Paris-based facilities house specialising in new technology, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The deal follows weeks of uncertainty for Medialab as Videosystem, its parent company, has gone into receivership. It forms part of Canal-Plus' strategy of diversifying its interests beyond its highly successful French pay-TV station. Canal Plus, which already owns 38 per cent of the facilities house, has been negotiating since early this month to buy the rest of the shares.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Renault to sweeten staff share terms Renault employees are likely to be offered a discount of up to 20 per cent of the price of shares in the French state-owned automobile group as part of its partial privatisation, Mr Alphandery, economy minister said yesterday. Under terms of the sale, Renault employees are due to be offered 10 per cent of January's shares when the government sells a stake of about 28 per cent in the group. Pricing Details have yet to be announced for the sale, expected to take place in November. The offer of cheap shares to Renault employees will be accompanied by other incentives, including a delay in payment and the possibility of free shares if they hold their investment for at least three years, according to Mr Alphandery. The government and Renault's management see such incentives as a means of strengthening worker support for the privatisation. Some unions, particularly the communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail, are opposed to the sale. The CGT has called for a day of action to protest the operation tomorrow.</p>

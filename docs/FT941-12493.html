			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Norwich Union dental link - At a glance Norwich Union Healthcare is linking up with MIDA Dental Plans to offer cover for dental treatment at three levels. Premiums will range from Pounds 6 to Pounds 12 a month, depending on the level of cover and where you live. Age and previous dental history do not matter. The levels start with basic cover for examinations, X-rays, fluoride treatments and scale and polish, plus worldwide emergency cover. The medium level adds basic fillings and simple extractions, while the top of the range plan also covers root canal fillings, non-surgical treatment of gums and crowns.</p>

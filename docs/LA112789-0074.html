			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO'S 'ORLANDO FURIOSO' IS TEDIOSO  </P> <P> It looks and sounds all too familiar.  </P> <P> Marilyn Horne, mezzo-coloratura assoluta, struts about the stage in ornate  high-heeled drag. She pretends to be a semi-mythological warrior-hero. Her  vehicle this time happens to be Vivaldi's "Orlando Furioso," anno 1727, but it  could be any number of related 18th-Century exercises.  </P> <P> The diva models a silly plumed helmet and trails a mile-long cape. She gurgles  and roars her mellifluous way through mile-long da-capo arias that dip and soar  and curl and cackle with infinite convolution yet go nowhere.  </P> <P> In Horne's best vocal days, one didn't have to love the style to appreciate the  virtuosity. Those days, alas, seem to be drawing to a close.  </P> <P> At the War Memorial Opera House on Friday, her technique still seemed  extraordinary. Unfortunately, the tone at her command tended toward the harsh  if not the threadbare.  </P> <P> The new production by the San Francisco Opera relies, after a fashion, on the  critical edition of Ulysses Roseman Jr. Mercifully, the musical sprawl is  reduced from 83 numbers to 61. Still, the performance lasts nearly 3 1/2 hours.  Tedium triumphs.  </P> <P> In the last act, Horne interpolates an extended excerpt from an unrelated  Vivaldi cantata -- "Fonti di pianto." This tragic digression jolts the mood,  literally disrupts a rather bizarre mad scene, and adds one more pointless  showpiece to an evening already overloaded with pointless showpieces.  </P> <P> Vivaldi apparently cranked out more than 90 operas in his lifetime. He produced  arias much as a good butcher produces sausages. He was a professional and a  utilitarian.  </P> <P> His melodic and harmonic formulas reveal few surprises. Little in "Orlando"  suggests illumination, much less inspiration. Poor Ariosto.  </P> <P> Terence McEwen, the former general director of the San Francisco Opera,  obviously planned this production as yet another esoteric indulgence for Horne.  It turned out to be a costly, and not particularly flattering, indulgence.  </P> <P> It also turned out to be an indulgence plagued with misfortune. Both Sir John  Pritchard, the intended conductor, and Pier Luigi Pizzi, the original director,  fell ill prior to opening night. Randall Behr, who had canceled "La Rondine" in  Long Beach to attend rehearsals here, ultimately took over Pritchard's baton.  Ugo Tessitore, the sorcerer's backstage apprentice, assumed responsibility for  Pizzi's staging scheme.  </P> <P> The stilted music fared better than the stilted drama. Behr kept the chamber  orchestra chugging along nicely, and accompanied his singers with sympathetic  elan.  </P> <P> Tessitore could do nothing to make Pizzi's awkward stylizations seem natural.  Nor could he make the mannered maneuvers look anything but predictable, which  is bad, and silly, which is worse. Adding scenic injury to theatrical insult,  Pizzi's slick, precious, white-on-black decors explored new frontiers of cutesy  neo-Baroque chic.  </P> <P> The cast mustn't be blamed for any of this. Everyone worked bravely. Everyone  performed stock gestures and tired rituals resourcefully, under trying  conditions.  </P> <P> Susan Patterson actually sang radiantly as the unangelic Angelica, princess of  Cathay. William Matteuzzi introduced a fine Italianate bel-canto tenor in the  thankless duties of Medoro. Kathleen Kuhlmann mustered appropriate sorcery as  the bewitching, if subdued, Alcina. Sandra Walker's gutsy contralto proved  useful as Bradamante, and Kevin Langan was his old sonorous self as the  knightly basso, Astolfo. Jeffrey Gall did his strident best to validate the  confused passions of Ruggiero, even though the castrato challenge inevitably  lost something in countertenor translation.  </P> <P> Many in the audience stayed to the long-delayed end. Some even stayed awake. It  was a considerable achievement.  </P></p>

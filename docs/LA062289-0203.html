			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH &amp; FITNESS;  </P> <P> EATERS' DIGEST: 4 CONFESSIONS;  </P> <P> DIETITIAN SAYS DIARISTS DINE PRETTY WELL BUT THEY LEAVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT  </P> <P> Certain exercises in self-examination can be unsettling -- the kind of zingers  Dr. Ruth or Barbara Walters ask, the sorts of questions that make you clear  your throat. Questions about morality, quirks, peccadilloes, scandals, big  goofs.  </P> <P> In Southern California, for instance, in the land that glorifies granola and  fresh fruit and eating to win, the makeup of one's diet could be a source of  unease. Would you be willing, for example, to fess up to every bite of food you  had over the course of three days? And write it down for analysis by a  registered dietitian? Even the Twinkies and the doughnuts and the Maui potato  chips?  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Edition found four fearless residents, representing  four different age groups, who were willing to do just that. And, said Santa  Ana registered dietitian/consulting nutritionist Rebecca Smith, who did the  analysis, they needn't have worried much. The four are typical of Orange County  residents in that, for the most part, they eat pretty well. They fit the  profile of those surveyed in The Times Orange County Poll -- 86% of the  respondents said they pay either a lot or some attention to diet and nutrition  -- and their eating patterns are fairly typical for each age and circumstance.  </P> <P> "People tend to put a lot more importance on their appearance (in Southern  California)," Smith said. "It's not like the East, where you can put on a big  overcoat and hide your body. That can be both good and bad. I've seen a lot of  children who are just on the chubby side, just a few pounds overweight, being  ridiculed at school, and teen-age girls who are bulimic or anorexic. But we are  becoming more conscious of what we eat."  </P> <P> Here's what Smith had to say about the eating habits reflected in the four  volunteers' food diaries, from youngest to oldest:  </P> <P> Erin Kiapos, 12, a sixth-grader at Morningside Elementary School in Garden  Grove  </P> <P> Smith said she was impressed that Erin, unlike many girls her age, drank a good  amount of low-fat milk, nearly at every meal.  </P> <P> "Most girls that age don't get good calcium, but hers was more than adequate,"  Smith said. Also, "she did eat breakfast, and a lot of kids that age don't.  About 75% of the kids I see skip it."  </P> <P> However, like many children and adults, Erin tended to eat high-calorie snack  foods on the weekends and make up for it early the following week by cutting  back on total calorie intake. (A better plan, Smith said, is a steady intake of  food, without bingeing or fasting.)  </P> <P> Overall, however, Erin got high marks from Smith, who said that her total  average caloric intake for the three days was "right on the nose" at around  1,800 to 1,900, which may be attributable to the place she eats most of her  meals.  </P> <P> "Because she's 12, she lives at home and she's under the influence of her  parents," Smith said.  </P> <P> Erin said she did eat most of her meals at home, and that her mother packed a  lunch for her to take to school each day.  </P> <P> "I usually eat vegetables and salads and stuff," she said. "Sometimes I'll go  for the junk food, but I don't eat candy because I have braces."  </P> <P> Her diet differed slightly from the norm over the weekend, because she went to  an international festival at Old World in Huntington Beach, where international  foods were served.  </P> <P> The dietitian's recommendations: skim milk rather than low-fat, lower-fat  cheeses, fewer sodas, lower-fat lunch meats, dried fruits and more grains.  </P> <P> Norman Major, 15, a sophomore at Santa Ana High School  </P> <P> Again, Smith said, the calorie intake over the three days was appropriate for  Norman's age: about 3,000 calories per day. And vitamin levels were OK, because  teen-agers tend to take in such a large volume.  </P> <P> However, many of those calories came from foods that Smith said were typical of  kids that age. "Teen-agers' eating habits tend to be pretty haphazard."  </P> <P> Norman ate too few vegetables and salads (vitamin K levels were low as a  result), too much protein- and cholesterol-laden food (such as hot dogs and  pizza) and far too much sodium (also the result of processed or fast food),  Smith said. Soft drinks also appeared too frequently, and calories from fruit  came in the form of orange juice (an occasional piece of fruit would have been  preferable, she said).  </P> <P> The most balanced meal was Norman's Saturday dinner. It included chicken,  orange juice and potatoes.  </P> <P> Norman agreed that the Saturday dinner was the best he had during the three  days. However, he said, with the coming of summer he eats more of his meals at  home, at more regular times.  </P> <P> "It's kind of tough to do that during the (school) year," he said. "It's been  pretty busy lately."  </P> <P> Smith's recommendations: more routine eating habits, especially including a  balanced breakfast, fewer sodas and lower-fat cheeses, milk and meats.  </P> <P> Art Barrett, 40, owner of a public relations firm in Tustin  </P> <P> Barrett's pattern of eating was typical of a businessman who does a lot of  eating out: almost no or very little breakfast, a medium-size lunch and a big  dinner, Smith said. "He does tend to choose the lower-fat foods at restaurants,  though, and he's a big vegetable eater, which a lot of men are not."  </P> <P> The pattern seemed to indicate his diet was "catch as catch can" when he ate at  the office, more balanced when he ate out, she said.  </P> <P> Also, she said, similar to Erin Kiapos, "he hit his ideal calorie intake  (between 2,000 and 2,500 calories, approximately) on Friday and Saturday, and  on Monday he severely cut back (to about 1,100 calories). A lot of people do  that: splurge on the weekend and cut back on Monday when everybody goes to the  gym, and then by Friday they've fizzled out again," eating larger and less  healthy meals.  </P> <P> Barrett scored well for eating low-cholesterol foods, such as fruits, breads,  margarine and pastas, but the sodium content of the overall diet was high, the  result of the amount of salt added to restaurant foods.  </P> <P> "I generally eat more of my foods at home," Barrett said, "and I'll make some  things ahead of time, like lentil and vegetable soup, that I can eat throughout  the week. The week I kept the diary I discovered a terrific Italian restaurant,  though, and I ate three meals there. Generally, I've been making an effort to  eat regularly and have more healthy food."  </P> <P> Smith's recommendations: a more balanced caloric intake between breakfast,  lunch and dinner and more balanced non-restaurant meals.  </P> <P> Ruth Mann, 79, a resident of Leisure World in Laguna Hills  </P> <P> She was the most regular as far as her scheduled meals and her eating routine,  Smith said.  </P> <P> Mann's average caloric intake over the three days was low (just under 1,200  calories), as was her average intake of protein (lower by between 20% and 39%  than the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for two of the days). But that is not  untypical for an older person, who tends to be more sedentary than a younger  one, Smith said.  </P> <P> A calcium supplement was noted by Mann in her diary, as was a favorable amount  of fruits and vegetables and foods low in cholesterol, Smith said.  </P> <P> "For a 79-year-old woman, it's a good diet," she said."I'm impressed."  </P> <P> Mann said her lower caloric intake during the three days was influenced in part  by the fact that she had a plumbing emergency at her home "and worrying about  that kind of took away my appetite. Usually I would have eaten more. I have a  huge appetite, I really do."  </P> <P> She also said her eating habits can be erratic, but she remains active, walking  frequently and participating in folk dancing.  </P> <P> Smith's recommendations: more protein sources, such as cheese and meats, yogurt  and dried beans, as well as milk products.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RUTH MANN  </P> <P> Age: 79  </P> <P> Weight: 152 lbs.  </P> <P>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of manufacturers expressed concerns regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed fuel economy labeling requirements for alternative-fueled vehicles. One concern common to many manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to the requirement to have statements appear on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottom border of the label. Since manufacturers use printed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms to generate fuel economy labels, the number of preprinted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of forms that manufacturers would have to purchase would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase because of the differences in border wording for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different vehicles. Instead, manufacturers recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these statements be written just above the bottom border, leaving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preprinted portion of the label unchanged. Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recommended that the size of the fuel pump logo be reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to accommodate fuel titles above the pump logo and that ``Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mileage Information'' be replaced by a more generic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate title such as ``Fuel Mileage Information''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers recommended that EPA establish an optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label format to include the fuel economy values for dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles while operated on the alternative fuel in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fuel economy values while operated on gasoline as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AMFA. They recommended that these optional fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values could take the place of the reference to having the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customer obtain the information from the gas mileage guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One manufacturer recommended that the proposed label for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas vehicles, which includes a conversion factor of 0.823  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be used by the consumer to convert mpg to miles per 100 cubic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feet of natural gas, should be changed so that the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would perform the calculation for the consumer. The manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would then report the natural gas fuel economy on the lower right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand side of the label in units that are used at retail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several manufacturers commented that the multiplicative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors for label values for gasoline vehicles developed by EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 0.90 and 0.78 should also be applied to alcohol and natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas fuel economy label values. However, these factors may have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be revised as more experience is gained with the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative-fueled vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA believes that the concerns of manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding printing statements on the bottom border of the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy label are valid. The purpose of the proposed location of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statement on the bottom border was to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement was clearly visible and caught the eye of the consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, this objective can still be reached if large print is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used and the statement is printed just above the bottom border of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the label. Therefore, for the final rule, EPA is requiring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this statement be located just above the bottom border of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the comments received in regard to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size of the fuel pump logo be slightly reduced to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate space for the fuel title to be positioned above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logo. The slight reduction in logo size will not have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse impact on the effectiveness of the label in informing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer of the vehicle's fuel economy. In addition, the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pump logo statement ``Gas Mileage Information'' is not appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for vehicles powered by alternative fuels. However, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying the comments received on this issue, the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who recommended the use of ``Fuel Mileage'' in place of Gas Mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreed with EPA that an even more appropriate term would be ``Fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economy''. Therefore, for the final rule, all label occurrences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the term ``Gas Mileage'' are replaced by ``Fuel Economy''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMFA clearly mandates that the label for dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles contain the fuel economy values when operated on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline or diesel fuel, and that additional information be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Gas Mileage Guide regarding operation on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel. The information required to be published in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Gas Mileage Guide includes: the energy efficiency and cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of such automobiles when operated on gasoline or diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels as compared to operation of alcohol or natural gas; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driving range of such automobiles when operated on gasoline or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuel as compared to such automobiles when operated on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol or natural gas; information regarding the miles per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gallon achieved by dual-fueled automobiles when operated on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol; and an explanation of how the information may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to change when the automobile is operated on mixtures of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol and gasoline or diesel fuel (15 U.S.C. 2006(b)(3)). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information will most likely be of interest to a consumer who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deciding whether or not to purchase a dual-fueled vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress recognized that it would be impractical to incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of this information on the fuel economy label and required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, at a minimum, the label contain gasoline fuel economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information while alternative fuel information is contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Gas Mileage Guide. However, the AMFA does not specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibit other label formats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To avoid consumer confusion and frustration with dual-fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle labeling, EPA agrees with commenters that it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial to include fuel economy values while operating on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel in addition to those while operating on gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the same label. This could help avoid problems which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur when a model is offered for sale before the Gas Mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guide is available for a particular model year. However, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be practical to design an optional label that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain all the information that the AMFA requires to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Gas Mileage Guide. Therefore, EPA is providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an optional label format for dual-fueled vehicles that contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited information on the fuel economy while operated on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel. Also, this optional label will contain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement that refers to the availability of additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the Gas Mileage Guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMFA mandates that the fuel economy label values for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dedicated natural gas-fueled vehicles are the values used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAFE purposes multiplied by 0.15. This requires that the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy value units are in terms of miles per equivalent gallon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of gasoline for natural gas-fueled automobiles. The most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate units in terms of consumer usefulness are dependent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on how the fuel will be sold at retail (e.g., per volume, per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight, per equivalent gallon gasoline). Since the vehicle fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market for natural gas is not yet established, the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate label units are not known at this time. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statement: ``To convert these values into units of miles per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 cubic feet of natural gas, multiply by 0.823.'' will only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required if natural gas as a motor vehicle fuel is sold on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume (cubic feet) basis. As an option, the manufacturer can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform the calculation for the consumer and display the values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the label in the following format: ``The fuel economy in units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of miles per [insert units used in retail] is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [insert city fuel economy value] in the city, and [insert highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel economy value] on the highway.'' This format can also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used if natural gas is sold in terms of units other than gallon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent of gasoline or cubic feet. Also, for the optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label format for natural gas dual-fueled vehicles, the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy units while operating on natural gas will be based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units used at retail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA agrees with manufacturers' comments regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessity to reevaluate the multiplicative city and highway fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy adjustment factors for label values to better represent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use fuel economy when more experience and data are available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for alternative-fueled vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

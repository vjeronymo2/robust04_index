			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] An opinion poll taken by the Union Studies Center  for the New Majority in the Federal Capital during the month of  December in the past four years shows that the image of the  Executive Branch has improved appreciably. On the other hand,  that of the Legislative Branch has remained stable, and that of  the Judicial Branch has suffered a considerable downgrading.    The positive image of the Executive Branch showed the  following changes: in 1990, it was 34.4 percent; a year later,  it was 48.5 percent; and, in December 1992, it was 35.9 percent.    Last December, however, it evinced a more than considerable  rise, reaching 48.3 percent. According to New Majority, this is  explained by the government party's victory in the 3 October  elections and the approval of the law on constitutional  amendment.    As for the Legislative Branch, its positive image was  reflected in the following numbers from December 1990 to  December 1993: 15.3 percent, 14.2 percent, 15.3 percent, and  12.3 percent. Although its figures varied little from one year  to the next, this branch shows the lowest index of the three  branches of government.    Insofar as the Judicial Branch is concerned, it showed very  slight changes of opinion among the persons queried between 1990  and 1992. The really sudden shift occurred last year, when it  had recorded an unexpected support just a few months earlier.  This branch had a positive image of 20.9 percent in 1990, 24  percent in 1991, 18.8 percent in 1992, and only 13.1 percent in  December of last year.    This marked setback can be explained by the deepseated  crisis  experienced by the Supreme Court.    The conclusions are as follows:     -  In December 1990, the Executive Branch had a better image  than the Legislative and Judicial Branches; however, the latter  surpassed the Congress. Now, the Judicial and Legislative  Branches have similar indexes.    -  Whereas the Executive Branch  improved appreciably during the past four years, both the  Legislative and Judicial Branches declined during the same  period.    -  Although in most countries it is common for the Congress  to have a lower level of support than the Executive Branch, it  is unusual for the Judicial Branch to have an image that is so  much more negative.       Using the same data collection device, the image of various  power factors was analyzed.    At the end of 1993, the Catholic Church and the FFAA [Armed  Forces] have an image better than that of business owners and  trade unions: a trend that has been repeated during the past  seven years.    During this period, however, the image of the different  factors evolved differently. The Catholic Church, which six  years ago had no more than 36 percent positive opinions, has now  attained 47.8 percent; while the FFAA, which had 24.6 percent at  the end of 1987, have now reached 36.3 percent.    On the other hand, business owners, who gleaned 18.4 percent  positive opinions in 1987, now have 20.1 percent; whereas trade  unions, which had 18.6 percent six years ago, have now garnered  no more than 6.9 percent, with a negative trend.  <H5>  Technical Record </H5>   The poll was taken by sampling opinion on the State's three  branches of government. It included the population residing in  the Federal Capital and in Greater Buenos Aires that met the  voting requirements. The sample size included 1,000 individuals,  and the poll was taken during the month of December in 1990,  1991, 1992, and 1993.

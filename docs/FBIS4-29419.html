			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] Seoul (NAEWOE TONGSIN)--The lexical definitions  of the language used in North Korea provide bases for judging  their political implications. In this sense, from any change in  the definitions of religious words one may be able to detect a  corresponding change in North Korea's religious policy.    In fact, Chosonmal Taesajon [The Korean Language Dictionary]  published in April 1992 shows a striking difference from its  older 1981 version published 10 years earlier, particularly in  handling the religious vocabulary. The new version is a very  comprehensive dictionary which took North Korea 7 years to  compile and it has 330,000 entries in total.    North Korea claims that the new Chosonmal Taesajon, compiled  by the Linguistics Research Institute under the North Korean  Academy of Social Sciences and published by Sahoegwahak  Chulpansa [Social Science Publishing House], covers an  extensive vocabulary used for nearly 100 years since the 19th  century, which has been researched comprehensively while using  the original version published after liberation as a basis.  North Korea has been stressing that the publication of the new  dictionary marks a turning point as it spurs the chuche-based  development of the Korean language; improvements in the  people's speech; the education of party members and workers in  the Korean- people-come-first principle; and an epochal  development of science, education, and culture.    Accordingly, the fact that the definitions of religious  expressions in the new language dictionary, which is of such  great importance, show a marked departure from the old  definitions is amazing in itself and indicates that North  Korea's religious policy is undergoing a realistic change.    First, the most characteristic of all is that the previous  negative or critical view of religion appearing in Hyondae  Chosonmal Sajon [Modern Korean Language Dictionary] (published  in 1981) and Cholhak Sajon [A Dictionary of Philosophy]  (published in 1985) is eliminated by and large in the new  Korean dictionary, which describes the development process of  religion and religious thoughts in a more comprehensive and  factual way.    North Korea's religious policy stems from the point of view  of regarding religion as a form of superstition and a kind of  opium that numbs the revolutionary spirit of the people. This  attitude was fully reflected in the older Korean dictionary  published in the 1980's. On the contrary, the newly published  Chosonmal Taesajon does not equate religion with superstition  but distinguishes between them. It distinguishes between  religion and superstition by trying to describe religious  phenomena in an objective manner while maintaining the old  negative attitude toward superstition. This drastic change  deserves attention, for it indicates that North Korea's view of  religion has widened and become more objective since the late  1980's.  <H5>  Discriminating Between Religion, Superstition </H5>   In Hyondae Chosonmal Sajon published in 1981 defines  religion  as "a reactionary outlook on the world or the belief that  preaches how to dream of a happy life in the other world." On  the contrary, Chosonmal Taesajon defines religion as "the  outlook on the world based on a doctrine that preaches an  absolute faith or belief in the super natural and superhuman  being." In addition, the new dictionary strikes out the  traditional critical descriptions invariably found in the older  versions, such as: "a tool of oppression and exploitation";  "the imperialists' ideological tool for invading backward  countries"; "the opium used in dulling the revolutionary  awareness of the masses and inspiring in them the principle of  nonresistance so that they may unconditionally subject  themselves to exploitation and oppression." Instead the new  dictionary explains religion in more concrete terms, using  expressions such as: "believing the holy being such as God or  the Lord"; and "there are numerous religions and religious  sects, large and small, beginning with the primitive religions  and including Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam."    This change in the attitude of North Korea was reflected in  the booklet titled "Ruminating About the History of the Great  Love" published in 1989. The piece, authored by Ho Chong-suk,  chairwoman of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the  Fatherland, contains an article titled "Let Us Treasure the  Patriotism of a Female Teacher." In this article Ho Chong-suk  tells an anecdote about An Sin-ho, An Chang-ho's younger  sister, who was so moved by Kim Il-song's warmheartedness that  she came to devote herself to the task of nation building and  worked hard for Kim Il-song. The article quotes Kim Il- song as  saying: "Without regard to what religion she believes in, we  should first try to see the depth of her patriotism and the  intensity of her efforts for nation building. We should not  take a jaundiced view of, or discriminate against her by  keeping her at an arm's length simply because she is a  religious woman."  <H5>  "Negative Explanations" of Doctrines Omitted </H5>   Chosonmal Taesajon also makes a lot of changes in its  explanations of religious doctrines as is the case with  religious phenomena. The older version explains theology as an  unscientific branch of learning that tries to rationalize  religious doctrines on the basis of an idealist outlook on the  world. But the new version simply explains that theology is "a  branch of learning for studying the religious doctrines on  God," and in the definition of theological terminology, it omits  the old negative and biased explanations. For instance, in the  entry under "religious education" the older version defines it  as "a reactionary and unscientific education designed to  inspire religious doctrines in the heart of the people," but  the new version corrects that definition by simply saying that  it is "an education for teaching religious doctrines and  precepts."    On Buddhism the older version of the Korean language  dictionary presents a negative view that Buddhism preaches a  reactionary thought of slavish submission and the principle of  nonresistance. It criticizes Buddhism for trying to dull the  class consciousness and fighting spirit of the masses and  having a dire deleterious effect on the development of culture  and science. But the newly published Chosonmal Taesajon omits  all such negative explanations and criticisms and describes  Buddhism as one of the three major religions widespread in the  East while giving a detailed explanation of the origin,  development, and central thought of Buddhism.    Christianity has been seen in the most unfavorable light in  North Korean philosophy and history textbooks in the past. In  the older dictionaries it is pointed out that Christianity was  being used as a tool of imperialist aggression and was perusing  the U.S. policy of aggression in South Korea. But in Chosonmal  Taesajon such criticisms are omitted and instead it presents a  richer substance and more factual explanations about  Christianity than Korean dictionaries in South Korea.  <H5>  Abundant Religious Vocabulary </H5>   On Confucianism North Korea used to take a critical view of  it by lumping the feudal Confucian thinking and Confucianism  together as a thought or doctrine that was used as a tool for  maintaining the conservative and reactionary feudal ruling  structures, without distinguishing between the two. On the  contrary, Chosonmal Taesajon, omitting all negative expressions  regarding Confucianism, presents a conceptual definition of  Confucianism in these words: "Confucianism is a political and  ethical doctrine that has been maintained in China for many  many years." It also presents a detailed account of the  development process of Confucianism. The dictionary simply says  that Confucianism has had an immense influence upon our country  in various aspects of our social life since it was brought in,  without passing any judgment on this influence.    Chosonmal Taesajon has an additional vocabulary of 200,000  words in excess of the 130,000 words entered in Hyondae  Chosonmal Sajon. Its religious vocabulary is correspondingly  larger and richer. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Religion Used as Window for Opening </H5>   Chosonmal Taesajon has new entries for the Tenriism of  Japan,  the Hinduism and Brahmanism of India, and the Taoism of China,  and presents factual descriptions of them. It also describes  Allah, the Korean, and Islam accurately and in detail in a  factual way.    All this is clear proof that unlike its older version,  Chosonmal Taesajon tries to explain all religions, religious  doctrines, and scriptures without omitting any and that its  compilers tried hard to faithfully present an objective  description of religious phenomena by doing away with the  previous negative attitude toward religion itself. [passage  omitted]    On the occasion of publishing Chosonmal Taesajon, North  Korea  showed an epoch-making change by presenting a more positive  definition of the religious vocabulary and at the same time  amended its constitution clearly stipulating that it is  permissible to hold religious rituals and set up facilities of  worship. These changes happened in April 1992. However, since  then no signs have been found yet which show that North Korea's  religious policy has undergone a corresponding revision to back  up these changes. The reason is that in North Korea religion is  not reviving in the form of reinstatement of the self-generating  religious substructures, but still remains at the level of  being used by North Korea as a window through which it may try  to give glimpses of its attempt at opening its economy to the  outside world after the Chinese model. Moreover, beginning in  the 1980's North Korea tried at a policy level to train the  priesthood that would revive the desiccated religions. Even if  religion is to revive in North Korea, this process will hardly  elevate religion beyond the limit of being a state religion  that depends on the priesthood trained under a state policy.  That is why North Korea may well be concentrating more on  sprucing up its religious appearances by retouching the  religious vocabulary and enacting laws and regulations related  to religion with a view to shutting off outside influence as  much as possible and thereby demonstrating its independent  capabilities.</p>

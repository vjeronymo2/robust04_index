			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment in a series of articles by Huang </F> Wenfang, a former offcial with XINHUA News Agency's Hong Kong  Branch who retired from XINHUA in 1992 and now lives in Hong  Kong]    [Text] It is a news agency--or that is its title. But  within the Hong Kong headquarters of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY  (XINHUA), the news department is known as the "mini branch".  Housed in a tiny section on Sharp Street West, it is the only  area from which XINHUA actually handles news and wire services.  The other 16 departments and offices on Queen's Road East are  for more pertinent use. The territory's branch of XINHUA is  composed of 22 sections: 12 departments, four offices, three  district offices and three offices on the mainland. Strictly  speaking, the three district offices are not part of the Hong  Kong Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, but in Queen's  Road East, the committee controls not only XINHUA, but other  units in Hong Kong.    We sum up the structure as "four major lines". The first  line is the banking system, meaning the financial committee,  with the Bank of China as its centre; second is the trade  committee, with China Resources as its pulse; third is the  transport committee, built around China Merchants, and fourth is  a committee handling overseas Chinese affairs.    Originally, the heads of these four lines were members of  the  Hong Kong committee, but this was scrapped in the mid-1980s.  With the reform many mainland organisations began sending  people to Hong Kong.    Economic units all come under the control of XINHUA,  although  they no longer take part in the work of the Hong Kong committee.  They are also controlled by their Beijing bosses, giving rise to  the phrase "two kinds of leaders". This means their day-to-day  business comes under the control of Beijing, and XINHUA, for the  most part, does not interfere. But anything relating to Hong  Kong decisions, policies or the deployment of cadres is handled  by XINHUA.    XINHUA has always been controlled by the Central Committee  of  the Chinese Communist Party, but the specific responsibility of  each central committee member has changed from time to time.  From the 1950s onwards, the central committee had a Hong Kong  and Macao leading group with Zhou Enlai as head. Chen Yi was  the first deputy head and Liao Chengzhi the second deputy.    XINHUA came under the leadership of this group. Among what  we called "Zhou-Chen-Liao", it was Liao who had the most  full-time and specific tasks. He often sought instructions from  Zhou, and, on matters of importance, would ask Mao Zedong. Zhou  was directly in charge of Hong Kong work right up to his death  in 1976. Chen also died during the Cultural Revolution. After  the revolution, new appointments were made. Geng Biao became  the new head, with Chen Muhua and Liao Chengzhi as deputies.    In fact, the leading group never functioned after this. The  moment appointments were announced, Geng and Chen said they  could not handle the job because they were not familiar with  Hong Kong. This meant Liao continued to handle Hong Kong by  himself. So this new leading group was dead as soon as it was  born. It never held a single meeting. From the time the party  central office decided to take back sovereignty over Hong Kong  in mid-December, 1981, to the time a draft policy plan was  completed in the first half of 1982, neither Geng nor Chen took  part in any stage of the process.    At the time, Geng was a politburo member and Minister of  Defence, and Chen an alternate member of the politburo and  Minister of Foreign Trade. Liao was a central committee member,  as well as heading the newly established Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office of the State Council.    It was not until the end of 1981 that then party general  secretary, Hu Yaobang, clearly stated: "The party central  committee has entrusted Liao Chengzhi to handle the three piles"  -- that is, work regarding Hong Kong and Macao, Taiwan, and  overseas Chinese. After Liao died in 1983, the central committee  entrusted three people to handle these jobs: Ji Pengfei on Hong  Kong and Macao work, Yang Shangkun on Taiwan and Wu Xueqian on  the overseas Chinese department. Thus, both Liao and Ji had  held two posts at once. They did not do Hong Kong work as the  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, but rather  as the leader entrusted with this work by the central committee.    The present director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, Lu Ping, has never been entrusted by the central  committee to handle Hong Kong work. Since the retirement of Ji,  that job has been handled by the General Secretary, Jiang Zemin,  and Premier, Li Peng. The Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, as a  politburo member, handles foreign affairs, Hong Kong and Macao,  and Taiwan. As the assistant of Jiang and Li, Qian helps with  Hong Kong.    So Jiang and Li are the highest power holders in respect to  Hong Kong. Right now, matters of great importance concerning  Hong Kong are first reported to Qian, then Jiang and Li are  asked for advice.    Jiang and Li divide Hong Kong work between them: Li handles  most jobs concerning government departments, while Jiang handles  party affairs and decisions concerning the overall situation.  It can be said that Jiang handles more than Li.    The so-called "three horse carriage", often referred to by  the Hong Kong media, translates as XINHUA, the State Council's  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and the Hong Kong and Macao  desk of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This view is incorrect.    The Hong Kong and Macao desk of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs exists only at ministerial-level, equivalent to one  level below a single department in XINHUA. So, XINHUA and the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office are of equal status, both at  ministerial level. Neither has leadership over the other.  XINHUA is a top level overseas post of the Chinese Communist  Party, while the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office is an office  of the State Council for handling Hong Kong and Macao work.    In most cases, when there is an important decision to be  made  about Hong Kong policy, XINHUA and the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office meet. If the subject concerns Sino-British  relations, someone from the Foreign Ministry will join the  meeting. If it concerns economic matters, people from the  relevant economic departments will be there.    So the best way to characterise leadership over Hong Kong  work is that it is handled by Jiang, Li and Qian.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, March 9 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang  Province will this year place great emphasis on the work of  establishing a modern enterprise system as well as transforming  the function of government to further the reform of the economic  structure.    In addition, the province will make efforts to speed up the  creation of a market system and improve the social insurance  system as two necessary measures in support of the  implementation of the major reform program.    The outline of reforms was announced recently at the second  session of the eighth provincial people's congress.    Differentiating it from past years, the provincial  government  has formulated a series of laws and regulations -- instead just  issuing political appeals -- to safeguard and boost the  implementation of the new economic structure, said Lu Wenge,  chairman of the provincial Commission for Restructuring the  Economy.    As one of the economically developed provinces, Zhejiang is  currently taking a lead in developing the market economy and  improving the social insurance system in China.    The province has chosen the corporation system as well as  group management as the breakthrough to be made this year in  reforming the property rights system of most of its large and  medium-sized enterprises, sources from the congress said.    More than 1,000 state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises will introduce the corporation system in 1994, the  sources said.    The state and collectively-owned small enterprises will be  at  the same time revitalized by means of auctions, mergers and  leasing.    According to officials from the provincial government, local  governments at all levels will this year totally withdraw their  control over management of enterprises and the allocation of  resources and will even transfer part of the supervision  function to some social intermediary organizations.    The province has also planned to introduce the market system  in such fields as investment, finance and foreign currency.    It will change all of the existing specialized and  cooperative banks into commercial banks in the near future.  Meanwhile, national banks and foreign-funded banks are welcome  to set up branches in the province, officials of the provincial  government said.    While expanding the current commodity markets, the province  will also develop the markets of labor, property rights,  technology, finance and information, in a bid to create good  conditions for the reform of the enterprise system.    The province now has more than 4,000 commodity markets,  whose  total transactions were worth some 65.1 billion yuan in 1993.    According to sources from the people's congress, the  province  will further develop its insurance services for pensions and  unemployment.    As well as covering employees of the state and  collectively-run enterprises and joint ventures, the sources  said, the unemployment insurance system would be extended this  year to employees of all the township enterprises all over the  province.    An integrated pension insurance system will be introduced in  more than half of the cities and regions in the province, the  sources said.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BALLET SERIES HELPS CENTER'S PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> The Orange County Center for the Performing Arts finished 1988 nearly $500,000  ahead of budget projections, fueled by one of "the most successful ballet  series in the country" and an increase in single ticket sales, according to  Center President Thomas R. Kendrick.  </P> <P> Response to the ballet series proved not only that Orange County audiences "are  great admirers of ballet" but that this is "a far more cosmopolitan region than  is sometimes ascribed," said Henry T. Segerstrom, chairman of the Center board  of trustees.  </P> <P> After the regular quarterly meeting of the Center's board, Kendrick and  Segerstrom discussed the results of the Center's preliminary 1988 financial  report. An operating loss of $4.8 million had been projected, but the loss was  only $3.2 million, putting it $1.6 million ahead of projections, Segerstrom  said. In 1987, he added, the Center's operating loss was $900,000 less than had  been expected.  </P> <P> However, 1988 projections for revenue from organizations and individuals  supporting the Center, which had been budgeted at $2.5 million, fell short by  $1.1 million. Kendrick said this shortfall resulted partially from the  diversion of $150,000 from one support organization to the Center's endowment  fund. Also, a grant from the Steele Foundation, up to $750,000 to support the  New York City Opera in 1988, was awarded after Dec. 31.  </P> <P> The difference between the $1.6 million resulting from an operating loss that  was less than projected and the $1.1 million shortfall in support -- just under  $500,000 -- will be transferred to the Center's endowment fund, Segerstrom  said.  </P> <P> "We always start from the premise of a balanced budget," Kendrick said,  repeatedly characterizing last year's results as "extraordinary." Practically,  he said, "we can't expect that to continue."  </P> <P> Kendrick said the ballet season of "6 solid weeks" and "five outstanding  companies" drew a paid audience of 85.4% of the Center's capacity, well above  the national average, enabling the Center to "break even" on the 44  performances.  </P> <P> Kendrick announced that paid attendence for programming presented by the Center  rose from 83.1% in 1987 to 85.4% in 1988. The number of Center-sponsored  performances went from 88 to 122, Kendrick said, producing a jump in attendance  from 232,771 to 324,705.  </P> <P> When included with performances sponsored by regional groups that use the  Center, however, the percentage of overall paid attendance at the Center dipped  slightly, from 79.1% in 1987 to 78% in 1988. Kendrick said he was "very  pleased" that the drop was as small as it was.  </P></p>

A source close to the talks said that Romanian Foreign  Minister Teodor Viorel Melescanu had raised the issue of  cooperation between the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)  which grouped Iran and nine neighbours, and the Organization of  the Black Sea Littoral States.    The two decided the issue should be followed up by the  secretariats of the two organizations, the source added.    Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and his  Romanian  counterpart inked two political and trade agreements as well as  a plan on the scientific, educational, cultural and art  exchanges at the end of the meeting.    Talking to reporters after the meeting, Velayati said the  agreements reached by the two countries showed that the two were  keen to further expand their ties.    Asked about the attempted assassination against President  Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani last Tuesday, Velayati condemned  terrorism, and expressed pleasure that the terrorist act had  failed.    He also said that Islamic Iran would spare no efforts in the  way of the establishment of a just and honorable peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

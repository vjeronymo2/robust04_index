			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Fashion: Madly modern among tapestries and marble - Me and My Wardrobe / One woman's sartorial schizophrenia If I buy so much as one more handkerchief, I'll have to move house]' says Jill Ritblat, wife of John Ritblat, chairman of property company British Land. And so last month she gave her wardrobe to The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. More than 100 outfits spanning three decades - Ungaro, Courreges, Mary Quant, Saint Laurent, Comme des Garcons - are destined for the museum's storerooms in what is the biggest single donation since it acquired the Cecil Beaton collection. She originally offered the V &amp; A just a few of what she thought were her most interesting clothes, but to her amazement they wanted everything, even hairpins and fluorescent socks. 'I had no idea,' she says, 'that what I owned amounted to 'a collection'.' So what does a woman wear when she has gone in for such a dramatic overhaul? 'I don't like to play the fashion game,' she declares dressed in pared down Shirin Guild, while she unfolds her high-tech Issey Miyake pleats to admire 'the perfection of technique and technology'. Her second husband, whom she married in 1986, is a traditionalist who 'doesn't like the avant garde in style or fashion'. He prefers his wife with her hair back off her face and dressed in proper yet cute, mid-calf length or short Valentino suits, high-heeled shoes and skin-toned fine stockings. But his wife, a devotee of modern art, has different ideas: 'I like the shock of the new. My husband sees me in a completely different way to how I see myself . . . I don't like my face enough to shove all my hair back and what makes me most uncomfortable is to be over-dressed. I prefer to err on the side of being less dressed-up than I should be.' Her solution is sartorial schizophrenia. Two wardrobes, one to please him and one to please her. Ritblat's skill is in reducing her wardrobe to the bare minimum, or 'systems' as she describes it. 'Both my husbands have wanted me to dress in a certain way. In 1966, aged 23, I married Elie Zilkha and wore a Dior wedding dress and a Dior haute couture going-away outfit.' The honeymoon was in St Tropez. 'I woke up the next day and put on a pair of white jeans and a fisherman's sweater, which I thought was very suitable and trendy but he took one look and said it wouldn't do. I was taken to Mic Mac, Gunther Sachs' boutique, and put in black crepe palazzo trousers and a yellow voile shirt. Obviously you can't resent anyone making you do anything as delectable as buying better clothes,' she says unconvincingly, 'but I had to go along with it. It made him happy.' She got the message. 'I had to shape up but I decided to do it in my own way.' Her way was avant-garde - whether in sharp-edged Courreges, huge felt cones by Zandra Rhodes or multi-patterned layers by Tuffin &amp; Foale worn under a dramatic St Laurent highwayman's cape. There was often 'a most hostile silence when I walked into a dinner party full of ladylike wives in Geneva. I never imagined something so completely wonderful could provoke such a reaction.' But looks are not everything - Ritblat always has an eye for the dry cleaning bills. 'On the first day of a trip to the US, a waiter spilt raspberry coulis down my Miyake top. I put the sleeves in the sink and the sauce just floated away. I was amazed, I didn't even have to use soap. That's good design.' By day (or night, if she is alone) you will find her in dramatic sculptural shapes, in innovative materials such as her shiny, tar-black Issey Miyake with a ridged back 'that looks like a dinosaur', opaque tights and flat Philippe Model elasticated shoes, with a massive Hermes bag. She puts her love of systems down to the fact that at heart she is happiest in a uniform, a look that is well suited to her petite frame. 'When I was young, my mother was always putting me in the latest fashions - candy stripe cottons with frills - which I thought were revolting. I much preferred tomboy to doll. 'That's why I was so happy in my school uniform and later, when I trained for the bar, in my black suits and white shirts. One of my favourite pieces was a black Mao jacket that I bought off the back of a waiter in Los Angeles. It was my ideal garment - practical, well-designed and easy.' Ritblat felt most at ease with her look during the seven years when she was officially without a man and enrolled at London University to read history of art. She felt no compulsion to wear sexy clothes to try to hook another man. During those years she dressed in Margaret Howell jumpers and fun clothes from Kenzo. Marriage to John required a change. 'In order to please him I wear Valentino and Ungaro in the evening. To me, Ungaro is bimbo dressing, although some of the fabrics are quite beautiful. For 'thinking crumpet' one's better in Comme des Garcons or Miyake, Romeo Gigli's shirts or my new find, easy like a school uniform, Shirin Guild. 'And I used to love Victor Edelstein, who came somewhere between bimbo and thinking crumpet. I respected him enormously.' If she were 18 again what would she wear, I wondered. 'Oh, I haven't looked at an 18-year-old for at least a week,' she retorts, registering her impression that fashion moves that fast now. 'I suppose I'd cut my hair very short and wear those wonderful clumpy shoes and a pelmet (short skirt) . . . and I suppose leather. But I hate to see young people in expensive clothes - they don't need to waste the money.' And her definition of real chic? 'When you're not sure whether it goes together or not, that element of surprise.' Ritblat's sense of modernity is played out in her public role as contemporary art benefactor. She is on the board of the New Contemporaries and is currently curating a show in Switzerland with Damien Hirst, the controversial conceptual artist. At gallery openings she dresses for the part in avant garde conversation-stoppers almost invariably in urban black, or in a well-thought-out statement, such as a 1969 Ungaro pop art dress for the Pop Art opening at the Royal Academy, three years ago. It is strange talking to madly modern and minimalist Ritblat, sitting in her husband's tapestried, ormolued and marbled drawing-room. The conflicting styles seem to jar. But as I leave she shows me her favourite room, the kitchen. It is a temple of machine-age modernism. Clean, sharp lines speak of time-saving, efficiency. That's better - a room that suits the psyche.</p>

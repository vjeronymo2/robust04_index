			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Secretary  of Agriculture Carlos Hank Gonzalez and the Cuban and Japanese  ambassadors here have discussed several joint scientific and  technological exchange projects in the field of agriculture.    During an interview with Cuban Ambassador Abelardo Curbelo,  the Mexican official expressed Mexico's willingness to establish  and expand technical and scientific relations throughout the  continent. As an example of this, he highlighted Mexico's  contribution of technological methods used in the production of  corn, wheat, tubers, and vegetables, among other types of crops,  which are not in use in several other countries.    Curbelo said the Cuban Government was pleased with the  progress achieved in its trade activities with Mexico. He  proposed extending this exchange to include genetic studies for  improving basic grain seeds and vegetable oil crops, as well as  several species of cattle. He also stressed the Cuban farmers'  interest in learning about new methods of controlling  agricultural pests and disease, currently in use in Mexico. The  Cuban official offered to transfer sugar cane farming and  production technology developed by his country to Mexico in  exchange.    Hank Gonzalez also spoke with Japanese Ambassador Mitsuro  Donokawi. They discussed the new conditions of the world market  and the need to increase bilateral relations to ensure a fair  and balanced commercial system. They also examined the  cooperation programs currently being channeled through the  Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The JICA is  in charge of administrating the Japanese Government's resources  and the development areas it supports in its beneficiary nations.    Furthermore, they evaluated three projects that are already  under way. The first of these projects is a five-year  agricultural development program for the mining communities in  the dry desert regions of Guerrero Negro, Baja California. The  second project is called Basic Silkworm Breeding Technology,  which deals with silkworm breeding and collection techniques.  This knowledge is currently applied in several states across  the country and will receive $950,000 over five years. The  third of these beneficiary programs is the production technology  improvement plan for small-scale rice growers. This plan is now  being applied in Morelos State.    The officials exchanged points of view on another nine  projects currently under evaluation for future implementation.  An agricultural modernization plan, a reconversion study for  Tapachula, an agricultural equipment and machinery test and  evaluation center, and residual waters recycling and usage  techniques for more efficient irrigation are some of the more  significant topics being discussed.</p>

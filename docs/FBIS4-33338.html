			<p>BFN     [Text] Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines  warned yesterday that foreign interests want to meddle in the  country's internal affairs, and demanded that solutions to the  many national problems must come from the Bolivian people.    He said it would be dangerous if anarchy descended on the  country, as this would go against the country's need for  development. Gen. Sanjines also reiterated his support for the  state of law.    He added: "From the prudent viewpoint of not discussing  political issues and putting ourselves within a realistic  framework, we believe that the solution to our problems should  be entrusted to capable Bolivian statesmen, as accepting foreign  influence would lead to greater complications."    These comments were made during the 165th anniversary of the  Armed Forces General Staff, a celebration headed by President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, commander in chief of the Armed  Forces.    Gen. Sanjines recalled that since the birth of Bolivia as an  independent republic, threats of the division of society and  interference by foreign interests have caused irreparable damage  throughout its history.    He said that this concern has allowed the armed institutions  to become the country's moral reserve and national identity in  the face of possible threats to the legally established  government, and to become the indissoluble part of the dearest  aspirations of the Bolivian people for progress and development.    Sanjines said: "We have improved our criteria in these 12  years for preserving legality, our sole concern being to  diminish dependency. And this is an objective mainly based on  political stability, which is the basis for economic potential  and social justice, which in turn are the result of productivity  and efficiency."    He also demanded the careful reorganization of the Armed  Forces on the basis of the country's real requirements, and not  on the basis of personal or subordinated criteria.    He also called for: "The conciliation of human and material  requirements that would ensure the better fulfillment of our  mission of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity."    He also called for understanding among the different social  sectors to overcome the problems of the country through dialogue  and agreement.    He also rejected what he called "the latent threat of  anarchy  and its terrible outcome of instability, which could scare away  investments and slow the enthusiasm for new efforts to make  economic growth possible, which is the basis for creating more  jobs."</p>

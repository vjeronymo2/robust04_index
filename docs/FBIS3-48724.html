			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The feature film  "Sisters" is showing before full houses in Korea.    The film is about sisters who volunteer to be shoe menders  following their father and devote their youth to the worthy work  in the spirit of selfless service for the people. The film  shows an aspect of Korean society where all occupations are  equally honorable.    The leading characters of the film are modeled on Choe  Kum-hwa and her younger sisters who work at the Welfare Service  Cooperative in Kwangbok Street, Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang,  enjoying respect from all people. When they finished the course  of senior middle school with great ambitions, they were  recommended for university entrance examinations, but they  volunteered for the job of shoe mending in order to become true  servants of the people.    In the DPRK, there are many persons who work with pure  conscience, paying no heed to the rank of job.    At the Pyongchon District City Management Office in  Pyongyang, Choe Chang-ae and 20 other girls work as road  cleaners. Graduating from senior middle school seven years ago,  they volunteered for this job. They have since cleaned roads of  the capital city, drawing affectionate attention of the  passers-by.    The family of Choe Tae-hwa of the Sinuiju Heating Station is  called a family of town management workers. There are many  people who sincerely work for society and the people for scores  of years, not changing their posts, for example, Choe Kyong-hwa  of the Kanggye Railway Corps and his two sons; Yi Son-ku, a  heated floor repairer of the Kyongsong County building repair  station in North Hamgyong Province; Cho Chung-un, a heat service  worker of the farm attached to the university of the national  economy; and Yang Pun-yo, a barber of the Pyongchon Welfare  Service Office in Pyongyang. Their patriotic devotion is based  on the deep loving care and favours shown by the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, who always puts the interests of the  people above all in shaping policies.    Comrade Kim Chong-il takes care that such persons  participate  in national conferences and state functions, and shows deep  trust and loving care for them, saying that those who devotedly  work on different jobs of society as faithful servants of the  people contribute to the fuller display of beautiful relations  among people across the country.    Amid his trust and loving care, a road cleaning girl becomes  a winner of "Kim Il-song Youth Honour Prize," the highest honour  to a Korean youth, and ordinary workers enjoy affection and  respect from all people as merited mender, merited barber and  merited hairdresser.</p>

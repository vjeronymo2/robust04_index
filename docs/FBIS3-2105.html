A local official said the tree belt, 97 km in length and 500  m in width, will cover parks, recreational and sports  facilities, thus offering more green land for people to enjoy  themselves.    The tree belt has been listed as one of the key projects to  be undertaken by the municipal government this year.    The whole project will be completed early in the next  century.    According to the plan, this populous city is striving to  cover at least 15 percent of its space with green this year,  averaging 1.4 sq m per capita.</p>

Legislators with the United Democrats of Hong  Kong (UDHK) revealed yesterday that bugging devices had been  detected during counter-surveillance sweeps of the party's  offices. UDHK elected member for Kowloon West, James To, told  the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD that bugs had been found in the  party's Kowloon head quarters and in the office of a UDHK  legislator.    "When we set up our Kowloon office (on Nathan Road) near  Prince Edward, we had a person go around with a field meter to  try and detect any devices," he said. "The result was positive.  That means there was a bug in the office. But we didn't hire  anybody to remove the bug at that time since we had no secrets.  When we tried the experiment on (legislator) Lau Chin-shek's  office (in Tsim Sha Tsui), the pointer on the meter moved even  more vigorously. That meant there were several devices in the  room."    Mr Lau is director of the Christian Industrial Committee, an  organisation that has been active in the pro-democracy movement  since the 1970s. A mainlander by birth, he has close ties with  leading Chinese dissidents, including trade union leader Han  Dongfang, who was last year refused permission to reenter China.  Mr Lau said yesterday that he believed he had been followed  both in Hong Kong and in China.    During the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD's investigation into  political bugging in Hong Kong, it was revealed that a bug had  also been removed from a UDHK legislator's office in May last  year. The latest development in political espionage in the  territory follows last week's revelations that Australian spies  had been hired by the British intelligence service MI6 to spy on  Chinese political and commercial activities in Hong Kong. UDHK  chairman Martin Lee admitted that security was a problem for the  party. "At some stage last year we had a discussion because we  were worried about security," he said. "I don't remember the  details or what happened exactly."    Liberal Party legislator Selina Chow said her party did not  take any special precautions beyond basic security measures.  "It is difficult for us as a political organisation to be  entirely full proof [as published]," she said. "We are  conscious of possible problems but nothing has surfaced yet."    A recent investigation by the HONGKONG STANDARD revealed  that  espionage was becoming a serious problem for business and  industry in Hong Kong. Listening devices have been found placed  under desks, in telephones, light sockets, electrical plugs and  in walls. Frank Knight, chairman of Asian Security and  Investigation Services, said: "Certain organisations have the  most superior equipment." He said such devices could pick up  sounds 100 metres away. The signals could then be transmitted  to a receiver outside the building. He said the point of a  listening device placed in a wall need be no bigger than a pin  head. Private investigation companies charge anything between  $3,000 and $14,000 for counter-surveillance undertakings.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Iraq vows defiance as US stance hardens: Clinton says election will not deflect American stand against Saddam THE CONFRONTATION between Iraq and the United Nations hardened yesterday as a senior Iraqi minister vowed continuing defiance and as President George Bush called in his national security advisers for talks on the crisis. After the White House meeting of military chiefs, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said: 'All options remain open.' At the same time, Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the US presidency, said he would support US use of force against Iraq if the UN deemed it necessary. He warned Iraq's President Saddam Hussein that his election battle against Mr Bush would not deflect Washington from making Iraq comply with the terms of Gulf war ceasefire last year. 'Let Saddam Hussein make no mistake. Even during an election campaign, Americans are united on this issue. Saddam Hussein should understand clearly that we will not tolerate his defiance of UN resolutions,' Mr Clinton said in a statement. US officials suspect the Iraqi president's defiance rests partly on a belief that the US would not launch military action against Iraq in the middle of a divisive election campaign. Mr Clinton's assurance will be welcomed by President Bush if it demonstrates to Mr Saddam that there is bipartisan support in the US for the administration's firm stance. The US Defence Department confirmed yesterday that it had cancelled port visits in the Mediterranean for the aircraft carrier Saratoga and three other warships, apparently strengthening the administration's threat to use force. But Mr Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said the decision was 'based on the situation in Yugoslavia'. Officials in Washington would not be drawn on whether the vessels - now said to be in the central Mediterranean - had been alerted for possible action. The White House warned on Wednesday that it could not rule out the use of force if Baghdad continued to defy a team of UN weapons inspectors seeking to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission charged with the task, warned in a US television interview yesterday that the confrontation could swiftly reach 'endgame', voicing growing fears for the safety of his 70-strong inspection team in Iraq. The allies appear to be pursuing a carefully calibrated increase of military and political pressure with echoes of the allied build-up before the Gulf war of January 1991 - and eliciting a familiar Iraqi response. In Baghdad yesterday, Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, told a news conference: 'Iraq will not concede its sovereignty, will not accept any insult, will not allow the inspection teams to threaten its national security and will not allow . . . any other person affiliated with the UN to interfere in its internal affairs. The threats and all what they are doing will not change the Iraqi position.' None of the western allies appears in a hurry to implement threats. Top officials at the Defence Department in Washington are known to harbour doubts about the likely effectiveness of a limited military strike. Nor do Bush campaign officials appear convinced that military action against Iraq offers good chances of success. Mr Bush's military advisers are reported to have warned that they can offer no prospect of ousting President Saddam from power without full deployment of a larger force than that used during Operation Desert Storm last year. They are also perplexed by the difficulty of finding targets for a limited air strike that would do enough to change Mr Saddam's behaviour, while not wreaking undue suffering on the civilian population. Campaign officials fear a raid that leaves Mr Saddam unshaken would further erode the political credit that Mr Bush originally won during Desert Storm. To complicate matters further, the US is having trouble reconciling disagreements between its allies on whether any military strike should be massive or limited in scale. Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, voiced caution yesterday, saying he thought Iraq would probably bow to pressure in the end. 'Above all, we have to see how Iraq reacts,' he said. 'It is not the first time in this period of two years that Saddam Hussein has rebelled against UN work on the spot. We have had difficult times. Last year, in the same circumstances, the Baghdad authorities refused access to some places to UN experts . . . and finally Iraq gave way.'</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / XJ range leads Jaguar's drive to profit Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, is expected to return to profit in the last quarter of this year for the first time since 1989. The company has been in loss since it was taken over by Ford of the US, the world's second biggest vehicle maker, for Pounds 1.56bn in late 1989 and has run up total pre-tax losses of Pounds 776m from 1989 to 1993. Jaguar sharply reduced its loss in the third quarter this year to Dollars 53m from Dollars 108m for the same period last year. Its loss in the first nine months this year fell to Dollars 155m from Dollars 226m in the corresponding period of last year. The company's fortunes were boosted in the last quarter by the autumn launch of its XJ range of luxury saloons, which led to an increase in its wholesale deliveries to dealers worldwide. Jaguar registrations in the UK in November rose 41 per cent year-on-year to 553. Ford is expected to start negotiations with the UK government in January over state aid for its project to build a range of smaller Jaguar sports saloons to compete with cars like the BMW 5 series. Code-named X200, this car is due for launch in 1998. It would be an addition rather than a replacement to the range, and would more than double Jaguar output to more than 100,000 a year by 1998/99. The car is being designed as a derivative of a Ford world car programme under development in the US which is expected to be submitted for approval by the Ford board in March or April next year. No decision has been made on a production location, but it is expected that the car will be built either at Jaguar's existing locations in Coventry and Birmingham or at one of Ford's US plants in Michigan. The Ford application for UK selective regional assistance will be based on an analysis of the cost benefits of production in the US versus the UK. The aid sought could total between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m. In March the government agreed to pay Pounds 9.4m in grant aid to Jaguar to deter Ford from moving the assembly of the next generation Jaguar XJS from the UK to Portugal.</p>

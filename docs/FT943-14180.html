			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Further slide in trading revenues at JP Morgan The upheaval in world financial markets touched off by a series of US interest rate increases in recent months led to a further fall in trading revenues at JP Morgan, the US bank, in the second quarter of the year. The bank's earnings from trading dropped to Dollars 228m in the three months to June, less than half the average quarterly income of Dollars 514m seen in 1993, a record year. The bank said it had not suffered any significant losses in particular markets, but had seen 'modest positioning losses' in some fixed income, foreign exchange and swaps markets. The lower income levels also reflected a decision to reduce its exposure at a time of market turmoil, the bank added. The lower trading income, which compared with Dollars 520m in the same quarter of 1993, was the main factor behind a fall in non-interest revenues to Dollars 926m, from Dollars 1.1bn in the same period a year earlier. Net interest revenue rose by 27 per cent to Dollars 540m, due mainly to the receipt of Dollars 35m of past due interest on Brazilian bonds together with Dollars 50m of interest on income tax refunds. After-tax profits were bolstered, though, by a Dollars 225m gain from the previously announced sale of part of the bank's interest in Columbia/HCA, the US hospital group. As a result, JP Morgan was able to report net income of Dollars 350m, or Dollars 1.73 a share, compared with Dollars 431m, or Dollars 2.12 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The annualised return on equity slipped from 23.5 per cent to 14.8 per cent, as shareholders' funds grew further to Dollars 9.7bn, from Dollars 8bn a year before. Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman, said that trading with customers had remained at the high level of last year's second quarter, in spite of the fall-off in trading income. He pointed to advances in income from investment management and operational services, as well as gains from equity sales, as an indication of the bank's efforts to diversify its earnings. For the first six months of the year, net income was Dollars 695m, or Dollars 3.43 a share, down from Dollars 726m, or Dollars 3.59 a share, in the first half last year. In New York yesterday, JP Morgan's shares fell Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 61 on mild disappointment at the results.</p>

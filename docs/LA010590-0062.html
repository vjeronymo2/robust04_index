			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CONNECTICUT;  </P> <P> LEGIONNAIRE DISEASE CASES TIED TO SHELTER  </P> <P> City health officials began screening employees and hundreds of people served  by a homeless shelter and soup kitchen in Stamford, Conn., after two men who  used the facilities were hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease.  </P> <P> City Health Director Andrew McBride said it was not known exactly how many  people had stayed at the shelter or eaten at the soup kitchen in recent weeks.  The two, a 60-year-old man and a 20-year-old man, were hospitalized before  Christmas. Legionnaires' disease can be fatal if not treated. The health  director and Mayor Thom Serrani ordered the building that houses the city's  largest shelter and soup kitchen closed indefinitely for fear it was the source  of bacteria that caused the outbreak.  </P></p>

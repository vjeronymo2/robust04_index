			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS--ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI singles out a  draft document "On the Attainment of Civil Accord", handed over  by President Boris Yeltsin to the State Duma and Federation  Council speakers on Thursday.    In the opinion of presidential press secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov, "the principal goal of this agreement among political  forces" is to preserve the already existing elements of civil  peace in the country.    The newspaper quotes Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin  as stating that "immediate prospects for Russia's economic  development are moderately optimistic."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries a big article in view of  the expected signing by government leaders of CIS member-states  of an agreement on the mutual recognition of the privileges and  guarantees for world war two veterans and the disabled and  participants in combat operations on the territories of other  states, the families of the fallen servicemen and other  categories of persons. The agreement is expected to be signed  in mid-April.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that a number of gangs engaging  in criminal activities connected with the search of privatised  apartments and their resale have been uncovered in Moscow.    About 9,000 Muscovites, who have been reported missing,  could  fall victim to those gangs, the newspaper writes referring to  the data of Moscow police headquarters as of January 1, 1994.  All missing persons on the eve of their disappearance  registered documents certifying the privatisation of their  apartments.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (independent newspaper) reports a "boom  in the illegal production of gold and diamonds" in the country.    The newspaper quotes A. Alexeyev, a staff member of the  Russian Interior Ministry's main department for combatting  economic crimes, as saying that one can now speak about the  existence of a veritable industry in Russia for the illegal  production, processing and marketing of gold and diamonds.    Criminals "are busy actively establishing contacts with  state  machinery officials and foreign counterparts and arranging  channels for the 'export'" of Russian valuables", Alexeyev said.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports a statement by U.N.  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who began his five-day  visit to Moscow on Friday, that he is grateful to Boris Yeltsin  for the success of Russian diplomacy in settling the Yugoslav  crisis.    At the same time, the newspaper believes, there is no  "complete mutual understanding" between the sides, considering  the stand of the U.N. chief, who issued an order to launch  bombing strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, and the stand of  Moscow which, acting virtually alone, prevented that". Neither  is the U.N. secretary-general willing to understand Russia's  intention to get a U.N. mandate for its peacekeeping force on  the territory of the CIS, the newspaper pointed out.    PRAVDA gives prominence to a report on a new party, Russia's  Choice, which is being created by former Vice-Premier Yegor  Gaydar. The newspaper believes that this, in all probability,  will be the first party of big bourgeoisie, and predicts that  the new party will suffer a setback at future elections.</p>

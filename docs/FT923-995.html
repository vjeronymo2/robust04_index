			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Latin American banana nations in plea to Dunkel FIVE Latin American banana producers have asked Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, to intervene in their row with the EC over import curbs on bananas from the region. Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela want the EC to scrap its plan to raise import barriers to 'dollar' bananas as part of its single market programme. They claim the plan would cost them up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 292m) in export earnings and flout Gatt rules against discrimination between trading partners. They say it runs counter to proposed farm trade reforms in the Uruguay Round that would scrap all import quotas in favour of tariffs. The EC proposals, yet to be endorsed by ministers, would replace national curbs with a Community-wide quota on banana imports. Latin American bananas would also face a 20 per cent tariff, with costlier bananas from Lome Convention members entering duty-free. The Latin Americans are using a procedure urging the director-general to resolve a poor country's grievance against a rich one. He has two months to try to solve the row.</p>

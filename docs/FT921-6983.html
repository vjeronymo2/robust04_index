			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Forces to receive house cash subsidy THE GOVERNMENT is to subsidise a home savings scheme for armed forces personnel, David White writes. The scheme, designed to provide benefits similar to the tax relief homeowners receive on mortgage interest, was announced by Mr Tom King, defence secretary, in a package of housing and resettlement measures. Mr King said the measures went 'a long way' to overcoming the disadvantages faced by personnel because of having to move around. Service people who are not homeowners and who save between Pounds 50 and Pounds 200 a month for at least five years will be entitled to an extra Pounds 1 for every Pounds 3 of savings and interest in order to buy a house or flat at the end of the period. Those personnel being made redundant are to be allowed to keep their married quarters at market rent as long as the premises are not needed.</p>

Well-informed sources told  INTERFAX that the terrorist, who called himself Nikolay  Skvortsov, was seized.    He had kept two boys, ages 3 and 4, and their 28-year-old  nursery school teacher, Natalia Khitalenko, as hostages.    The terrorist, who had also captured a YAZ car with a  driver,  demanded on Thursday morning that $500,000 and a plane to go  abroad be given to him.    He went from Sukhodolsk to Rostov-on-Don together with the  hostages. Authorities there agreed to give him a Tu-134  aircraft.    Initially, he declared that negotiations would begin as soon  as he boarded the plane. He also demanded that he and the  hostages board the plane before the crew. Two crews had  volunteered to pilot the plane.    According to some sources, the terrorist intended to leave  for London. Other information says he was going to the U.S.A.</p>

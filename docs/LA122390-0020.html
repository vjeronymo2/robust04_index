			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR GUIDE: A DOUBLE DOSE OF GARTH BROOKS IS A REAL DEEE-LITE  </P> <P> Keeping up with what's fresh in pop music on a budget of $25 per month ($40 for  CD fans).  </P> <P> November  </P> <P> Garth Brooks' "Garth Brooks" (Capitol) -- Brooks, the hottest newcomer in  country music, is a good but not great singer -- and he's not able to always  come up with dazzling material. But see him live -- where he sells his best  songs with a genuineness that is hard to resist -- and you'll become a fan.  </P> <P> Garth Brooks' "No Fences" (Capitol) -- Brooks has enough good material for one  excellent album, but it's spread over two collections. After seeing him on  stage, where he expresses country's blue-collar dreams and frustrations as well  as anyone in a decade, you'll probably be willing to buy both albums so you can  listen to the best songs.  </P> <P> Deee-Lite's "World Clique" (Elektra) -- It's normally wise to avoid any group  that begins its album with a self-introduction, but this New York-based trio  overcomes the self-consciousness and delivers some of the year's most witty and  inviting dance-pop, including "Groove Is in the Heart." The B-52's of the '90s?  </P> <P> </P> <P> December  </P> <P> Black Box's "Dreamland" (RCA) -- The framework of this dance music from Italy  (dubbed "spaghetti house" by Q magazine), is conventional, but the beats are  infectious and the key vocals bring a sensual edge to the music that is  reminiscent of Gloria Gaynor's best disco-related work.  </P> <P> Gear Daddies' "Billy's Live Bait" (Polydor) -- Martin Zellar's songs touch on  the struggle between childhood ideals and adult responsibilities with an  insight and conviction reminiscent of Paul Westerberg and Bob Forrest, and it  is delivered with a lonesome rock intensity that keeps drawing you back. One of  the year's 10 best albums. See Page 71.  </P> <P> Lush's "Gala" (4AD/Reprise) -- Don't let the recent New Musical Express cover  story comparing this British group to ABBA fool you into thinking you'll find  another "Fernando" or "Dancing Queen" here. But "Gala" -- with its harsher  textures and tales of stained innocence -- offers deliciously appealing  art-pop.  </P></p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Despatches: The ghost town of Graham Greene IT IS still just a seven-minute walk from the Phastcleaners shop on Lamparilla Street, Havana, to the Wonder Bar at the corner of Virtudes and Consulado - the same time it took Jim Wormold to escape from his vacuum-cleaner agency for a mid-day daiquiri with his old friend, Dr Hasselbacher. Wormold, anti-hero of Graham Greene's Our Man In Havana, was impaired by a limp and, given the traffic that must have prevailed in late 1950s Havana, seven minutes must have been a close-run thing. Today there is little traffic to slow the curious visitor, but it is still a brisk walk, made all the more difficult because of the distraction of finding traces of Wormold's Havana 35 years after publication of Greene's novel. Such landmarks are not easy to find, given the Cuban capital's neglected state and the preponderance of tin sheets covering the windows and entrance-ways to the city's once-infamous nightspots. But there are some pleasant surprises, for a few beacons have survived to make the curious visitor, armed with a street map, ballpoint pen and Greene's Penguin paperback, feel he is getting somewhere. Greene's Havana centred on the shopping and banking thoroughfares of the old district, with a few amusing diversions into uptown Vedado, location of then-swank hotels, and into the classy neighbourhoods of Miramar. Our Man In Havana was oddly prophetic, hinting at great 'enemy' military installations in the interior against the background of an unstable government, that of Castro's then-nemisis, Fulgencio Batista. That some of the installations looked like giant vacuum-cleaner fittings, including snap-action couplings, was the amusing twist to the story. Trying to find any trace of Phastcleaners, or any shop selling conventional retail goods, is impossible today. Lamparilla Street, running east to the waterfront, is parallelled by Obrapia, Obispo and O'Reilly, a hive of activity in Wormold's day, but now a neighbourhood through which people walk but do not stop because there is little to stop for. The Western Union cable office is still on Obispo, whence Wormold sent his fraudulent cables to MI-6 in London. And the bells still toll at the Church of Santo Cristo, off Lamparilla, where Wormold's expensive daughter Milly said her prayers. Within a baseball throw of the famous Floridita bar, near the top of Obispo on the Avenida de Belgica, stand two bookshops, one dispensing socialist tracts, the other an array of old classics and leftovers. Ask for any Greene, Hemingway or - for that matter - Dickens or Cervantes and you will be greeted by melancholy headshaking. 'Much in demand, si, but no, not for long time. You come from Spain? England? Next time bring books. Paper shortage.' The conversation echoes one heard on a previous visit in 1985. One of Wormold's haunts on that daily trek for the mid-day daiquiri was the famous Sloppy Joes, better known as Loppy Youse in Cuban lingo. It was there that Wormold was recruited by Hawthorne, MI-6's inept Caribbean control. It was founded in the 1930s by two Spanish brothers, one named Jose, who became renowned for his unwashed off-white shirts. A rival Sloppy Joes was set up in Key West, Florida, 90 miles the other side of the Gulf Stream, a few years later. The original, alas, folded in the late 1960s due to the post-revolution collapse of tourism and is now sealed up. One can only draw on the memory of the meeting in Sloppy Joes in the Alec Guinness-Noel Coward film in which Coward (Hawthorne) recruits Guinness (Wormold) into the world of spying. Nearby, on a side street linking the tree-lined Paseo de Marti with Zulueta Street, stands the shell of the Seville Biltmore Hotel, Hawthorne's Havana haunt, now being slowly rebuilt. From nearby Virtudes Street, a visitor can see the towering wedge of the Havana Libre Hotel - in Greene's day the Hilton - now in need of paint and new plumbing but still drawing crowds, especially highly solicitous women seeking convertible currency. Just below it, in the Vedado district and overlooking the sea, stands the Hotel Nacional de Cuba, a twin-towered, immaculately restored relic of the 1930s. Its nearly pristine state is a welcome surprise of which Greene himself might have approved - only a few years ago it was a crumbling relic. In Jim Wormold's day, the Nacional was the home of the European Traders Association, which met there regularly for lunch. It was inside the Nacional that Wormold, tipped off by Hasselbacher in the foyer, warded off a clumsy assassination attempt in the form of poisoned whisky. Where the money came from to restore the 483-room Nacional, no one will say. It is rumoured that Cuban expatriate money from Florida has been pumped in. Greene returned to Cuba in 1963 and was disappointed to find that some of the seedier haunts on Zanja Street, an east-west throughfare linking old Havana with Vedado, had been boarded up, particularly the Shanghai Theatre. 'There, for Dollars 1.25, you could have seen a nude show and three blue films a night, and there was a pornographic bookshop in the foyer for those yet unsatisfied', he wrote at the time. These days, no one has even heard of the Shanghai. But one aspect of pre-Castro life has not changed - the famous floor show at the Tropicana, the open-air, jungle-motif night-club on the edge of the leafy Miramar district. It was at the Tropicana, amid the dazzle of dancing girls, that Wormold helped his daughter celebrate her birthday, at the same time protecting her from the unsubtle groping of the evil Captain Segura of the Havana police department with the help of his MI-6 cypher clerk, Beatrice Severn. All is as it was except for the gaming tables which were, in any event, out of sight from the main floor-show area. The round bar is still there, as is the original stage, set in a grotto. The floor show is probably the best anywhere in the western hemisphere, and regularly features some 65 barely post-adolescent dancers, clad in jewelled nether garments, and an Afro-Cuban band of 25 musicians. The pulsing performance (prices range from Dollars 40-Dollars 55 per head, and all seats are good) lasts 2 1/2 hours and only stops short of a human sacrifice. There are many Fay Wrays onstage; all that is missing is King Kong. It is the Tropicana's proud boast that it has been operating continuously since 1939. After the Tropicana I returned to town, to the corner of Virtudes and Consulado. An old woman sitting in a chair, knitting, remembered the Wonder Bar, or, rather, two bars answering the description, identical and on opposite corners, both sealed up. They were muy popular among the shopkeepers, she recalled. It was at the Wonder Bar that Our Man In Havana turned deadly serious, for it was there that Hasselbacher was killed by unknown foreign assailants. But one should not get too serious. Greene's novel, like modern-day Havana, is a work of fiction.</p>

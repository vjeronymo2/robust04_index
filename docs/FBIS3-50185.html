			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar by Peter </F> Toman in Bratislava on 21 January--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Toman] This week our country has been  extraordinarily rich in visits of representatives of important  international institutions. Experts from the Council of Europe,  Miguel Martinez, the chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of  the Council of Europe, as well as Max van der Stoel, of the High  Commission of the Conference for European Security and  Co-operation [CSCE], were especially interested in changes in  the territorial division of Slovakia as well as our reform of  state administration and self-administration. Did more  fundamental proposals come out of these meetings, Prime  Minister, by which the government would correct its existing  intentions in this area?    [Meciar] All three visits were important and each of them  was  different. The talks on territorial division, which were held at  an expert level, in effect examined different variants of the  proposals we had submitted and the objections that were  envisioned to be raised by Hungarian political parties in the  Council of Europe. I can say that the Slovak Government course  was solidly based, and we shall submit all legislative proposals  to the National Council by 30 June so that they can be approved.  The territory of Slovakia will be divided on the basis as  required by the administration of the given territory and not on  an ethnical principle.    The second visit, which was connected with the president of  the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Mr.  Martinez, was significant in that we discussed rather global  problems, global relations in Europe, and Slovakia came out very  well, even more than very well out of that assessment. If the  citizens could have heard what was said, this would have simply  confused our criticics and those people who are engaged in  propaganda against us, and they would have to creep back into  their corner. Moreover, those talks provided an impetus for  Slovakia to act in the pursuit of such relations in its own name  and become substantially more active than before so that its  voice could be heard substatially more loudly. It should cease  to be the Czech Republic's twin and come out with its own  independent proposals and initiative, which Europe needs. It  also needs ideas from us because they are important and our  perception of things, although different in some things, cannot  be said to be bad because of this.    The visit of the Commissioner van der Stoel in essense  reacted to the ongoing process of a two-year inspection both in  Hungary and Slovakia regarding the minorities issues. One  proposal that came out of it was that a consultative body should  be set up at which minorities issues would be continually  discussed. A proposal on collective rights, however, did not  come out of it. The talks did not touch on that subject.    Therefore, all three visits were special in their own way.  Each of them was positive in relation to Slovakia both in  content and importance. [passage omitted]    [Toman] Already deliberations of parliamentary committees  have shown that discussion about two amendment bills on big  privatization, the government one and the one put forward by a  group of deputies for the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL],  will be among the most interesting points on the agenda of a  January session of the Slovak parliament. [passage omitted]    [Meciar] There is a diametrical difference between the SDL  bill and the government bill. We do not intend to support the  SDL bill becuase it is based on unrealistic assumptions. Above  all, it is based on the assumption that there is strong capital  market and a lot of money here--and the opposite is true. The  National Bank of Slovakia does not intend to release those 20  billion [presumably Slovak korunas] spoken about in the context  of privatization in 1994.    Furthermore, the SDL bill does not take into account the  fact  that our territory is nationally mixed. Various nationalities  live here, and various economic interests exist here. There is  no longer any need to hide the fact that, according to the  figures on privatization as of 30 June 1993, in the nationally  mixed areas more than 50 percent of privatized assets were  acquired by the Hungarian capital--almost the entire retail  sphere, food industry, wholesale distribution. This is not good,  and it can have political hidden meaning, too. This is why it is  necessary to have also other entities present there.    If the system changes proposed by the SDL are carried out,  this would result in two undesirable facts. First, privatization  assets would be accumulated in hands of a narrow circle of  people. Second, the present reorganization would be destroyed  and we would need to begin anew. [passage omitted]    A compromise is possible because the SDL bill includes some  rational elements of a technical nature that are acceptable to  us. However, we got stuck in the last moment as the SDL demands  the split of privatization minister post from the post of  president of the Fund of National Property. [passage omitted]    [Toman] In this context, opposition officials like to list  your present posts, ranging from the chairman of the presidium  of the Fund of National Property to privatization minister and  to the post of prime minister of the government. Mr. Prime  Minister, is this accumulation of posts inevitable? Isn't an  appointment of privatization minister about to be announced?    [Meciar] [passage omitted] The problem is not that I am  currently holding the two posts. I am in fact putting things in  order there. In substance, as moral and political authority was  lacking to reveal the relations about the existence of which we  were aware, I have found time to do this tidying up. It is now  under way. [passage omitted]    As far as a new privatization minister is concerned, I have  known his name for a long time, and an agreement on him was  reached several months ago. So far I have not put forward his  nomination to the president only because the SDL bill proposes,  among other things, to abolish the Privatization Ministry. Once  this issue is clarified by a law adopted by the parliament, I  will immediately put forward my nomination for privatization  minister.    I have never personally accumulated power. I accumulate  responsibility, administrative duties, and I serve. It is  totally alien to me to perceive my post as the post providing me  with power. [passage omitted]    [Toman] A week ago, Interior Ministers Jan Ruml and Jozef  Tuchyna announced that their recommendation regarding open  questions concerning the Slovak-Czech border would be that the  hamlet of (Sidonia) in the village of Horne Srnie become part of  the Czech Republic and, on the other hand, the hamlet of U  Sabotu in the Moravian village of Javornik nad Velickou become  part of the Slovak village Vrbovce. [passage omitted]    [Meciar] As far as border changes are concerned, meetings of  ministers are only consultations. I do not think we will manage  to conclude the matter by the end of this year because the  problem is more complicated inasmuch as it involves also the  catchment area of the Morava river. [passage omitted]    A decision on this matter can be made only by the National  Council. I would like to confirm once again the pledge I made in  the past that not a single square centimeter of the Slovak  territory will be given away without being compensated for by a  square centimeter from the Czech side and without an agreement  of legislative bodies. The government will stick to this  principle, strictly respecting not only the local  self-administrative bodies but also other matters. [passage  omitted]</p>

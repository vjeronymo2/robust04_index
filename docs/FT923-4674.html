			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / You'll believe Superman can die IT WAS morning in America yesterday. But then, a heavy, dark and pendulous cloud of ominous breadth passed over the national horizon, and remained suspended over the imaginary city of Metropolis. There was solemn news, disclosed by the comic book division of Time Warner, of the imminent demise of Superman, that most winsome and able of super-heroes, he who once descended from the planet Krypton. Yes, Superman will die, in issue number 75 of the eponymous comic book, to be published on November 20, 1992. The man who was born with a few strokes of a pencil in 1938, and who has starred in countless books, magazines, movies and television, may be able to fly faster than a speeding bullet and leap tall buildings in a single bound. But he has found it impossible to resist the commercial dictates of a mighty publisher. In New York last night, Mr Paul Levitz, executive vice-president and publisher of Time Warner's DC Comics division, finally confirmed the rumours that had been swirling about the city all day. Although Superman has generated more than Dollars 1bn of consumer sales over the past decade, Mr Levitz said the story line would dictate death for the Man of Steel, come November. An aide to Mr Levitz explained the scenario: 'There will be a character called Doomsday, who is like this force of destruction who comes out of the ground and starts moving in a straight line toward Metropolis. Both Doomsday and Superman will die after a big battle in front of the headquarters of The Daily Planet. Clark Kent will also be missing. And Lois Lane, Superman's fiancee, will be traumatised.' Superman will die - but will he return? 'I think this is a nice attention-getting device,' said Mr Levitz. When pressed further, he would only say: 'Superman, as a multi-media property which is so valuable to Time Warner, is not going to disappear.' In Wisconsin, Mr Don Thomas of the Comic Buyers' Guide said he also expected Superman might well return - somewhere, somehow. 'It's a little difficult to determine what death means to someone from the planet Krypton,' Mr Thomas observed.</p>

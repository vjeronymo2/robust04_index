			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Euro - Buzzword The European elections with their 'Euro-candidates', 'Euro-sceptics' and 'Euro-enthusiasts' are the latest confirmation 'Euro-' has become the most highly charged of political terms. A decade ago it sent us to sleep. But its meaning depends on who is using it. In Australia it has a double life as the name for a kangaroo, according to Webster's dictionary. In Europe, the prefix is as old as the continent. 'Euro' comes from 'Europa' (Greek: Europe), the Phoenician princess abducted by the Greek god Zeus who appeared in the form of a white bull. The noun and adjective 'European' have spawned the inevitable 'Europeanise' and 'Europeanisation'. In 1949 George Orwell spun 'Eurasian' (combining Empire and India, meaning an Anglo-Saxon who spent a lifetime in India) into the power block 'Eurasia' for '1984'. Then in 1963, investment banks Hambros and Warburgs created 'Eurodollars' and 'Eurobonds'. Since then, with the UK's impending membership of the European Community in the 1960s and the money market expansion in the 1980s, 'Euro' has enjoyed two periods of popularity. During the 1960s when the pejorative 'Eurocrat' and 'Eurospeak' nodded towards Orwell's faceless state, the political foundations of the word, with an anti-European leaning, were laid. There was an inundation of consumer 'Eurobabble' in the 1970s as UK membership began to affect shoppers and suppliers, while economists warned of growing 'Eurosclerosis'. In the 1980s, 'Euro' arrived as shortspeak for Eurodollar Futures in Chicago and New York. And the mid-1980s saw 'Euros', meaning people from Europe, used by Americans as in: 'there are Euros on holiday . . . and 'Miami Vice' clones' (Newsday 1989); and by the British in 'why didn't we assert British Rule and make the Euros change to furlongs and chains . . .?' (The Listener 1986). America today uses 'Eurotrash' for Europeans in New York, dark of suit and thick of accent in Soho or the Village. In the UK, the word pulls in two directions. In British politics, 'Euro-' evokes its antithesis, not Asia- or America- but a feeling of Britishness. Politicians starting life as Members of the European Parliament became 'Euro-MPs', a Brussels copy of Westminster. But in business, 'Euro-' is a positive and unequivocal form: 'Euro-' spellsmultinational, culturally adjusted. 'Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Key British Enterprises' has 171 of the largest companies bearing the 'Euro-' prefix, like Eurobake, Eurohire, Eurotec and Eurotunnel. The greatest 'Euro-' remains the evergreen 'Eurovision Song Contest'. The patron saint of television, St Clair of Assisi, could not have wished for better 'Euroconvergence'.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Murray Industries Inc., maker of Chris-Craft pleasure boats, has been sold for  about $58 million to Outboard Marine Corp. of Waukegan, Ill. The sale came in a  spirited auction in the Tampa, Fla., courtroom of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Alexander Paskay, who has been overseeing Chris-Craft since Dec. 9, when it  filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy  code. Murray, based in Bradenton, Fla., had been virtually paralyzed since the  filing, which listed $70 million in debts and less than $60 million in assets.  </P></p>

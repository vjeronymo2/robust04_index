			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Management: In the cockpit of change - The affirmative action policy at South African Airways Any air hostess, anywhere in the world, would have had trouble dealing with these two young men: they had been drinking, they were angry at a delay in take-off, they wanted to smoke (on a no-smoking flight) and drink (before the aircraft left the tarmac, against airline policy). But for a young black stewardess wearing the uniform of South African Airways, flagship of apartheid and international symbol of Pretoria's misrule, it was doubly difficult to tell these two slightly drunk Afrikaner bucks that they could not have what they wanted. She did it with tact and charm, giving them crisps to appease their nicotine craving and a pretty smile to ease the pain. In the end, they were won over - and SAA's policy of affirmative action had two new converts. There are few more obvious signs of the impending change of government in South Africa than in the cabins of SAA, the state airline. Suddenly, there are large numbers of black faces where Afrikaans maidens previously held sway; and the new integrated cabin crews demonstrate an obvious rapport, and an oblivion to racial distinction, which is a model for the nation. Many have joined the same trade union, a traditionally black body, the South African Railways and Harbours Workers Union (SARHWU). Only 10 years ago, when SAA hired its first non-white (in a more than menial position), the airline had to get parliamentary approval for the move. Today, says Martin Sebesho, SAA's executive manager (human resources), there is a blanket ban on hiring whites. To employ a white in any position requires board approval. Sebesho notes that this policy is far from the norm for South African business; few other companies - except those with government shareholders - are making such drastic efforts to restructure racially. Only 3 per cent of South African managers are black, and that figure has not changed much despite the new awareness of affirmative action. But SAA, with its high public profile and government shareholder, is a slightly different case. 'We suspect we are going to have a new government and that government will be our shareholder and being predominantly black it will demand a lot of compliance with affirmative action,' says Sebesho, with some understatement. 'By the turn of the century, the racial composition of SAA must reflect the racial composition of the country,' he says, noting that integrating the cockpit is the biggest challenge. SAA recently hired its first five non-white pilots, but the other 600 are white. The company plans to spend R3m (Pounds 557,000) a year to train 10 new black pilots per annum. Integrating cabin staff is easier, because of the lower level of technical skills involved: some 230 of 1,400 cabin staff are non-white. But, complains Sebesho (who is himself black), apartheid's legacy of poor non-white education and skills training makes hiring blacks difficult. 'We don't have a pool of blacks who are readily available to choose from,' he says, adding that SAA could find only 40 blacks in the entire country to interview as prospective pilots, let alone hire. SARHWU, the union which represents most black SAA employees, is unhappy about the company's efforts even so - and not for the obvious reasons. True, SARHWU complains that SAA hires whites on contract for vacancies which cannot be filled by competent blacks. But that is not the union's main complaint. 'Management says affirmative action means you must not hire whites. That is not my understanding: affirmative action means every worker must progress, black and white,' says Nelson Ndisa, SARHWU president, who argues that all SAA employees should receive in-house training to upgrade skills. 'If affirmative action is seen as taking white jobs it can be detrimental, it can cause strikes,' Ndisa says. Union official Ewan Abrahamse chips in: 'In the end, we'll bear the brunt of the racial tension in the workplace. If we cannot have a better understanding between whites and blacks, the country will be ruined,' he concludes. According to SARHWU's logic, those most committed to rapid affirmative action are the least likely to integrate successfully: 'The people who are leading in affirmative action (like SAA) were also at the forefront of apartheid,' says Abrahamse. He might have been quoting from a recent African National Congress policy paper: 'If well handled, affirmative action will help bind the nation together and produce benefits for everyone. If badly managed, it will simply re-distribute resentment, damage the economy and destroy social peace.' At least unions and management agree on one subject: the need to protect the company from nepotistic employment practices forced on it by the new government (and SAA's new shareholder). 'We want to have a clear plan to help us avoid being a political pawn. Then the chance of being forced to compromise on competency will be minimised,' says Sebesho. SARHWU officials agree.</p>

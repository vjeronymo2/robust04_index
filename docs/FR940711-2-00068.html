			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> B. Provide a sample curriculum for the summer institute participants based on content and approach which will help increase participants' knowledge of science, increase their understanding and skills regarding how to create classroom environments, and capitalize on the out-of-doors and family settings as areas of scientific exploration and learning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. List projected field experiences appropriate to the location of the college and Head Start programs. These may include trips to the ocean, visiting a quarry, aquarium, desert, nature trail, or wild life reserve. Information submitted should include the total number of hours of the institute program including a breakout of instruction vs. field trip experiences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Describe a plan for how many participants will be included in each summer program and how these participants will be recruited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Describe what provisions will be made for residential, intensive summer institutes for Head Start teachers, teacher assistants, and/or home visitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. Describe provision of materials, lunch and snacks, stipend or reimbursement, transportation to field activities, entry fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.

Explain the criteria and the approach to be used to recruit, fund, and mentor another teacher education college for the second year of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J. Develop an evaluation of the project to determine the effectiveness of the project. Describe the research questions to be addressed. Describe the evaluation that would be implemented, including the outcomes that would be measured, the evaluation design to be employed, and how the data will be analyzed. The evaluation should also include an analysis of the second summer institutes. The project and the evaluation will be completed by the end of the project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K. Provide a description of the qualifications of each key staff member including the third-party evaluator (the evaluator cannot be a member of the demonstration project staff). Include copies of their curriculum vitae.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L. Describe a plan to establish a self sustaining project, since this will be a prototype other colleges and universities may want to adapt. It is expected that the applicant may pay for more activities and services during the first year; however, attempts should be made to run a more self supporting program by year two. Outside resources or Head Start grantees that see these services as a priority can support some of the cost of the training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part IV_Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of how applicants will meet the requirements and responsibilities addressed under Parts II and III of this announcement, competing applications from colleges and universities will be reviewed and evaluated against the following criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Objectives and Need for Assistance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (15 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The extent to which the applicant identifies any relevant economic, social, financial institutional or other problems requiring a solution: demonstrates the need for the assistance: and states the principal and subordinate objectives of the project.

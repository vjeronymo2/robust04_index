			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Adoption of EC rules set to boost tyre sales TYREMAKERS, distributors and retailers expect extra sales of at least 500,000 car tyres this year as a result of the UK's belated adoption yesterday of tougher European Community minimum tread-depth standards. The British Rubber Manufacturers' Association expects extra sales generated by the stricter standards - which have been in force for up to two years in other EC states - to lift stagnant demand for replacement car tyres by 2.3 per cent to 17.9m this year. Replacement car tyres are much the largest sector of the market. This will provide relief to an industry in which profit margins, if not unit sales, have been badly affected by the fall in new-car sales and strong price competition in the replacement market. In recent months UK-based tyremakers, almost all of which were operating at a loss early last year, were able to convince carmakers that price increases were needed on tyres supplied as original equipment. Without increases, they argued, the tyre industry would have difficulty funding research and development and other investments essential to its long-term health. It was an important victory for the tyremakers, who last year provided 7.4m tyres for fitting to new UK-produced cars. Then, in November, for the first time since the recession began, leading companies such as Michelin and Pirelli imposed increases in the price of replacement tyres. So far these have not only failed to spark an escalation of the price war, but have led to a general upward shift in prices of between 10 per cent and 12 per cent. Mr Peter Tyson, marketing manager of Pirelli in the UK, said both moves meant UK operations 'are once again on a profitable trend'. The tougher tread-depth standards will provide a further boost. EC safety legislators as well as the industry insist they are necessary. The legislation requires a tread depth of at least 1.6mm 'throughout a continuous band comprising the central three-quarters of the breadth of tread and round the entire outer circumference of the tyre'. The standard about to expire - which applies to all vehicles including trucks, buses and motorcycles - requires a minimum of only 1mm of tread across three-quarters of the tread pattern, with 'visible tread' on the remaining quarter. The industry's belief that the legislation will trigger a surge for the tyre market is based on more than optimism. When the first legislation requiring a minimum tread depth was introduced in the UK in 1968, the replacement market for car tyres rose 31 per cent to 13.9m, from 10.7m in 1967. Mr Tyson said there was even a temporary shortage of tyres. When the minimum-tread law was modified in 1983 sales rose 10 per cent to 14.9m, from 13.5m in the previous year. Industry research shows that the differences in braking distances between tyres of varying tread depth can be substantial. Even a tyre with 1.6mm tread depth requires a 50 per cent greater stopping distance than a new tyre, while one to the existing UK standard requires a 90 per cent greater distance. This translates to 139 feet to stop with a new tyre, 207 feet at 1.6mm and 266 feet at 1mm. In spite of such statistics, the new standards are to be applied only to cars and light commercial vehicles up to 3,500 kilogrammes. The maximum fine for non-compliance is Pounds 1,000. The British Tyre Distributors' Association and individual tyremakers and distributors are critical of the government's unwillingness to allocate funds to promote awareness of the new legislation, in spite of survey indications that about 7 per cent of cars currently in use have illegal tyres.</p>

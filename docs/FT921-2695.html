			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Germany's see-saw pay row GERMAN engineering employers have called up a new ally - a nonplussed cartoon character armed with a saw - to fight against union pay demands. Der Sagermann has appeared on billboards and in press advertisements all over the country in the past few days, seemingly puzzled by the copywriter's exhortation that Germany could lose its leading economic role in Europe if he puts the saw to use. The aim was to promote common sense among 'unreasonable' people, Gesamtmetall, the employers' association funding the promotion said yesterday. The cost of the ad campaign could be measured in 'thousandths of 1 per cent' of the 9.5 per cent wage demand the association is facing from the IG Metall union. The campaign slogan - 'Don't cut off the branch we're all sitting on' - is accompanworkers in neighbouring countries have seen the economic light and are prepared to help improve national competitiveness by exercising moderation at the pay negotiating table. Italians have asked for less than inflation - 4 per cent at most. Finns have foregone any increase in the interests of national economic well-being. Britons, French and Belgians want around 4 per cent, the advertisement says. The soft-sell approach contrasts sharply with the hard line taken by Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, head of Gesamt-metall, who has said pay this year should rise in line with expected productivity increases of 2 per cent if hundreds of thousands of job losses are to be avoided. The campaign also represents an attempt to affect broad public opinion, which has so far tended to favour the employers in this year's pay round. A recent opinion poll showed that 56 per cent of west Germans think the unions are asking for too much.</p>

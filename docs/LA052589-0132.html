			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> RIVALS IN RUNNING TO EARN A MASTERS;  </P> <P> NIELSEN WILL LINE UP AGAINST LAVELLE AGAIN IN FORMIDABLE 1,600-METER FIELD  </P> <P> Three years ago, Mike Nielsen played on the Mater Dei High School freshman  basketball team with a tall, gangly kid named Eddie Lavelle.  </P> <P> Lavelle transferred to Corona del Mar after his freshman year and became one of  Nielsen's biggest rivals. Not on the basketball court, but on the track.  </P> <P> Friday night at 7:45, Lavelle and Nielsen will line up along with seven other  runners for the boys' 1,600-meter final at the Southern Section Masters meet at  Cerritos College.  </P> <P> The field is a Who's Who of Southern California prep distance-running talent,  including Agoura's Bryan Dameworth, the 1987 state cross-country champion;  Burbank's Todd Lewis, who won the 3-A title last Saturday in 4 minutes 11.44  seconds -- the fastest time of the day, and Carpenteria's Coley Cadaele, who  won the 1-A 800 and 1,600 Saturday.  </P> <P> Lavelle and Nielsen, along with Corona del Mar's Greg Shryock and Capistrano  Valley's Neil Stevenson, are expected to represent the county well.  </P> <P> Not that representation is the main idea.  </P> <P> Nielsen, who also will compete in the 3,200 approximately two hours after the  finish of the 1,600, said, "I'm just getting on that line to win."  </P> <P> And, perhaps, to prove a few things.  </P> <P> Nielsen, normally a soft-spoken, amiable fellow, said he wasn't happy when he  learned last fall he had been left off the all-county cross-country team, one  that is selected by a vote of coaches at a meeting of the Orange County  Cross-Country Coaches Assn.  </P> <P> "I felt I was overlooked," he said. "I think that's what was driving me (to  train hard) during the winter time."  </P> <P> And now, after beating Lavelle twice in the past two weeks -- in the 3,200 at  the Southern Section preliminaries May 13 and again in the 3,200 final last  Saturday -- Nielsen said he has the confidence necessary to run with the very  best.  </P> <P> And if he, like other Masters competitors, finishes among the top five of his  event, he will advance to the state meet June 3-4 at Cerritos College. But  Nielsen says that is not his first priority.  </P> <P> "I'm not going just to qualify," said Nielsen, whose best times are 4:14.36 in  the 1,600 and 9:15.62 in the 3,200.  </P> <P> "The big goal is to win."  </P> <P> If that happens -- and if Nielsen runs faster than Lavelle's county-leading  time of 4:11.94 -- he will no doubt take a major step toward proving himself  the best miler in the county this season. It is a goal both Nielsen and his  coach, Dave Zeitler, have sought for some time.  </P> <P> "A 4:12 (for the 1,600), that was basically our goal for him," Zeitler said.  "But I think Eddie's best time is 4:11.96 this year, so I think we'd like to go  4:11.95.  </P> <P> "We'd like to show that Mike's basically the best middle-distance runner in the  county. Of course, we want to get to the state meet, but that would be the  icing on the cake."  </P> <P> And Lavelle was not at his best in the section finals Saturday.  </P> <P> In the 1,600, he had to scramble from the back of the pack before finally  overtaking Nielsen on the final straightaway for second in 4:13.86. And later,  in the 3,200, Lavelle finished sixth in 9:25, 10 seconds behind Nielsen, who  was second.  </P> <P> But Lavelle, who will attend Notre Dame in the fall, should not be counted out.  His 11 years of racing experience alone -- he won four national championships  as an age-group competitor before high school -- lends a certain advantage.  </P> <P> Though Nielsen did not race against Lavelle before high school -- he is one of  the few Masters 1,600 meter entrants without any age-group background -- he  said he has certainly heard plenty of his name and reputation.  </P> <P> It doesn't seem to bother Nielsen, though. He said he'd rather be the underdog  anyway.  </P> <P> "Oh, definitely, that's the way I like it," he said.  </P> <P> And for at least one more race anyway, that's the way it will probably be.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Emission Reductions. EPA believes the average g/bhp-hr level for line haul locomotives and locomotive engines operated by class 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locomotives in California is approximately 13.5 g/bhp-hr. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate was developed from train data and locomotive emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data supplied to EPA by railroad companies that operate within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, and locomotive engine manufacturers. <FOOTCITE>86</FOOTCITE>  The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroads have however claimed that the average emission level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locomotives operating in California is 12 g/bhp-hr. While they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have provided no accounting of that average level, and the 13.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g/bhp-hr level was calculated from data provided by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroads, EPA has used both levels in its estimates of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of this program. The range provides for conservative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates both of the current emissions impact of locomotives and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reductions from this program. Other locomotives, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated by class 2 and 3 railroads and switcher locomotives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated by class 1 railroads have g/bhp-hr levels higher than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.5 g/bhp-hr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 86 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Memo from Peter Hutchins to Chester J. France. February 14, 1994, ``Current Emission Levels and Duty-Cycles.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To calculate a minimum emission reduction, one can assume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all locomotives are at 12 or 13.5 g/bhp-hr. EPA's 2007  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that railroad emissions average 5.5 g/bhp-hr would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore provide overall emission reductions of 54 percent to 59  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. The 2010 requirement that railroad emissions average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.0 g/bhp-hr would therefore provide overall emission reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 67 percent to 70 percent. Since the current overall average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, due to switching operations and class 2 and 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation, must be higher than 13.5 g/bhp-hr, a reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess of 70 percent is likely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the reductions necessary to meet the 5.5 g/bhp-hr emission average will be achievable through the use of clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel technology and operational changes. Some use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuels may be necessary to supplement the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction achieved by clean diesel and operational changes or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow significant growth. Electrification, under strong  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration for at least some South Coast lines would greatly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate compliance and reductions. EPA requests comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what types of engines or strategies may be required to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not anticipate that additional measures of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction will be required at this time. However several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options, which EPA could not finalize due to technological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues, but could develop later as provided by section 182(e)(5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the CAA, are widespread use of electrification and the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel cells.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Other Options. EPA requests comment on three other options being promoted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the South Coast, the CARB and the AAR, respectively. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast Air Quality Management District is proposing that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90 percent reduction in railroad emissions in the basin be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the year 2010. This proposal requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrification of all locomotive operations, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switching. They have not yet determined how such a project could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be funded. For this reason, EPA is not proposing this option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CARB is considering an option that would require an 80  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent reduction in locomotive NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions statewide by 2003.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions of HC and CO would be allowed to rise and emissions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulates would be reduced after 2003. It appears likely that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this level of reduction could require that all locomotives used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in California operate on a fuel other than diesel, with natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas being a likely candidate. Alternatively, electrification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a number of lines may be necessary. EPA is concerned about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicality and costs associated with electrification, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore not proposing this option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAR has proposed that linehaul locomotives be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to average 6 g/bhp-hr by the year 2010. This proposal could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumably build from national standards on new locomotives and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some regulation of remanufactured locomotives. However, it does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not affect switching and other non-line operations, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loading and unloading. The effect of that omission has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variously estimated at from 5 to 30 percent of emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on the geographic area. Because this program does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve sufficient reductions, EPA is not proposing this option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, EPA requests comment on this and the other two options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

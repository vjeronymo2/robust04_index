			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Stanhope near to agreeing refinancing STANHOPE Properties yesterday announced the sale of two buildings for just over Pounds 100m and said it was close to agreeing the refinancing of Pounds 160m of debt. However confusion surrounded the exact state of Stanhope's refinancing talks for a few hours yesterday afternoon when Brunswick, the company's public relations adviser, inadvertently released a statement to the stock exchange which claimed that the refinancing had been agreed. The statement was later retracted. The error arose because Brunswick had prepared two alternative releases describing the sale of a building, one of which also announced the refinancing of Stanhope's debt. The wrong released was issued. Stanhope said the extension of its revolving credit facility until December 1996 had indeed been agreed by the 16 banks directly involved. However, agreement had not been reached by all the banks involved in Stanhope's projects, some of which are guaranteed by the parent company. In particular, the head office of a French bank had yet to give formal approval, although the deal had been agreed at branch level. The revolving credit facility has been reduced from Pounds 165m to Pounds 160m and, if finally agreed, will be subject to bank approval in December 1994 and December 1995. Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, Stanhope's 50 per cent-owned subsidiary, has sold Broadwalk House, a 280,000 sq ft building within the Broadgate office complex in the City of London to Credit Lyonnais, the building's main tenant. Rosehaugh, the other half of the RSD venture, went into receivership a month ago. Credit Lyonnais will pay Pounds 12.7m for the building and will assume the building's debt of Pounds 76.3m. RSD will benefit from any increase in the value of the building before 1995, up to a ceiling of Pounds 1.75m. Stanhope also announced yesterday that an overseas buyer had paid Pounds 20.5m for a Staines office building, let to the tobacco division of BAT.</p>

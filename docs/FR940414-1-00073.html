			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the considerations outlined in the foregoing discussion, EPA defined and analyzed an additional regulatory option for sanitizer chemicals. This option (called Option 3/S) is the same as Option 3 discussed above except for those facilities that formulate, package, or repackage sanitizer active ingredients and whose sanitizer production is less than 265,000 pounds per year. Specifically, in such facilities, non-interior wastestreams such as those from exterior cleaning, cleaning safety equipment, lab wastewater, floor washing and DOT test baths and that contain only sanitizer active ingredients would be exempted from PSES. All other PAI wastestreams at these facilities, including interior wastestreams containing sanitizers PAIs and any non-interior wastestreams containing both sanitizer and other PAIs, would be subject to the zero discharge requirement. In the same way as for Option 3, the zero discharge requirement for these other wastestreams can be met through pollution prevention practices. The Option 3 zero discharge requirement would apply to all PAI wastestreams at any facilities whose wastestreams do not qualify for the sanitizer PAI exemption. The projected impacts under Option 3/S are discussed below for all Subcategory C facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In defining this regulatory alternative, EPA set the 265,000 pounds per year production limit based on analysis of the production volume of facilities that would be expected to avoid adverse impacts as a result of the Option 3/S sanitizer chemical exemption. Specifically, in its facility impact analyses, EPA found that no facility larger than the 265,000 pounds per year production limit would avoid a significant impact as a result of the exemption. Accordingly, in an effort to mitigate significant impacts among PFPR facilities owned by small businesses while retaining as large a share as possible of the pollution reduction benefits of the originally selected Option 3, EPA decided to limit the Option 3/S (ans the Option 3/S.1) sanitizer chemical exemption to only those facilities with less than 265,000 pounds per year of production involving designated sanitizer PAIs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 7 compares the impacts projected under Option 3 and 3/S, providing detail for facilities with wastewater streams containing only sanitizer PAIs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Impacts of Option 3/S. Under Option 3/S, 529 population facilities are estimated to incur costs. The incremental capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 3/S are estimated to be $63.0 million and $26.1 million, respectively. Compared to Option 3, total annualized costs are reduced by approximately $2 million as a result of the reduced requirements on exempted sanitizer PAI-only wastestreams. The possibility of facility closure was analyzed for 113 of these facilities and the remaining 416 were analyzed for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One facility is estimated to close due to compliance with Option 3/S. In addition, 136 facilities (20 percent fewer than under Option 3) are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Under Option 3/S, total U.S. job losses are estimated, in the worst case, to be 355 FTEs or 17 percent fewer than the 426 job losses estimated for Option 3. All of the reduction in impacts necessarily occurs in facilities with non-interior wastewater streams containing only sanitizer PAIs and whose sanitizer production volume is less than 265,000 pounds per year. The requirements of Option 3 and Option 3/S are the same for facilities that co-mingle their wastestreams or whose sanitizer production volume is at least 265,000 pounds per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,i1,s50,7.1,7.1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> ._National Estimates of Impacts for Subcategory C Facilities Under Option  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 -->  and Option  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 3/S <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=1 --> [Assuming Zero Cost Pass-Through] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank;

the amount of pollutants associated with their non-interior wastestreams is insignificant; and excluding their non-interior wastestreams from coverage results in basically the same overall reduction in pollutants discharged by the PFPR industry but significantly eases the burden on these small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The adoption of Option 3/S.1 based on Option 3/S is consistent with the objectives of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which directs agencies to examine any significant regulatory alternatives which will accomplish the stated objectives of the applicable statute and which minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities. (RFA Section 603). Section 603 also specifically mentions exemptions from coverage of the rule as one type of alternative that could be examined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Subcategory E Facilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Refilling establishments generate wastewater as a result of contaminated stormwater and leaks and spills falling within their secondary containment areas or loading pads, as well as the collection and holding of rinsates from refillable containers. Secondary containment and loading pad requirements for refilling establishments who handle agricultural pesticides were recently proposed by EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. EPA considered two regulatory options for refilling establishments. These two options would both require zero discharge of pollutants but they would be based on different control technologies. Option 1 is based on reuse of all contaminated wastewater, and assumes that the contaminated wastewater is used as make-up water in application of pesticide chemicals to the field. Option 2 assumes that the wastewater is disposed of by off-site incineration. The Agency is proposing Option 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. BPT. Refilling establishments with their use of refillable containers is a relatively new industry which developed during the mid 1980s as a response to industry and environmental concerns regarding the packaging of pesticide products. Because they are a new subcategory, they are not covered under the BPT zero discharge rule promulgated in 1978. EPA is therefore establishing a new requirement for this subcategory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responses to the survey indicate that there are no direct dischargers and therefore there are no costs to the industry to comply with a BPT regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. PSES. Of the estimated 1,122 Subcategory E facilities that are potentially subject to the regulation, EPA's data indicate that 98 percent, or 1,103 facilities, are already in compliance. Therefore, they would not incur any costs to comply with the proposed regulatory option. In addition, the remaining 19 facilities are expected to be able to achieve compliance with the proposed regulation at zero additional cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 26, IRNA -- There is a feeling of  hurt and anguish in Muslim circles at the news of the slaughter  of innocent Muslims by Israelis in a mosque in Hebron, Palestine.    IRNA talked to a cross section of Muslim intelligentsia from  different walks of life today to elicit their views. The  reaction everywhere was one of shock and disblief. People were  also highly critical of the agreement reached between Palestine  Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader and the Israeli Government  late October.    Najma Heptullah, deputy chairman of the upper house of the  Indian parliament called the incident tragic. She suggested  that both the PLO and the Israeli Government must be cautious  for there are people on both sides who are against a lasting  peace in the occupied lands.    Heptullah said while such a mishap was expected, it was up  to  the two sides to diffuse the tension and carry on with the  action for peace.    Syed Shahabuddin, member of parliament and a vocal advocate  of Muslim issues was anguished to hear of the incident. He can  now see the agreement between PLO and the Israeli Government  resting on very shaky foundation.    Unless Israel clearly agrees to vacate all occupied  territories, no permanent solution can be found, Shahabuddin  said adding that this was the main stumbling block to the  possibility of a peace. He wanted all settlers to be disarmed  so that such mishaps would not be repeated.    Students' islamic Movement (SIM) holds that the issue of  Palestine and that of 'Bait-al-Muqaddas' is that of all Muslims  all over the world.    Anwar Ali, secretary general of the organisation feels that  the agreement between the two sides is baseless. It is an  attempt to thwart the Palestine movement.    Ali added that the entire Muslim world was alarmed at the  way  in which the Israeli police and army had turned a blind eye to  the murder in cold blood of scores of worshipers.    Mulana Mukarram Ahmad, chief imam of the Fatehpuri mosque in  New Delhi, feels it is certain big powers who are creating all  the trouble. Innocent Muslims are their choice targets every  where. He expressed shock and said that all parties must work  for peace.    The people of Palestine have gone through very bad times.  That phase must come to an end, he said. On whether the  incidence will derail the peace process, he said while the  possibilty was always there, it can be tided over in the  interest of peace if the Israelis are sincere.    Syed Hamid, former vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim  University felt the act was a most atrocious one likely to queer  the pitch of the negotiations going on between PLO and Israel.  He felt the ball was in the Israeli court now. They must  provide the necessary security to the Palestinians since they  were in command.    S. Burney, former governor of the state of Haryana and a  retired civil servant called the incident most painful. He said  all violence must be avoided, for violence begets violence.    The slaughter, he said, will have a lot of serious  repercussions. He only hoped that peace be restored.</p>

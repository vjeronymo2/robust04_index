			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Public sector warned of reforms' fraud risk The government's policy of breaking up large public-sector bureaucracies has increased the risk of waste and opened more opportunities for dishonesty, the Audit Commission warned yesterday. The commission is responsible for audits in the local authority and health sectors in England and Wales. The bodies it audits spend about Pounds 90bn and employ 3m people. Some managers and professional staff, it said, were handling large sums of public money regardless of their expertise or experience. Sir David Cooksey, the commission's chairman, said in his annual report that early indications suggested the 'massive changes' taking place in the public sector, with devolution of responsibility to large numbers of service providers, were leading to better management and value for money. But teething troubles were inevitable and change brought risks as well as potential benefits, Sir David said. Accountability could be blurred as responsibilities were reallocated. He said: 'If the full benefits are to be gained, we must ensure that effective mechanisms for accountability are put in place to underpin the process of change and to ensure that the risks are minimised.' Although a study by the commission of probity in local government had shown that fraud and corruption were apparently low, Sir David said that there were 'some signs that it could be on the increase'. The commission will assess the extent of fraud and corruption in the National Health Service by the end of this year. He said: 'I remain concerned that some aspects of public expenditure are not subject to adequate independent scrutiny.' Local authority companies, for example, were subject to audit under the Companies Act, which provided a 'less rigorous regime of audit than that required by the Audit Commission for other local-authority funds'. The commission would welcome legislation to rectify this. Sir David called for an early resolution to uncertainty caused by the current review of local government structure. This was 'reducing the time members and officers can devote to making their services more effective, efficient and economical'. The commission expresses concern that the standard spending assessment (SSA) process, under which the government distributes Pounds 40bn a year to local authorities and indicates appropriate spending levels, is leading to 'confusion of accountability'. Neither central nor local government accepted responsibility for decisions on particular services, while the complexity of the SSA formulas hid underlying political choices, obscuring decisions and those responsible for making them. The report noted problems of efficiency and accountability in the policy of local management of schools. While most schools had adapted well to managing their own finances, 'green shoots of impropriety' were emerging in a few. Some schools spent five times as much as others on administration, while heads of similar schools spent anything from 5 per cent to 60 per cent of their time managing budgets.

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: Best for France and Europe if franc floats Sir, The letter from L van den Muyzenberg (March 30) contains a very large level of misinformation. Since it is also typical of comments that one hears from French politicians, I feel it cannot go unanswered. No serious commentator that I've read suggests that the franc would fall by 20 per cent if free floated; indeed, most say that the likely behaviour would be a small fall followed by a gradual rise back up to previous levels as German short term interest rates come down. How is this remotely inflationary? The point of John Plender's article, 'Le doomsday machine' (March 26), was not to argue that the French banks ought to be bailed out of their bad lending decisions but to illustrate the sort of deflationary forces that were gathering over the French economy and the problems this would put in the way of economic recovery, when the present draconian and wholly inappropriate monetary squeeze is finally relaxed. France already has low inflation and how maintaining very high levels of real interest rates leads to investment is beyond me. Many people have said that long term rates are more important in France than, say, in Britain. But I would be willing to bet with anyone that long rates would also fall were the franc to float free. To link one's currency to that of a sound money economy that normally moves in sync with one's own economy seems a very sensible idea. Unfortunately, that description of the German economy, in the wake of German reunification, is somewhat doubtful at the moment. European exchange rate co-operation seems a very sensible long-term policy (some of the arguments for which he eloquently advances in his final paragraph). However, he must surely have noticed that the ERM has not recently been providing the sort of stable environment for doing business in Europe, after which he hankers. It is a pity that this sensible policy is being put at risk (and brought into disrepute) because the rules of the ERM are unable to cope satisfactorily with the present situation. Would it not be better for the franc to float free until economic conditions in Germany become more normal; better for the French economy, better for the longer term future of ERM, and better for the European economy.

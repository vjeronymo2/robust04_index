			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Smashing bargain How much can scientists reasonably expect taxpayers to spend on machines to investigate the innermost secrets of nature - the fundamental particles and forces that make up the universe? The US Congress decided last October that Dollars 11bn was too much; it cancelled the all-American Superconducting Super Collider under construction in Texas. Now, an irresistible bargain is on offer: Dollars 1.8bn for a smaller atom-smasher to be funded by the entire industrialised world. That is the price tag on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which Cern, the European particle physics laboratory, proposes to build in a 27 kilometre tunnel beneath the Jura foothills near Geneva. Unfortunately the Cern council failed to give full approval to the project last Friday. In a typical Euro-wrangle, two of the 19 Cern members, Germany and the UK, blocked agreement in an attempt to extract a larger contribution from the host countries, France and Switzerland. But all delegates seemed confident that a compromise could be reached later this summer. Europe must agree as soon as possible, so that Cern can take advantage of the SSC's demise to make the LHC a truly international project. American physicists are particularly keen to negotiate entry, so as to make use of the scientific skills and experience that had been devoted to the Texan project. The level of US contribution suggested in informal discussions - Dollars 400m, including equipment and cash - would substantially improve the LHC's performance. Once the US was involved, it would not be difficult for Cern to bring in Japan, Canada, Russia, India and other non-European nations that have expressed interest in the LHC. It would then become the world's first global scientific enterprise and a model for future collaboration in 'big science' projects that are beyond the means of even the richest country on its own. The next such facility might be ITER, the proposed international experiment in fusion power. The LHC will not match the planned power of the 87km Texan machine. But it will still smash together atomic particles with enough energy to recreate a microcosm of the new-born universe a millionth of a millionth of a second after the Big Bang. In that primordial fireball, scientists believe the 'Higgs boson' particle held the secret of why some things came to weigh so much more than others. The atom smasher may recreate this and other particles predicted by theory but never yet observed. These may seem abstruse subjects - and physicists certainly need to make more effort to explain their importance to non-scientists. But almost everyone is interested in the origins and future of our universe. So the world should not hesitate to spend a couple of billion dollars on a machine that helps us to understand it.</p>

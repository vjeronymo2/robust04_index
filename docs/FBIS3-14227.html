			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq today testified before  the Shamgar Commission on the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre.  Baraq said the massacre in Hebron fell on the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] like a bolt from the blue and was totally  unexpected. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports:    [Begin recording] [Amsalem] The chief of staff's testimony  is continuing now behind closed doors, and this will bring to an  end today's proceedings. This morning the chief of staff also  testified for two hours behind closed doors. Baraq's public  testimony also lasted for two hours. Baraq's testimony was  fluent, firm, and extremely lucid. He said the IDF is acting on  the basis of what it estimates to be reasonable and expected. A  massacre is not an event that the Army could have prepared  itself for. A bolt out of the blue -- this is how Baraq termed  the incident. Baraq said that the security procedures at the  cave where good, but even so the massacre could not have been  prevented -- rather only minimized -- had these procedures been  adhered to.    The chief of staff opened his public testimony with an  hour-long review of the situation. The first part dealt with  the situation in the territories; the threat of terrorism,  dangers stemming from terrorist acts, and the pursuit of  fugitives. Baraq said this situation has exacerbated since the  beginning of the intifadah, and that things got even worse after  the Oslo agreement and in the wake of the political process.  During all this time the IDF has initiated an active campaign  against Palestinian terrorism. The chief of staff said this was  the IDF's main mission in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip,  as he himself and the defense minister have explained to all the  Army echelons. The chief of staff said that Colonel Me'ir  Kalifi, Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, and Major General Dani Yatom  are the officers in charge of the struggle on the ground -- and  these three were also the three senior IDF witnesses at the  Shamgar Commission. The chief of staff defined their work as  complicated and difficult.    During the second part of his review the chief of staff  explained the IDF's open-fire orders. He said they were  formulated by the General Staff and approved at the most senior  legal levels. He said they have not been changed in terms of  law or principles, but there have been adaptations to new  situations on the ground. Baraq said the measures adopted by  the soldiers on the ground were also kept proportional to the  dangers confronting them. Baraq said the orders left a large  room of discretion for the soldiers on the ground. The Army  chose to simplify the orders rather than going into the fine  details of hypothetical situations, as was deemed appropriate by  jurists.    The chief of staff said that there was no order not to fire  at Jews. Let us hear how Baraq described this issue:    [Baraq] In no case is there, nor can there be, an IDF order  saying it is forbidden to fire at a settler even if he is  directing gunfire at other people or at the soldiers. On the  contrary, there is an order relating to life-threatening  situations explicitly stating the opposite. If there was a  misunderstanding -- and from some of the testimony it appears  some people did misunderstand the orders -- it could have  stemmed from misunderstanding answers given to soldiers during  briefings. This issue should indeed be investigated, and  normally we would have thoroughly investigated it by ourselves.  Now I am not certain we should do so, in view of the fact that  the issue is being examined by this commission of inquiry, among  others.    [Amsalem] The chief of staff said no briefings are held in  anticipation of a massacre. This is how Baraq defined the  massacre:    [Baraq] All this is not required for a massacre. Here  everything is clear: A massacre is a massacre is a massacre.  There is no need for special orders or directives to know what  has to be done in such cases.    [Amsalem] Baraq said the misunderstanding of the orders  stemmed either from the briefings or from temporary procedures  introduced several months ago regarding imposing the law on  Israelis in the territories. These procedures included a clause  dealing with directing shots at Israelis. The chief of staff  said these procedures did not deal with life-threatening  situations.    Baraq said that in the six years of the intifadah there has  not been even one case in which a soldier saw an Israeli  shooting without a reason. There were no fatalities stemming  from criminal acts perpetrated in the presence of soldiers. The  chief of staff finished his review with a comparison of the IDF  with the French Army fighting in Algeria. He said the problems  were somewhat similar; in Algiers, however, the French Army  suffered a moral deterioration, whereas the IDF is trying to  preserve moral standards.    After Baraq's review ended, the questions started. Justice  al-Zu'bi wanted to find out if the chief of staff bears  responsibility for the massacre. Baraq said he bears the  overall responsibility, but the chief of staff's responsibility  detracts nothing from the responsibility borne by any officer  regarding his sphere of command and concrete responsibility --  this is how the chief of staff differentiated between his  responsibility and that of the officers on the ground.    Answering another question regarding the settlers' right to  bring weapons into the cave, Baraq said there was no room to  change this, because there was no concrete warning regarding  dangers posed by Jews:    [Baraq] We did not expect a murder by such a lunatic, we did  not expect this sort of action. We did not conceive of the  possibility of such an action. I am afraid that in order to be  honest with ourselves we must state that such a suicidal and  determined lunatic can murder people; he can murder Israeli  citizens and Palestinian Arabs. In other places in the world  such a lunatic can carry out mass massacres, shoot down  jetliners, or murder the president of a superpower who is  guarded by an entire secret service. I think we should have no  illusions regarding what we cannot accomplish. I think it is  impractical to act on the assumption that the IDF or any other  element can come up with a foolproof security plan which would  give a complete answer to any coldblooded or lunatic suicide  attack.    [Amsalem] Answering a question posed by commission member  Menahem Ya'ari, the chief of staff expressed reservations about  comments made by Yisra'el Bluementhal, head of Hebron's home  guard, who issued the IDF weapons to Goldstein. Bluementhal  defined the massacre as a battle. The chief of staff ended his  public appearance by stating that in the restrictions under  which it is operating, the IDF is imposing law and order in an  even-handed fashion. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / 'Collorgate' and the costs of corruption: Despite a carnival atmosphere, Brazil's political crisis threatens prolonged economic uncertainty In the demonstrations which have recently erupted across Brazil, demanding the resignation of President Fernando Collor, there is a surprisingly carnival-like atmosphere, despite the black mourning dress worn by protesters. Such festive spirit is hard to understand in a country which is suffering severe economic difficulties and which has now been plunged into its worst political crisis with the publication this week of a congressional report accusing the president of involvement in a multi-million-dollar corruption scandal. 'We have inflation of 23 per cent a month and a minimum salary of Dollars 40 a month' complains one demonstrator who demands Mr Collor's departure. 'Things can only get better.' Few doubt the importance of the coming weeks for the future of Latin America's largest economy. After Wednesday's approval of the congressional report on the scandal, which implicates its first president to be directly elected for 30 years, Brazil is now set to embark upon the unfamiliar process of impeachment. The report was the culmination of 85 days of investigations by a special congressional panel set up after Mr Collor's younger brother accused him of profiting from his position on a large scale. Although the focus of the inquiry was Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the president's former campaign treasurer, the final report detailed how in two and a half years in office Mr Collor and his family profited from a kickback scheme run by Mr Farias. The report has underlined how deeply corruption is engrained in the political system. Mr Collor came to office vowing to crush corruption; many of his supporters were Brazil's 'shirtless ones', the poorest people in a country with wide income disparities. Tax revenues have fallen partly because of a belief that the government will abuse the money. Added to that, the inaction in government as Mr Collor struggles to hang on to his office threatens further the stability of the government's fiscal position, which in turn puts at risk agreements with its international creditors to reduce Brazil's debt. The crisis has united Mr Collor's opponents. The fractious opposition of more than 15 parties has joined forces to back a formal request for the president's impeachment. This request will be presented to congress next Tuesday, jointly by the heads of the Brazilian Lawyers' and Journalists' Associations. From his office in Brasilia, where he is sheltered from the worst of the demonstrations, the country's 43-year-old president insists that the situation is 'normal' and that he has 'no problem sleeping'. He refuses to resign. Brazil's current situation would cause a mood of despondency in most countries. Professor Riordan Roett, head of the Johns Hopkins School of Latin American Studies in the US, says: 'Increasingly I see Brazil as having a set of intractable economic and political problems which no one person can solve'. Yet the mood in the streets is one of hope, particularly because the military, which held power between 1964 and 1985, shows no sign intervening. Even within the embattled government there is optimism. Mr Carlos Garcia, the Minister for Special Projects, says: 'This is the ultimate crisis. The good thing is if we can survive this we can survive anything.' Over the next few weeks Brazil's this sentiment will certainly be put to the test. Mr Collor's lawyers are expected to put up technical challenges to the congressional report, arguing that the subject of inquiry was Mr Farias and thus did not have the right to incriminate the president. They also plan to contest the impeachment process; the section of the 1988 Constitution which sets down the procedure has not yet been ratified. Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, president of Congress, has already said that he will accept next week's request. The battleground then becomes the lower house of Congress where a two-thirds majority is required to open proceedings. Mr Collor's allies and opposition are currently engaged in a frantic game of political arithmetic to ensure success in the vote. A wave of defections prompted by the demonstrations and reflected in the overwhelming approval of the report, suggests that Mr Collor no longer has the 168 votes needed to hold onto power. Influential politicians and businessmen are already queuing up to see Mr Itamar Franco, the vice-president who assumes office in the event of Mr Collor's departure. If the vote goes against Mr Collor he will be suspended from office for 180 days. Mr Franco will take over while the Senate carries out its own investigation and hears the president's defence before making recommendations to the Supreme Court on whether he committed a 'crime of responsibility' for which the penalty is losing office. A criminal investigation may also be brought against him by the Federal Prosecutor, head of the country's independent judiciary. If convicted he could go to jail. This is thought quite likely if impeachment is approved. Even if Mr Collor manages to muster sufficient votes in congress to withstand the impeachment process or succeeds in convincing the Senate of his innocence it is likely to be a hollow victory. He is likely to be left a lame duck president, discredited in the public eye and unable to push through the reforms which are necessary to balance government finances and revive the economy. Whichever outcome emerges, the one certainty for the coming months is continued economic paralysis. Although the economics team has kept the currency fairly stable during the crisis, all investment decisions by foreign and domestic companies are currently on hold. Crucial fiscal reform has been delayed, tax revenues are falling, an agreement with the International Monetary Fund has all but collapsed threatening the recent accord with creditors on the restructuring of Dollars 44bn of commercial debt. In the year to the end of June, prices increased by an average of 850 per cent, compared to 20 per cent in neighbouring Argentina. Monthly interest rates are in excess of 30 per cent. The financial markets are making no secret of their hope that Mr Collor makes a speedy exit. They rose last week on rumours of his resignation and again this week because the pace of events has been moving faster than anticipated. Already the slowest growing of the large Latin American economies, Brazil is lagging far behind its neighbours in economic reform programmes such as tariff reduction, privatisation, and particularly in fiscal reform. This year, it is expected to achieve a nominal expansion of Gross Domestic product of a meagre 1 per cent. But long-term comfort is being drawn from the resilience of the country's political institutions and the political reform expected to result from 'Collorgate'. These include new electoral rules and the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, as well as the implementation of anti-corruption measures being pursued by congress. Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, Brazil's most respected politician, says that in his 44 years as a congressman he has never seen such a wide-ranging crisis. 'But we now have the chance to create a new Brazil where no corrupt person can come to power.'</p>

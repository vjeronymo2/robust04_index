			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Delhaize net falls sharply NET profits at Delhaize 'Le Lion', the Belgian retail group, fell more than 70 per cent, to BFr1.01bn (Dollars 28.5m) in the first half of 1993, from BFr3.43bn in the same period a year ago. Delhaize also warned its full-year profits would be lower than in 1992, and said it may hold its 1993 dividend at last year's BFr20 per share. Group sales rose 8.2 per cent to BFr163bn, against BFr151bn. The Belgian stores pushed up sales from BFr45.15bn to BFr45.29bn. However, recession, falling food prices, and industrial disputes cut profits. Turnover at the Food Lion chain in the US rose to Dollars 3.41bn from 3.24bn. The supermarkets, however, suffered a 48 per cent drop in net profits in the first half, to Dollars 52.6m, as they tried to recover from a wave of bad publicity. Last month, Food Lion settled a long-running dispute over federal labour laws with the US department of labour. The company granted back pay of Dollars 13.2m to some employees who had worked overtime without pay. It was fined Dollars 2m for that dispute and Dollars 1m for failing to ensure adequate safety conditions for employees under 18.</p>

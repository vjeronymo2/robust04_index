			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FRATELLO RESIGNS AS HAWK COACH AFTER FAILING TO MAKE PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Mike Fratello resigned Monday as coach of the Atlanta Hawks after the team  failed to qualify for the NBA playoffs for the first time in five seasons.  </P> <P> "Looking at the situation, and to be honest to myself, I feel comfortable in  saying that for the best interests of the Atlanta Hawks and in my best  interests, it's probably best for both of us if we part ways at this time,"  Fratello said at a news conference with Hawk President Stan Kasten and General  Manager Pete Babcock.  </P> <P> Fratello, in the last year of a four-year contract, was under pressure as the  Hawks, plagued by injuries and internal bickering, played sub-.500 basketball  most of the season.  </P> <P> He had a record of 323-251 with the Hawks and was the second-winningest coach  in Atlanta history. Only Richie Guerin outranks him, with 327 victories.  </P> <P> There had been speculation that Fratello would be fired, but Kasten said the  departure was Fratello's decision. He said no decision has been made about a  new coach.  </P></p>

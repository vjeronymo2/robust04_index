			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Observer: Charity-speak Some pretty improbable-sounding charities - such as the Solicitors Benevolent Association and the Girls Friendly Society - figure among those in The Henderson Top 1000 charities guide which has just been published by Hemmington Scott. But there is no disguising the fact that it is increasingly difficult to differentiate big business from charity when it comes to jargon. One contributor to the guide enthuses about improvements in 'donor base technology' but warns that 'cold donor acquisition rates' are slipping below the threshold of commercial viability on first mailing. Not sure what it means, but no doubt it is all in a good cause.</p>

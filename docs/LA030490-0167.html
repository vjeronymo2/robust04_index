			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A DEVICE TO TRACK DOWN BANK ROBBERS  </P> <P> Re "Device to Track Bank Robbers Challenged (Feb. 27)."  </P> <P> Your anti-police attitude has once again reared its ugly head. The Orange  County agencies finally have a new tool that can have a very positive impact on  catching bank robbers.  </P> <P> It is obvious that they asked you to not print this article so the bank robbers  would not know about the device, thus decreasing the chance of catching the  bank robbers. Did this stop you? Of course not.  </P> <P> A ridiculous statement was made by (H. Dean) Steward (head of the federal  public defender's office in Santa Ana). He said, "If everyone knows it is in  the bank, they will be less likely to rob it." That is a typical statement of a  public defender whose job it is to defend the bank robbers. Talk about your  head in the sand. The robbers know about the cameras and exploding dye packs,  and they still commit the robberies.  </P> <P> Thanks for taking an outstanding device to help the police catch felony  suspects and make it less effective by telling the robbers about the device.  Your article once again makes a difficult job more difficult. This is  irresponsible journalism.  </P> <P> STEPHEN G. MANTHORNE  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

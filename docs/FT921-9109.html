			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: News Corp It is perhaps sobering for News Corporation shareholders to speculate what might have happened a year ago if something had gone wrong during the company's delicate refinancing talks with the banks. The negotiations were so delicately poised, that a single piece of bad news might have had lenders making a hasty bee-line for the door. Yesterday's 38 per cent rise in net profits for the six months to December underlines just how far things have changed. Having got into a fix because huge capital spending coincided with declining cash flows, the company's financial position is gradually improving through cost cutting and asset sales, such as the timely Pacific Magazines deal. The interest bill fell Dollars 100m at the half way stage. News Corp's outstanding debt is still vast, but the pressure to sell good assets in depressed markets is off. Having recovered from their low of under ADollars 3 early last year the shares were trading in London yesterday at ADollars 16.50. Their future strength will depend on the speed of any recovery in the company's three main territories, and by the prospects for BSkyB. Yesterday's confirmation that the satellite TV station will be in the black next month is encouraging news, and will no doubt be accompanied by a fanfare of publicity. That alone is reason to hold on to the shares for a while longer.</p>

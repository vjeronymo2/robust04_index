			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Uzbekistan courts 'His Majesty the som': Tashkent tries to inflate respect for its new currency, but many fear its glitter will not last The conservative government of Uzbekistan yesterday introduced a new currency, the som, without international backing, to the alarm of the few western traders still toughing it out in Tashkent. Nor are they the only ones worried by the move, decreed by Mr Islam Karimov, the Uzbekistan president. Since the announcement the black market rate of the interim currency, the coupon, has fallen by 33 per cent. Western traders suggest that even the government is uncertain about the new currency launch. They point to an unusual government tender planned next month in Tashkent, in which residential properties will be sold exclusively for dollars. 'It shows that someone in government doesn't believe the som is going to remain convertible for very long,' a senior western business consultant in Tashkent said. In a public relations drive that reflects the lack of any substantial under-pinning of the new currency, the state media have tried to inflate respect for the som by referring to it as 'His Majesty the som'. But the International Monetary Fund has halted talks on currency support, since Mr Karimov refused to set the stage for the som by first altering economic policies that have fuelled a 1,500 per cent annual inflation rate. Uzbekistan left the rouble zone eight months ago. In April, the government initiated talks with the IMF, which had already awarded support programmes to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. But IMF officials decided Mr Karimov was not prepared to shift his economic policies sufficiently to sustain long-term currency stability. 'The government thinks it can avoid strict fiscal and monetary policy,' said a western economist in Tashkent, 'but this is impossible.' Lacking IMF support, the government is backing the som with Dollars 700m (Pounds 466m) in cash and an undisclosed quantity of gold. The som will circulate at an initial rate of six to the dollar; the government will exchange the new currency without restriction at a rate of one som to 1,000 coupons. During the one-month phase-in, the coupon will be honoured alongside the som. At current exchange rates, the som will be worth almost seven times the value of the coupon, a level western analysts say is almost sure to decline sharply and quickly. They believe Mr Karimov will continue to try to dictate the value of Uzbekistan's currency, though with just Dollars 700m in reserves he will not manage to intervene in support of the new som for long. Mr Karimov has attempted, at least at first, to restrain expected devaluation by restricting the circulation of the new currency in its initial month of circulation. Uzbekistanis will be required to deposit their coupons in state banks but will not be permitted for a month to exchange them for the new currency, thus restricting circulation to the current month's state salaries. The currency's introduction mirrors Mr Karimov's administration of Uzbekistan's economy as a whole since independence came with the Soviet collapse 30 months ago. On paper, the republic has tantalised western investors, if a bit less than its richer central Asian neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. During the Soviet period, Uzbekistan served mainly as a cotton bin, growing most of the Soviet crop and becoming the world's fourth largest producer. Uzbekistan also produced 60 tonnes of gold a year, and in 1993 extracted 45bn cubic metres of natural gas. About 4m tonnes of oil were produced last year, and recent discoveries make this figure likely to rise. Trouble has come because Mr Karimov has expended enormous efforts trying to conserve the Soviet system that put him in power during the Gorbachev era. For example, state enterprises still thrive by borrowing money from the government at a significant negative interest rate, since Mr Karimov is keen to avoid causing unemployment. He has rejected western advice that, with a spiralling 3.5 per cent birth rate and half the population of 21m below the age of 19, Uzbekistan should move quickly with a reform package of subsidy reduction and industrial restructuring. One of Mr Karimov's tendencies has been wholeheartedly to support market reform and western investment (in January he unveiled a well received reformist programme) as long as it does not disturb anything. Thus, his policies have produced only a slight crack in the door through which just a few investors have managed to pass. Notable among these are Daewoo, Mercedes-Benz and Newmont Mining. This week, as well, BAT Industries is to sign a Dollars 190m deal to develop Uzbekistan's domestic and export market for cigarettes. Analysts say that Mr Karimov's tight economic grip has also been the main problem with Uzbekistan's disastrous monetary policy but that he is unlikely to lighten up soon. One western business consultant in Taskhent said: 'We hear all the time here: 'Before you move into your new house you don't destroy your old one.' Karimov is just going to be very cautious.'</p>

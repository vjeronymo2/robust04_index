			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Two more Blue Arrow trials sought: Serious Fraud Office intends to prosecute four remaining defendants THE Serious Fraud Office intends to mount two further trials against the four remaining defendants in the Blue Arrow scandal, it emerged yesterday. No formal announcement has yet been made by the SFO. However, it is clear that in spite of the mixed result of the first trial, the SFO intends to proceed against all four individuals still charged with conspiracy to defraud the markets over the result of the 1987 rights issue. At a court hearing to be held on April 6, the SFO will ask the judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, to split the proceedings and hold two trials. If he agrees, the first trial is expected to be against Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Timothy Brown. Both men were equity sales directors for UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and were present at the crucial meeting on September 28 1987 when the advisers to the issue agreed to buy their secret holdings in Blue Arrow. Both men are still employed by P&amp;D although neither has been involved in the conduct of investment work since the publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report on the rights issue in 1989. The second trial is expected to be against Mr Charles Villiers, the former chairman of County NatWest, and Ms Elizabeth Brimelow, the merchant bank's former compliance director. Although both are still charged with conspiracy to defraud, some close to the trial believe the charges against Mr Villiers and Ms Brimelow could be altered following the outcome of the first trial. Before delivering his summing up in the first trial which ended last month, Mr Justice McKinnon dramatically cut the indictment and told the jury to consider only the late buying of shares on the night of September 28. Neither Mr Villiers nor Ms Brimelow was present at the meeting when the decision was taken to buy shares late to increase the take-up level presented to other investors from 38 per cent to 49 per cent. The court hearing on April 6 will also consider the timetabling of future proceedings. The first Blue Arrow trial - which resulted in the conviction of only four of the original 10 defendants - prompted widespread criticism for its length. Mr Justice McKinnon himself said it had imposed an unacceptable burden on all concerned. Those close to the case agree that further trials would be considerably shorter than Blue Arrow One which lasted a year and four days.</p>

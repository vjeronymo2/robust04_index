			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  2 MORE CITIES BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> The cities of Carson and Lynwood became the third and fourth municipalities in  Los Angeles County to outlaw semi-automatic "assault weapons," including the  AK-47 assault rifle that was used to kill five schoolchildren and injure more  than two dozen others in Stockton last month.  </P> <P> The weapons -- which allow a gunman to shoot dozens of bullets rapidly without  reloading -- have become increasingly popular among gangs in the southern part  of Los Angeles County, according to police, and have been banned in Los Angeles  and Compton.  </P> <P> The Carson ban, which was passed on an emergency basis Wednesday, received  unanimous support from the five-member council. Councilwoman Vera Robles  DeWitt, who proposed the ban, said a request by the city for gun shop owners to  stop selling the rapid-firing weapons had failed to win support from all the  city's gun shops.  </P> <P> The ordinance makes it a misdemeanor to sell or possess semiautomatic rifles  that accept a magazine of 20 rounds or more. The ban also includes sawed-off  shotguns that can fire more than six rounds without reloading.  </P> <P> The Lynwood city council passed unanimously Thursday night what Mayor Evelyn  Wells called a "preventive measure."  </P> <P> There was no debate, and no one in the sparse audience spoke for or against the  measure, which became effective immediately.  </P> <P> Copies of the ordinance, based on the one recently passed by the Los Angeles  City Council, were to be sent to surrounding cities and to the Legislature with  the urging that they pass similar measures. Penalties are six months in jail  and a $1,000 fine.  </P></p>

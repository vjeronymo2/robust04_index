			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UN 'ready to play role in Bosnia' THE United Nations yesterday cautiously agreed to extend its involvement in the Balkans to Bosnia-Herzegovina, reflecting the growing threat to local and European security posed by the former Yugoslav republic. 'The United Nations is ready to play a role in Bosnia on condition that it has the resources,' said Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali after talks in Paris with President Francois Mitterrand. Bosnia's foreign minister yesterday strongly urged the despatch of peacekeeping troops to Bosnia as fighting erupted in several towns. Mr Haris Siladjzic, who is temporarily heading the Moslem delegation to the EC-sponsored peace talks in Lisbon, said financial considerations should not be allowed to delay the sending of UN troops. Qualified support also came from Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serb community, and from Mr Mate Boban, deputy leader of the Croat minority. Bosnian peace talks scheduled to get under way in Lisbon yesterday were delayed by the late arrival of the republic's president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic.</p>

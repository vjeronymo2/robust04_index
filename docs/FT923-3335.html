			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Murdoch plans to raise Dollars 690m from global share offering NEWS CORPORATION, the media empire of Mr Rupert Murdoch which was almost overwhelmed by its bank debts two years ago, last night signalled another milestone in its return to financial health by announcing a global share offering likely to raise some Dollars 690m (Pounds 350m) before fees. The Australian-based company also confirmed reports that it plans to cut its bank debt through a Dollars 1bn issue of senior debt securities in the US market. Mr Murdoch said he hoped the twin fundraisings would go 'a long way towards accomplishing our pre-eminent goal, which is to achieve an investment grade rating'. The company's debt is currently rated several notches below investment grade by the agencies Moody's and Standard and Poor's. After growing rapidly by acquisitions and new television ventures during the 1980s, News Corporation found itself tipped into financial crisis by its Dollars 7.6bn of borrowings in late 1990 and underwent a long and painful debt renegotiation with nearly 150 banks. The equity offering, which follows one in December last year which raised Dollars 404m, involves the issue of 40m ordinary shares, including 18m to be offered in the US and Canada in the form of American Depositary Shares. About 13m will be aimed at the Australian market, 5m at the UK and 4m at the rest of the world. Merrill Lynch, the New York securities house, will act as global co-ordinator. News Corporation said it intended to use the entire proceeds of the two debt and equity offerings to repay bank debt. It noted that in the fiscal year to June it raised Dollars 1.8bn from asset sales and public and private debt offerings as part of its debt reduction strategy. Mr Murdoch said that the proceeds of the offers would satisfy most of the company's debt amortisation due in February 1994 and the balance would be satisfied from operating cash flow.</p>

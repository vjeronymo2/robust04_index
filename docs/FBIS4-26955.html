			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Short commentary" by XINHUA reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 </F> 3057 1696): "The North Must Not Ignore Anti-Flood Preparations  While Combating Serious Droughts"]    [Text] Beijing, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- In addition to doing all  it can in combating drought and executing the three summer jobs  [planting, harvesting, and field management], experts have  pointed out that north China must also pay close attention to  keeping flood-control projects in good repair and implementing  various antiflood measures. They must, in particular, rush  repairs of unsafe sections and remove obstacles in river  courses. Experience tells us that if we make full use of every  minute now, we will be able to achieve maximum results with  little efforts.    Experience also tells us that localities that have done a  good job in building water control projects are better prepared  to prevent and combat floods, and they are in a better position  to minimize losses of life and property.    Currently, combating drought is an urgent task in the north.  They must, however, prepare against the possibility that "a  serious drought suddenly turns into a big flood." Experts noted  that late July and early August are the peak days of the flood  season. Harder days still lie ahead insofar as prevention is  concerned, and localities in the north should conduct a review  of their flood prevention efforts. As the rainy season has  begun gradually moving northward from the Zhu Jiang valley, a  countdown has started for the north in terms of the time it has  to make preparations; they must make every minute count.    There are such major rivers as the Huai He, Huang He, Hai  He,  Liao He, and Songhua Jiang and countless smaller streams and  tributaries north of the Chang Jiang. Government at all levels  must maintain high vigilance.    There have been reports that the north will experience  heavier rainfall during this year's flood season. Localities in  the north should make early preparations and see to it that  adequate attention is paid both to combating drought and  preventing floods.</p>

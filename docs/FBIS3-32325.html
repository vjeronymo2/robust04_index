			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some senators from the Alliance for Parliamentary  Cohesion interpreted the meeting between U.S. Ambassador Swing  and Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis as a threat against  national sovereignty. Thomas Eddy Dupiton is demanding the  discharge of President Firmin Jean-Louis, whom he accuses of  being an agent of the international community:    [Begin recording, in Creole] We see that Firmin Jean-Louis,  as I told you yesterday, is at the service of the international  [community]. They had to come and give him instructions. But the  instructions that he receives -- it is not the Senate of the  Republic that would execute them. Those are instructions for  Firmin and all the hired hands of his ilk. What do you see  happening today? Firmin is taking orders from foreigners. He has  blocked the Senate of the Republic since he ratified Malval.    When Firmin has the entire international [community] behind  him, the office that the country would have supported -- that  all men of good faith would have supported -- this office would  be accepted and would be imposed on those who still stand up in  this country, those who do not crawl and who do not take their  orders from foreigners. [end recording]    These statements were made on 3 February by Senator Thomas  Eddy Dupiton in reaction to the visit of U.S. Ambassador William  L. Swing to the Senate of the Republic.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Polluted land register in doubt THE government is seriously considering scrapping proposals for a register of contaminated land after criticism that it could blight property values across industrialised parts of England and Wales. The proposals have been one of the most bitterly contested parts of the government's environment policy. There have been claims that the register would depress property values, trigger a flood of legal claims and set back efforts to regenerate derelict land. There have been protests about the inclusion of all land which had been used by specified types of industry, regardless of whether the land had actually been polluted. Earlier this month an advisory committee of prominent business people warned the government that banks were increasingly worried about taking land as security for loans in case they became liable for the cleaning-up costs. An announcement on revised proposals is expected in two weeks. Ministers are understood to favour a register based on planning applications.</p>

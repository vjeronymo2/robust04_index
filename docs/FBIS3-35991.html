He arrived here to attend a  three-sided forum, opening on Tuesday, of representatives from  Russia, the United States and Japan on security in the northern  Pacific.    Nikolayev said he brought the video film to Tokyo and is  prepared to show it to Japanese experts if they would wish so.    On Monday a spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency  (MSA) told ITAR-TASS that the agency "did not put on record"  massive intrusions by Japanese fishing boats into Russian  territorial waters on January 21-22, which had been the subject  of a Russian Foreign Ministry representation made to Tokyo.    In view of this, the MSA, which partially performs the  functions of frontier units, dropped the inquiry into whether  Japanese boats crossed the state border of the Russian  Federation.    It has become known from informed sources that last year  Russian border guards recorded about 7,000 transgressions of the  border by Japanese fishing boats. Practically no transgressors  were apprehended to avoid a conflict with the neighbouring state.</p>

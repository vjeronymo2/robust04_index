			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / NY subway bombing charges Edward Leary, critically injured by a firebomb that shot flames through a crowded subway car on Wednesday, wounded 45 people and threw lower Manhattan into chaos, was arrested in his hospital bed yesterday and charged with attempted murder and assault. Officials said extortion might have been the motive. The accused man is a 49-year-old unemployed computer operator. The bomb went off in his hands and bomb-making materials were found in his home, Police Commissioner William Bratton said. He declined to give further details but said the extortion might have been aimed at the Transit Authority, which operates the subway system.</p>

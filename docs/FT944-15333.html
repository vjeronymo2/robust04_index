			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Ex-WDA chief issues statement Dr Gwyn Jones, the BBC governor for Wales, has not previously responded to criticism of his WDA chairmanship, from which he resigned in June last year. He issued a statement this week: 'During my five years as chairman, the agency more than doubled the rate of inward investment projects going into Wales. Capital investment was more than trebled and small businesses to support the large inward investment projects grew considerably. 'This provided tens of thousands of new direct and indirect jobs and reduced the unemployment level in Wales to below the national average for the first time since before the war. 'I was recruited to do a specific job - to increase inward investment and to make the agency itself more efficient - and it is, therefore, important to judge the whole effort of the five-year period on the basis of the tasks originally set against what was achieved.'</p>

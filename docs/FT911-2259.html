			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Polly Peck's bank creditors jostle for committee places BANK CREDITORS of Polly Peck International, the fresh fruit to electronics group which has been in administration since last October, are jostling for scarce places on the formal creditors' committee to be set up later this month. Under the terms the Insolvency Act the committee, to be appointed at a creditors' meeting on May 24, can consist of no more than five members. So, with about 100 bank creditors, and 28,000 creditors in all, competition for a seat is believed to be intense. A place on the committee will give a bank power to influence the detailed restructuring proposals being drawn up by the group's three administrators, from Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Touche Ross. Those said to be in the best position to win a seat on the committee are banks which, though not large creditors in their own right, lead banking syndicates and so can count on the support of other banks within these groupings. They include Credit Suisse First Boston, Hungarian International Bank and Mizrahi Bank. Warburg Soditic, the Swiss arm of Warburg, which led several Swiss franc bond issues for Polly Peck, is also likely to have the backing of enough creditors to secure a place. That leaves only one seat for other bank creditors. Standard Chartered, one of the largest creditors, is known to want a place, but other banks are likely to be competing as well. To appease creditors, Mr Michael Jordan, one of the administrators from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has proposed to give a further ten institutions a say through an additional, informal committee. But under law these institutions could have no vote and therefore no direct say in the progress of the administration. Most of the ten informal committee places will go to banks, but some are being reserved for Polly Peck's trade creditors and shareholders. Competition between banks to get on to the formal, five-member committee is likely to present a problem for the administrators at the creditors' meeting, to be held at Alexandra Palace in north London. Under law, a creditor can only be appointed to the committee if it gets the support of other creditors who speak for at least 50 per cent of the company's debts. It is thought likely that, with banks competing for a place, the vote will be split and few if any will achieve the necessary 50 per cent level. A broad outline of the Polly Peck administrators' restructuring proposals is due to be sent to all creditors on May 7, to be voted on at the May 24 meeting. The documents are expected to contain some detail on the financial state of the group, but little new information on the state of its finances in northern Cyprus, where administrators have been trying to track down Pounds 200m.</p>

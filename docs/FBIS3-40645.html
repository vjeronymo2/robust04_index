			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Murli Manohar Joshi: "We Will Have To Fight </F> To Keep Our Economic Sovereignty"]    [Text] Adopting the Dunkel proposals with regard to  agriculture and food products is going to prove harmful to us.  Its direct effect will be on our self-preservation. First, we  will be compelled to meet 2 to 3.3 percent of our domestic  demand for food through imports. Food products including fish,  meat, dairy and poultry are subject to these clauses. Grants on  food products will have to be reduced. At first, it will be  reduced by 20 percent. Consider the fact that Japan gives 700  percent grants. Even after giving a cut of 20 percent, 680  percent remains.The U.S. and European nations also give some 300  percent grants. In general, it is common to see various types of  agricultural grants ranging from 60 percent to 150 percent. A 20  percent reduction in it is really not much. We have only 6  percent in grants. Further reduction would prove fatal to the  farmer. Our commerce minister claims, since we have foreign  exchange deficits, the Dunkel clauses will not apply to us,  whereas the finance minister says that he has managed to get rid  of the deficits. Now, we don't know who is telling the truth and  who is not. The fact is though, that whether we are having  deficits or not will be determined by GATT, depending on what  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have to say,  not what our own commerce, or finance minister says, and we will  have to abide by that.    Cutting agricultural grants will result in fertilizer-price  increases. Fertilizer consumption will decrease, and we have  sown such seeds that, with the dearth of fertilizers, food  production will also decrease. To improve production, the demand  for certain imported fertilizers, will go up. They sell for less  than the local fertilizers, since tariffs have been relaxed.  this will cause the indigenous fertilizer factories to shut  down. Asia's biggest fertilizer plant will close down with  heavy losses, and 20 smaller ones will also shut down.  Approximately 12 to 15 thousand laborers will become unemployed.  As our fertilizer production closes, foreign manufacturers will  start quoting prices as they please, and everyone knows what can  happen. Then we will have to import food grains. The commerce  minister says that it will not exceed 3.3 percent of our needs.  But he is forgetting that if imports exceed 3.3 percent, then it  will be hard to control it. The new proposals state that if food  imports should exceed 3.3 percent, then the duty may be  increased, and that too not more than 30 percent. Why doesn't  he tell the nation like it is? Our food consumption includes  defense needs. We had better decide also how much of a store we  have in this area. This is a risky business. Our enemy can  always take advantage of this. We should not forget that when we  were fighting a war with Pakistan, the U.S. was sending us  essential supplies on a weekly basis, and we had to stop  ourselves when we had almost finished our business. We have  attained self-sufficiency with great difficulty and now, the new  proposal is going to ruin our farmers. The government will no  longer determine grain prices, and the small farmer will be  compelled to compete with dynamic pricing during harvest. It is  possible that the foreign companies involved in food trade will  fill their coffers at such time. With their affluence, they  will buy out all available grains, export massively while the  Indian market will be rendered uncompetitive, and our grain  production will decidedly suffer. In this buy-sell, export  scenario, there will be nothing for the Indian farmer. He will  remain poor. Thus there is no profit in sight for the Indian  farmer. It is also not clear how the country benefits. The  commerce minister does not tire of saying that adopting Dunkel  proposals will increase export opportunities for Indian  agriculture, but he is forgetting that no country is going to  want to import any thing before the quality and purity of our  products are put through exacting standards. Many times  already, Indian goods could not be exported because of not  meeting international standards.    Intellectual property rights issue will seriously influence  agriculture, animal husbandry, and the pharmaceutical industry.  Now even seeds, and other areas of national interest in  agriculture are laid utterly open for multinational firms to  enter into. These companies will use their affluence and  advertising to sell their seeds to our farmers. We have not  forgotten the East India Company days. Paddy and wheat fields  all through Bengal and Bihar had been converted to indigo  fields, and slowly we grew deficient in food. There is also the  risk that our eating habits may have to be modified. Once a  farmer buys the seeds of these companies, he will got caught in  their evil web. Because they hold the patents, even the seeds  obtained from farming may remain their property. Because of  TRIPS [Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights],  we will have to amend and abide by our patent laws, but the  price of drugs is certain to climb unrestrained. TRIPS will also  end mandatory licensing and technology transfer will become  impossible. Since it becomes possible to patent production, and  in a way imports are being considered patented things,  manufacturing foreign drugs locally will also have to come to an  end. It is only natural that they will start selling at the  import price, which will be the price of the producer. For  example, four tablets (500mg each) of cifrolfoxesin sells in  India for Rs.43.50, in the U.S., for Rs.300, in Pakistan for  Rs.302.75, and in England for Rs.363.60. The price of 10 tablets  (400mg each) of norfloxecin is Rs.33.61, in India, whereas in  the U.S. it costs the equivalent of Rs.613.77. Similarly, 40  tablets of famatidine costs Rs.26.24 in India, and in the U.S.,  the same costs Rs.511.78. Cancer drugs, and drugs for heart  disease which get manufactured in foreign countries, will sell  in India for the equivalent of their price. The removal of  mandatory licensing and relaxing of import restrictions are  going to result in drug manufacturers not worrying to sell for  lesser price in India. Manufacturing patents will also restrict  the methods of production, even if we should be able to produce  drugs locally. Indian industry will suffer thus. Our health and  welfare program will remain so only on paper. In the event of a  ten-twenty fold increase in life-saving drugs, who will be able  to procure medicines for supplying to government hospitals?  Even as it is, we are unable to give free medicines in our  public hospitals, and with these developments, it is going to  become difficult to even run these hospitals.    The effects of TRIPS won't stop with just seeds, or drugs.  It  will affect our whole scientific research and industry. Our  space and atomic programs, as well as our laboratory experiments  will be affected. The genetic, and biochemical research  projects will suffer. India will fall back in scientific  achievements. In the area of public service, foreign banks have  already infiltrated to quite an extent. Most of our businessmen  prefer to keep their wealth in foreign banks. If allowed to  enter the life-insurance scene, these foreign financial  institutions have the opportunity to walk away with huge amounts  of money. Since there is no mandatory seniority requirements  anymore, such an entry will affect our developmental programs.  Our backward areas will suffer even more.    By accepting intellectual property revisions, we will also  have to overhaul our existing patent laws. This is an attack on  constitutional sovereignty. The Constitution recognizes our  right to make indigenous laws, but now we will have to adopt  them to fit those laws made under GATT. What will happen then  to our parliament and assemblies? The whole responsibility for  agriculture, and pharmaceuticals rest with state governments in  our country. But the right to revise many of their laws has now  been given to GATT. This is an impingement of the basic rights  of Indian citizens to food, livelihood, health, autonomy, and  democracy. Signing this agreement amounts to ignoring the  treaty-precedents of our country, which is the backbone of our  Constitution.    This international agreement has far reaching implications,  and the effects are not yet completely known. It will impact  such rudimentary things as our culture, consumption, and habits.  It will affect our politics, and our security. So, the  significant question here is whether in signing such an  agreement, only the executive branch of the government should be  involved, or the approval of the Parliament and people also  sought? Can the government be given the license to meddle with  the very basic character of the nation? According to the Indian  Constitution, some powers are veted with the state governments,  and only they can make decisions with regard to these matters.  Now may the central government take decisions in such matters  without concurring with these state governments? Whatever rights  have already been given to state governments through the second  and third articles of the Constitution, may the central  government now snatch them away, and give them to an  international entity, without verifying the Constitutional  provisions? Will article 253 of the Constitution provide  extensive answers for these nagging questions? Do the citizens  of India have the basic right to food, livelihood, and health,  or not? Many constitutional questions like these will arise,  and they will need to be answered satisfactorily. It is even  more important to find out which is more important, the  government, or the nation? Does the government have the license  to work against the country's interests? The truth is that  adopting such harmful proposals as Dunkel's can never be said to  be in the nation's interest. Does any government have the  license to let its country's future be taken hostage like this?  It should be realized that in the GATT talks, and in the Dunkel  proposals, the jargon mentions "contracting parties," not  "people."    In the new GATT, Indian national interest has been greatly  compromised. Throwing in the scare of seclusion, the central  government wants to convince the nation of economic benefits,  but it has only benefitted the already rich nations in opening  up Indian market with the greatest ease to their goods, and in  making India a showroom for multinational companies. In  textiles, which was our greatest export product, we have not  been able to get any significant breaks. Quotas still exist, and  the European Community has only said that in ten years, they  will open up for Indian exports. But it is not clear what  percentage of their textile-market will be opened to us. If we  are unable to bring things under control in textiles, we may  face the unemployment of multitudes of workers.    The Indian government did not show firmness in these  negotiations. They behaved like a `banana' republic, whose spine  broke in just one blow. It threw down its arms in front of the  utmost stringent international financial establishment. It was  completely missed that being left out of certain things is not  in itself a mistake or degradation. Since we would not sign the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have been left out of space  programs. But, these are the only two areas, where we have  developed indigenous technology significantly. We must not  forget that India's population is considerably larger than that  of the G-7 countries together. We are a market in ourselves  because of our huge population, natural resources, capable  engineers, and scientists. There is a tradition here that  started in ancient times predating Koutilya [eminent economist  of antiquity], and we have held our place in international  trade. The potent truth that this country could become an  economic stalwart once again, has been ignored. The country  should be equipped to fight to win in the battle of economic  independence. The political parties that realize this truth must  cast aside their minor differences and join hands towards this  major common cause.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KVB/MPK: "Lubbers: Paris Prefers Dehaene </F> To Succeed Delors"]    [Text] Paris/The Hague, 14 June (BELGA/ANP) -- "Paris has a  slight preference for Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to  succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the European Commission  (EC)," Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers stated on Tuesday  [14 June] evening.    "French President Mitterrand is seeking a consensus; if  there  is not a consensus for Mr. Dehaene, then it could be someone  else," Mr. Lubbers affirmed. "My candidacy does not pose any  problems for President Mitterrand," he added following an  hour-long meeting with President Mitterrand at the Elysee.    The head of the Netherlands Government nevertheless  described  his meeting with President Mitterrand as "good." Last week Mr.  Lubbers met with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. "This  time, we discussed matters in more detail," Mr. Lubbers added.    Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos and Mr. Papandreou,  Greek state secretary for foreign affairs, are to visit The  Hague on Tuesday evening. They are due to meet with Mr. Lubbers  and Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans.    The issue of Mr. Jacques Delors' successor as EC president  is  to be discussed at these meetings. The visit is a routine visit  which the Greek presidency of the European Union (EU) is making  to all EU member states to prepare for the Corfu Summit next 24  and 25 June.</p>

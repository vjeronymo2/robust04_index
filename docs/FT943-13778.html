			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: HK company reverses into Beverley The Hong Kong-based Far East Consortium International is set to gain a control of Beverley Group, the engineering concern previously known as Petrocon, in a deal that will give it a stake of more than 70 per cent in Beverley. FEC is to sell its Vicco Development subsidiary to Beverley for about Pounds 9m to be satisfied by the issue of new shares. The Takeover Panel has waived the requirement for FEC to make a full offer Vicco's principle asset is a 51 per cent holding in Guangzhou Pegasus, a company based in China which is engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of boilers for the Chinese market. Mr Colin Robinson, chairman of Beverley, acknowledged that FEC was to gain control of the company but said its present management would remain in place. 'This gives us an enormous opportunity for entry into the Chinese market.' News of the takeover came as the group's report and accounts for the year to December 1993 were qualified by itsauditors before being posted to shareholders at the weekend. Solomon Hare, the auditors, said the group had been 'unable to provide confirmation that it will have sufficient facilities to cover future working capital'. However, Mr Robinson said, the deal with FEC would 'sort that out'. Beverley last month reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.67m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan interest in  visiting Mainland China substantially cooled in February and is  expected to remain low in the wake of the March 31 robbery and  murder of 24 Taiwan tourists while on a pleasure cruise of  Qiandao Lake, the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)  said Thursday [21 April].    Council statistics show that the number of Taiwan residents  who applied for a "Taiwan Compatriot Certificate" to enter the  mainland totaled 80,000 in February, down 31.62 percent from the  year-earlier level.    MAC officials said that Taiwan residents have made more than  6.12 million visits to the mainland since a Taiwan Government  ban was lifted in November 1987.    People here were prohibited from visiting the mainland since  the Kuomintang Government moved to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a  civil war to the Chinese Communists.    Currently, Taiwan residents must apply to mainland  authorities in Hong Kong for the certificate to enter the  mainland.    The officials noted that mainland travel is expected to  remain lackluster as Taiwan residents have been enraged by  Beijing's callous handling of the Qiandao Lake murders and the  local tourist industry has launched a drive to boycott tours to  the mainland.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER THE CHURCH AND CELIBACY  </P> <P> For 35 years I have taught in Catholic schools, and I have worked closely with  the clergy.  </P> <P> Celibacy does not mean isolation. Priests are fully aware of the many struggles  in family lives, traumas among the secular and their own personal sacrifices.  </P> <P> Who was with me in intensive care unit, buried my parents, married my son and  recently buried my oldest child? A priest!  </P> <P> We would be honored to set his place at our table and dine on Christmas or any  day that another family isn't in need.  </P> <P> Do not stereotype the lonely ones who may prefer to isolate themselves on the  few occasions they have. Even Christmas.  </P> <P> MARY HELEN CHAMBERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

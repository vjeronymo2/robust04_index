			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHEAST SOAKED BY SEVERE STORMS  </P> <P> Thunderstorms and at least one tornado raked the Southeast on Friday as  unseasonable heat lingered in the East, but blowing and drifting snow reminded  residents of the upper Midwest and Plains that winter has not bowed out yet.  </P> <P> Storms in the western Florida Panhandle unleashed up to 6 inches of rain in  four hours and flooded a portion of Interstate 10 near Alabama up to car-bumper  depth.  </P> <P> A tornado uprooted trees northwest of Pensacola, Fla., while high winds  sweeping northern Pensacola damaged an apartment complex. Dozens of roads and  streets in the area were closed or flooded.  </P> <P> Flooded-out roads also were reported in northwestern Georgia, the National  Weather Service said. Mobile, Ala., was hit with nearly 11 inches of rain  between noon Thursday and mid-Friday, while Montgomery, Ala., recorded 8 1/2  inches.  </P> <P> High winds made for hazardous driving in northeastern North Dakota and  west-central and northwestern Minnesota, stirring up the 8 to 12 inches of  snow. Gusts to 62 m.p.h. blew through Nebraska and South Dakota, and several  highways in southeastern Wyoming were closed because of drifting snow.  </P></p>

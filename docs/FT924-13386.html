			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Greenwich Resources wins Greek deal Greenwich Resources, the UK mining company, hopes to become the first new gold producer in Europe for many years via a project in Greece for which it has won the financial and technical backing of Newcrest Mining, Australia's biggest gold producer, writes Kenneth Gooding. Greenwich has been awarded the Konos mining lease, which covers about 22 sq km between the towns of Komotini and Alexandroupolis in north-east Greece, and, according to the company, contains an important gold discovery. Mr David Quick, managing director, said a Drachma 1bn (Pounds 3m) three-year exploration programme had been submitted as part of the tender, but spending could stop at any time and the lease forfeited. Newcrest would be responsible for expenditure in the first 10 months, in exchange for a 51 per cent stake.</p>

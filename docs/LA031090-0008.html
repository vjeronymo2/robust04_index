			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHING STUDENTS BETTER LESSONS  </P> <P> Anyone looking for no-cost, low-tech, frills-free and, most of all, effective  ways to make education better would do well to consider a new Harvard  University study on how students learn.  </P> <P> The three-year study found that modest changes in teaching and studying methods  can produce real improvements in learning. For example, students who are asked  at the end of each class to write a one-minute paper on "the big point you  learned today" and "the main unanswered question you still have" benefit from  having to think about the course's central themes and organize their thoughts.  Teachers benefit, too, from the feedback on how their ideas are getting across.  </P> <P> The study further found that students learned the most when they were given  periodic quizzes and regularly required to write reports and make oral  presentations. They learned more when given the chance to rewrite a term paper  after a teacher had read and commented on it, and found that taking part in  outside study groups of up to six people was a more effective way to learn than  hitting the books in lonely isolation.  </P> <P> Such ideas are anything but new. Frequent tests to measure progress in, say,  math and foreign-language classes are a staple of teaching. And many teachers  demand frequent written reports and quizzes. But what's particularly intriguing  about the Harvard study is that its findings have a relevance that clearly  extends beyond higher education: The approaches in teaching and studying that  the report describes can be applied through most of the school years. Best of  all, in this age of tight budgets, here are some ideas to improve learning and  teaching skills that don't require new schools or classrooms, expensive new  laboratories or special equipment, or bigger staffs.  </P> <P> What's needed, on the part of students and teachers alike, is a commitment to  work a little harder each week. If the Harvard study is right, the payoff could  be considerable.  </P></p>

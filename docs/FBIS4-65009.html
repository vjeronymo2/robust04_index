			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Hilde Harbo report: "Hagen Just As Uncompromising"] </F>   [Text] Party chairman Carl I. Hagen is showing no  inclination toward reconciliation and sees no need for the  clarification the Progress Party Youth [FrPU] is asking for.  This could lead to mass resignations from the party or a  further escalation of the conflict between the mother party and  its youth organization.    Yesterday the FrPU held a national executive meeting to  discuss its turbulent relationship with its mother party. The  meeting did not reach any final conclusions, but it did decide  to call an extraordinary national conference before 3 July. In  a resolution the FrPU asked the party chairman to clarify  whether he adheres to statements that the FrPU and leading  officials in the FrPU are not wanted in the Progress Party [FrP]  movement. The resolution states that Carl I. Hagen and the  majority in the party must assume the responsibility for the  growing number of resignations in the youth movement. The  resolution was adopted by 26 votes against the single vote of  Ulf Leirstein of Ostfold FrPU.    "The minority in the FrP are dissatisfied with the way in  which we are being treated by the majority. The only thing we  want is to be given a little more respect and space, especially  on questions of values. Hagen has made remarks about us that  are less than pleasant, and has hinted that he wants us out of  the party. Now we want an answer from him about whether we can  continue to work as a radical youth party in line with our  political manifesto or whether we are to be subjected to total  and slavish discipline," FrPU chairman Lars Erik Gronntun said  after yesterday's national executive meeting.    He will use the time up to the national conference to  clarify  his future role in the party, and he rejected the suggestion  that participation in the formation of a new party is on the  agenda as far as he is concerned. At the same time he confirmed  that Hagen's response to the youth organization will be  important for the outcome of the extraordinary national  conference.    Several centrally placed officials in the FrPU are now  looking at their links with the party, but the national  executive adopted a resolution yesterday urging all its members  to stay on in their posts in the FrP and the FrPU and wait for  the outcome of the extraordinary national conference. Gronntun  confirmed that there are divergent views in the youth  organization about whether or not there is any point in staying.    Party chairman Carl I. Hagen was unwilling yesterday to  offer  an outstretched hand to those in the FrPU who are frustrated.    "There is no need for the FrP to clarify anything at all.  This was something that happened at the national conference. It  is up to each individual member of the party to decide whether  he or she wants to continue to work on the basis of the  guidelines drawn up at the national conference. If anyone has  any doubts about what they want, they will have to start  behaving like adults and reach a decision. We have to put this  behind us now," Hagen said.    Do you think that it would be regrettable if many centrally  placed officials in the FrPU see no option other than to leave  the party after the national conference?    "I choose not to have any views on that," Hagen said. He  added that if the youth organization has anything to tell the  party, it should address itself to the central executive. He  merely notes the FrPU resolution, adding that there are many  youth organizations that adopt resolutions.    Terje Nyberget, who was the mother party's observer at the  national executive meeting, said yesterday that he will now  resign from his post as member of the FrP central executive. He  seemed somewhat disappointed that the youth organization had not  reached a final decision at yesterday's meeting and said that  personally he cannot wait any longer before reaching a decision  about what is happening. At the same time he praised the youth  organization and said that politically he feels much more at  home in it than in the FrP.    Nyberget was unwilling to comment on the question of  resigning from the party. But it is possible that after the  FrPU national conference he could become a member of the youth  party, because the national executive backed a proposal to end  the age limit for FrPU membership. This is a reaction to a  series of requests from FrP members who have passed the current  age limit of 30 but who nevertheless feel more in line with the  youth party.</p>

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (6): Prestige goes on the line - John Murray Brown on the army's role in political life When Necip Torumtay resigned at the height of the Gulf War as head of the Turkish armed forces in 1990, he issued a statement alluding obliquely to a 'matter of principle'. It was never clear what exactly the principle was. The Turkish press, nonetheless, applauded the general's action. A comparable incident, of a military chief walking out over a disagreement with an elected government, would be hard to find in most western democracies, except perhaps in France in the 1960s during the army's challenge to President de Gaulle over his Algerian policy. But Turkey is, of course, a little different. And its army has always enjoyed a special place as the self-appointed guardian of the country's democracy and its secular traditions. However, even here in a society which retains a deep affection for its soldiers, there are signs that things are changing. The process of transformation goes deeper than a simple internal debate about military strategy to cope with the post-cold war realities. It has an impact on doctrine, on the composition of the army and its equipment, and the role of the army in Turkish society. For the complex strands that make up modern Turkey, whether the growing Islamic consciousness, or the tension between modernism and tradition, almost certainly have their mirror image in the messrooms of Turkey's armed forces. Turkey has the second largest army in Nato, after the US. In all, the Turkish armed forces comprise 560,000 troops and the army can call on a further 1m reservists. The budget, agreed by parliament, was around Dollars 5.4bn in 1994, equivalent to 10.5 per cent of the national budget. There are a number of other sources, including money from the Defence Industry Support Fund and the Foreign Military Sales from the US. In addition, the Armed Forces Pension Fund (Oyak) has assets in a car assembler (together with Renault of France), in several cement companies and, most recently, a majority stake in an Istanbul trade finance bank. The restructuring of the armed forces' inventory has two elements - to upgrade the technology and to streamline sources of supplies. In line with this, the F-16 fighter aircraft assembler plant at Murted outside Ankara is being beefed up. The programme is winning support under the Dollars 4bn Gulf Defence Fund, set up under US sponsorship in the wake of Kuwait's liberation to utilise Saudi and other Arab finance to strengthen Turkey's defence industry. The need to beef up the fire power of Turkey's armed forces and enhance its mobility has been the subject of countless Nato studies. However the TV pictures of US smart technology deployed against Iraq shocked the military top brass, and highlighted the limitations of Turkey's armed forces and their reliance on out-of-date western hand-me-downs. The technological debate about hardware has given new impetus to those calling for the abandonment of conscription in place of a more professional corps. In Turkey military service has traditionally been a form of remedial education for many of those from poorer homes. It has also inculcated a sense of patriotism, and imbued generations of young Turks with the tenets of the social and political reforms instituted by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the republic. As Mehmet Ali Birand in his book, 'Shirts of Steel', makes clear, a stint of military service also does wonders for the calorie count of the average Turkish farmboy. There is, on one level, the tension between the goals of a conscript army and those of a professional corps. There is also the inevitable tension between 'laicism' and Islam. In this context, the army has refused to allow children from the Imam schools into military academies and continues to operate a fairly rigorous system of vetting to prevent the armed forces from being infected by Islamic extremism. More dramatically, there are telling signs that the army's appeal and its prestige may be waning. A few years ago, the idea that Turks would actively seek to get out of military service was unthinkable. Today draft dodging, US-style, is an increasingly common phenomenon, as people try to avoid being sent to the conflict in the south-east. Newspapers have taken a certain glee in exposing the fact that the current chief of staff's son is shirking military service. The army is not happy about it, of course. When Mehmet Ali Birand used the topic as a subject for his current affairs programme, 32nd Day, he was hauled before a military tribunal and two of his journalists were charged. The make-up of the regular Turkish army - the graduates from the military academies rather than the conscripts - is changing, too. The intake are no longer the products of the ruling elite as in Ottoman times. The social composition reflects the changes in society at large. Indeed, western defence experts believe the current class are more often the sons of non-commissioned officers rather than of generals and colonels. For many Turks, particularly from poorer backgrounds, an army career provides upward mobility and an escape from the backwardness of rural life. On the other hand, today's officers seem more ideologically hidebound to Kemalist ideas. Birand's book on the Turkish army points out that the Kemalist curricula actually increased sharply in response to the 1980 coup d'etat. Often, this has manifested itself as condescension towards the elected politicians, who are perceived as unreliable, inconsistent and too eager for popularity. There is also a feeling that national defence policy is too important to be left to the civilian politicians. Despite returning the country to democracy in 1983, the military is still at the centre of Turkish political life. The constitution gives the army extensive powers. The army chief is subservient only to the president. The defence minister has little sway. General Dogan Gures, Turkey's chief of staff, must be the nation's most photographed personality, usually captured standing alongside Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister. At the centre of the problem is the tension between an army which is militarily effective and one which is politically reliable. The history of the three military interventions between 1960 and 1980 gives the debate added poignancy.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / EC set to reclaim Klockner-Werke loan THE European Commission is poised to demand the full recovery of its DM175m (Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner-Werke, the German steel and engineering group which filed for protection from its creditors in December. The move, which is up for discussion at the full meeting of the EC executive tomorrow threatens to push the Klockner group into outright bankruptcy. Bankers to the group believe the EC's stance will lead to the unscrambling of a complicated debt restructuring deal under which the bulk of the group's creditors had agreed in principle to forgive DM1.4bn of the group's DM2.7bn debt. The restructuring plan was designed to guarantee survival of the group and prevent problems of the steel businesses - Klockner Stahl and Klockner Edelstahl - from dragging down Klockner's engineering subsidiaries. The non-steel companies employ 25,000 out of the group's 33,000 workforce and are not formally touched by the 'composition proceedings' which Klockner has launched under German insolvency law. But three large German banks warned in a letter to the commission yesterday that these jobs would be at risk if the the EC called in its loan. The EC, which granted the loan for investment purposes under the European coal and steel treaty, ranks among Klockner's biggest creditors. The biggest is Deutsche Bank, the group's house bank which is believed to be owed DM450m. Other leading creditors include the Westdeutsche Landesbank, state bank for North-Rhine Westphalia, believed to be owed DM255m; Dresdner Bank, with DM175m and the Bayerische Vereinsbank with DM150m. Hard-line EC commissioners, believed to be in a majority, are demanding that the Duisburg-based Klockner should not be given special treatment amid the crisis afflicting the EC steel industry. But bankers, including Mr Ulrich Cartellieri from the Deutsche Bank, said in their letter yesterday that the bankruptcy of the group would give the opportunity for rival steel manufacturers to buy Klockner's steel-works at knock-down prices, thereby contributing to the glut of steel capacity in the EC.</p>

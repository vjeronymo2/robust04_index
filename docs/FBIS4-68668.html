			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Chamal Mashevich Beslaneyev, </F> chairman of the governing board of the Kabardino-Balkaria  Republic Organization of the Agrarian Party of Russia and past  head of the Shalushkinskiy Sovkhoz, conducted by Z. Asin; date  and place not given]    [Text] The Kabardino-Balkaria Republic Organization  of the Agrarian Party of Russia (APR) was created at the  founding meeting in Nalchik recently. The party's Program and  Rules were approved and appropriate corrections to account for  the specifics of the region and the republic were made in these  documents. The party was registered on 25 March. The new party's  governing board was elected and its members included Z. Kh.  Balkizov, chairman of the Germenchik Kolkhoz, M. M. Klevtsov,  chairman of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] State Land  Committee, C. Z. Shavayev, his deputy, A. T. Kushkhov, the  minister of agriculture and food, Z. M. Taov, the head of the  Ministry of Agriculture and Food kolkhoz organizing department,  K. S. Kuchmenov, chairman of Agrosnab [Agricultural Supply  System], V. I. Punarzhi, chairman of the KBR Agrarian Union, and  Z. Kh. Shogenov, chairman of the Kolkhoz imeni Lenin in  Chegemskiy Rayon. Ch. M. Beslaneyev, who headed the  Shalushkinskiy Sovkhoz for the last several years, was elected  chairman of the governing board.    Our interview is about the motives for creating the new  party and its goals and tasks.    [Asin] Chamal Mashevich, the Agrarian Party headed by  Lapshin  is one of the most influential in Russia. As I understand it,  you are a part of the all-Russian party of agrarians. What are  the motives for creating this republic party?    [Beslaneyev] Yes, we are the republic, Kabardino-Balkaria  Organization of the APR.    As for the second part of the question, I will say right  away  that we do not intend to "plug" the gaps in the political vacuum  which once formed. It is now so overflowing with so many parties  and movements of the most varied persuasions and all colors of  the rainbow that not even a small niche left for another can be  found in that space. The people are confused not only about  their program documents but even their names. Fortunately, this  boom has not hit our republic so hard.    The essence of the motives. The economic, political, and  social standing of agriculture has been reduced to a critical  point. The state has not implemented the so-called shock therapy  as such in even one sector of the economy. If it were conducted  in a decisive, well-considered, and sober manner, the state and  the entire economy would have wakened and gotten going long ago.    In 1991 state social programs in rural areas were supported  with budget financing at a level of 22 percent for housing  construction, 31 percent for social-domestic objects, and 67  percent for roads. In 1992 less than half as much money was  directed to the social sphere as in 1991. This past year the  volume of capital investments in rural areas declined again by  half as compared to 1992.    Because of the price "crunch" and the enormous state debts  to  kolkhozes and sovkhozes, rural residents, and they account for  26 percent of the entire population, live in extremely tough  economic and domestic conditions. Proceeds for the output of  fields and farms received by the treasuries of kolkhozes and  sovkhozes fell short by more than 1.5 trillion rubles [R] and  R800 billion worth of budget allocations. The state is buying  agricultural output abroad while 35 percent of the rye from the  harvest grown in Russia remains unsold, 67 percent of the  vegetables, 76 percent of the long-stemmed flax, 24 percent of  the animal fat, and 59 percent of the wool. It has become  difficult to sell all types of grain, meat, and meat products in  many regions.    [Asin] In our republic too, in my opinion. I have  information  on unsold meat at the meat combine and unclaimed first  generation hybrid seeds in the republic's grain elevators.    [Beslaneyev] You are absolutely right. Here is one more  example of how the peasant is really being robbed. Only 28  percent of the earnings from the sale of grain are left for the  grain producers, while one-fifth goes to trade and 40 percent to  grain receivers. The list of examples of excess being created in  the agricultural complex would take up a great deal of time.  Suffice it to mention that as a result of all this, a foundation  has been laid for further degradation of agriculture. As of  today, Agroprom [Agroindustry] is unable to ensure simple  reproduction using its own resources.    So in these conditions, it has become urgently necessary to  create a strong political party able to keep agriculture from  breaking down for good.    [Asin] The appearance of such a political party which sets  such goals is a gratifying thing. What ways do you see to  achieve them?    [Beslaneyev] This would be the most reliable path: the  diversity and equality of various forms of ownership and  economic activity on land must be achieved and commercial  reforms based on long-term scientific programs must be conducted  on the state level. We support the priorities of development of  the agroindustrial complex.    The primary task is overcoming the opinion which has become  fixed in social consciousness that the peasantry is conservative  and politically backward. They must take a proper place in  society.    [Asin] What methods do you intend to use to achieve your  goals?    [Beslaneyev] Only constitutional means and political  methods.  We intend to participate actively in elections to the state  organs of power. We realize very clearly that only those who  truly express the will of the majority can count on success and  have this moral right. People have had enough populist slogans  and unfulfilled and deliberately unfeasible promises. The rural  laborer is tired of them.    In our work we will cooperate with other political parties,  trade unions, and public movements and organizations.    [Asin] What will be the foundations of this cooperation?    [Beslaneyev] Cooperating with organizations and movements  whose goals and tasks are close to ours as well as with power  structures does not mean abandoning our program goals and tasks.  We will follow them strictly. But we will begin from the need to  unite the efforts of political parties, structures of parliament  and executive power, and the healthy forces of society in the  cause of uplifting and strengthening the agrarian sector and  restoring the traditional way of life in the countryside. We  also take into account that our republic is largely an agrarian  one and most of the population has rural roots. The countryside  has been and continues to be the keeper of the national culture  and traditions of the Kabardins, Balkars, and Cossacks.    [Asin] What do you consider the most important position, the  most important question?    [Beslaneyev] There is perhaps no tougher or more fundamental  question in our work than the question of land. The approach to  resolving it cannot be the same even in conditions of different  rayons within the republic itself. Even less acceptable is a  mechanical transfer to Kabardino-Balkaria of models developed  somewhere else. Our party supports the outright transfer of land  parcels to ownership with the right of lifetime possession and  bequest. But only to those who live and work on it or want to  obtain it exclusively for production of agricultural output,  horticulture, or gardening.    But at the same time, we are against haste in resolving the  question of the free buying and selling of land. In the  republic's conditions, this may lead to redistribution of land  in favor of persons who have nothing to do with agricultural  production and to unpredictable consequences. We must not allow  land to become an object of speculation and enrichment of rich  people. Yes, we are for the equality of multistructural forms of  economic activity on the land. We believe that private farming  must not be "under the thumb." But we must not go to extremes.  For development of peasant (private) farms does not presuppose  the mandatory suffocation of collective forms of economic  activity on the land. But it is clear that in the present stage  of the reforms in Agroprom, private farmers still cannot, as  they say, feed the country. There are many reasons for this: we  do not have the small equipment needed for small farms, the tax  system is imperfect, and private farmers' relations with the  processing enterprises are becoming extremely difficult. We must  understand that the development of private farming, especially  given the shortage of arable land, is the longest, most capital  intensive, and most inefficient way. There are, of course,  barriers of a psychological and professional nature. Already the  first experiments have shown how the peasant farmer must be  trained in many things. By no means is everyone ready for this  now. If excesses triumph here, we risk sliding down the path of  the inefficient, subsistence form of economic activity typical  of underdeveloped countries.    [Asin] But is there other experience?    [Beslaneyev] We usually like to refer to the United States.  In fact, the American agrarian sector is oriented to large  market agricultural enterprises. This type of economic activity  can be created on the base of kolkhozes and sovkhozes without  large additional expenditures. I want to be understood  correctly: There will be no obstacles to those private farmers  who want to and in fact do everything necessary to use the land  efficiently or to those for whom this difficult job is not a  sideline but their life's work. They can and will successfully  coexist with other forms of labor organization. Large commodity  producers will be no obstacle to them.    [Asin] Chamal Mashevich, what organizational plans does the  party's governing board have?    [Beslaneyev] Anyone who is even a little tempted by this  work  understands that in the future we cannot do without a precise  organizational structure. We are going to create our own cells  in the villages from people who understand and sympathize with  our ideas and program. Then will follow their joining into rayon  organizations. It would probably be appropriate to stipulate  that we do not plan to revive a communist-oriented party. We  have precise practical goals where the economic and social  orientation predominates.    But for now we face the work of explaining our Rules and  Program. I believe that we have already taken the first step in  this direction with this conversation. We see clearly that  without detailed knowledge and a sense of the problems bothering  rural residents we will not rally people around us.    The Agrarian Party will work hard to preserve the republic's  integrity and indoctrinate the rising generation in the best  traditions of our peoples. We are not striving for  self-isolation; our program includes close cooperation with all  branches of power, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food,  and with elected and management organs. In defending the  interests of rural commodity producers, we will rely on solid  knowledge of the state of affairs in local areas.    [Asin] To judge from the makeup of the APR governing board,  there is good potential for this. In my opinion, a solid "team"  has been chosen, one able to create a party which in terms of  size is a mass party and in terms of quality a competent one. I  sincerely wish you well, may you have success in your work, and  thank you for the interview.</p>

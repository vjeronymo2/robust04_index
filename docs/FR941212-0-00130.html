			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Army Carrier Recovery Program involves the supervising and pursuing of administrative settlements of all claims in favor of the Government against third parties arising from claims settled under the preceding sections of this subpart. The Program includes making and issuing policies, procedures, and instructions pertaining to recovery action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The term third parties as used in this section, refers to all types of contractors, carriers, and insurers of personal property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.184  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Duties and responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Field claims approval and settlement authorities are responsible for local implementation of the Army Carrier Recovery Program and will ensure that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Proper notice is provided to third parties (see DA Pam 27162, paragraph 2&hyph;55).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims are processed so that relevant time limitations on pursuing recovery demands are met, particularly the 6-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2415(a). In overseas areas, statute of limitations relevant to locally procured tenders and contracts will be observed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Servicing transportation offices provide supporting documentation and perform necessary inspections in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Claims files include complete, legible documentation needed to support recovery action, including a copy of the itemized breakdown prepared by the claimant's insurer when appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Third party liability is correctly calculated in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, and is reflected on all copies of the DD Form, 1844.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Written demands for reimbursement are prepared against appropriate third parties, and demands are dispatched locally or forwarded for centralized recovery within 30 days of settlement (see &sect;536.196). If this 30-day standard is not met or no demand is prepared because liability will not be pursued, claims personnel will explain the basis for this on the claims chronology sheet. Note, however, that files will not be forwarded for centralized recovery prior to the 21st day after settlement in order to afford the claimant an opportunity to request reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Unearned freight letters are prepared when required by DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;27, and are either included in files forwarded for centralized recovery or are dispatched locally after settlement with the carrier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Settlement offers from third parties are accepted or rejected within 30 days of receipt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Checks received are kept in a locked container in accordance with AR 37&hyph;103, and are hand-carried to the servicing finance and accounting office within 24 hours of acceptance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Claims files for which a third party fails to satisfy its liability are forwarded to USARCS or to contracting officers for offset as appropriate (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Include demand packets for all claim files forwarded to USARCS due to incidents of bankruptcies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Commander, USARCS, is responsible for the general administration of the Army Carrier Recovery Program and for the Army Centralized Recovery Program.

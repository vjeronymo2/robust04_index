			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Gold funds add the glister to a remarkable year - Risk and Reward 1993 was a remarkable year for the world's stock markets, a fact underscored by the latest performance data on equity mutual funds. According to Lipper Analytical of New Jersey, gold funds topped the performance charts in 1993 after being laggards for a decade. Benefiting from a 17.8 per cent rise in the price of gold and a 13 per cent appreciation of the South African rand against the US dollar, Lipper reports that gold funds posted an 80.87 per cent average return for the year. While gold bugs finished first, every category of stock fund that Lipper tracks finished ahead for the year. Funds which invested heavily in emerging markets and international stocks were second only to gold. Mutual funds, the investment vehicle for US investors who prefer to trust their savings to professional money managers, saw assets balloon in 1993. Stock funds in particular received an influx of cash, as people moved money out of low-yielding fixed-income accounts in search of higher returns. Net sales of mutual fund shares reached a record Dollars 250bn in the first 11 months of the year. However, mutual fund purchases did slow in the fourth quarter, a cautious response to stock markets that were reaching historic highs. Stock funds invested in international markets outperformed general funds, which have both US domestic and foreign investments, by a factor of three. Lipper reported an average return of 43 per cent for world equity funds, compared with an average 12.5 per cent increase in the 1,336 general equity funds it tracks. In the US, that compares with a 16.97 per cent gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the year, or the relatively lacklustre gain of 10.06 per cent in the Standard and Poor's 500 index. The fever of rallies in emerging markets last year was reflected broadly in the mutual fund sector. Regionally, shares of Pacific basin funds advanced 63.81 per cent in the year, lifted by a 145 per cent advance in Hong Kong. Latin American funds, rarely seen until last year, gained in popularity. The nine funds Lipper tracks posted a 57.05 per cent annual return. Canadian funds appreciated 34.3 per cent on average. Their robust growth, analysts said, could be attributed partially to optimism generated by the debate over and completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Equity funds targeting European markets advanced 26 per cent, overwhelming the falls in many European currencies against the US dollar. That performance was below the 50.2 per cent five-year average for the European funds. Japanese funds finished last in the international sector, suffering with Japan's battered stock market, but they still managed a 23 per cent annualised return. Lipper's editor Mr William McBride explains that an 11 per cent gain in the yen's value in dollar terms, combined with some first-half market gains, helped offset the effects of the slide in Japan's market in the second half of the year. Reflecting on the fact that the current stock and bond market rallies are one of the longest in living memory, particularly in the US, Lipper advises caution in 1994 fund selection. For the nervous investor, it favours money market funds, the mutual fund industry's version of cash. For stock funds, it advises high-quality growth funds for the least downside potential, and funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 for new investors. For the adventurous, Lipper pinpoints last year's laggards, Japanese and health/biotechnology sector funds.</p>

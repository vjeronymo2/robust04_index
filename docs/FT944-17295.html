			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Manchester's Modernist comes to light / Review of Karl Hagedorn, Derek Jarman and Cindy Sherman The Whitworth Art Gallery of Manchester University has a reputation for imaginative temporary exhibitions that take risks, or look again at forgotten artists. Two such are running at the moment. Karl Hagedorn was born in Freiberg in Germany in 1889, but his antecedents remain a mystery, albeit a romantic mystery. He was supposedly an illegitimate son of Kaiser Wilhelm II - hagedorn means blackthorn, a name often taken to indicate the royal bend sinister in Germany. Certainly the several self-portraits in this exhibition, in youth and old-age, in their particular likeness to Kaiser Bill, do nothing to confound such speculation. He came to England in the mid-1900s, settling in Manchester where he studied under Adolphe Valette, who was also Lowry's teacher. He was naturalised in 1914, was called up in 1916 and served out the war in Flanders with the Middlesex Regiment. He left Manchester in the 1920s for London, where he was active in the circle of the Royal Society of British Artists, which included Minton and Carel Weight. He also taught for many years at Epsom School of Art, so he was not exactly unknown to the London art world. Only after his death in 1969, however, did the early work come to light, on which this exhibition's claim for his being 'Manchester's first modernist' rests. For the tragedy of his middle years was the death, in 1928, of Anne, his only child. In his grief he abandoned his modernist ways and asked Nellie, his wife, to destroy all his old work. Instead she hid it. So it is we discover once more the lively work of a committed young artist, already well-travelled in the years before 1914, and familiar with such as Derain, Matisse - whom he visited - and Picasso. He was also knew the Vorticists, Lewis, Bomberg and their friends, and the Bloomsbury avant garde of Fry and Grant and Bell. If what he did does not now exactly shatter our perception of modernism in its great days, it was quite enough to stir up a little local controversy when he showed with the Manchester Society of Modern Painters in the autumn of 1913. 'Mr Hagedorn's rhythmical expressions', said the Manchester Evening News, 'include one which happens to be a sea-green man - Robespierre was pink to him - another seems like a kitchen dresser after an earthquake . . .' Plus ca change . . . It is an intriguing and charming revival. The late Derek Jarman's last works, Evil Queen, are hardly charming, but they are intriguing, and given the circumstances in which they were made, even moving. Through his last decline, unable to paint himself, Jarman directed an assistant in achieving these manic, expressionist swirls and vortices of pigment and colour. They are truly desperate things, for the palpable hurt and anger they express, powerful enough even without the final fierce inscriptions, scoured out of the paint, that were Jarman's only direct contribution to the work. Ouch; Dead Sexy; Dizzy Bitch; Scream; Do Lalley; Ataxia (Aids is Fun) - the cries grow weaker, the surfaces thinner, as Jarman himself fades away. This is not great art. Jarman began and always claimed to be a painter, but the truth is that he made his greater contribution through his films. His painting, rather, was ever impulsive, opportunistic, unsustained, and it is only the special pleading of his particular condition that would make it more. That is not to say, however, that this sad exhibition is not a most poignant testament to our times. Finally, a brief mention of Cindy Sherman, who is herself the subject of her remarkable photographic works. Yet it is never self-conscious or self-celebratory, for she takes on the impersonality of the true actor. She has shown frequently in London, but never before in the country at large. The show at the Manchester City Art Galleries offers a concise summary of her career, from the Untitled Film Stills of the late 1970s, through the ever-larger colour images of the '80s to the disturbingly gynaecological sex images, with their dismembered dolls and disembodied masks, of the '90s. She is a satirist and a surrealist of real power.

Evil Queen - Derek Jarman's Last Paintings: in association with Richard Salmon, Boddingtons and Granada Television.

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Air France to buy 40% stake in Czech airline AIR FRANCE is leading a consortium that will pay Dollars 60m for a 40 per cent stake in Ceskeslovenske Aerolinie (CSA), the Czechoslovakian state airline, writes Daniel Green. The deal values CSA at Dollars 150m (Pounds 82.4m) and makes Air France the first western airline to become a shareholder in an existing eastern European carrier. It would be one of the biggest investments yet for the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is in the consortium. The EBRD and Caisse des Depots et Consignation, a French financial institution and a shareholder in Air France, were each contributing Dollars 20m in cash to the consortium, said Air France. The EBRD said yesterday its board would finalise the level of investment within eight weeks. The two airlines signed a memorandum of understanding in Prague on Monday. The deal is subject to approval from the French and Czechoslovak governments. Air France hopes this will be given by spring. Air France's investment represents a partial privatisation of CSA. The remaining 60 per cent will be held by the Czechoslovak state and domestic financial institutions. Air France said: 'We were looking for a partner in eastern Europe. Prague is geographically located right in the centre.' The French state-owned airline intends to make Prague a secondary European hub after Paris. 'This alliance represents an excellent platform for CSA's future development as an airline based in the heart of Europe and for Prague as a major hub,' said Mr Oldrich Churain, CSA director-general. Of the Dollars 60m being paid for the CSA stake, Air France is paying about Dollars 6m in cash. Observer, Page 18</p>

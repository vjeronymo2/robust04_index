			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Shalnev: "Russia Is Not Forcing Its </F> Way Into G-7, Viktor Chernomyrdin States on Departure for  Washington"]    [Text] The Russian premier made this statement at the  airport prior to his departure for Italy, from where, having  completed his one-and-a-half-day visit, he is proceeding across  the Atlantic to the United States as you are reading these lines.    The question of transforming the G-7 into the G-8 is one of  the key questions at both the talks held with the head of the  Italian Government, who we know will chair the June G-7 summit  in Naples, and at meetings in Washington, where Chernomyrdin's  interlocutors will include President William Clinton, albeit (as  the situation stands at the time of the departure from Moscow)  with the qualification of "conditionally."    From the Russian premier's viewpoint Russia has "already  progressed a long way" regarding the question of whether it will  add itself to the G-7. But the official formation of the G-8 is  a matter for the future which goes beyond the bounds of the  Naples summit. "I see no difficulties as regards political  questions," Chernomyrdin said, answering my question. "As for  economic questions, we are not forcing our way in, we are  perfectly well aware that there are difficulties on which we  ourselves have some work to do today." When these difficulties  have been overcome is when, as far as can be understood from the  premier's comments, the G-7 will become the G-8. "This," he  stressed, "is the next stage." True, Chernomyrdin did not  specify whether Moscow hopes to overcome this obstacle by next  year's summit scheduled in Canada.    In Washington, to where the premier is flying to participate  in the third session of the Russian-U.S. economic and technical  commission, which he heads jointly with U.S. Vice President  Albert Gore, our delegation will strongly raise a question which  has gone unanswered for too long: When do the Americans and the  West as a whole intend to finally lift the restrictions on  business contacts with us which persist from Cold War times?  Let me recall that at the summit meeting in Vancouver in April  last year Clinton solemnly promised to do this without delay.  Over a year has elapsed. "This is simply unsettling us all,"  Chernomyrdin said. "Not only us but also the Americans are  losing out because the restrictions are being maintained.... We  want to work on equal terms, we are not asking for anything that  would make us an exception. We have wishes, like everyone. Of  course, we will not tolerate discrimination against Russia."    Although the premier did state that he hopes that a solution  will nonetheless be found, I personally have doubts as to how  serious the Washington administration and U.S. Congress are  about this. The doubts are strengthened, in particular, by the  U.S. Department of Commerce's recent statement, which defined  the 10 most promising emerging markets from the viewpoint of  U.S. interests. This list includes Brazil, Indonesia, India,  Turkey, South Korea, and Poland. But not Russia. In order to  promote U.S. interests in Indonesia, for example, a special  strategic group has already been formed which includes  representatives of 22 ministries and departments. In other  words, if we are talking about the level of interest shown by  the Americans, Jakarta has reached a level which is still  unachievable for Moscow. Let me add that in relation to China,  which is also on this list, Washington is prepared to waive  literally any of its principles, including those linked to  guaranteeing civil rights and freedoms, so that it does not lose  this market and becomes established and prevails in it. But as  for us this attitude is once again something unrealistic.    It must be specially stressed that the mood of U.S.  business circles plays a colossal role in the extent to which  the Washington administration is complaisant in its dealings  with Beijing. The fact that Clinton effectively ignored human  rights violations by the Chinese authorities and is going to  renew China's most-favored-nation trading status is indicative  of the powerful pressure put on the White House by, among  others, the Boeing aviation corporation, which, were it not for  this status, could have lost tens of billions of dollars. Those  meeting with Chernomyrdin in the United States -- who, besides  Washington, will visit Detroit (in order, among other things, to  support our team in the football World Cup) and Los Angeles and  San Francisco -- will include leaders of Boeing and other U.S.  aviation giants. I wonder to what extent they are going to want  to mount an intensive campaign of pressure on the White House in  order to break into Russian markets and open up U.S. markets for  Russian products.    Another noteworthy point on the Russian premier's itinerary:  the Livermore Laboratory, the very same one where the most  advanced weapons, including nuclear and space weapons, have been  and are still being developed. Chernomyrdin will become the  first Russian of such high rank to visit this laboratory, in  order -- as far as can be ascertained -- to thoroughly discuss  questions of defense conversion and those about which he prefers  not to talk for the moment. "We are discussing those problems,"  he just told me, "about which it was prohibited to think  previously." It is to be hoped that some light will be shed on  this subject as well by the end of the visit.    U.S. reporters who accompanied the premier to the airport  asked a question which evidently interests U.S. politicians much  more than the visit itself at the moment: Are there any  differences of opinion between Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin?  The reply was categorical: "There are no differences between  us. There were not any initially, there are none now, and there  will be none. It is impossible to work in the midst of  differences. The line being pursued by the government and  president is a united line. I better than anyone else can  confirm this today."</p>

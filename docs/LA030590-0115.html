			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET REFORMERS LEAD VOTE;  </P> <P> YELTSIN WINS BUT RUNOFFS ARE NEEDED  </P> <P> Radical reformers including Boris N. Yeltsin and several former political  prisoners defeated orthodox Communist opponents in many regions, incomplete  results from elections in three Soviet republics showed today.  </P> <P> But ballots with as many as 20 candidates in a race frustrated the election  process. Returns from more than half of the 1,068 parliamentary districts in  the huge Russian Federation were inconclusive, the official news agency Tass  said.  </P> <P> The inconclusive ballots meant that voters would have to go to the polls again  in those districts two weeks from now as well as in parts of the Ukraine and  Byelorussia, the other two republics where elections to parliaments and local  councils were held Sunday.  </P> <P> Complete official results are due March 14. Tass released a handful of results  and others came from election observers.  </P> <P> The polls, involving 70% of the country's 280 million population, took place  against a background of rapid political change.  </P> <P> Yeltsin bested 11 other candidates to win more than 80% of the vote for a seat  in the Russian Federation parliament from the city of Sverdlovsk.  </P> <P> The white-haired populist said the radicals' gains will make it possible to  press ahead with reforms.  </P> <P> "The vote gives the possibility to strengthen reforms and allow new measures to  be taken," the former Moscow party chief and junior Politburo member told  reporters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, starting a seven-nation tour promoting  his autobiography.  </P> <P> Yeltsin would not say whether he will run for president of the Russian  Federation. The post is currently held by Politburo member Vitaly I.  Vorotnikov, who also won his election race in a rural district of southern  Russia.  </P> <P> But he threatened to quit the Communist Party if the various blocs are not  given proportional representation in the leadership.  </P> <P> The other reform candidates who won, according to unofficial results gleaned by  election observers, read like a "Who's Who" of former dissidents and popular  personalities.  </P> <P> In the Ukraine, two former political prisoners were among leaders of a radical  opposition alliance that swept into the Ukrainian parliament despite what  members described as a concerted official campaign against it.  </P> <P> Mikhail Horyn and Vyacheslav Chornovil, who between them spent 27 years in  prison but were released under Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev, were among  leaders of the nationalist Rukh movement who won parliamentary seats from the  Western Ukraine.  </P> <P> In Donetsk, a coal-mining center and recently the scene of frequent strikes,  several local Communist officials lost their races, according to Interfax, a  publication of Radio Moscow. It gave no details.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Sergei Kovalyov, another former political prisoner and colleague of  the late human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov, won a seat, according to  unofficial results collected by pro-reform observers.  </P> <P> In Leningrad, the Democratic Elections 90 pro-reform bloc said its candidates  are ahead in 30 of 34 parliamentary constituencies, although many will have to  go through second rounds, and stand to win 80% of seats on local councils.  </P></p>

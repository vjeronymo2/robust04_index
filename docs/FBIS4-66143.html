			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France/Italy: Berlusconi in French </F> Poll"]    [Text] (ANSA) Paris, May 17 -- Some 54 percent of the  French feel that Italy's European Union [EU] partners should  boycott the hard-right National Alliance ministers in Prime  Minister Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet and half see the new  premier as a "populist demagogue," but 48 percent believe the  Berlusconi phenomenon could be repeated in France, according to  a poll published by the French Catholic weekly, LA VIE.    The poll indicated that 68 percent of the sample see a  "significant" risk of a growth in neo-fascism in Europe, and  only 26 percent believe there is no such risk. Italy's National  Alliance, which has five ministers in the Berlusconi government,  was known until earlier this year as the Italian Social  Movement, the post-war heir to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party.    According to the LA VIE poll, only 28 percent of the sample  believe the EU should impose no boycott on the Alliance  ministers and 18 percent had no opinion, just as many as denied  that Berlusconi is a "populist demagogue."    But even if many French are critical of Berlusconi's  political style, as many as 37 percent believe he may have the  qualities to get Italy back on the rails. Thirty percent  disagreed with this suggestion. The poll suggested that 36  percent of the sample believe the Berlusconi phenomenon would be  impossible in France, while 16 percent didn't know.</p>

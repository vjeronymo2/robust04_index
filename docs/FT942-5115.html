			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Direct selling of insurance gets continental break Zurich Insurance's plans to launch a telephone-based direct sales subsidiary at first appear unexceptional. After all, the investment is unlikely to dent the balance sheet of Switzerland's best capitalised insurance company. Yet the new business, which Zurich intends to extend rapidly to EU countries, indicates the arrival of direct selling in conservative continental markets, where agents - usually selling exclusively for companies such as Allianz, Union des Assurances de Paris and Generali - hold sway. 'Direct writing' bypasses middlemen and instead reaches customers through mass media advertising and telephone sales. This sales method is firmly established in the UK, where the original telephone insurer, Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, has become the country's largest motor insurance company in less than 10 years. Deregulation of the European market will give further impetus to the development of direct writing. Next month EU members must abolish rules which require minimum prices to be set for some lines of home and motor insurance, and local regulators to approve policies. Zurich's Swiss rival Winterthur has been quicker off the mark in direct writing: its Churchill subsidiary is the second biggest direct writer in the UK. Yet Mr Rolf Huppi, Zurich's president and chief executive, is now a fervent advocate of the technique. Zurich Municipal, a UK subsidiary which specialises in local authority insurance, has achieved an expense ratio (expenses as a percentage of premiums) of 12 per cent, way below the industry average, by selling policies direct rather than through a broker. Telephone links will allow Zurich greater contact with customers, which Mr Huppi is prepared to underline brutally. 'Anybody who says that our customer is the broker gets shot where he stands.' Above all, direct sales methods reduce costs. 'The new ways of distributing our product are more effective than traditional ways. The opening up of the market will mean an enormous pressure on costs,' adds Mr Huppi. Zurich is signalling its confidence by launching Zuritel in the Swiss market, which is highly traditional even by the standards of Germany and Italy - probably the most conservative in the EU. Swiss motor and home policies are typically five or 10-year contracts. Only seven of the 26 cantons - mainly French-speaking ones - allow private insurers to offer buildings insurance. Even so the company believes Zuritel will establish a foothold in Switzerland and expand rapidly. The key tests will come in Germany, the continent's most lucrative market, where hitherto direct writers such as Tellit and Kosmos have made only limited headway; and in France, where a number of low-cost mutuals control large swathes of the personal lines market.</p>

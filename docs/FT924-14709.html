			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu to cut spending, NEC sees losses FUJITSU, the Japanese computer company, yesterday confirmed its capital spending would be below forecast levels, while NEC, the electronics company, may report consolidated net losses of more than Y10bn (Dollars 83m) for the first half. The two companies, and the entire Japanese electronics industry, are under pressure because of a fall in capital spending at home and international weakness in the computer and semiconductor markets. NEC is also suffering in Japan's overcrowded consumer electronics market. Fujitsu said it would reduce capital spending from a planned Y140bn to Y110bn this year, while research and development spending would be about 8.5 per cent below the original plan. It is also transferring systems engineers to the sales department in an attempt to bolster profits. The company has forecast net consolidated losses of about Y20bn for the first half to end-September, although it hopes an emergency economic package recently announced by the Japanese government will stimulate sales in the second half. Meanwhile, NEC said that a Japanese newspaper report that it would incur consolidated losses of more than Y10bn was not necessarily wrong, although the company has not completed its calculation of first-half earnings. Heavy discounting of computer and consumer electronic products in the domestic market has hurt the company, while the recent appreciation of the yen is likely to harm international profitability. As with other semiconductor-makers, NEC is counting on an upturn in the US market to lift demand and prices, which have fallen sharply over the past two years.</p>

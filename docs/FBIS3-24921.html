The two sides, together with two bishops, two top army  officers and the representatives of the UN and Organisation of  African Unity will seek to bring the landlocked East African  state "back from the brink," said UN special representative  Ahmedou Ould Abdallah.    The two sides would not split up before settling the problem  of who should succeed president Melchior Ndadaye, assassinated  in a failed military coup on October 21, Ould-Abdallah added.    Political and tribal violence flared in the capital after  the  government sacked five members of the constitutional commission  Saturday. The commission is expected to rule on the legitimacy  of Ntaryamira's designation as president on 13 Janaury.    The opposition, led by Sylvie Kinigi, is contesting the  nomination by the national assembly.    Ntaryamira, the former agriculture minister, comes from the  same majority Hutu tribe as the assassinated president.  Burundi's army, and until recently its top political posts, are  dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Aura Lila Moreno] </F>   [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo has said that the  FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] Congress offers an  extraordinary opportunity for Sandinists to make decisions  concerning the country's future. He also denied there is any  possibility of former President Daniel Ortega winning the 1996  elections, because, according to Lacayo, Ortega is politically  "burned out."    Lacayo refrained from expressing an opinion on the support  that either of the two candidates for FSLN secretary general  could have from groups participating in debates prior to the  congress. He said he has tried to maintain respectful relations  with the Sandinist leaders, although "most of those relations  have been with Daniel Ortega and Sergio Ramirez."    "We hope the FSLN will emerge united and convinced that  violence belongs to the past," Lacayo said in a three-hour  program broadcast by a local radio station during which he  explained his views on various topics concerning the country's  economic, political, and social life.  <H5>  Gringos Caitudos </H5>   Commenting on the U.S. Congress' ultimatum to the government  to resolve the property problem or face the suspension of U.S.  aid, Lacayo poked fun at Somozists who are demanding properties  disguised as U.S. citizens, calling them "gringos caitudos  [pejorative term for some Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S.  citizens]," who are nothing more than "Nicaraguans whose  properties were confiscated in 1979 as Somozists and who now  return as U.S. citizens.    "There are many gringos caitudos saying `I am American.'  They have almost forgotten Spanish," Lacayo said, adding that  those people demanding properties "will be treated as  Nicaraguans, because according to international law, the  nationality that matters is the one the individual had at the  time his rights were affected."  <H5>  The Right Has a Visceral Hatred for Him </H5>   After explaining his expectations for the results of the  Sandinist Special Congress, Lacayo expressed his views on the  subject of properties and the so-called Helms ultimatum, his  optimism about Nicaragua's future, and the political  possibilities he foresees for the 1996 electoral campaign.    According to the presidency minister, the extreme right  attacks him with a visceral hatred because he maintains a  central political position and because he has not allowed a  return of the Somozist system. "They hate me because they  thought Dona Violeta would `not have any authority' and that  they would run the government with Vice President Virgilio Godoy  as leader," he stressed.    "There is hatred because Dona Violeta is running the  government and promoting a center project of reconciliation and  national unity. They know the right doesn't stand a chance in  the 1996 or 2002 elections as long as there is a political  faction in the center, which makes them mad," Lacayo said. He  compared the hostile treatment he receives from the rightist  media to the "loving" way they treat former President Ortega.  <H5>  Liberal-Somozist Plan </H5>   Based on Lacayo's analysis, the Nicaraguan right is trying  to  imitate the strategy used by the Salvadoran right in the  previous elections. "They are behind a Liberal-Somozist plan  hoping that Daniel Ortega will be the leftist candidate like  Ruben Zamora in El Salvador and that he will receive 24 percent  of the votes while the right will get 50 percent," Lacayo  stressed.    In his opinion, the rightists know very well that Ortega  will  not win if he runs for president in the next elections because  "he is burned out, he confiscated properties, and he made war."  In that sense, Lacayo said the right's biggest problem is "what  to do with the center or with Antonio Lacayo, should he decide  to be a candidate."    "They are obsessed with me, but their plan will fail,  because  people will never vote for a rightist option as long as there is  a center option," Lacayo said. For the first time he openly  admitted his presidential aspirations, saying that "I will not  shirk the responsibility" if a center coalition chooses him as  its candidate for the 1996 elections.    In Lacayo's opinion, if a Liberal-Somozist option wins in  the  1996 elections, "the Sandinists will not tolerate it." On the  other hand, if an option from the "hackneyed left should win,  the rightist sectors will try to make things hard for them."</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PROTEST PART OF UNION EFFORT AGAINST NORDSTROM  </P> <P> A union's prolonged war with the Nordstrom department store chain in Washington  state spilled into Los Angeles and four other cities Thursday, with  demonstrations intended to pressure Nordstrom into signing a new labor  contract.  </P> <P> The negative publicity campaign, coordinated by the international office of the  1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial Workers Union, was timed to make  a dent in Nordstrom's holiday sales.  </P> <P> The old contract between UFCW Local 1001 and six Nordstrom stores in the  Seattle-Tacoma area expired in mid-1989. Since then, the two sides have been  unable to come to terms on a new pact.  </P> <P> For the past year, Local 1001 has accused Nordstrom of encouraging sales  associates to perform many of the chain's famed customer-service activities on  their own time. Since the workers are paid by the hour, such practices would be  illegal. Washington state labor officials have sided with the union, and many  workers have confirmed the allegations in interviews with newspaper reporters.  </P> <P> The Seattle-Tacoma area is the only part of the country in which the 63-store  chain's sales associates are unionized.  </P> <P> Thursday's demonstrations were held at the Nordstrom store in Westwood, and at  stores in San Diego, San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Virginia.  </P> <P> A Nordstrom spokesman said persistent union criticism of the store is an unfair  attack on Nordstrom's "entrepreneurial environment," in which successful sales  associates can earn substantial commissions.  </P> <P> A group of Nordstrom employees in Washington state who are opposed to union  representation have mounted a campaign to decertify Local 1001. However, that  effort was stalled earlier this year when the union complained to the National  Labor Relations Board that Nordstrom was illegally assisting the employees.  </P> <P> Nordstrom last month agreed in a settlement with the NLRB to refrain from  showing preferential treatment to employees involved in the decertification  campaign.  </P></p>

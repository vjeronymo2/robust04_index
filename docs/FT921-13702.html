			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Zhelev wins Bulgarian election REFORMIST Zhelyu Zhelev won Bulgaria's first presidential election yesterday, according to unofficial results, ending communist hopes of clinging to a slice of power, Reuter reports from Sofia. His victory consolidates power in the hands of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), which now controls the presidency as well as the government it formed after winning a general election last October. But the margin of victory was relatively narrow in both cases, reflecting the lingering appeal of communist-inspired policies in the Balkan country of 8.5m people. According to unofficial results which the state news agency BTA said would be confirmed, Mr Zhelev was given about 54 per cent of the vote, edging out Mr Velko Valkanov, his rival backed by the socialists (former communists), who got about 46 per cent.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Tec issues ultimatum on training THE Central England Training and Enterprise Council (Centec) has given the hundreds of companies who contract with it a tough training ultimatum. It has given its suppliers until November 1993 to register as committed to Investors in People (IIP) or forfeit grants for training and enterprise initiatives. Centec's budget this year was about Pounds 10m. Centec, based in the West Midlands, is the first Tec to adopt such a policy of contract compliance. Others among the 82 Tecs in England and Wales may follow. Mr Edward Roberts, Centec chairman, also chairs G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen that liaises with the government on broad issues. IIP was introduced last year as a means of evaluating the process of training. Companies have to convince Tec assessors that they undertake a range of quality assurance actions - for example, that they regularly review the training and development of all their employees. Government and Tecs, which are responsible for accrediting companies with a kitemark for training quality, hope that IIP will be a driving force for the improvement of training. The scheme has taken off slowly, with only 68 companies accredited, although more than 1,000 throughout the UK have registered as committed to it. The Department of Employment yesterday published a report saying its Restart programme, which provides unemployed people with advisory interviews every six months, has proved highly successful. The Policy Studies Institute report says Restart brought a number of benefits, including getting more people into jobs. The Restart Effect. BEBC Distribution, PO Box 1496, Poole, Dorset BH12 3YD.

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: US insurer in Dollars 800m placement THE EQUITABLE, the large US life insurer which recently 'demutualised' as part of an effort to bolster its capital base, yesterday announced it had completed an Dollars 800m private placement of depositary shares. Almost half the new investment came from Axa, the French insurer. The new depositary shares represent underlying cumulative convertible prefered stock. The stock carries a 6 per cent annual dividend and is convertible after July 22 1994 into about 32.7m shares of Equitable common stock, at a conversion price of Dollars 24.50 a share. Axa had invested Dollars 1bn into The Equitable ahead of the demutualisation. This, in turn, bought the French company a 49 per cent interest in the US insurer, when the demutualisation plan and an associated stockmarket flotation of Equitable shares was completed. Axa's subscription in The Equitable's latest capital-raising exercise means it maintains its underlying interest in the US company. The remaining depository shares were purchased by unnamed institutional investors. The Equitable said yesterday that 'a significant portion' of the placement proceeds would be used to increase the capital of group's life insurance subsidiaries. This would be achieved through direct capital contributions and the possible purchase of the capital stocks of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, a subsidiary of the group. 'Additional actions to increase the capital of the insurance subsidiaries may also include asset securitisation of certain investment assets,' it said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia oranges in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule invites comments on two changes to the reporting requirements currently prescribed under the California-Arizona orange marketing orders. This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders specify that, for the handling of oranges other than by rail car (primarily truck shipments), handlers issue to the consignee an assignment of allotment certificate covering each quantity of oranges so handled. Sections 907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit such information on Form 8. Handlers are also required to segregate the information on Form 8 by size of oranges shipped and destination (i.e., U.S. and Alaska or Canada).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the inception of the orders, the committees have utilized Form 8 primarily for tracking and verifying truck shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the orders suspended [58 FR 53,114; October 14, 1993], the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8 creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the committees, many handlers have long questioned the value of Form 8 (commonly referred to in the industry as ``the daily truck ticket'') during periods of no volume regulation. Shipment information from Form 8 is transferred to Form 4 (Weekly Report). Handlers maintain their own manifest records of these shipments and, without weekly volume regulation, Form 4 provides similar data with the exception of number of cartons shipped by size. The committees plan on requesting size information from handlers as needed on a voluntary basis and anticipate revising the weekly Form 4 at a later time to provide for the collection of size information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8, particularly during periods of no volume regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the orders and &sect;&sect;907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 8 will be discontinued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

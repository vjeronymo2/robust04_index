			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Public figures from  Hong Kong said here today that they support the Chinese  Government's stand on Hong Kong issue and will make their best  to cooperate with the mainland to ensure a smooth transfer of  power in Hong Kong.    Hong Kong deputies to the Eighth National People's Congress  (NPC) and members of the Eighth National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (NPC) [as  received] expressed their stand while attending the current NPC  session and the second session of the CPPCC National Committee.    Delivering a government work report this morning, Premier Li  Peng expressed the hope that the Preliminary Working Committee  for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region will unite with the largest possible  number of Hong Kong compatriots in preparing for the  establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,  its first government and its legislature.    Tsang Hin Chi, Liu Yiu Chu, Tsang Yok Sing and Tsui Sze Man,  members of the Preliminary Working Committee, said that the  committee will live up to the expectation of the whole nation  and make every effort to lay down a sound foundation for a  smooth transition.    Tsang Hin Chi, vice-chairman of the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce in Hong Kong and chairman of the Goldlion (Far East)  Co., Ltd., said the British Government has adopted an  uncooperative attitude on the issue of the political structure  in Hong Kong when the British colonial rule will come to an end  in Hong Kong soon. In such a case, it accords with the will of  the people to accelerate work pace of the Preliminary Working  Committee, which is confronted with an arduous task and great  responsibility.    Solicitor Liu Yiu Chu said the Preliminary Working Committee  is confident in its work no matter what happens.    They said Premier Li Peng's remark on Hong Kong issue in his  report shows China's determination and ability to resume the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.    Tsang Yok Sing, member of the CPPCC National Committee and  chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong  Kong, said that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten tabled to the  Legislative Council the remaining parts of his political reform  bill on March 9. This is a another serious and uncooperative  step that the British Hong Kong authorities have taken to insist  on their stand of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration,  the convergence with the basic law and agreements and  understandings reached between China and Britain.    He said that the Preliminary Working Committee is proceeding  in a planned way. Whatever attitude and step the British side  and British Hong Kong authorities will adopt will have no impact  on the work of the Preliminary Working Committee which started  its work under the non-cooperation of the British side from the  very beginning.    Tsui Sze Man, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC  National Committee, exposed British Hong Kong authorities'  hypocrisy in spreading "accelerating democracy." The  Preliminary Working Committee will listen to opinions of Hong  Kong people, unite with all the forces that can be united with  and make contributions to the smooth transition and maintaining  Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.</p>

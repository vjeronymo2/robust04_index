			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Pak Chong-hyon from Paris] </F>   [Text] It was reported on 2 May 1994 that North Korea has  made known to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] its  intention to accept additional inspections recommended by the UN  Security Council presidential statement.    On 2 May, a high-ranking diplomatic source said: "Last  weekend, North Korea told the IAEA that it was willing to accept  additional inspections, including the taking of samples in the  glove-box area and gamma mappings in the radiochemical  laboratory, which it had not allowed during last March  inspections."    The source added: "North Korea has clarified the reason for  this, saying it will accept additional inspections, inasmuch as  the ROK has recently shown a flexible attitude by withdrawing  the condition on the exchange of special envoys between the  North and South--a precondition to the U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks. The IAEA is discussing measures as to North  Korea's acceptance of additional inspections."</p>

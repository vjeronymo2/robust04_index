			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Muscovites back Yeltsin at the polls AT THE headquarters of the Writers Union of the USSR - alias polling station number 3 in Moscow's Krasnopresenski district - they were doing a brisk trade yesterday lunchtime. Of the 3,000 voters registered for the area, 500 had trooped in from the spring sunshine during the 5 1/2 hours since polls opened. An informal survey suggests they were overwhelmingly voting Yes to Yeltsin. Pavel Kozhen, first voter of the day, anticipated the emerging trend in his answers to the main ballot questions: yes to Yeltsin, yes to his economic reforms, no to pre-term presidential elections, and yes to parliamentary elections - in the words of the campaign slogan, da, da, niet, da. Nina Malachkova, an 83-year-old 'veteran of labour' from Soviet days and an official poll observer, had been at station 3 since 6.30 am. Chivvying dawdling voters in slippers and housecoat, she had no doubt about how they should vote. 'My whole family is united in support of Yeltsin and reform, and so is a majority of people in Moscow. Life is very hard, but most people know that without these reforms it would be worse.' Moscow is not typical, not least because its voters have been under a constant barrage of referendum propaganda. But street interviews yesterday revealed an interest in, and understanding of, the referendum that seemed to belie the image of the post-Soviet citizen as downtrodden and apathetic. At Izmailovo market, a sprawling bazaar in the shadow of a sports stadium on the outskirts of Moscow, lunchtime buying and selling was keeping many from the polling booths. But all the traders surveyed had voted or intended to. Volodya Rusin, 27, a caretaker during the week but a hawker of Soviet memorabilia at the weekend, was for Yeltsin, although his support for the president was less than enthusiastic. 'They used to call what I am doing speculation,' he said. 'If Yeltsin loses, communism will come back and we'll have to stop trading. If Yeltsin wins, at least things won't get any worse.' Viktor Sensov, a journalist and bookseller, had voted for Yeltsin but against his policies. 'We are against the parliament, but we are concerned about Yeltsin,' he said. 'He is a man with courage but without policies.' Tatyana Sultanova, another bookseller, refused to endorse either the president or his parliamentary opponents but voted for new elections for both. 'I am against all of them, because all they do is help themselves. I want young and clever people to enter politics.' But for the young, Yeltsin still seems to promise a better future. Slaking his thirst outside a cafe, Mikhail Borokov, 24, a worker in the Zil limousine plant, said: 'Things will get better if Yeltsin wins, but it will take five to 10 years. Under communism young people couldn't breathe. But Yeltsin is giving everybody the chance to trade, to own land, to be free. Younger people believe in Yeltsin because they have time to wait.'</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (8): Eyes turn to the discount  -3i will dwarf other trusts that invest in unlisted businesses, and allow more savers to back recovery in smaller companies There has never been an investment trust launch quite like it. When 3i comes to market later this month, the UK's largest venture capital supplier will have a valuation in the region of Pounds 1.6bn, making it by far the largest investment trust ever floated. It will dwarf the existing trusts that invest in unlisted businesses. But 3i may also raise the profile of investment in unquoted companies, providing investors with an opportunity to back recovery in smaller businesses throughout the UK economy. Whether or not 3i proves an attractive investment will depend on the pricing, due to be decided on June 22. But unlike 14 months ago, when 3i's shareholders called off the last attempted float, the group's smaller-company customer base appears to be on the road to recovery. 3i was set up as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation by six clearing banks and the Bank of England in 1945. It provides equity, debt and mezzanine finance through 18 UK offices to unquoted companies seeking expansion capital, funds for management buy-outs and buy-ins and for start-ups. The group also has five continental offices. The group has tended to lend and invest off the strength of its own balance sheet. But earlier this year it started managing and investing funds provided by other financial institutions. This will increasingly provide 3i with fees, raising the group's return on assets. Preferring to use its branch network to do a large number of smaller deals - where most venture capital firms focus on a small number of larger deals - 3i has investments in over 3,400 companies, valued at about Pounds 3bn. The group does not, however, like to be called a venture capital group: it believes it provides 'investment capital', a term, it says, that better reflects, among other things, the fact that the managements of companies in which it invests are not obliged to commit to when they will float, or provide investors with an alternative exit. Not does 3i consider itself an investment trust. It argues, with some reason, that its branch network makes it more like a traditional business. But 3i is floating as an investment trust, in order to gain exemption from capital gains tax. Like most other investment trusts, the group is likely to be valued at a price based on a discount to net asset value (NAV). The only question is how great that discount should be. Since 3i announced its float in the summer, the discounts at which venture capital investment trusts have been trading to net asset value have widened considerably. Electra, the venture capital investment trust whose business most closely approximates to 3i's, is trading at a discount to NAV of about 17 per cent, compared with about 8 per cent when 3i announced that it would float. This is only partly because investors are taking a more cautious view of smaller-company prospects and the strength of the recovery. Average discounts for the investment trust sector as a whole have widened over that period, partly because of the number and size of recent new issues like the Kleinwort Benson European privatisation trust. 3i's advisers will have to contend with this recent weakness when deciding the flotation price. Some analysts and brokers, however, say 3i has a unique business which should reduce the discount. In the first place, valuation of unquoted companies in venture capital investment trusts is generally conservative. Quoted companies tend to be valued on expected future profits. 3i and other venture capital trusts only revise upwards the valuations of the companies they invest in based on profits actually produced. The benefits of economic recovery are, therefore, yet to show up in valuations of 3i's unquoted portfolios, whereas they may be largely discounted in quoted company valuations. That said, results for the year to end-March, released last week, showed that net asset values had already risen 39 per cent to Pounds 1.85bn, including the release of a Pounds 152m provision for deferred tax no longer required as a result of 3i's anticipation that it will receive investment trust status. Secondly, institutional support for investment in unquoted investment will probably increase once 3i floats. Not only is 3i a diversified cyclical play on UK recovery, but demand may also increase. Funds that try to match the performance of the FT-SE 100 index may have to hold 3i, which will be in or near the index. With the banks only selling 40 per cent of their stake in 3i, there may not be that much stock around. The listing of such a large investor in unquoted companies as 3i might have been seen as bad news for the existing venture capital trust. But Electra's managing director, Hugh Mumford, relishes the prospect. '3i is unique, well run and has a place in investment portfolios,' he says. 'From our point of view, we hope it will stimulate a better understanding of what we are doing. It will be good to have some competition.'</p>

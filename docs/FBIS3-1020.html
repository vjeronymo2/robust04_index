			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader  Afonso Dhlakama yesterday once again called on the international  organizations to assist Maringue residents who are experiencing  famine because of the shortage of rains and an outbreak of  rodents. Dhlakama said Maringue residents are experiencing a bad  period and if there is no urgent assistance, many people will  die.    The Renamo leader was speaking to reporters after landing at  the Maputo International Airport, coming from Maringue, his  movement's general headquarters. Afonso Dhlakama said the World  Food Program [WFP] will stop assisting Maringue residents as of  next month.    This morning Radio Mozambique contacted the WFP to hear its  stand in view of the statement made by the Renamo president.  WFP Director Philip Clark has denied the allegations and says  that civilians in areas under Renamo control have been receiving  assistance without restrictions. [passage omitted]</p>

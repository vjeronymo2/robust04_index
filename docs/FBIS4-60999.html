			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a report from our Foreign Ministry's press  service:    To ensure the irreversibility of the peace talks,  Azerbaijan,  Armenia, and the international organizations, primarily the  CSCE, should declare that they will assume the following  obligations after the establishment of a cease-fire in the  region.    1. The Armenian Republic's leadership should guarantee to  pull out its Armed Forces from all the occupied Azerbaijani  lands, including Shusha and Lachin.    2. The Azerbaijani Republic's leadership should guarantee to  discuss Daghlyk-Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh's] status within  the Azerbaijani state structure.    3. The CSCE countries should announce that they will not  allow military equipment to be sent to Daghlyk-Karabakh.    This proposal was put forward by our republic's foreign  minister, Gasan Gasanov, during a meeting with Mathias Mosberg,  deputy chairman of Minsk Group.</p>

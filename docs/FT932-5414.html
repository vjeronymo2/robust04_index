			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Leading Article: BT abroad WHEN CORPORATE executives describe their deals as 'nuclear', people should ask what is the fall-out. Such is the natural response to BT's proposed Dollars 4.3bn investment in MCI, the US telecommunications group, and the parallel establishment of a Dollars 1bn joint venture to provide 'state-of-the-art' services to multinational corporations. UK telephone users will wonder whether the fact that BT can splash out such large sums of money shows that its monopoly power has allowed it to earn excess profits since its 1984 privatisation. Shareholders may wonder whether their interests would not have been better served if the cash had been handed to them in higher dividends. BT's chairman, Mr Iain Vallance, argues that customers will benefit from the range of sophisticated services provided by the new joint venture and that shareholders will do well, because MCI is a good investment. But neither argument is all that convincing. Multinational customers may benefit from the joint venture, but they are a tiny proportion of BT's customers. Many more could benefit if the deal led to the sweeping-away of the cartel-like arrangements that govern international telecommunications and keep transatlantic phone charges more than twice as high as might apply in a competitive market. Unfortunately, BT does not plan to use its 20 per cent stake in MCI to upset the current arrangements, which involve it channelling the majority of its transatlantic traffic through AT&amp;T, MCI's larger competitor. In some ways, the deal may even delay competition because BT is retreating from plans to set up its own US long-distance operator to rival AT&amp;T and MCI. From the perspective of shareholders, the concern must be that the deal is another grandiose scheme from a management with a poor track record in foreign investment. BT has dissipated shareholder wealth or, at best, broken even from a string of other North American investments - notably, Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications manufacturer, and McCaw, the mobile communications group. One could argue that shareholders should be able to take care of their own interests. But the snag with the British form of capitalism is that it has not been very effective at controlling managements where the principal discipline - threat of takeover - is widely seen as inoperative because of political considerations. This is doubly so in BT's case, which will continue to be protected by a 'golden share' even after the government's sale of its final stake in the company next month. Government, shareholders and consumers ought to be concerned that wealth generated by a regulated monopoly whose management is under little external discipline may be frittered away in unwise foreign adventures. Shareholders, in particular, should be asking tough questions.</p>

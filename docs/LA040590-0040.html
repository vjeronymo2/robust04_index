			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE COLLEGE WORKERS VOTE TO END MERIT SYSTEM  </P> <P> Workers at Glendale Community College have voted to scrap the merit system that  regulated hiring, firing and promotion of the college's clerical, custodial and  other non-faculty employees, school officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> One-hundred and fifty-nine of the college's 243 classified workers voted to  overturn the system.  </P> <P> The change takes effect July 1.  </P> <P> The merit system was run by a three-member commission that oversaw hiring and  testing procedures, promotions and employee complaints. The appointed  commissioners operated independently of the Board of Education and the district  superintendent.  </P> <P> The system had been in place at the college since 1981 when residents voted to  separate the institution from the Glendale Unified School District, where the  system has been in effect for 24 years.  </P> <P> "We don't need the merit system," said Carolyn Payne, chairwoman of the  Equitable Personnel Practices Task Force, an advisory committee that worked to  overturn the merit system. "With the merit system, we had problem areas in  testing, interviewing and hiring. They worked against us more often than for  us."  </P> <P> Payne said personnel matters can now be handled more efficiently by the  college's board of trustees working with Supt. John A. Davitt. "We will now  have one governing body for handling personnel problems," she said.  </P> <P> A similar attempt in March to overturn the merit system in the Glendale Unified  School District fell 66 votes short of the majority required.  </P></p>

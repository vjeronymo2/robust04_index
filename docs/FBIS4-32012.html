			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava June 16 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  "The policy of economic transition must aim for two quite  contradictory goals -- creating conditions for economic growth  and employment and maintaining macroeconomic stability," says  Brigita Schmognerova, deputy [prime] minister for the economy,  in an interview in PRAVDA.    That part of transition representing adaptation to new  conditions on a microeconomic level is more difficult and  longer-term, she says, and involves mainly the entrepreneurial  sector, but also requires consumers and employees to change.  The minister notes that the Slovak economy continues to have  certain basic advantages over that of Poland or Hungary, though  it does have its difficulties.    The basis for further development of the economy which the  current Moravcik cabinet has promised to lay down is inspiring a  trust in the government's economic policies -- something that  will give the country access to lower cost credit, Schmognerova  told the paper.    During talks with the International Monetary Fund on the  provision of a stand-by loan, for example, the government  strived to specify goals and instruments that correspond to  Slovak conditions, and are realistic and realisable, says the  minister. "The opposition is trying to make the International  Monetary Fund out to be a bogeyman," PRAVDA quotes Schmognerova  responding to accusations that the government is being too  accommodating towards the international organisation.    Instead, sticking to those goals will ensure Slovakia's  ability to repay its loans, showing that the government's  economic policy is reliable, not just in the eyes of the IMF but  more generally.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Actuarial view of the long term Sir, Actuaries must take an extremely long-term view of the future (Lex: 'Pensions', June 1) when making projections of pension fund liabilities - eg, the final payments made in respect of a 30-year-old employee may be more than 60 years hence. However, they will be influenced by the views of clients - trustees and sponsors of the pensions schemes. It is the actuary's responsibility to explain why he or she proposes to use a certain set of actuarial assumptions about the future, and also to allow for the client to have input on these assumptions. The client's views are likely to be shorter term, but if the actuary, in his judgment, finds them acceptable then he will adjust his assumptions  - provided that the client is made aware of the implications of those changes. A current example of this is the implications of the exchange rate mechanism and the consequences for future inflation/interest rates - to what extent should the actuary take this into account given the short-term nature of political policies? Mark Lloyd, Gissings, Finsbury House, 23 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7AL</p>

He said  that these extremists have repented and returned to the right  path in society.    His remarks came after six extremist terrorists voluntarily  surrendered themselves to the security organs in Asyut  Governorate after becoming convinced that the wrong ideas they  believed in were corrupt.    The six repentant terrorists are: Rushdi Sayyid Muhammad,  Hasan 'Abd-al-Rasul, Hasan Ibrahim Mahmud, 'Abd-al-Badi'  Rashwan, 'Abd-al- Halim 'Ali 'Abd-al-Halim, and al-Qadhdhafi  'Abd-al-Raziq 'Ali.

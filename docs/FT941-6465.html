			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Longuet sees alliances as industry's hope: John Ridding and David Buchan talk to a French minister with a difficult brief As minister for industry, trade, posts and telecommunications, Mr Gerard Longuet has one of the broadest and trickiest briefs in the French government. His in-tray bristles with delicate dossiers, from the restructuring of public sector companies selected for privatisation to the reform of France Telecom and the promotion of trade and investment links in international markets. Yesterday, for example, Mr Longuet was faced with the task of persuading Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, to allow a capital injection of FFr7bn (Pounds 812m) for Groupe Bull, the loss-making state-owned computer group. Brussels' decision on the capital increase will help determine the fate of one of the country's biggest technology-based companies. Bull is just one of the problems inherited by Mr Longuet when he took his post in March last year. With a budget deficit target of FFr300bn this year, the state cannot afford to fund loss-making groups and has embarked on a programme of privatisation to support the public coffers. However, to achieve this several companies from Bull to Pechiney, the aluminium group, and Usinor Sacilor, the loss-making steel group, need to be prepared for sale. For Mr Longuet, a self-declared liberal, but also a pragmatist, the solution is often to be found in industrial alliances. 'An important factor for Bull's privatisation is an increased relationship with its present partners, such as NEC,' says Mr Longuet, who believes the state's holding in Bull could be reduced to less than 50 per cent by the end of the year. He dismisses the political sensitivities which could arise from the sale of a substantial part of Bull's capital to a Japanese company. 'Mr (Jean-Marie) Descarpentries (Bull's chairman) has been given carte blanche,' he says. He expresses concern, however, about the sale of Rover to BMW, which angered Honda, the British company's partner. 'It is a precedent which is not favourable for relations of trust with the Japanese.' The industry minister's enthusiasm for alliances spreads beyond the resolution of public sector problems. In many cases, he views partnerships as the best means to strengthen the position of French companies on the international stage. 'Why do I want to privatise Renault?' asks Mr Longuet. 'It is to give it the opportunity to find partnerships with other companies. If the cards in the industry are reshuffled, there is no reason why Renault should not be involved.' Since the failed deal at Volvo, Renault has largely disentangled itself from the cross-shareholdings and industrial alliances that bound the prospective partners. Mr Longuet now hopes to privatise the French motor group this year, depending on the state of the financial markets. The most striking example of an alliance in Mr Longuet's domain, however, is to be found in the courtship between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, its German counterpart. The agreement last December between the second and third largest international telecommunications operators to create a joint venture to supply data and other services to clients is the first step towards a deeper industrial alliance which is expected to include the exchange of equity. For this to happen the French telecoms group requires a change in its legal status to transform it from a state agency to a public sector company with its own capital. The threat of union opposition, however, has forced Mr Longuet to delay such a change. Negotiations, he says, are being held in an attempt to win the support of France Telecom's employees, many of whom fear that reform is a prelude to privatisation. Mr Longuet says privatisation is not on the cards. But he is determined to allow the group to open its capital to forge alliances with international partners. France Telecom's defeat by British Telecom last year in the fight for the hand of MCI of the US is a precedent which Mr Longuet does not want to see repeated. The manoeuvrings of the French and German telecoms groups reflect the close trade and industrial links between the two countries. But according to Mr Longuet there is room for improvement in the commercial relationship. 'Germany has to accept the idea that there are other industrial countries in Europe,' Mr Longuet says bluntly. He cites the vehicle, transport and energy sectors as areas where co-operation should be increased with Germany to strengthen the competitiveness of European companies against Japanese and US rivals. One example is in high-speed railways, where the TGV produced by GEC-Alsthom is engaged in fierce competition with the German ICE consortium. Despite his emphasis on partnerships and alliances, Mr Longuet is confident about the strength of French industry. 'For a European country, that is to say a country with a certain level of social protection and salaries, France is very competitive.' In support of this he points to export figures, which rose in the final months of last year, despite depressed demand in markets such as Germany. But if France is to maintain its industrial strength, broader reforms are needed. 'The big challenge for a liberal government in France over the coming years is to reinforce our capital investment. We have to create the right conditions for domestic and foreign long-term investment,' he says, ruling out 'artificial' industrial policies that provide incentives for specific activities. The first step, he believes, is under way. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has said he will introduce reform of France's pension system which should encourage long-term savings and, through private funds, create vehicles for long-term stock market investment. Fears of extinguishing France's fragile consumer recovery appear to have pushed back the reform from spring to the autumn, but Mr Longuet is certain the reforms will take place. At least that is one problem in someone else's in-tray. Clinton accused, Page 6</p>

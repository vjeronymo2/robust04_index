			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Brussels wants universal letter monopoly to continue in Community countries THE European Commission yesterday said its green paper on European postal services would advocate the continuation in EC countries of monopoly universal letter services that were both affordable and efficient. A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, said: 'What it emphatically does not do is challenge or attempt to whittle away at basic minimum postal services in each member state.' It will advocate that the EC should have a universal letter monopoly. But this will not exclude measures designed to increase competition, such as ending cross-subsidies from reserved, or monopoly, areas to non-reserved areas. Thus member states will not be able to finance international mail with profits made from letters monopolies. Brussels intends to publish a policy paper on postal services within three weeks, which could be followed by draft legislation. Officials said the paper would concentrate mainly on international and intra-Community mail rather than domestic services. The green paper will not prejudge the content of future legislation on the issue, which would have to be approved by a qualified majority of EC member states. The paper will make it clear that liberalisation should be the rule and monopoly the exception. But it will not propose to end all existing monopolies. Member states will be able to decide to have a monopoly letter service more limited than the one proposed by the Community, but will still have to ensure a minimum universal letter service. The paper will advocate continued monopolies for some letters, postcards and addressed direct mail (up to certain limits). It will not include publications, goods-bearing items or express items, all market segments which have been subjected to extensive liberalisation efforts in individual EC states and in which there is often fierce competition with private sector providers. Some countries, however, such as France and Italy, have been conservative in their approach toward liberalisation of monopoly postal services. Britain and the Netherlands are the most advanced among EC states in opening up their postal services to private-sector competition. Each EC country will be able to define the universal service that must be provided. Any service now outside a country's national monopoly cannot be made part of that state's reserved area simply because the service is included in the set of reserved services defined at Community level. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi is the main commissioner responsible for drafting the paper, but Sir Leon has also been heavily involved in preparing it. Sir Leon is a strong advocate of breaking up public monopolies where they appear to distort competition or restrict benefits for consumers, but the EC treaty stops the Commission dictating whether particular businesses should be publicly or privately owned.</p>

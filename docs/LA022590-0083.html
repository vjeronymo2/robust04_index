			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA VOTES TODAY, U.S. AGONIZES TOMORROW;  </P> <P> POLICY: WASHINGTON IS IN TROUBLE NO MATTER WHO WINS THE NICARAGUA PRESIDENCY.  ENDING A HISTORY OF U.S. INTERVENTION IS THE BEST POSSIBLE RESULT.  </P> <P> A deeply divided Bush Administration awaits the outcome of today's elections in  Nicaragua: What to do if the despised Sandinistas win and remain in power? What  to do if they lose?  </P> <P> Either result poses profound problems. The White House fervently roots for the  victory of Violeta Chamorro, the opposition leader; her campaign has enjoyed  U.S. money and advice. The White House roots against President Daniel Ortega, a  self-acknowledged Marxist and a supporter of Central American leftist guerrilla  movements.  </P> <P> But a Chamorro triumph would not solve Nicaragua's aching troubles -- nor would  it assure a victory for U.S. policy.  </P> <P> The fate of that small, long-tortured little republic is once again at stake.  But so is the regional prestige and influence of the United States, after  nearly a decade of futile overt and covert hostilities against the Sandinista  regime.  </P> <P> If Ortega is reelected -- he won handily in 1984, when no credible opposition  candidate stayed in the race -- the Bush team will have to stomach a sour  reality: The democracy that Washington preached for Nicaragua worked for the  Sandinistas and not for Chamorro. This would be the ultimate, most ironic,  defeat of U.S. policy in Central America.  </P> <P> Not since the elections in Chile 20 years ago, when Salvador Allende, a  Marxist, was chosen president despite all-out U.S. support for his adversaries,  has a Latin American election contest so embroiled the United States. And the  postscript to the Chile episode -- U.S. attempts to destabilize the new  government, a military revolution that overthrew Allende and Allende's death  three years after his election -- brought new problems to Latin America and no  credit to Washington.  </P> <P> Today's Nicaragua elections follow a U.S. invasion of Panama by two months, the  military intervention designed to oust Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. Noriega had  become an obsession for Washington, indicted for his alleged drug-dealing and  despised for his ability to resist U.S. pressure. The obsession with Ortega is  milder but also based on frustration, on a U.S. inability to influence  Nicaragua politics despite overt and covert action.  </P> <P> The Panama invasion may have played right into Sandinista hands. It rearoused  nationalism. Nicaraguans remember that U.S. Marines intervened in their country  several times between 1909 and 1933. Many believe the Contra "freedom fighters"  are a product of U.S. design. Some voters may opt for Ortega solely on grounds  of resisting Washington.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration must weigh two possible scenarios:  </P> <P> Ortega Wins. With more than 1,000 observers on hand to watch over the  proceedings (from the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the  European Community and a delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter),  Ortega is extremely unlikely to attempt electoral fraud or intimidation. If the  foreign observers certify the validity of his reelection, Washington will have  no choice -- in terms of world opinion -- but to recognize Sandinista  legitimacy. Failure to do so would create an untenable situation for the United  States, in vivid contrast to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's posture of allowing nations  in the Soviet orbit to work out their own destinies.  </P> <P> The more relevant issue is how far and how rapidly the United States is  prepared to move in normalizing relations with Nicaragua. This is the nub of  dispute within the Administration: White House hard-liners believe that even  after an Ortega victory, conditions must be attached to any relaxation of  American pressures on Managua. The State Department seems ready to move faster,  on everything from the lifting of the economic embargo to the disbanding and  relocation of about 12,000 Contras, as provided for in the Central American  accords that led to election day.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, however, said as recently as Thursday  that the United States will make its own judgment about election fairness and  that better relations with Managua depend on "a sustained period of good  behavior in terms of refraining from subverting their neighbors." This kind of  insistence may imply a higher standard demanded of Nicaragua than of other  nations -- and could produce new policy disasters.  </P> <P> Disbanding and resettling the Contras -- inside or outside Nicaragua -- is an  urgent priority. If the Administration does not act rapidly, a new crisis is  bound to develop. Inside Nicaragua, about 3,000 Contras are still fighting a  guerrilla war. The larger Contra force is in neighboring Honduras, along with  wives and children. Thousands of armed men with no place to go and no organized  objective are a peril to the stability of both countries. Congressional funding  for humanitarian aid to the Contras runs out at the end of this month; no new  money is likely to be approved other than for relocation.  </P> <P> The demand that the Sandinistas end military assistance to the leftist  guerrillas in El Salvador is reasonable. Ortega may do that in return for  removal of U.S. economic sanctions. Nicaragua is about broke, shattered by war  and by economic mismanagement. The accords signed by Ortega and the four other  Central American presidents provided for cessation of armed help to guerrillas  anywhere in the region. But the Sandinistas reportedly violated that agreement  in attempting to deliver surface-to-air missiles to their Salvadoran guerrilla  friends.  </P> <P> At home, Ortega has released 1,200 political prisoners two weeks before the  election. He has largely restored freedom of expression in the media. Both  actions were self-serving and good for the campaign. But they also helped heal  the country. The United States extends considerable generosity to regimes  practicing more repression than does Managua. If the Bush Administration acts  with imagination -- and if Ortega does not respond with ideological tantrums --  Nicaragua may turn into a success story: another example of a nation enjoying  peaceful transition from leftist dictatorship to representative democracy, the  New World version of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Chamorro Wins. Washington will rush to embrace her victory but mammoth troubles  lie ahead. Chamorro is the standard-bearer for more than one dozen political  parties forming the Nicaraguan opposition movement. Representing so many  interests, many conflicting, there is no certainty that she will be able to  hammer together an effective government, even with massive U.S. aid. The battle  for power may erupt all over again under different banners.  </P> <P> Uncertainty will be exacerbated by reality: Sandinistas will retain control of  the armed forces and the police, plus many elements of the bureaucracy. To  attempt to replace the Sandinista army with Contra forces appears unthinkable;  that would trigger a new, bigger, deadlier civil war.  </P> <P> If the levers of effective power are not in Chamorro's hands, she may find  herself facing day-to-day Sandinista challenges in matters of governance. And  she will have few forces mobilized to assert authority. Washington could be  tempted to provide help, overt or covert, but this would reopen the old sores  among Nicaraguans. The U.S. Administration may have to decide whether  full-fledged economic assistance should be offered to Managua if indeed nobody  is really in charge and political battles continue.  </P> <P> The election may be Act II. The drama is certain to persist no matter who wins.  </P> <P> Real resolution will only come when Nicaraguans determine their own future,  when the United States has at last forsworn intervention in their lives. The  best way out of the morass is for the United States to accept the result of the  balloting -- and to display some old-fashioned American generosity toward the  impoverished and war-weary people of a republic that has obsessed us for so  long.  </P> <P> The United States was also a victim of obsession: The trials of the Iran-Contra  scandal are still with us. Former President Reagan and President Bush still  face possible embarrassment from the illegal arming of Contra guerrillas.  Nicaragua is a shadowy chapter of American history in need of new light.  </P></p>

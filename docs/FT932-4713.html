			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / The Tories can rely on Labour Mr John Smith has a choice. He can let a taxi-cabful of trade union bosses run the Labour party, or he can try to run it himself. It is not much of a choice. If he caves in to Mr John Edmonds, the general secretary of the GMB union, he might as well give up politics and retire to compose a guide to hill-climbing in the Highlands. If he fights for his party's independence he may lose anyway. The short-term winner can only be Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. The long-term beneficiary is likely to be the Conservative leader, whoever he or she may be at the time. Yes, the plot does have a familiar ring to it. The GMB voted yesterday to oppose the exclusion of trade unions from the selection of Labour's parliamentary candidates. Several unions also plan to retain their 40 per cent share of the vote for the party's leader and deputy leader. Mr Smith wants participation in the Labour party's procedures to be limited to members of the party. Mr Edmonds will have none of that. He refers to what he calls two groups of Labour members - the 200,000 individuals who pay by direct subscription, and the 4m. who pay a 'political levy' through their trade unions. 'We believe that everyone who contributes should have the right to participate,' he said. It sounds as reasonable as it is wrong-headed. So does the compromise offered to Mr Smith by the National Union of Public Employees' conference yesterday. Under this deceptive formula, Nupe's political levy-payers could declare themselves supporters of Labour and no other party, thus becoming 'registered' members. Like Mr Edmonds' rationalisations, this is a sham. Votes delivered by union machines to the party headquarters are not true democratic votes. They never can be. Somewhere along the line apparatchiks control them. The unions' inability or unwillingness to perceive this will be the death of the party they founded and still finance. 'Apparently some Labour politicians think we are an electoral liability,' Mr Edmonds said yesterday. He can say that again. Labour will not win another election if people think that they are electing puppets. The ineffably reasonable Mr Edmonds is demonstrating that he aspires to be a puppet master, first, last and always. He will do his best to retain control. If Mr Smith persists, Mr Edmonds will be able to demonstrate his power. He can deploy a negative 'block vote' of some 650,000 GMB members at Labour's conference in October. His fellow-bosses from the Transport and General Workers' Union, Nupe, the MSF union and others can throw in veto cards with a combined value of 2m-plus. End of story. A few general secretaries can thus publicly and unashamedly block reform in a manner that would turn the Russian parl-iament's speaker, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, puce with envy. This is not the end of Mr Smith's troubles. As he is discovering, the Labour movement can always be relied upon - by the Tories. Whenever the trade unions' party is doing well, a bogey-man comes along to act as a vote-repellent. Once it was Mr Tony Benn; another time it was Mr Ken Livingstone; for a while it was Mr Arthur Scargill. The latest aspirant for this historic post, which is surely nurtured by Conservative Central office, is Mr John Prescott, Labour's spokesman on transport. He was trounced when he put himself forward as a candidate for deputy leader, but he has learned nothing. Now he has emerged as the dummy on Mr Edmonds' knee, his wooden crescendos reverberating in public as he insults the team of 'modernisers' around Mr Smith. This little drama must be of some comfort to Mr John Major. The prime minister is in a spot of bother himself, but he can console himself with the thought that it is better to have governed and lost than never to have governed at all. Whether he stays or goes, he will have won a general election and made his mark. The Labour leader has no such consolation to rely on. If, as seems possible, Mr Smith is brought down by Mr Edmonds, he will never have experienced the delights of sitting in Number 10 Downing Street and enduring the vilification of the media and the electorate. Only Mr Ashdown can smile at what is happening. He has much to gain, and nothing to lose. The leader of the Liberal Democrats may indulge himself in fantasies about becoming prime minister, but he is not likely to perish of disappointment if he fails to achieve what most people believe to be impossible. After all, under-secretary of state for Wales in a Labour-led coalition is still further than he can realistically hope to get. Yet today he is enjoying a fine run, which may become prolonged. Only four years ago he stood amid the ruins of the former Liberal and Social Democratic alliance, a symbol, some said, of the end of third-party politics in Britain. Now the Liberal Democrats can fairly claim the support of perhaps a quarter of the voters. Mr Ashdown commands an advancing army of local authority councillors. He can look forward to further triumphs in the south-west of England. His party's recent victory at Newbury cost Mr Norman Lamont the chancellorship; its possible forthcoming win at Christchurch could cost Mr Major his premiership. It will be seen at once that these excursions into the land of power are likely to be short-lived. The Liberal Democrats are prospering because the government is regarded as incompetent and Labour remains unmodernised. To be fair, Mr Ashdown has added to his party's strength by taking unequivocal positions on matters such as the Maastricht treaty and intervention in Bosnia. Voters can see through the careful equivocations of the prime minister and the leader of the opposition; some are attracted by the Liberal Democrat's clear-cut stands on principle. But that said, Mr Ashdown has not managed to sell any overriding general principle that, in the electorate's eyes, would both distinguish his party and dispel the killer belief that it can never win. Well then, can Labour? A slam-bang open battle for control with the union leaders, with Mr Smith laying his job on the line and yet winning, could solidify the Labour vote. I'll believe that when I see it. A Lib-Lab pact? We are more likely to see the two non-conservative parties cancel one another out, as the government climbs upwards from its post-recession trough.</p>

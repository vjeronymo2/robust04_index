			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Franc faible could fortify the French FRENCH politicians and industrialists were yesterday grappling with a new set of risks and rewards as the government's franc fort policy of maintaining a stable currency looked close to collapse. The widening of fluctuation bands for the French currency from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent leaves the franc more than ever vulnerable to the foreign exchange markets. But by decoupling the franc from its rigid D-Mark parity, the move may also provide the scope for the interest rate cuts that are necessary to revive the economy and sharpen the competitive edge of French exporters. The foreign exchange markets yesterday seemed to be pointing towards a franc faible (weak franc). However, most economists cautioned against a snap judgment on the fate of the franc. 'Of course we can expect strong pressure in the short term,' said Ms Marie Owens-Thomson, international economist at Midland Global Markets. 'But once the market finds its feet the franc should stabilise at between FFr3.50 and FFr3.55 to the D-Mark.' The consensus view is that there is little prospect of the franc depreciating by the full amount permitted by its more flexible fluctuation band. Political considerations will encourage the government to limit the fall in the franc. 'The strong franc has become an important symbol of French identity,' says one Paris-based diplomat. Mr Edouard Balladur's government has committed itself to maintaining the stability of the currency and its parity with the D-Mark. But the government is also determined to reduce interest rates to stimulate the economy. 'Ultimately, the French people are much more concerned by the prospect of unemployment than by the stability of the franc,' said Mr Dominique Mosi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations. 'There will be a lot of Frenchmen who think a weaker franc may be bad for our pride but good for our economy.' Yesterday the government played down the prospects of rapid cuts in interest rates, emphasising instead the need to keep the currency stable. 'The absolute priority is the stability of the currency both internally and externally,' said Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister. But reduced borrowing rates are clearly on the agenda. 'We want to open the way to interest rate cuts by unblocking the EMS (European Monetary System) constraint,' said Mr Alain Madelin, minister for small business, who advocated floating the franc in December last year. According to Mr Madelin, there was no contradiction between maintaining the value of the franc and reducing interest rates. He argued that the assaults on the franc during the ERM crisis were not a result of the fundamentals of the French economy and that the stimulatory effects of interest rate cuts would restore confidence in the foreign exchange markets. He believed it should be possible to reduce intervention rates  - which set the floor for money market interest rates - from the current level of 6.75 per cent to about 4 per cent. Economists are largely in agreement. 'The fundamentals are strong,' said Mr Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'Inflation is half the rate it is in Germany and exporters will be given a boost by any depreciation.' French companies were almost universally positive about the prospect of lower interest rates. Although most large companies have placed the bulk of their debt at fixed interest rates, many have faced steep bills for the interest payments on their short-term borrowings, such as bank overdrafts, at floating rates. Small companies tend to have less sophisticated financial arrangements and have been badly affected by high interest rates. 'There is no question that lower rates will ease the financial pressure on the corporate sector,' said Mr David Harrington, French market strategist at James Capel in Paris. 'And they should eventually help to restore confidence in the domestic economy.' Meanwhile, any weakening in the franc augurs well for exporters. 'It's good news for us,' said Mr Claude Taittinger, chairman of Taittinger, the French champagne house which relies on exports for two thirds of turnover. Other companies have also suffered. The total value of French exports fell by 12 per cent to FFr279bn (Pounds 31.8bn) in the first quarter of this year, according to the Customs Office. The car industry suffered a 20 per cent fall in foreign sales during that period. French exporters cannot expect to see an improvement across the board, given that a number of European currencies are likely to fall with the franc. However they ought to become more competitive in stronger currency markets such as Germany, the UK and US. One of the main arguments in favour of the franc fort policy was that it created a stable currency for exporters. But most companies yesterday seemed willing to view the risk of instability as a cheap price to pay for greater competitiveness in their export markets. 'The only real problem would be if the currency markets became very unstable,' said Mr Taittinger. 'After all, we want to concentrate on making champagne, not on gambling on exchange rates. We don't want the franc to become a yo-yo.'</p>

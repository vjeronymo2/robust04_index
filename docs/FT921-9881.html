			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Red flags fly once more in the heart of Moscow THE RED FLAGS flew once more in the heart of Moscow yesterday as demonstrators claiming to be carrying forward the ideas of Lenin - and, on some banners, Stalin - mounted a protest against the country's economic misery, writes John Lloyd from Moscow. At a separate gathering of 'patriotic groups' on Saturday, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president, took his opposition to the Russian government a stage further when he called its policy 'economic genocide' - the exact phrasing of a number of yesterday's posters. However, where the demonstrators were calling for a reassertion of Communist power to stop the rot, Mr Rutskoi, an air force general, said he feared such a reassertion if the course were not changed. Both Mr Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's chairman - who has criticised economic policy on Russian television - insisted that they supported President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Rutskoi said that he and the president had no differences, while Mr Khasbulatov said that he was 'like-minded, in strategic terms'. Yesterday's neo-Communist marchers, numbering some 50,000, were led by Mr Viktor Antipov, who is the most active of a number of leaders among Russia's hardline groups. A significant number of the placards blamed the policy on the Jews. Others called for freedom for the leaders of the failed August coup, while a number of demonstrators carried photographs of Stalin, the red banner - the banner of the former Russian Socialist Federation - the St Andrews Cross of old Russia; and the black, yellow and white imperial banner. The militia, out in force, kept the march away from the Russian parliament - its original objective - where some 10,000 to 15,000 democrats heard speeches about the need to defend democracy and support the president.</p>

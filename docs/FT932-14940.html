			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: US tires of waiting for bite of Japanese apple market 'EMPTY boxes, empty promises' reads a sign hanging from empty apple crates displayed at an American food fair in Osaka this week. The display by the Washington Apple Commission, which represents growers producing 60 per cent of the US apple crop, reflects mounting frustration at Japan's reluctance to open its market. Although Japan officially liberalised this market in 1971, it has been rejecting imports through strict quarantine rules about pests and diseases. Such import restrictions are viewed as a structural trade barrier by foreign agricultural exporters, although the Japanese contend the matter is purely technical. The US took action to meet Japan's rules for pest control in 1975. However, after 18 years of waiting, it is accusing Japan of dragging its feet. Last week, the US embassy in Tokyo filed an official complaint claiming the technical aspects had been resolved and that Japan's slow processing was a non-tariff barrier. 'Apples are symbolic of Japan's attitude,' says Mr Tom Hale, president of the Washington state group. 'We've been patient and thorough with the Japanese, and it's not a matter of science any more, but of politics.' The US wants the market open by next January. The US has spent considerable sums trying to meet Japanese requirements for controlling the codling moth pest and fireblight disease. However, when the US Agriculture Department sent data on treatments, Japan then raised concern about another pest. A Japanese official warned the US not to treat the matter as a trade issue. 'We still haven't received a proper explanation from the US why it does not allow Japan to export mandarins to orange-producing American states,' he said.</p>

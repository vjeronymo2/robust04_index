			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS;  </P> <P> AIRLINES' LOST-LUGGAGE RULES DIFFER  </P> <P> Question: When an airline lost my baggage, it would not compensate me because I  hadn't filed a claim within a week. Is this legal?  </P> <P> Answer: Each airline has a different statute of limitations. Some may give you  three months, others demand notice of loss on the spot. Always keep copies of  paperwork and names of those you contacted at the airport.  </P> <P> Q: We're planning a vacation with our trailer this winter. Will there be any  gas limits for such vehicles?  </P> <P> A: Energy officials in Washington say no such controls are presently being  contemplated.  </P> <P> Q: How late in the year are cruises run on the Baltic?  </P> <P> A: Cruise service usually discontinues in the winter, although ferries operate  year-round.  </P> <P> Q: How do you get a job as a courier carrying documents to different countries?  </P> <P>  A: Although this is largely a government function, some private companies do  engage people to transport confidential material. Check local courier services  for information.  </P> <P> Q: Are there air excursions that fly over the North Pole?  </P> <P> A: A check of current Alaska and Northern Canada tour offerings show no such  flights. However, there's always the possibility that a local air service may  undertake such flights. Check your travel agent for such information.  </P> <P> Q: With the big interest in Eastern Europe, will there be local cruises  available along inland waterways?  </P> <P> A: Operators are looking for a large expansion in European river cruising, not  only in Eastern Europe but on the more popular Rhine and Danube rivers. Check  travel agents for 1991 schedules and itineraries.  </P> <P> Q: Someone has opened a travel agency in his home and is selling air and cruise  tickets obtained from other agents at no increase in prices. Is this possible?  </P> <P> A: Anybody can open a travel shop, but airlines won't issue tickets or pay  commissions to agents not accredited by the Airlines Reporting Corp. (ARC) or  the International Airlines Travel Network. Accredited agencies sometimes will  handle reservations and ticketing for such outsiders.  </P> <P> Q: We're planning a trip to Australia visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Ayers Rock  and the Gold Coast. Are there air discounts available?  </P> <P>  A: Both Australian Airlines and Ansett offer discounts and low-priced air  passes for visitors to Australia with savings up to 40% over normal fares.  Regional airline East/West also offers discounts. With deregulation of the  airlines set for later this year, look for more special promotional fares.  </P> <P> Q: Must airlines notify passengers if there is a change in departure time of an  international flight?  </P> <P>  A: No, but most airlines try to notify passengers' travel agents if they  change published schedules. However, it would be best for you to check with the  airline a day or two prior to departure.  </P></p>

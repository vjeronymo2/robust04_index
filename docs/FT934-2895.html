			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Italian unions in one-day strike Italy's powerful engineering unions yesterday staged a one day strike to highlight the growing number of plant closures and lay-offs, writes Robert Graham from Rome. Union leaders also threatened similar action in January if the government and employers failed to respond with measures to help offset the employment crisis. Demonstrations were staged in all Italy's main industrial cities with 15,000 marching through the centre of Rome shouting angry slogans demanding job protection and a new industrial strategy. The protest was held against the backdrop of two benchmark sets of negotiations over job losses and lay-offs - at Fiat's cars division and at Olivetti, the computer and office equipment group. Fiat is proposing to lay off 10 per cent of its car workforce for two years as of January and is seeking a 5 per cent cut in jobs. Olivetti is seeking to prune a further 2,000 jobs from its 18,000 strong Italian workforce. In recent protests Fiat plants have been little affected. But yesterday there was 80 per cent adherence to the strike call at Arese near Milan, the Fiat plant most at risk of closure.</p>

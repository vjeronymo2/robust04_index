			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul May 30 TASS -- "South Korea is looking forward  to Russia's assistance in the effort to settle the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula. It will strive to get the  Russian Government's support to possible U.N. Security Council  sanctions against the Korean People's Democratic Republic during  the summit negotiations in Moscow," a representative of the  presidential chancery, who preferred to remain anonymous, told a  briefing for foreign journalists here today.    He said that the South Korean-Russian summit, which is to  take place during South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's visit to  Moscow (from June 1 to June 4), would be of great importance for  the security of the peninsula. The Seoul leadership is  disturbed by North Korea's efforts to develop its own nuclear  weapons. It calls for international measures to influence  Pyongyang if the latter refused to comply with its commitments  under the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty. In this  connection, the support given to this stand by Russia and other  major powers would be very important for South Korea.    The presidential representative noted that the possibility  of  Security Council sanctions was growing due to the recent  replacement of fuel rods in North Korean 5 megawatt nuclear  reactors without the control of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA). Kim Yong- sam plans to discuss this problem with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Moscow and  to find out what would be Russia's stand in this connection.    Commenting on Moscow's proposal to call a multilateral  conference on the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula with  the participation of Russia, the United States, Japan, China,  the Republic of Korea, the Korean People's Democratic Republic,  and leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, the South Korean  president's representatives noted that the Seoul government was  "carefully studying" the idea. "However," he said, "it is first  necessary to see how the situation on the peninsula develops  under the impact of continuing efforts exerted in the same  direction by the United Nations and the IAEA."    During his talks with Boris Yeltsin, the same source  informed, Kim Yong-sam plans to discuss the terms of the treaty  of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, which was  concluded between the USSR and the Korean People's Democratic  Republic in 1961. The South Korean side is particularly  interested to know whether Russia would be inevitably drawn into  a military conflict if it broke out in Korea.    According to the YONHAP news service, a meeting on problems  of security was held in Seoul today. President Kim Yong-sam  instructed his government during the meeting to take preparatory  steps against any surprises linked with the unpredictability of  Pyongyang's nuclear plans. At the same time, south korea  reaffirmed during the meeting its intention to continue the  efforts to overcome the current crisis by peaceful means.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Donor countries and  international organizations concluded two days of talks on the  reconstruction of Cambodia on Friday [11 March], having pledged  over 700 million dollars in new aid for the next two years.  Delegates said the donors pledged a total of 486 million  dollars of aid projects and programs for this year and half that  amount for 1995.    The meeting of the International Committee on the  Reconstruction of Cambodia [ICORC], chaired by Japan, was  attended by delegates from 32 countries, the European Union and  12 international organizations.    One senior Japanese Foreign Ministry source said the amount  pledged was more than expected, particularly in light of the  so-called "aid fatigue" believed to have set in among many donor  nations.    "Tokyo seems to be a lucky place for Cambodia," said another  senior Japanese official, referring to the last such meeting  here in 1992 when participants pledged 880 million dollars. The  pledges came in answer to a call from ailing Cambodian King  Norodom Sihanouk, read out at the meeting on his behalf, for a  modern-day "Marshall Plan" to help the war-ravaged country back  on its feet.    Many, if not most, of the delegations participating in the  two-day meeting pledged fresh funds toward the roughly projected  200 million dollars that Cambodia will require over the coming  year.    Japanese parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma  pledged on Tokyo's behalf the equivalent of 87.7 million dollars  in grant aid for the coming year, while U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher announced 73 million dollars in new U.S.  assistance to Cambodia over a two-year period.    Among international financial institutions, the Asian  Development Bank (ADB) announced it will provide Cambodia with  some 129 million dollars in loan assistance for 1994-97, as well  as technical assistance of some 28 million dollars for the same  period. The World Bank said it is planning to offer Cambodia  roughly 75 million dollars in reconstruction assistance in the  coming fiscal year.    The first ICORC meeting, held at a working-level in Paris  last September, saw 119 million dollars in fresh commitments  added to the 880 million dollars pledged at a previous  ministerial conference on Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992.  While most of those funds were for short-term financial  support, the present ICORC meeting is focused on Cambodia's mid-  to long-term aid requirements.    At the outset of the meeting, Cambodian First Prime Minister  Norodom Ranariddh conveyed an appeal from his father Sihanouk,  who has been undergoing medical treatment in Beijing.    "The gift of which my country has the greatest need, having  suffered from so many years of turpitude and devastation, is  none other than a new unconditional Marshall Plan gauged to  specific needs," Sihanouk said in the message. Sihanouk's  reference was to a multibillion-dollar plan drawn up by late  U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall in the late 1940s to  rehabilitate the shattered economies of post-World War II  European nations.    Japan was the largest donor at the conference, followed by  the U.S. and france, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Of the 15.77 million dollars committed to the Cambodia Mine  Action Center, the U.S. was the largest contributor, followed by  Japan and Australia, they said.    During the meeting, Cambodia explained its economic and  development policies. Cambodia's shift toward a market-oriented  economy seems to be progressing steadily, the officials said.  International organizations such as the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) positively evaluated  Cambodia's reconstruction efforts, they said.    The participants of the conference also agreed to hold the  third ICORC meeting next year in Paris as scheduled, but timing  of the conference has not yet been set, the officials said. The  Cambodian delegation also expressed its intention during the  conference to join the Yokohama-based International Tropical  Timber Organization (ITTO), the officials said. The ITTO  consists of 23 timber producing countries such as Brazil,  Colombia and Peru, and 26 consumer countries such as Australia,  Japan, Canada, China and the U.S.</p>

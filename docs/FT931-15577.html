			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum receives unwelcome approach from US THE TABLES have been turned on Aberdeen Petroleum, the USM-quoted oil and gas group, which yesterday became the focus of a surprise announcement of an unwelcome approach from a US company. This follows last month's announcement of its merger proposals with Brabant Resources, which were rejected. Houston-based Bellwether Exploration has said that in December it approached the UK-quoted company with merger proposals on the basis of 3.75 Aberdeen shares for each of its own. Based on an exchange price of Dollars 1.5395 to the pound, and Bellwether's share price of 62 1/2 cents, the proposal values each Aberdeen share at 10 3/4 p. Mr Darby Sere, chief executive of Bellwether, said the announcement was made in light of the almost-50 per cent rise in Aberdeen shares since the approach had first been made. He stressed the synergies between the two groups, which both own and operate North American assets. If an eventual offer succeeds, then the enlarged company would lose the USM quotation. Bellwether, an oil and gas exploration and production company, is traded on Nasdaq in the US. It has a market value of about Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.5m) and is 80 per cent held by three UK institutions and Torchmark, the US insurance company. The Bellwether proposal was believed to be somewhat different from the tentative arrangements discussed in the earlier informal meetings.</p>

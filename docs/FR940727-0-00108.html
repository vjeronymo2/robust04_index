			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Figure H&hyph;3. Guide for Testing Defective Items Under Criminal or Civil Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Testing Defective Items Under Criminal or Civil Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Under no circumstances is testing to proceed unless the command has committed sufficient funding to cover the entire cost of the projected testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. No testing will be initiated unless there has been a written request for the testing to the appropriate Procurement Fraud Advisor from a criminal investigator or Assistant United States Attorney or Department of Justice Attorney (AUSA is used in these procedures to indicate either an AUSA or Department of Justice attorney). If they have not already done so, criminal investigators should be requested to coordinate their testing requests with the AUSA overseeing the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Barring extraordinary circumstances, only one test will be conducted to support the criminal and civil recovery efforts of a procurement fraud/irregularity matter. Early coordination with the Civil Division of Department of Justice or the local United States Attorneys Office is necessary to ensure that testing funds are not wasted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The request for testing should include a clear, concise statement of the purpose of the testing to include a statement of the allegations made and the contact number(s) involved.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Any test plan which requires destructive testing must be approved by the AUSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. No testing will be initiated unless a test plan has been developed which states the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> a. the contract number(s) involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. the National Stock Number (NSN) of the item to be tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. the purpose of the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. the alleged defect or the contractual requirement violated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. the CID report of investigation (ROI) number or the DCIS case number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. cost of the test (a cost proposal should be an attachment to the test plan)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. where the test will be conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. how the test will be conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. the name and telephone number of the test team leader  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. the names of all test team members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> k. the approximate dates of the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> l. the date that completion of the test is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m. a clear statement of the desired product (that is test report, raw data, analysis of results, evaluation of test results)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> n. the PRON to fund the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> o. a retention plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 6. The test plan shall be coordinated with the concurrence received in advance from the appropriate personnel in the Procurement Directorate, Product Assurance and Test Directorate, the Procurement Fraud Advisor, and the investigator/AUSA requesting the test. No testing will be initiated until the criminal investigator/AUSA who requested the testing has approved the test plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. If the items tested are to be retained as evidence, the criminal investigator should arrange for retention of the evidence. While the Command will support evidence retention, this is primarily the responsibility of the criminal investigators. Agents should be advised that putting items in Code L or similar non-use status is insufficient to protect it from being released to the field. A decision not to retain the tested items as evidence must have the approval of the AUSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. All items to be tested should be from a statistically valid random sample. The sample should conform with the inspection requirements of the contract or be in conformance with a random sample specifically developed for the instant test plan. It is recommended that a statistician be consulted to determine the feasibility of a random sample specifically created to support the test plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Results of testing should be available to Command and DA personnel for appropriate contractual and administrative remedies. Any request for testing results that indicates that dissemination of the testing results will be limited by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be forwarded through the MACOM or AMC Procurement Fraud Coordinator to DA Procurement Fraud Division prior to the initiation of any testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Resolution of problems associated with testing requests should be conducted at the local level. In AMC the authority to refuse a testing request resides with the Office of Command Counsel. Any disputes which cannot be resolved at the local level will be forwarded to the AMC or MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator for resolution. This includes disputes regarding funding or any time sensitive issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Second requests for testing of the same item due to a change in the investigative plan require coordination by the PFA with the investigator and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  AUSA overseeing the investigation to determine the deficiencies in the earlier test. Disputes which cannot be resolved between the AUSA, PFA, and investigator regarding testing are to be forwarded simultaneously to the MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator and PFD for resolution. The procedures established in paragraphs 5 and 6 apply for second requests for testing with the additional requirement that the Assistant United States Attorney must be requested to approve the test plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

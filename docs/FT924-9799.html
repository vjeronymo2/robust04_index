			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Tories signal support for PM MR John Major appeared last night to have made a breakthrough in his efforts to thwart the Tory revolt in today's critical Commons debate on Maastricht after five of the party's most prominent rightwing MPs indicated they were preparing to give him their public backing. With the prime minister fighting to avoid a House of Commons defeat that would threaten the future of the treaty and his own political career, leading members of the '92 group, including the chairman Sir George Gardiner, met Mr Major and now plan to write to him saying they will support the government today. They urged colleagues to rally behind the prime minister, although they will reserve their position in future. Hard-line Euro-sceptics, numbering at least 30, still threaten the government's majority, but the public endorsement from a previously rebellious wing of the party could be critical in persuading other waverers to swing behind the prime minister. Cabinet ministers are increasingly confident of victory tonight. Further help may yet come from some of the nine MPs of the Ulster Unionist party who, although supposedly anti-Maastricht, may abstain or even vote with the government. Earlier yesterday, Mr Major clashed with a European commissioner over the implications of the Maastricht treaty. He described as 'very silly and ill-informed' a speech in which Mr Martin Bangemann said Maastricht was a milestone on the road to a federal Europe. Mr Bangemann, Germany's senior commissioner, is a vice-president of the European Commission. A group of 34 Euro-sceptic Tories and one Ulster Unionist met last night to discuss tactics. Mr James Cran, Tory MP for Beverley, said: 'We have got 37 who will take a tough line tomorrow.' The Ulster Unionists meet this morning, but will not decide their position until just before the vote at 10pm - perhaps allowing time for ministers to hint at incentives such as establishment of a Commons Northern Ireland select committee or extra regional assistance for the province. Downing Street refused to contemplate the possibility of defeat, saying the prime minister expected to win. He saw more Tory MPs at the Commons yesterday. Tory MPs are under orders from their whips to attend Parliament tomorrow, which would ensure an easy government win on a confidence motion, should there be such a debate. It was clear Mr Major was annoyed by the timing - if not the content - of the speech Mr Bangemann gave at a Berlin conference on Europe's future. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said Mr Bangemann was 'an official' who had not been involved in European summits at Maastricht, Lisbon or Birmingham. The European Commission had made it 'absolutely clear these were personal remarks by Mr Bangemann and did not reflect the views of the Commission', Mr Major said. 'Nor, I can assure you, are they my views, the views of this government or the views of any mainstream government in Europe,' he added. Mr Major was backed last night by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner, who said Mr Bangemann had given 'a purely personal view'. However, Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, said Mr Bangemann had 'let the cat out of the bag'.

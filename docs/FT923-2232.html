			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: The Force of Destiny - Opera The long-awaited new Force of Destiny at the English National Opera is serious, decisive, absorbing, ultimately unsatisfying. It reveals a thorough-going attempt to contain all the elements of Verdi's tremendous operatic canvas without resort to either 'editorial' intervention or simple-minded naturalistic spectacle. It lays a clean, lucidly argued grasp on the theme - the pitilessly unchanging nature of human passions and obsessions - that runs like a blood-red thread through all the variegated episodes of peace and war, inn and monastery, town and country. Alike by the conductor, Mark Elder, and the producer, Nicholas Hytner, it is worked with considerable theatrical acumen. The scene-changes are fast, the visual strokes arresting (semi-abstract, semi-symbolic props balanced against bright-coloured 19th-century costumes); there is practical encouragement of some impressively concentrated, musically and dramatically authoritative leading performances. In Josephine Barstow, a long-celebrated ENO Leonora, the staging possesses a leading lady whose immense powers of physical and vocal theatricality have been distilled to a new and sublimely potent essence: she seems to have re-charged the character's whole being, so that every phrase, every detail become suffused with a dark, tragic radiance unmatched in my experience of this opera. There is an ambitious new translation by Jeremy Sams, surer of tone in comic and demi-caractere mode than in dramatic. And yet, on the evidence of Wednesday's opening performance, the show fails to click. The problem is partly of Verdi's making: the familiar 1869 Scala revision, preferred by ENO, may smooth down the rough edges of the 1862 St Petersburg original (which both the Welsh and Scottish companies and the Proms have with profit explored in recent years), but Act 3 in its expanded and re-ordered form sprawls uncomfortably. It is a problem compounded by the recourse of the ENO designer, Richard Hudson, to the stage revolve, which whirls the basic set (a strikingly shaped half-cone bounded by a rising stairway) round and round to provide each new scene-change. As so often in a production based on the activities of a dominant stage machine, what starts off as a boon-bestowing technical solution ends by disgorging difficulties of its own - in this case, a noisy whoosh and hum and an overly forceful tucking of every loose end into the design pattern. Hytner drills his soldiers, orderlies, camp-followers, whores, recruits and beggars (all distinctly well-scrubbed and smartly dressed) round the perimeter and into the central cavity in a manner that seems oddly 'showbiz' for this most intellectually stringent of the younger British opera-producers. (Preziosilla's 'Rataplan', which Verdi re-sited to form a splashy but narratively distracting curtain to the 1869 third act revision, is here a Big Number surprisingly coarsely executed.) In some successful Forza productions of recent times the opera's disjunctive dramaturgy has been transformed into a virtue (of an extraordinarily modern kind). In this one the hanging-together comes to seem a feat of physical imposition rather than of textual re-imagining. In the foreground, though, the characters are placed and confronted with the clarity (which means, among other things, stillness in moments of reflection) and intelligence that are the more familiar Hytner fingerprints. Jonathan Summers's Carlos, ravaged by the end into a figure of terrifying madness, is an astonishing creation, embodied and enacted with fierce discipline - of all on stage he makes consistently most of the words. John Connell, whose unforced bass seems to be developing new resources of power and emotional range, proves a very strong Father Superior, ruggedly human, sympathetically placed alongside Alan Opie's brilliantly vivid Melitone. And Edmund Barham, using his ringing tenor with greater malleability of tone and line than previously on this stage, rises to the tragic pessimism of Alvaro's role with genuine largeness of stature. He, and all the others, owed much to the Verdian steadiness and 'long line' of Elder's conducting, even if it lacked much of the forward-moving excitement that also needs to inform a Forza performance. Sponsored by Friends of ENO; in repertory at the Coliseum until October 15</p>

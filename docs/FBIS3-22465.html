The highest standards of accountability, probity and  financial control must operate in the NHS, said Virginia  Bottomley, the Health Secretary, yesterday.    The new guidelines have been introduced following the  Cadbury  report on corporate governance and financial scandals in the  Wessex and West Midlands health authorities which drew criticism  from the Audit Commission and the Public Accounts Committee.    As predicted, the codes call for the setting up of a special  committee by each health board to consider thee remuneration of  chief executives and other senior officers. A recent study  criticised the pay of some chief executives, with reports that  the chief executive of one trust hospital in London received a  package worth around &pound;130,000 a year.    Health authority and trust members are reminded to keep a  strict curb on using taxpayers' money for hospitality, and to  refuse excessive hospitality from suppliers.    "Chairmen and board members should act impartially and  should  not be influenced by social and business relationships," say the  guidelines.    The codes set down clearer definitions of the functions of  chairmen and non-executive board members, a requirement to  establish remuneration committees, and a duty by members of NHS  boards to declare private interests relevant to NHS business.    The remuneration of chairman, executive and non-executive  board members must be published in annual reports.    At a press conference to launch the guidelines, Mrs.  Bottomley said excessive pay deals to chief executives would not  be tolerated, but in some cases it might be possible to justify  high salaries if better care to patients resulted.    David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the new rules  would do little to raise standards to accountability in the NHS.    "Most right-thinking people would have assumed that all the  suggestions being made would already be in place. They will be  appalled to discover they are not," he said.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Germany halts arms to Turkey GERMANY yesterday suspended supplies of military equipment to Turkey, its Nato partner, and bitterly criticised the government in Ankara for its attacks on Kurdish settlements in the south-west of the country. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, called on the European Community to condemn the Turkish actions, which he described as in 'total contravention' of the Helsinki Final Act, and contrary to its commitments as a member of the CSCE and Nato alliance. The sharp confrontation comes only days after Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, bluntly rejected an appeal by President George Bush to support full Turkish membership of the EC. Officials in Bonn said the German leader did not disguise his opposition to the Turkish membership application, and observers said that the latest dispute can only strengthen German resistance. 'Everyone is opposed to Turkish membership, but no one dares say so publicly,' a senior official said. Germany instead is pushing for EC enlargement negotiations to include up to five Efta countries - Austria, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Switzerland - as well as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland before Turkey is considered. German outrage at the Turkish operations against the Kurds has been stoked by alleged evidence that military equipment supplied by Bonn from the former East German army has been used in the raids, and by a Turkish accusation that Germany was harbouring terrorists from the PKK Kurdish nationalist movement. The arms suspension was announced yesterday in a formal government declaration, demanding an answer on whether and how armaments supplied by Germany had been used in the military operations. Germany also reminded Turkey 'that the requirements of the relevant agreement make it clear that this materiel may be used exclusively by the Turkish armed forces to defend itself against an armed attack on the Nato treaty area.' On Wednesday, the German government announced its concern at the use of security forces against the civilian population in Turkey. It condemned every form of terrorism, and rejected Turkish accusations that it supported the so-called PKK. The Bonn statement went on to insist that: 'Turkey must measure itself as a subscriber to the values of the western community - in particular as a member of the Council of Europe and the CSCE - and according to the corresponding conventions on human rights and the protection of minorities.' The German government has provided Turkey with military assistance worth DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.92bn) since the mid-1960s, including DM1.5bn in connection with the Gulf War.

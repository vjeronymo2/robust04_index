			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / People: A Trinity of top jobs It should come as no surprise that Philip Graf (above), is to succeed David Snedden as managing director and chief executive of Trinity International Holdings next month. Snedden stays on the board as a non-executive director. The job is one of the best in the newspaper industry. Trinity, an independent with headquarters in Chester, publishes 44 UK newspapers and 59 in Canada or the US. Its flagship titles are the Liverpool Daily Post and its sister evening paper, the Echo. The careers of the two men have been intertwined for the past 20 years starting at Thomson Regional Newspapers, where Snedden ran The Scotsman and the Belfast Telegraph, and Graf was a protege. Graf, 46, tried to move to Liverpool from his native Northern Ireland in 1978, when he was offered the job of marketing services manager of Trinity's flagship titles, but a furious Snedden, who was Thomson's joint managing director, counter-offered with a promotion to the Western Mail in Cardiff. But when Snedden moved to Trinity in 1982, he had no compunction about offering Graf a job two years later. Since then Graf has held a succession of posts, grooming him to succeed Snedden on retirement - at 60, a requirement of Trinity intended to keep the management fresh. Graf says that Trinity - cash-rich with only 15 per cent gearing - would continue to look for more acquisitions and hoped they would be more friendly than Trinity's aborted, contested bid for Southern Newspapers last year. Trinity also announced the appointment to its board of Leo Coligan, 44, managing director of the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo, and Stephen Parker, 40, managing director of the group's weekly papers.</p>

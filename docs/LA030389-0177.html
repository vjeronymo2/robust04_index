			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY BISHOP APPOINTS VICAR FOR AREA'S LATINO CATHOLICS  </P> <P> Bishop Norman F. McFarland of Orange County today appointed Father Jaime Soto  as the new vicar for the Latino Catholics in the diocese.  </P> <P> The position is regarded as extremely important because the vicar represents  400,000 people -- half the diocese -- many of whom remain undocumented, or  under-represented in predominantly English-speaking parishes. Of 300 Masses  celebrated every Sunday, 60 are in Spanish.  </P> <P> Soto, 33, was ordained in 1982, was associate director of Catholic Charities  and a priest at Our Lady of Guadalupe (Delhi), a predominantly Latino parish in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Soto succeeds Archbishop Tomas Clavel who died in October.  </P></p>

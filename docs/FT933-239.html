			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Israeli peace fatigue blocks Rabin's road to Damascus: Obstacles to a deal on the Golan THE GIANT banners are everywhere. One hangs from a window-sill next door to Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's Jerusalem residence. Another is festooned across the top floor of a towering luxury apartment complex overlooking parliament. A third has been planted into a small hillock alongside the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. The message, loosely translated: 'The Golan Heights are an integral part of Israel.' The banner campaign, backed up with the distribution of car stickers bearing the same message, was dreamed up by a group of Israeli right-wing activists several months ago, before the news broke that Israel had secretly reached an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation to grant limited self-rule to the Palestinians of the occupied territories. The activists were mainly Jewish settlers, residents of the occupied West Bank. But since the mainstream Israeli population had little sympathy for the settlers, having watched successive hard-line Likud governments pump money into settlements instead of towns and poor neighbourhoods inside Israel, they focused their efforts on resisting territorial compromise on the Golan - an issue for which there is a far wider national consensus. Their hope was that the Israeli electorate would first join them in demanding that Mr Rabin reject Syrian demands for an Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights ridge, captured from Syria in 1967, and then back them in their demand for the maintenance of Israeli rule over the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip as well. The settlers, like other Israelis and, for that matter, the rest of the world, were caught off guard by the accord with the PLO. They barely had time to organise a couple of protest demonstrations before Messrs Rabin, Peres, Arafat and company were gathering on the White House lawn. Within days, Israeli opinion surveys were showing that about 60 per cent of the public were behind the autonomy deal. The banner campaign had apparently failed. But most days, as he leaves his home, or glances at the back windscreen of the car in front, Mr Rabin must still see the message. And the interviews he has given in the past few days suggest that he has absorbed it. The US is pressing Mr Rabin to follow up the deal with the PLO and the agreement with Jordan on a joint 'peace agenda' by working for a similar breakthrough with Syria. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is heading for the region next month bent on mediating an accord between Mr Rabin and Syria's President Hafez Assad. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is urging Mr Rabin to cut a deal with Damascus. And Israeli and Syrian negotiators in Washington have done most of the work on a joint declaration of principles for peace. Yet Mr Rabin is holding back. He knows that the road to a truly comprehensive Middle East peace leads only through Damascus - that once an accommodation is reached with Syria, Lebanon would follow immediately, the Arab boycott of Israel would be lifted and the new era of regional harmony he speaks of might at last be at hand. But Mr Rabin also knows that the Israeli public is still grappling with the concept of 'Yassir Arafat, the peace partner'. After all, as he confessed at the White House two weeks ago, it was not easy for him to make the leap. He knows that a second peace punch might just knock the Israelis out. If, only weeks after rehabilitating Mr Arafat, he were to announce a deal with President Assad - one that would necessarily involve withdrawal from most, if not all, of the Golan - he might lose his mainstream support. In the short term Mr Rabin has no urgent need for an agreement with the Syrians. The Israeli-Syrian border has been quiet for almost 20 years. And in southern Lebanon, American-mediated understandings have ensured that Syria limits the activities of the radical Hizbollah and Palestinian gunmen to attacks on the Israeli 'security zone' rather than sovereign Israeli territory. It may well be that, behind the scenes, Mr Rabin is signalling a certain readiness for compromise with Damascus. That would seem to be a pre-requisite for preventing President Assad from working actively to torpedo the accord with the PLO. But publicly, Mr Rabin continues to accuse the Syrians of 'preventing progress', of inflexibly demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, of talking peace while quietly encouraging war. For all the American presure and all the tantalising possibilities of wider Arab reconciliation, Mr Rabin appears to have decided that a deal with Syria can wait a while. He has been reading the banners.</p>

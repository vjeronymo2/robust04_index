			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Markets: Scare stories put a little fizz into trading - Wall Street IT HAS been a week for quashing scare stories on Wall Street. The most bizarre of these tales concerned PepsiCo, the soft drinks company, which found itself at the centre of a national product tampering fright. People across the US suddenly began alleging that they had found objects, mainly hypodermic needles and syringes, in cans of Diet Pepsi. One man was interviewed on television describing how a needle pricked his lip as he sipped Pepsi from the can. But by the end of the week the scare seemed to have all the elements of a sick hoax. The US Food and Drug Administration said it had been unable to confirm even one case of tampering and Pepsi declined to withdraw the product from retailers' shelves, stressing that it had no evidence of interference with the Diet Pepsi production process. Wall Street's fears of accelerating inflation received similar treatment this week when the federal government released May's consumer price index. For weeks the markets had been fretting about a sharp upturn in inflation in the first four months of the year, when consumer prices grew at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent, compared to 2.9 per cent in all of 1992. The Federal Reserve had hinted that it would tighten monetary policy for the first time in four years if the trend persisted - a move which would have probably prompted a sharp stock market correction. In the event, May's consumer price figures, released on Tuesday, showed a scant 1 per cent rise. That confirmed the evidence of the previous Friday - when the producer price index showed no increase for May  - that inflation presents no immediate threat to the US. This may keep downward pressure on bond yields and give support to stock market valuations. But the equity market may be unable to make much progress beyond the trading range of the past month - when the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved between 3490 and 3560 - without overcoming its anxiety over the second quarter results season, which begins in mid-July. The US economy seems to be growing solidly, if unspectacularly, at around a 3 per cent annual rate, but that still leaves room for some nasty earnings surprises, both at home and among multi-nationals exposed to weak markets in Europe and Japan. The airline sector fuelled these anxieties this week when USAir - in which British Airways holds a minority stake - and then AMR, parent company of American Airlines, the nation's largest, issued profits warnings. American said its earnings in the second quarter would be 'significantly worse' than analysts' forecasts, which had been pitched around net income of Dollars 75m. It blamed lower-than-anticipated traffic in May, which was continuing into June, and said international performance was 'very weak.' USAir warned that it would show after-tax losses for both the quarter and 1993 as a whole. The warnings sent airline stocks in general sharply lower, since it dashed hopes that the business was finally turning the corner after nearly three years of record losses. HJ Heinz, the foods group, found its stock under pressure after it announced a Dollars 192m pre-tax charge against fourth quarter earnings to pay for a range of cost-cutting moves, involving an 8 per cent cut in its worldwide workforce of 35,500. Tony O'Reilly, Heinz's chairman, said this would help speed up productivity improvements and concentrate a three-year rationalisation programme into a year. But analysts said the action was a sign of the price pressures being put on big consumer products companies by the extremely competitive retailing industry, and several lowered their forecasts of Heinz's 1994 earnings. Kay Whitmore, the embattled chairman of photographic products group Eastman Kodak, scarcely got a more enthusiastic reception on Wall Street when he announced plans to spin off the group's chemicals company as a separately quoted company. Whitmore is facing strong shareholder pressure to improve Kodak's lacklustre earnings and analysts had long urged him to dispose of the chemicals business. So when the announcement finally came, it was distinctly anti-climactic and was seen as one small step in the group's struggle to turn around. The spin-off is just an hors d'oeuvre, designed to satisfy Wall Street's hunger for action before Whitmore unveils his master plan for Kodak in September. But if that fails to impress, there will be some real flashing of sharp instruments.  ------------------------------- Monday       3514.69  +  9.68 Tuesday      3492.00  -  22.69 Wednesday    3511.65  +  19.65 Thursday     3521.89  +  10.24 Friday       3494.77  -  27.12  -------------------------------</p>

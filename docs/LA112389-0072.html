			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CRAVEN LEADS SPIRITED FLYERS PAST CANADIENS  </P> <P> One of the big stories in the NHL this season is the play of the Philadelphia  Flyers, despite injuries to key players and the suspension of standout  goaltender Ron Hextall.  </P> <P> Hextall, suspended for the first 12 games, has missed all but two others  because of injuries. Tim Kerr, their top scorer, and Brian Propp, their top  playmaker, have recently undergone surgery.  </P> <P> The Flyers haven't lost their spirit, however. Murray Craven had two goals and  two assists Wednesday night at Philadelphia as the Flyers defeated the Montreal  Canadiens, 5-1.  </P> <P> The Flyers welcomed back right wing Scott Mellanby, who played his first game  after undergoing surgery on his left forearm, which he severely damaged in a  barroom fight during the off-season. Mellanby had an assist.  </P> <P> The Flyers started fast. They outshot the Canadiens, 9-2, in the first period,  and built a 2-0 lead on goals by Rick Tocchet and Craven.  </P> <P> Backup goaltender Ken Wregget made the lead stand up, although he faced seven  shots in the first six minutes of the second period.  </P> <P> "Craven has been our most consistent forward all season," Flyer Coach Paul  Holmgren said. "He sucked it up a lot when we lost Tocchet and (Ron) Sutter.  Now that they are back, the line is flying."  </P> <P> Montreal Coach Pat Burns was so disturbed by the Canadiens' poor performance,  he never emerged from the dressing room to answer reporters' questions.  </P> <P> Buffalo 4, New York 1 -- The Sabres scored three times before the game was 13  minutes old to remain the only team in the NHL unbeaten at home.  </P> <P> Christian Ruuttu, Pierre Turgeon and Scott Arniel had early goals and Daren  Puppa made 27 saves to run the Sabres' record to 9-0-1 on their home ice.  </P> <P> Puppa improved his record to 9-2-4. He lost his shutout early in the third  period when rookie Darren Turcotte scored his 13th goal.  </P> <P> The Sabres (13-5-4) moved into a tie for first place in the Adams Division with  Montreal, which has played four more games.  </P> <P> Washington 5, New York Islanders 3 -- In the first quarter of the season, the  Capitals played pretty well but had trouble scoring.  </P> <P> With Mike Ridley and Dino Ciccarelli leading the way at Landover, Md., the  Capitals ended a four-game winless streak and displayed an offense.  </P> <P> Ridley had two goals, and Ciccarelli, not known as a playmaker, assisted on  three goals. The Capitals outshot the Islanders, 16-4, in the first period and  built a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> New Jersey 6, Pittsburgh 3 -- Bruce Driver set up four goals to lead the Devils  to victory at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The Devils, in ending a four-game winless streak, stopped the Penguins'  three-game win streak. In the last three games, Driver has a goal and eight  assists.  </P> <P> Mario Lemieux assisted on all three Pittsburgh goals to extend his scoring  streak to 10 games.  </P> <P> Quebec 4, Hartford 2 -- The Whalers know they have a problem on home ice when  they can't beat the struggling Nordiques.  </P> <P> Defenseman Jeff Brown broke a 2-2 tie with a 55-foot shot on a power play with  4:42 left to give the Nordiques just their sixth win in 23 games.  </P> <P> The Whalers have lost four in a row at Hartford and are 4-8-1 at home this  season.  </P> <P> Minnesota 6, Toronto 3 -- After going scoreless for the first 21 minutes at  Bloomington, Minn., the North Stars got offensive.  </P> <P> They scored all six of their goals in the next 26 minutes. Mike Gartner scored  two and has 14 this season.  </P> <P> The North Stars took 54 shots at Toronto goalie Mark LaForest, who stopped the  first 27. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

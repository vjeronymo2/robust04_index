			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Mandarins in the slow lane SOME government departments are failing to answer MPs' letters promptly and they meet their targets in only one case in four, according to figures for last year released by Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister. The figures show that bottom of the league with just 24 per cent of replies dispatched within the target period was the Scottish Office. It performed only marginally worse than the Department of Transport which achieved 26 per cent. Star performers with 92 per cent of letters answered on time were the Central Statistical Office and the Department of Trade and Industry. The CSO, however, had only one letter approximately every 10 days to deal with.</p>

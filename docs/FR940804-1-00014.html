			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Flexibility To Negotiate a Method to do a Major Portion Analysis on a Case-By-Case Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS is considering adding new regulatory language that would allow lessees the flexibility to negotiate with Indian Tribes and allottees a method of fulfilling the value of a major portion of production from a field or area. MMS seeks comments on the feasibility of such an approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Dual Accounting Scenarios <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Wellhead Sale of Gas and the Gas Is Processed (Seller Not Owner in Gas Plant) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this scenario, the lessee typically sells gas prior to processing in a gas plant. The lessee should know the gross proceeds accruing under the sale of gas at the wellhead. To fulfill the dual accounting requirement, the lessee is also required to obtain the actual sales values of the residue gas and gas plant products after processing. Lessees have made MMS aware of the difficulty, in some instances, in obtaining all of the information necessary to determine accurately the value of production. On July 27, 1992, MMS issued a letter to payors describing a theoretical dual accounting method that can be used to approximate the value of gas after processing. Although this method has helped, MMS has been made aware that there are still problems in obtaining information that is both timely and accurate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To facilitate the process of obtaining all of the information (such as gas plant efficiencies, processing charges, plant fuel and flare volumes, and fractionation costs) necessary to accurately do dual accounting, MMS is considering the following alternatives: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;MMS could draft regulations requiring owners of plants that process Federal and/or Indian gas to report the processing information directly either to MMS, the lessee, or both. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;MMS could attempt to obtain information on plants that process Indian gas from State agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMS requests comments on the feasibility of requiring plant owners to make processing information available to lessees or MMS. MMS also welcomes suggestions for any other possible alternatives for obtaining this information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMS is also considering establishing a single basin-wide processing allowance that would be used by all lessees or could be used when the lessee does not have actual processing plant information. MMS requests comments on using basin-wide allowances that the MMS would periodically calculate and publish. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Gas Is Sold at the Tailgate of a Gas Plant <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this situation, the lessee should have all of the data pertaining to the sale of the processed gas. To fulfill the dual accounting requirement, the lessee must determine the value of the unprocessed gas at the wellhead. When there is no sale of gas at the wellhead, the wellhead unit value ($/MMBtu) of the gas for royalty purposes could be determined by using: (1) Gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or nearby fields or areas; (2) the unit value of the residue gas; (3) gas price indices posted in publicly available national publications; or (4) the price arrived at by performing a major portion analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMS seeks comments on the availability of information and the accuracy of the above methods in determining the value for royalty purposes of unprocessed gas at the wellhead. MMS further seeks comments on what specific publications are used by industry for index prices. MMS also seeks comments on using the highest price in the range, the index price, the average price, or some combination of prices if index pricing were used in dual accounting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Gas Is Sold Under a POP Contract <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS requests comments on the following methods of determining value of gas at the wellhead under a POP contract when doing dual accounting: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Gross proceeds under the POP contract, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The unit value of the residue gas, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Gas price indices posted in publicly available national publications, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAITH, HOPE AND RACIAL DISPARITY;  </P> <P> AS MULTICULTURAL MARRIAGES INCREASE, CHURCHES CONFRONT A CALL FOR GREATER  SENSITIVITY, SUPPORT  </P> <P> It was a Sunday. Through the crowd of departing parishioners, the pastor eluded  her through one door; she chased after him through another. Her voice was  quiet, firm and full of fury.  </P> <P> "I demand to be counseled," Ruth Bryant White told the Rev. Tom Wolf, pastor of  The Church on Brady in East Los Angeles, one of the city's most ethnically  diverse Baptist churches.  </P> <P> The preacher already had spoken to her future husband, Steve White. She said:  "I want to know why you decided to do premarital counseling to Steve and did  not ask me to come."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scriptural Silence  </P> <P> By that time, recalls White, a lean, 34-year-old woman with granite-like, high  cheekbones, "I really didn't want to be counseled by him. I just wanted to make  a point: Because I'm black and have had three children doesn't mean I'm dumb. .  . . I know 'The Word,' " says White, who recently became an ordained,  nondenominational Christian minister. "And there's nothing scriptural to  justify a prohibition against interracial marriage."  </P> <P> But the pastor never claimed there was, says Steve White, 40, an elementary  school teacher. Instead, "he said he was against the marriage because Ruthie  had been with two other men (the father of her three children born out of  wedlock) and it was as if she was married to them before she met me. Since that  was the case, she should make an effort to get back with them. . . .  Irrespective of the fact that they were never married and these guys are not  Christians. . . ."  </P> <P> Says Ruth White: "We know Brother Tom -- he is still our brother -- has  interracial couples in his church but they usually are not black and white  couples. The problem mostly comes . . . when blacks and whites want to marry  because of society's long-standing prejudice against blacks."  </P> <P> When the pastor failed to persuade Steve White not to proceed with the wedding,  other members of the congregation "started to work on him," says his wife.  </P> <P> "One handed me a list of 15 reasons why I shouldn't marry Ruth" and did  everything short of pounding the list to the door like Martin Luther, says  Steve. Nonetheless, the couple were married by a minister in 1980.  </P> <P> But they believe that things have not improved much since then for other  evangelical Christians who are considering, or already are in, an interracial  marriage and want counseling based on the tenets of their faith.  </P> <P> As a result, the couple in 1984 formed "A Place for Us," a Christian ministry  based in Gardena. The Whites both are certified Christian counselors and were  ordained in 1984 as nondenominational Christian ministers by Living Waters Inc.  of Garden Grove. They also are the authors of "Free Indeed, the Autobiography  of an Interracial Couple," and have appeared on locally and nationally  televised talk shows.  </P> <P> Wolf, 44, and the pastor of The Church on Brady for 20 years, is pained by the  Whites' "misinterpretation" of events in 1980. He does not remember ever  counseling either of them. Further, if he had, it would be inappropriate to  reveal what went on in a pastoral counseling session with them or any other  church member, he says.  </P> <P> But in principle, he adds: "We try to take seriously the Judeo-Christian world  view, the deep affirmative world view of the unity of the human race."  </P> <P> Any kind of "mixed marriage," he insists, has problems built into it. "A man 42  marrying a woman 22 is a mixed marriage" and will have its problems, too.  People from different "socioeconomic backgrounds" are a mixed couple. "But the  only situation that is passed onto children is the interethnic one. . . . When  you get on to larger ethnic diversions and gene isolation and then pass it on  to children you have to work with" what perceived physical differences mean in  society. "Many times bicultural children, based on ethnic and racial  appearance, feel they don't fit in either world," he says, adding that he  raises these issues for examination, not to condemn interracial marriage.  </P> <P> While most Christian ministers preach against prejudice from the pulpit,  "benign neglect" typifies the attitude of most pastors toward the issue of  interracial marriage, Steve White claims. "The racism is often subtle."  </P> <P> Christian counselors and clergy "are often into denial about the challenges  interracial couples face in a racist society," says Ruth White. "Christian  individuals and couples dealing with interracial issues obviously don't benefit  from either denial or neglect. They need positive guidance, something concrete  to give them spiritual strength.  </P> <P> "This is a city, this is a country becoming more diverse every day . . . look  at all the blacks and Hispanics and Asians who are drawn to the evangelical  movement, who are born again. We don't push interracial marriage, but it's  inevitable that there will be more and more in this kind of social  environment."  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Evangelicals, based in Wheaton, Ill., estimates that 20%  to 25% of Americans describe themselves as "born-again" Christians. How many of  those are black, Latino, Asian or other ethnic minorities is unknown.  </P> <P> "A lot of people believe in God," says Ruth White. "They want to go to church,  they want to bring their children up right . . . but the very thing they  believe in is turning them away in many instances."  </P> <P> Many Christian ministers might counter that interracial marriage is still  relatively rare in the United States and there is little social motivation to  preach about it.  </P> <P> But the increases in these marriages have been "statistically significant,"  says Steve Rawlings, a U.S. Census Bureau family demographer. In 1988, there  were 218,000 marriages between blacks and whites, compared to 181,000 in 1970,  three years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down anti-miscegenation laws.  In 1970, there were 310,000 interracial marriages beyond those involving blacks  and whites. In 1986, the last year for which figures are available, these  marriages had more than doubled to 827,000.  </P> <P> The Rev. Jack Hayford -- pastor of First Four-Square Church of Van Nuys and an  internationally known and respected Pentecostal clergyman -- explains that "I  wouldn't say anything any differently to (an interracial couple) than I would  to any other couple." At his 7,000-member church, also known as the Church on  the Way, "we have a very involved prewedding counseling program" that lasts  eight weeks.  </P> <P> Couples also have three sessions in private with a member of the pastoral  staff. "In these encounters, at the private level and the group level, one of  the great challenges any couple has is to appreciate the social, economic and  spiritual values and family traditions" that may differ between families. While  these differences might exist because they are from "different ethnic groups or  racial cultures . . . it would not be discussed from the standpoint of a racial  or ethnic matter, but simply as a human matter."  </P> <P> Some Christian leaders, however, "actually preach against interracial  marriage," asserts Steve White, who claims Dr. James Dobson's ministry is one.  </P> <P> Dobson, whose $12.2-million ministry headquarters is in Pomona, is not an  ordained minister but a broadcaster and Christian psychologist to the nation's  evangelical families. He is considered one of the most influential voices in  conservative Protestant America.  </P> <P> His "Focus on the Family" radio shows are heard on 1,300 radio stations. And  while his lay ministry -- he is a layman in the Church of the Nazarene --  addresses primarily family issues, he has become a political figure, too.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority,  called Dobson the Religious Right's "rising star." An ardent foe of abortion  and pornography, Dobson served on the U.S. Attorney General's Commission on  Pornography in 1985-86, one of several Reagan Administration appointments. Last  year, he was among those conservatives who urged Congress not to override  former President Reagan's veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act.  </P> <P> Dobson was out of the country and could not be reached. But a spokesman, Paul  Hetrick, a Focus vice president, said that Focus on the Family does not  "actively oppose" interracial marriage, nor has it ever done a program on the  issue.  </P> <P> When pressed to answer questions on interracial marriage -- "and we haven't  been pressed often at all," says Hetrick -- the group has recommended that  people contact organizations like A Place for Us.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Risky Business'  </P> <P> But, Hetrick says, "I think Dr. Dobson believes, and Focus takes the position,  that marriage is a risky business, not just interracial marriage, but any  marriage. . . . And it is difficult to forge a successful relationship even  under the best of circumstances.  </P> <P> "In interracial marriages there are even greater strains on the relationships.  Typically, couples can undergo rejection by family members and (there are) the  strains of cultural differences. All these place added stress on the children  and the marriage. . . . For those reasons, Dr. Dobson would not recommend  interracial marriage -- not because of racial discrimination -- but because it  often leads to marital problems."  </P> <P> Says Church on the Way pastor Hayford: "That point of view . . . is humorous to  me now. . . . I don't mean that I think that it's humorous today that anybody  thinks it." But those sociological barriers are "precisely . . . the substance  of the statement I concluded in a paper I wrote in graduate studies 25 years  ago. It's humorous that I once thought that and hear it repeated back in my  ears by somebody in 1989. That's not meant as a slur on Focus on the Family. I  never have a negative point of observation to make about other ministries. It's  just humorous today that anybody thinks it."  </P> <P> Hayford, 55, is a regular on Christian television, is heard on 70 radio  stations and in 1985 was named one of the nation's 10 leading  Pentecostal-Charismatic church leaders by Charisma magazine, a leading  publication in the field.  </P> <P> A native of Oakland, Hayford says that despite having many black friends as a  youth, he was a product of the "socially segregated culture" that characterized  America most of this century. So, "I find it believable that segments of the  Christian church, which are essentially WASPish -- and I don't mean that  unkindly, it's just a fact" -- can't imagine any other conclusion than the one  Dobson reached on interracial marriage. "It's not even a matter of being  racist. It's just that you can't imagine anything else . . . because your life  isn't exposed to anything else other than that general order of experience."  </P> <P> What "helped open my eyes has been living in this stew pot of L.A.," says  Hayford. "I know that it's a farce in God's eyes that people should not  intermarry. And as I traveled more internationally . . . I began to discover in  the Christian Church in foreign nations interracial couples. I encountered them  so constantly that I recognized what had been a sociological position in my own  mind was in fact nonsense."  </P> <P> The nation's largest Protestant denomination, the 14.7-million-member Southern  Baptist Convention -- of which Wolf's Church on Brady is a member -- has  numerous projects aimed at serving the country's increasing ethnic and racial  pluralism. The denomination does not know the racial and ethnic makeup of its  members.  </P> <P> But it does know what the face of America is now and what it is projected to  look like by the third or fourth decade of the 21st Century. It then will be a  nonmajority population, with most of the population growth among nonwhites --  primarily Latinos, according to the Population Reference Bureau in Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Explicit Discussions  </P> <P> That scenario is discussed "quite explicitly," says the Rev. Dr. Emmanuell  McCall, 53, who directs the Black Church Extension division of the Southern  Baptist Convention Home Mission Board in Atlanta, which is responsible for  evangelism and church growth in the United States and its territories.  </P> <P> "One of the things we try to do at the six Southern Baptist seminaries, and in  ethics and other classes that deal with human behavior, is prepare pastors to  counsel in a way that accepts that kind of diversity as a given in our  society," he said. "And then, be prepared to counsel people who intend to  intermarry in a way that prepares them for the challenges without necessarily  cautioning them against it."  </P> <P> Further, says McCall, "we help to develop churches that would be open and  supportive to anybody who may come into their midsts, rather than be  exclusive."  </P> <P> Theory and practice don't always mesh, he agrees, but adds: "There has been and  continues to be a widening acceptance of black and ethnic peoples" in every  aspect of the Southern Baptist Convention.  </P> <P> "Having come to this agency 21 years ago, I remember how very racist it was. As  a black man who has come up through the ranks and gone high in the structure,  and been able to bring others along with me, I'm pleased with the progress  we've made. But I wouldn't rest on any laurels. We still have a ways to go."  </P> <P> Catholicism, like Judaism, is more concerned with issues of faith, not race, in  intermarriages. The Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles' Office of Family Life  offers extensive premarital counseling for Catholics. In the archdiocese,  couples receive formal counseling, which may last one day, an evening or a  weekend, said Father James C. Gehl, director of the Office of Family Life.  </P> <P> In the formal sessions, engaged couples can raise issues of concern to them,  explains Gehl. More important, all couples meet several times with their parish  priest and can explore more intimate matters in depth. "Interracial couples,"  he says, "are still an exception, especially when you talk about color. A  little more common when you talk about ethnic background, for example, an  Oriental with an Anglo."  </P> <P> Reminded that, too, constitutes an interracial couple, he says: "Yes, that's  true. I guess I'm thinking black-white. I haven't seen as many of those, though  they surely take place. And the church has no problem with that. But there are  no specific points that we want to bring across in regard to interracial  marriage."  </P> <P> The National Conference of Catholic Bishops recently published a handbook for  parish priests to use in pastoral premarriage counseling called "Faithful to  Each Other Forever." It does not cover interracial couples, Gehl says, adding,  "That's interesting. It's an area of concern, but obviously the Catholic Church  has not seen it as a major stumbling block. If it had been, no doubt it would  have come out in this study."  </P> <P> Roosevelt Brown, 40, is a black Christian married to a Jew. His two children  are being raised Jewish. He has no plans to convert to Judaism and sees no  problem in raising his children in a home with a dual religious identity --  perhaps because he is not "tied to any religious dogma. And I believe in the  Old Testament," as do Jews, says the financial adviser.  </P> <P> Brown, his wife, Nancy, and children "pray to the same God." There is no  problem, he says. He was even one of the original board members of Temple Shir  Shalom in Mar Vista, the Reform synagogue his family attends.  </P> <P> Shir Shalom's rabbi, Neil Comess-Daniels, thinks the Brown children one day may  confront problems from their growing up in a mixed-background family. But  that's because Roosevelt Brown has not converted to Judaism, not because he is  black.  </P> <P> "The fact that he is black has never entered into anything here," the rabbi  says. "I think that's because Reform Jews are sophisticated enough to know that  Moses was a . . . lot blacker than I. Jesus probably looked like Anwar Sadat."  </P> <P> Jews, says Comess-Daniels, did begin "as a people who were intent upon keeping  their 'racial purity' intact. The early Biblical stories note how the founding  fathers and mothers of the tradition wanted their own children to go back to  their own family, in their own homeland and marry distant cousins rather than  marry idol worshipers -- the pagans they were living around. That perspective  broke down when the Jews went into Egypt . . . because we came out as what is  called the mixed multitude."  </P> <P> During the "400 years we were supposedly enslaved in Egypt, there was a good  deal of intermarriage going on and it was at least somewhat tolerated. That is  the way some of us interpret the mixed multitude."  </P> <P> Moses, he says, "was married to an Ethiopian." As for Moses himself, "whatever  race he was, we are not sure, because his mother and father were slaves and  their racial background we don't know."  </P> <P> Whether Reform, Conservative or Orthodox, rabbis all state emphatically that  race has never been a barrier to marriage between Jews. It's not even  considered an intermarriage, which Jews consider to be a marriage between a Jew  and a non-Jew, says Conservative Rabbi Paul Dubin, executive vice president of  the Los Angeles Board of Rabbis.  </P> <P> "There is no question in my mind that an Orthodox Jew would accept the marriage  of a dark Yemenite and a Caucasian Jew, both being Jewish, as against a Jew  marrying a Catholic, both being good-looking, blond, blue-eyed Caucasians,  because there is a chance that the children would be lost to the Catholic or  Christian tradition," Dubin says.  </P> <P> As for Comess-Daniels' interpretation of the "mixed-multitude," Jack Simcha  Cohen, an Orthodox rabbi and now president of the Los Angeles rabbis' board,  agrees with it -- in part. There have been, he says, conversions to Judaism  among "different nations and different races throughout the world." So Jews are  a mixed multitude. But "are we, by nature, a mixed racial and cultural lot?  That's a pretty high level of conjecture with zero possibility of demonstrative  proof. Therefore, anybody who wants to can make any leap into the unknown, and  that's all it is."  </P> <P> Because of the sense of "peoplehood" that exists among Jews -- an ethnic  identify that transcends religion -- it can be difficult for a converted Jew to  be fully accepted socially by other Jews, says Comess-Daniels.  </P> <P> African-Americans like Roosevelt Brown have their own sense of peoplehood and  tradition, too, though it is possible to incorporate both the African-American  and Jewish cultural traditions in a Jewish home, says Comess-Daniels. That is  one of the many challenges in a pluralistic society, says the rabbi, sitting in  his office in a building he shares with an Episcopal church.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Across the Centuries  </P> <P> He leans forward. He has a final story: Not long ago, a contingent of American  Jews went to an Ethiopian province. "They landed in a jet, then took a  five-seater plane, then they had to go by horseback and then walk."  </P> <P> One among the Americans spoke Amharic and translated. "Where's the synagogue?"  he asked the Ethiopian Jews. They pointed to a hut that looked like all the  others, only bigger.  </P> <P> "Is that the ark where the Torah is?" the translator asked. It was. "And what  is your Torah portion for this week?" The translator started to cry, the rabbi  said. The others asked him why. "We have not been connected with these people  for centuries and it's the same Torah portion . . . word for word.  </P> <P> "That's what makes somebody Jewish. That connection, that vibration. There are  Jews of all races."  </P> <P> And nowhere is it written that a Jew, whatever color, should not marry a Jew.  </P></p>

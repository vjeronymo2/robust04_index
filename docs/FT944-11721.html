			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sale is likely drugs prescription - Tim Burt considers Boots' plans for its pharmaceuticals side Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is likely to face tough questions next week on its strategy from an unexpected quarter - its own managers. Senior staff from the pharmaceuticals division will meet head office executives ostensibly to review the company's first-half performance. But the year-long review of the drugs business is likely to overshadow the proceedings. Managers conducting the review, prompted by the withdrawal last year of the heart drug Manoplax at a cost of almost Pounds 40m, have considered selling the business, launching a joint venture or retaining it in a radically restructured form. While reluctant to indicate the group's favoured option, Mr Gordon Solway, managing director of Boots Pharmaceuticals, warned yesterday that job losses were inevitable. 'Whatever happens, there are bound to be redundancies in research and development in Nottingham.' In what may be seen as a blow to the city, he added that Boots had not asked potential bidders to maintain a presence in the East Midlands as a condition of any acquisition. Of the possible options, a disposal has looked increasingly likely in recent months following the group's decision to issue a sales memorandum and hire Credit Suisse First Boston as financial advisers. A number of companies have been linked with the division, which offers laboratory and sales expertise in the the UK and a marketing and distribution network in North America, the world's largest pharmaceuticals market. Zeneca, Britain's third largest drugs group, is thought to have examined the business, but was put off by the asking price. Medeva has also ruled itself out, leaving analysts' attention focused on continental European bidders. They have identified three possible suitors: Knoll, part of the German BASF; Menarini of Italy; and Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group. Yesterday, however, Astra denied having any interest while its German and Italian rivals refused to comment. Nevertheless, a consensus has emerged among City analysts on Boots' long-term intentions. Their scenario envisages the pharmaceuticals business being sold for more than Pounds 700m, greatly strengthening the group's cash resources. Profits on the disposal could help fund a share buy-back, which would reassure investors frustrated by the dilutive effect of the Pounds 900m Ward White acquisition in 1989. Analysts suggest the company might then feel confident enough to acquire an over-the-counter drugs business in continental Europe, preferably in Germany, for about Pounds 500m. Mr Solway said although no decisions had been reached, senior managers in the pharmaceuticals division were under no illusions about the review process. 'They recognise that their prospects are better if we were to change hands and become part of a major pharmaceuticals player.' He denied, however, that the uncertainty over the division had harmed its performance. Buoyant demand for Synthroid, the treatment for thyroid deficiency, helped lift the division's profits by 71 per cent from Pounds 29.2m to Pounds 49.8m. Research spending has also been maintained and sales have risen from Pounds 215.5m to Pounds 228.1m, although the second half is not expected to be so healthy because wholesalers stocked up in the first half. Sir James Blyth, chief executive, welcomed the figures. But with most pharmaceuticals companies facing over-capacity in research and stringent regulatory hurdles for new drugs, he admitted there was no choice but to reassess the value of the division. 'We were not alone in having problems and there was no choice but to reconsider our future in pharmaceuticals. But I don't believe we have painted ourselves into a corner.'  ------------------------------------------------------------- BOOTS PHARMACEUTICALS Half-Year Sales  -------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Pounds m  ------------------------------------------------------------- Prescription   Brufen/buprofen - anti-inflammatory             37.7   Froben/flurbiprpfen anti-inflammatory           16.4   Prothiaden/dothiepin anti-depressant             9.2 Synthroid (Dollars 117.0) - Thyroid replacement   78.2 Total                                            141.5 Other products*                                   77.9 BHC                                                6.2 Total                                            225.6  -------------------------------------------------------------                                 1994       1993                               Pounds m   Pounds m  ------------------------------------------------------------- Licence income total             2.0       13.6 Research and Development        33.1       30.4  ------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes Esberiven (France) at Pounds 14.7m  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

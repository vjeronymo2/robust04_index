			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andre Erdos, Hungarian ambassador to the </F> United Nations, by Laszlo Gereb; place and date not given: "Our  International Obligations Are More Important"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The importance of a dialogue  with Belgrade markedly appears in official statements about  Hungary's policy toward former Yugoslavia. Does this contradict  UN policy?    [Erdos] Not at all, on the contrary: The political  settlement requires a dialogue with all sides, irrespective of  how the international community judges any of the sides morally  or politically. Generally, I find it extremely important to  have a rational and consistent Hungarian policy toward our  neighbors, and I find a courageous initiative quite correct.  However, let me add that relations with the Serbs seems to be a  separate issue, because things occurred along our southern  border and this makes our system of relations there different  from our relations with Romania, Slovakia, or any other  neighbors. This does not at all contradict the fact, in terms  of Hungarian policy regarding the Yugoslav crisis, that it was  clear from the very beginning that this policy is not against an  ethnic group, against the Serbian people, but against a certain  Serbian policy and the means used to implement this policy,  means repeatedly condemned by the UN Security Council such as  the forced acquisition of territories, ethnic cleansing,  barbaric violations of human rights, and the destruction of  historical and cultural values.    I think that both international and specific Hungarian  viewpoints are equally important in our Yugoslav policy and, in  the current political context, it would not be desirable to form  some sort of priority. In other words, we must equally consider  the future good-neighborly relations with Serbia and the  viewpoints of the ethnic Hungarians living in Vojvodina as well  as the principles and behavior norms declared at the London  conference on the former Yugoslavia and stipulated by the  obligatory Security Council decisions. We know from our own  experience that keeping our international obligations is  directly proportional with the prestige of Hungary's foreign  policy and the credibility of our positions.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Zeneca With the timetable for demerger set, haggling over the valuation of Zeneca, the bio-science side of ICI, can begin in earnest. Whatever the outcome, the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue planned for June will be priced below the level envisaged by management when the plot was hatched. The healthcare sector has underperformed the market by 40 per cent since the start of 1992. Hence Zeneca may emphasise its recovery promise in speciality chemicals and agrochemicals, which together account for 60 per cent of sales. Stripping out costs attributable to ICI, specialities made perhaps Pounds 45m profit last year on sales approaching Pounds 1bn. Assuming trading margins of 10 per cent - after restructuring and a favourable exchange rate  -operating profits of Pounds 100m should be achieved in a good year. The outlook in agrochemicals is clouded by the reform of the CAP and pressure on prices. Any big advance on last year's Pounds 85m trading profit may require weather conditions that give pests a field day. Pharmaceuticals may thus still have to provide the engine for growth. Zeneca has survived the kind of patent expiry now confronting others. If that makes it less risky, the yield should reflect as much. Since the 1993 dividend has been set at 27.5p, a share price of 700p - and a rights issue price some way below - would give a yield roughly in line with Glaxo. Zeneca would doubtless argue that a multiple of around 14 times this year's forecast earnings is a miserly assessment of its drugs pipeline. With the market so suspicious of pharmaceuticals, though, it will do well to get away with any more.</p>

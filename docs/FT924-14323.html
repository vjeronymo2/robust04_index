			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / We've walked this road before: Major and Lamont have survived a rough week in Brighton despite a dearth of new policy directions Stumbling out of the wreckage, Mr John Major has wrapped himself in the Union Jack. Thus protected from the chill blasts of party disunity he proposes to stagger, then walk, hoping eventually to trot in the same direction as he set himself when he became prime minister two years ago. If you make the charitable assumption that his government will not fall flat on its face again, you could persuade yourself that the aftershocks of Black Wednesday will come to be seen as blips on a glorious rising graph delineating the achievements of the post-Thatcher period of Conservative rule. That, at any rate, is the conclusion we are intended to draw from Mr Major's address to the Conservative party conference in Brighton yesterday. The prime minister's European and economic strategies were blown apart when Britain was forced to leave the exchange rate mechanism on Wednesday September 16. Bits and pieces of those same strategies have been waved aloft at the conference every day this week. In his speech yesterday Mr John Major signalled that he hopes to put them together - that nothing has changed. The Maastricht treaty will be ratified. That has been loudly proclaimed. Britain will re-enter the exchange rate mechanism, perhaps within a year. That has been loudly disguised. The near-elimination of inflation will still be the objective; there will be no dash for growth. That was intimated by the chancellor on Thursday and emphasised with somewhat more courage by the prime minister yesterday. Until further notice, the same chancellor will be in charge. Nobody has much to say in public about that, although Mr Major did slip an endorsement of Mr Norman Lamont into his speech. This methodical reconstruction of the authority of his administration cannot properly begin until there is an acceptance of the Maastricht treaty. By the time it gets through - if it does - it may be a meaningless bit of paper, many of its clauses neutralised by addenda designed to suit the Danes and allay the fears expressed by doubters in both Germany and Britain. The Danish bid, put in yesterday, takes Britain some way towards its objectives. A German paper, now circulating, may take the process even further. A sketchy plan to curb the powers of the European Commission is emerging. All that is, however, beside the point. The fate of something more than mere nations - namely the careers of Mr Major and his colleagues - depends on Parliament swallowing the treaty. After yesterday, we are supposed to rest assured that it will. On Monday night ministers arriving in Brighton were distinctly nervous about the prospects. No one could tell whether there would be an uncontainable anti-Maastricht revolt. The government's business managers knew - and still know - that getting the bill to ratify the treaty through the Commons will at best be a lengthy and exhausting process, with no guarantee of success. What they could not foresee was whether the anti-Europeans would gather recruits from among the ideological innocents who make up the great centre of the Conservative party. The antis are a disparate gang, led by two stars in ermine, Lord Tebbit and Lady Thatcher (she who, at Bruges in September 1988, so memorably denounced European centralism). Some are merely narrow nationalists. Others are anti-immigration fanatics; yet others the grandchildren of the old empire loyalists, or Lord Salisbury's defenders of white Rhodesia. A few, such as Mr John Biffen, are attractive and civilised advocates of a respectable point of view, blessed with a sense of constitutional and parliamentary history and possessed of a wide vision reaching from the Atlantic to the Urals. Some, such as Mr William Cash, are unstoppable Euro-bores. The great majority represent the least attractive aspects of modern conservatism. It is to the credit of the government, and some of its own stars, that at this week's fixture Maastricht United defeated Bruges City. The ermined strikers overreached themselves. On Tuesday Lord Tebbit's carefully rehearsed impersonation of Brutus roused the noisy minority and provided good television. It was, however, an ego trip too far, and the majority in the conference hall eventually came to realise it. They started to do so after a passionate, and magnificent, speech by Mr Douglas Hurd. His arguments appealed to reason, although, the way I recall it, he was saying in his peroration that if you are against Maastricht you are for murdering starving babies in Somalia. Perhaps he was not quite so shameless, but you get the picture. When Mr Hurd expresses such passion in public, even the Conservative party knows that something important is going on. Mr Michael Heseltine played the conference with his customary skill. His crescendos, his soft-voiced changes of pace, his good fortune in his hecklers, his every pause struck home. It might have been the clincher - but for a newspaper article written by Lady Thatcher. In it she denounced the policies she had implemented when in government. Would this sway the force of the debate away from Mr Major's team? It did not. It was as much of a mistake as Lord Tebbit had made. When she entered the hall on Thursday morning she was given a rousing welcome by a substantial minority of those present, but many sat on their hands. She watched from the platform, a slightly diminished figure, while a speaker from Cheltenham reminded her that the elders of the party were not expected to rock the boat. Loud and prolonged applause. It was Maastricht United's winning goal. Yesterday Mr Major sought to take the cup. He threw in every rhetorical device his platform personality will allow. 'You cannot bully Britain,' he said, in what for him was a Churchillian growl. He would put the interests of his country 'first - now and always', he insisted, in his version of a Thatcher oratorio. He did seek to explain, at some length, the simple proposition that Britain cannot afford to stand outside the goings-on on the Continent. He made a creditable attempt to educate his party workers. In my view - but then I have always been a believer - he won the argument: Maastricht does represent a turning away from a centralised Europe towards a congeries of sovereign states, whose elected governments co-operate through a series of constantly renegotiated intergovernmental agreements. The ERM building block may be harder to put in place, even though it should logically come next. It is several ifs away, so we cannot be sure. It could become irrelevant if the meeting of European Community leaders in Birmingham on Friday fails to agree on the principles for amendment of the treaty. But, assuming that hurdle is passed, consider the other ifs. If the exchange rate mechanism survives, and if signs of economic recovery are evident in Britain, Mr Major's government, if it is still there, will apply to rejoin. No minister is talking in quite that way. Most are content to let the argument subside for a few months. But the instincts of a strong majority of the cabinet lie in the ERM direction. Never mind the conditions stipulated in writing, but not in public utterance, by the chancellor on Thursday. They are as the Madrid conditions for joining the ERM, imposed by Lady Thatcher. When the political time is right, Mr Major and his then chancellor will surely declare that the Lamont conditions have been met, execute an about-turn, and march back in. But the conference, the wider public and, most particularly, the handful of anti-ERM ministers could not safely be let into this open secret. One or two of the latter threaten resignation rather than accept re-entry; as to the Tory audience the few pro-ERM remarks made from the floor this week were loudly shouted down. Mr Major barely mentioned the dreaded initials. For the moment he has other preoccupations. His dogged effort to reconstruct his pre-September 16 position might be blown away - strategy, chancellor and all - unless voters and consequently the MPs behind him begin to believe that there will be an end to the recession. At the same time the markets must be convinced that the process will be carefully controlled. The prime minister's real problem, more serious than the exhilarating debates of this week, is that his admirable counter-inflationary drive is still costing more in terms of growth foregone than his supporters, many of them small business owners and employees, can be expected to bear for much longer. From his speech yesterday you have to conclude that he is aware of the problem, but rather less in possession of a solution than he was on September 15. For the rest, he chose to repackage well-established themes in the language of conference oratory. A little trade-union bashing here, a re-emphasis of school and hospital opt-outs there, all spiced with a dash of anti-crime platitudes. In some of this he seemed to lean rightwards, perhaps in harmony with his adoption of the flag as a suitable dress in which to cross the Channel. So he attacked progressive education (here I am with him all the way), bureaucratic red tape (who could demur?), the Conservatives' last reorganisation of local government (although he did not put it like that) and, in an onslaught beneath the dignity of a prime minister, new-age travellers. Given his audience this was all predictable and mostly harmless stuff. In sum, the strong likelihood is that Mr Major will indeed survive. Some three weeks ago he was shattered, personally and politically. This week he seemed to have recovered his nerve. A tinge of anger has crept into his demeanour and even his voice. If he is not tripped up again - in Birmingham, say, or in the Commons, or by a further long run of bad economic news - he will in due course exercise that most potent of all symbols of prime ministerial power and reshuffle his cabinet. He, and we, can never again assume that what he says will happen will in fact take place, but a significant proportion of his former stature is recoverable. His own awareness of this was evident in his trumpeting of his April 9 election victory yesterday. His contemptuous one-sentence dismissal of the opposition ('Labour and the Liberals are utterly irrelevant') indicates that he knows well enough how strong a position he occupies simply by virtue of the fact that he is a prime minister commanding a working majority at the start of a term that could last another 4 1/2 years. He could be blown off course again, but it would be folly to assume that he will be.</p>

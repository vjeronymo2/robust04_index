			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY TV DINNER WITH MICKEY;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: 'THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB' DEBUTED 35 YEARS AGO TODAY. THE AUTHOR, A  MOUSEKETEER, TALKS ABOUT ITS IMPACT.  </P> <P> When Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, President Eisenhower was serving his  first term, a Cadillac cost less than $3,000 and a new word entered the  language: Mouseketeers.  </P> <P> "The Mickey Mouse Club" premiered Oct. 3, 1955, and immediately enthralled  millions of children. The ABC hit children's series ran until 1959, was re-ran  from 1961 to 1965, and gave birth to a second version of "The New Mickey Mouse  Club" from 1975 to 1977 and from 1983 to 1989 on the Disney Channel. A third  spinoff of the show is in its third season.  </P> <P> Nine Mouseketeers lasted from the first day of filming to the last: Annette,  Tommy, Karen, Cubby, Doreen, Bobby, Darlene, Sharon, and me -- Lonnie. There  were three adults -- Jimmy Dodd, Roy Williams, and Bob Amsberry -- as well as  39 kids during the original show's four-year life.  </P> <P> The adults have since died, as has Mouseketeer Mike Smith. Sherry Alberoni and  Cheryl Holdridge were highly identifiable even though they were on the series  for only two years. Two other alumni went on to star in "The Rifleman" (Johnny  Crawford) and "My Three Sons" (Don Grady).  </P> <P> Why did a fairly simple kids' TV show capture the imagination of millions of  children and quite a few adults, become a spontaneous hit and last for 35 years  in one form or another?  </P> <P> The Mouseketeers and their show appeared at the same time as television was  also growing up.  </P> <P> Children had been on TV almost from its inception but they were always child  actors playing roles or kids as audience members (the peanut gallery on "Howdy  Doody") or interviewees (Art Linkletter's "House Party"). The Mouseketeers  were, at Walt Disney's insistence, almost all amateurs as opposed to show  business kids. Only Sharon Baird and I had credits as child actor/dancers and  managed to sneak by Walt and his producers. So the Mouseketeers were real kids  growing up with whom other real kids viewing the show could identify. Walt made  it very clear that everyone who watched the show was a member of the club.  </P> <P> Given the schedule of five 15-minute episodes a week plus cartoon introductions  and other chores, it is not surprising that some of the Mouseketeers made  mistakes -- which made us seem very human.  </P> <P> The diversity of the show was a very important factor. The Mouseketeers changed  their show every day: Monday was "Fun With Music Day," Tuesday "Guest Star  Day," Wednesday "Anything Can Happen Day," Thursday "Circus Day," and Friday  "Talent Roundup."  </P> <P> The Mouseketeers' singing and dancing was followed by a children's serial such  as "Spin and Marty" or "The Hardy Boys." The next segment presented short films  on children in other countries, wildlife, growing up on a farm or the American  Indians. Millions of kids learned to spell encyclopedia from a cricket. The  fourth part of the hour was a Disney cartoon.  </P> <P> Finally, some unassuming kids known as the Mouseketeers became the link between  Walt Disney's characters -- Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Donald Duck -- and real  kids. There was nothing slick or hip about the Mouseketeers. We were real kids  who grew up and enjoyed ourselves in front of a nation.  </P> <P> It was quite a trick for Disney to put on those five hours a week in 1955. One  could criticize the production values of the show, the repetitive musical  numbers and the innocuous dialogue. But kids never seem to care about these  criticisms: The "Mickey Mouse Club" was a seminal entertainment that  communicated directly to children.  </P> <P> There were faults in the America of the '50s, and faults with "The Mickey Mouse  Club." An obvious example would be that although there were two Latinos on the  Club, blacks only appeared as guests. This was a reflection of the age and  nearly all TV programming at the time. Naturally, the second version of the  Mouse Club in the '70s and the third show in the '80s were both fully  integrated.  </P> <P> In their small way, the Mouseketeers and "The Mickey Mouse Club" symbolize for  millions a lost American innocence. It is wonderful to be a very tiny part of  entertainment history that makes people smile when it is recalled.  </P></p>

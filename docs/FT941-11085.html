			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Paramount prefers Viacom The board of Paramount, the US communications group at the centre of a Dollars 10bn takeover battle, yesterday urged shareholders to accept a bid from cable TV company Viacom and to bring a speedy end to the five-month battle. Paramount warned that the long-drawn out bid risked damaging its business, and asked shareholders to accept Viacom's offer by the bidding deadline of February 14. If neither Viacom nor rival bidder QVC gets a majority of the company's shares by the deadline, Paramount said it would bring the bidding procedure to a close. That could leave both bidders still struggling for control of the group. There is little to choose between the Viacom and QVC offers on price, though Viacom's bid includes a slightly higher cash element and guarantees for Paramount shareholders if Viacom shares fall in value over the next year.</p>

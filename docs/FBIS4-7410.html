			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has  sent a telegram to North Korea and urged North Korea to allow  inspection when it replaces nuclear fuel rods under the  condition that the IAEA conducts sample-taking and surveys gamma  rays later. The IAEA proposed that it will send a five-member  team to North Korea early next week.    IAEA spokesman David Kyd said that although the IAEA sent  this message to the North Korean side, there is no change in the  IAEA's basic position to conduct essential inspection activities  pertaining to the replacement of the nuclear fuel rods.    It appears that the IAEA, changing its previous policy,  intends to conduct inspections in a flexible manner because it  expects that there will be a change in the North Korean position  according to the results of U.S.-North Korea contacts to be held  in the future.</p>

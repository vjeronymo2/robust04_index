			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Jin Songtai (6855 2646 0669): "In </F> First Five Months This Year, Shanghai Attracts the Highest Level  of Taiwan Investment on the Mainland"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 June (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The  "Investment Inspection Council of the Economic Ministry" of  Taiwan has made an announcement on the situation of Taiwan  businessmen's investment in the mainland between January and May  1994. Statistics show that Shanghai remained the area where  Taiwan businessmen made the largest total amount of investment  on the mainland. Of the 475 mainland investment projects, 66  were in Shanghai, where the investment amount totaled $68.54  million, far greater than that in Shenzhen, which ranked second  place.    Although Shanghai lacks natural and geographic partners for  close economic relations -- like those that exist between  Guangdong and Hong Kong, between Fujian and Taiwan, and between  Shandong and South Korea -- Shanghai is still the favorite of  Taiwan investors. In particular, some companies which have  achieved initial successes in Shanghai are making additional  investments, which form a substantial force.    The chain store business, which began in 1992, is now the  key  point of competition among overseas corporations. Chung Hsing  Group and Pacific Construction, companies that run chain  department stores in Taiwan, have launched investment projects  in Shanghai. In view of the good business prospects in  Shanghai, Pacific Construction will launch a second-phase  $7.2-million investment project in Shanghai's Pacific Department  Store, which will increase its total stake in the department  store to $12.7 million. Ouyang Yi-ming, the company's general  manager, said that the rapid business growth in Shanghai  prompted them to make the decision on the construction of the  second building for the Shanghai Pacific Department Store.    Last month, the board of directors of the Hua-hsin Li-hua  Company, the Taiwan cable and wire producing enterprise that  made the highest amount of indirect investment in the mainland,  held a meeting to adopt three indirect mainland investment  schemes. Its original plan for building a power and cable plant  in Jiangsu's Wuxi was shifted to Shanghai, with the amount of  investment increasing form $3.5 million to $6.75 million.  Before that, Hua-hsin Li-hua had already invested and run  factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Wuhan.    Shanghai became the Taiwan businessmen's favorite investment  target thanks to Shanghai's vital relations with the Chang  Jiang. After Shanghai was built into a port city in 1843, it  continued to be a major foreign trade port for the entire Chang  Jiang valley. Taiwan's Chang Jung Shipping decided to make  investment in Shanghai precisely because it took this fact into  account. On 14 May, the shipping company signed an official  contract with the Shanghai Harbor Authority on building a  container terminal with an area of 60,000 square meters along  Baoshan's Jungong Road. The project will be completed and put  into operation in approximately one year and will be named the  Shanghai Chang Jung Container Corporation. The Shanghai side  exchanged the land for shares of the company and the Chang  Jung's holding in the company will not be limited. In addition,  Chang Jung will have full management power.    A number of Taiwan-funded enterprises engaged in  labor-intensive industries such as plastics, footwear, garments,  and mechanical tools have been set up in the nine suburban  districts and counties. They and the urban Taiwan investment  projects, primarily engaged in tertiary industry, support and  supplement one another. In the first quarter of this year,  Taiwan-funded enterprises in Shanghai's suburban areas numbered  846 and accounted for 51.8 percent of the total number of  Taiwan-funded enterprises in Shanghai. Of the suburban  Taiwan-funded enterprises, 70 percent were labor-intensive ones.    Experts expect that Shanghai will become the base for the  mainland headquarters of many Taiwan companies in the near  future. After Citibank decided to move its China headquarters  from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Morgan Stanley decided to move  its Asia headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai, other foreign  corporations may take similar action and this will give a  warning to Taiwan businessmen: Do not let this opportunity slip  by. Wei Chuan Group built a food producing center in Shanghai  as its operation center in the mainland; Xiamen Kun Tsan, which  was the first foreign-owned company to be listed in the mainland  stock market, moved its mainland headquarters to Shanghai and  also proceeded from Shanghai to sell its products in all parts  of the country, thus becoming the model for Taiwan companies  seeking to enter the mainland market.    Yang Wen-fan, general manager of the China market  headquarters of Kun Tsan, said that Shanghai plays two functions  which cannot be replaced by other cities. It is the city that  absorbs information and provides opportunities more directly and  rapidly. The city is also the sole "economic window" which can  radiate to all parts of the mainland market. As long as  products can sell well in Shanghai and gain fame, they will  certainly become popular in nearby provinces and cities.    Since Shanghai became the key point of the mainland's reform  and opening and once again became the economic, financial, and  trade center of the Chinese mainland, it has certainly had great  influence among Taiwan businessmen. In fact, Taiwan businessmen  have had a strong interest in Shanghai for a long time, and this  shows that they are well-aware of Shanghai's position. As  Taiwan's CHING CHI JIH PAO said, in order to occupy the mainland  market, one must first gain a foothold in Shanghai.</p>

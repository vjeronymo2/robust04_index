			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Burtonwood falls 18% to Pounds 4.62m BURTONWOOD Brewery announced an 18 per cent decline in profits, from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 4.62m pre-tax, for the year to March 31. However, the Cheshire-based company pointed out that after stripping out one-off disposal profits in the previous year, the pre-tax line showed an increase of 21 per cent. Turnover amounted to Pounds 44.7m (Pounds 44.5m) although the underlying trend was 6 per cent ahead after adjusting for the closure of the group's cash and carry business. Beer volumes declined by a modest 2 per cent, against a national fall of about 6 per cent. Earnings per share worked through at 18.6p (23.6p). A proposed final dividend of 3.75p brings the total to 4.45p (4.24p).</p>

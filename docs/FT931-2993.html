			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Horse traders clear a hurdle FEARS that leading racehorse owners and premier bloodstock auctions would leave the UK, jeopardising the industry, have been lifted by VAT changes. Allowing racehorse owners to claim back the VAT they pay on buying and running their horses will remove the disadvantage of operating in the UK, compared with the Repubic of Ireland with its 2.5 per cent rate and France with 5.5 per cent. Owners considering moving their strings abroad included the Maktoum family of Dubai and the American Mr Paul Mellon. They and about 8,000 others will be able to reclaim VAT on the Pounds 12,000-plus annual expense of running a racehorse as well as on purchase prices. Tattersalls, the leading auction house, yesterday indicated it would reverse the switching of activities to Ireland. Average selling price at its premier yearling sale is 35,000 to 50,000 guineas. The industry had estimated that 30,000 jobs were at risk at racing yards and studs and among vets, blacksmiths and horse transporters. Mr Gerald Leigh, a Northamptonshire breeder, said he had been selling his yearlings abroad and would have considered running down his establishment from 10 staff to three. Mr Peter Walwyn, a trainer at Lambourn, said he had lost clients to overseas trainers. Custom had also been reduced by the weight of VAT. 'We will now keep the clients we have and get more in.' To enable the changes to go ahead, the Jockey Club will remove barriers to horse sponsorship and appearance money.</p>

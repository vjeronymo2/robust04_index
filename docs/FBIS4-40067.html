			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin today left for a  working visit to Blagoveshchensk in Amur Oblast. Before his  departure, Boris Yeltsin gave an interview to journalists at the  airport. In particular, he spoke about his telephone  conversation with U.S. President Clinton a day before.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] We discussed several issues.  First, the North Korean nuclear issue. And we agreed, or  rather it was our proposal, to put forward to the Security  Council a question about an international conference and,  simultaneously, about sanctions -- phased-in ones. It is a very  serious matter. So there you are. Later, Kozyrev and  Christopher are to meet tomorrow or the day after in Brussels,  where they are to agree the text. [end recording]    The presidents also discussed the question of Boris  Yeltsin's  visit to the United States in September this year. As for his  visit to the Far East and Siberia, the Russian president noted  the regions' specific features and abundance of mineral  resources there.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] We have now somehow concentrated  on  the foreign countries in the east, and I think it is from there  that an inflow of investment can be expected. This is something  we are now lacking. I refer to China, Japan, and the Republic  of Korea. [end recording]</p>

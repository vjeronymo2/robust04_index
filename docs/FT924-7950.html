			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Benefits from Budget wiped out - Science THE real increase in the government's science budget, promised in the Autumn Statement a year ago, disappeared when the chancellor spoke yesterday. The science budget - distributed mainly through the five research councils - will rise in cash terms by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 1.164bn in 1993-94. That is Pounds 17m less than the planning figure released a year ago. The new planning figures for 1994-95 and 1995-96 show level funding, allowing for expected inflation, instead of a rise. This is the first public spending round in which science has been outside the Department of Education and in the Office of Science and Technology under Mr William Waldegrave. The outcome shows that he has had some success in protecting the research budget against cuts. 'If the OST had not existed this year, science would have had a rougher time,' he said.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic on 22 February  publishes on page 9 an approximately 2,500-word article by  Islamist writer Fahmi Huwaydi in which he discusses the  differences between the Algerian and Egyptian confrontations  between the government and the Islamists.    After noting some similarities between the situations of the  two countries, the writer determines that "there are many  differences between the two cases, both at the general social  level and at the level of the confrontation itself." On the  social level, Huwaydi says that, unlike Egyptians, the people of  Algeria are generally inclined to extremism, largely mobilized  against the government, and lack social harmony. And unlike  Egypt, Algeria has a different political experience, a weaker  central authority, and an Army that is the main player in the  country's politics.    Turning to differences in the nature of the current clash in  both countries, Huwaydi notes first that unlike the Islamic  movement in Egypt, Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front [FIS],  established in 1989, has little political experience. The  60-year experience of the Islamic movement in Egypt, he writes,  "has reflected on its political language and positive attitude  toward the issue of democracy. Its cadres have been active in  all fields and are occupying important positions in society's  institutions."    Huwaydi then maintains that the parties involved in the  conflict in Algeria are different from those in Egypt. He says  that while the clash against the government in Algeria involves  many forces and sectors, with the Islamists only at the  forefront, "the clash in Egypt is not as vague. It has become  clear so far that the clash is between the government and some  Islamic elements; no other sectors of society are involved."    The writer adds: "The Islamist group confronting the  government in Algeria is primarily the FIS, which is the biggest  Islamic faction in the country. But the clash in Egypt involves  marginal factions in the Islamic movement, not the major faction  represented by the Muslim Brotherhood. This means that while  the biggest Islamic bloc is the main party to the clash in  Algeria, the biggest Islamic bloc in Egypt is outside the  confrontation. No matter where the Muslim Brotherhood stands in  the line of political opposition, it is certainly not party to  the armed violence in the country."    He says: "It is astonishing that some of the media trumpets  in Egypt insist on expanding the scope of confrontation between  the Islamic movement and the government by insisting on  abolishing any differences between the various [Islamic]  factions and branding them all with terrorism and extremism."    Huwaydi says the issue at the center of the confrontation is  also different in the two cases: While the confrontation in  Algeria is mainly a struggle for power, "the clash in Egypt is a  series of settling scores and reactions, and power is not its  main objective. The evidence is that the assassination of former  President al-Sadat was directed against him personally. The  whole government was around him, and it was easy for the  culprits, if they really wanted to take over power, to take  advantage of the situation and achieve their purposes in one way  or another, but this did not happen."    Finally, the writer maintains that the struggle in Algeria  essentially revolves around the country's identity and  inclinations, particularly its position toward the sensitive  issues of Arabism and Islam. He notes that a powerful trend in  the government adopts a negative attitude toward the two issues.</p>

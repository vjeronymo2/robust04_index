			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Segni announces a new political party MR Mario Segni, the leader of Italy's referendum movement, threw the country's party political framework into disarray at the weekend after announcing the creation of a new party to contest general elections expected later this year. Mr Segni left the Christian Democrats earlier this year in protest at their inability to reform and distance themselves from members facing allegations of political corruption and links with organised crime. Since then, Alleanza Democratica (Democratic Alliance), the loose political grouping formed around Mr Segni earlier this year, has coalesced amid signs it could present a serious threat to the Christian Democrats, and possibly other centre-right parties, at the polls. Mr Segni's move came a day after Mr Giuliano Amato, former Socialist prime minister, indicated he was also interested in promoting political change. In an interview with La Stampa, the Turin newspaper, Mr Amato suggested the creation of a new centre-left group which could embrace former Socialists and members of other centre parties. The signs that Mr Amato had reconsidered his decision to leave politics after 10 months as Italy's prime minister were welcomed by a number of politicians. Mr Amato, believed to have turned down the Foreign Ministry in the new government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was widely praised for steering the the country through one of the most difficult post-war periods. Mr Segni's and Mr Amato's statements triggered immediate reactions from the Christian Democrat and the Socialist leaderships. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, Christian Democrat leader, poured scorn on the Democratic Alliance, while expressing hopes that Mr Segni might return to the fold. The new alliance was no more than 'a cylinder into which everyone wants to put something', said Mr Martinazzoli. 'I don't agree with Segni when he says that innovation means getting rid of the Christian Democrats.' Separately, Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, Socialist leader, made clear his readiness to offer Mr Amato a senior party position. The Socialists have been rocked by the departure of a number of senior figures recently in protest at the support of many MPs for Mr Bettino Craxi, their former leader. Meanwhile, the Lega Nord, the regional autonomist grouping headed by Mr Umberto Bossi, confirmed it would change its name in an attempt to broaden its electoral base and shake off its lingering racist image. The party will call itself the 'Italian Federal League' in central and southern Italy while retaining its 'Lega Nord' title in the north. The simmering divisions within the Christian Democrats and Socialists have been exacerbated in the run-up to important local polls on June 6, which will be the biggest test of political support since last year's general elections. Attention has focused in particular on Milan and a few other big cities, where a new law on the direct election of mayors will be put to the test. The mayoral race in Milan, a former Socialist stronghold, has attracted 12 candidates. However, in a measure of the demise of a party whose word once held sway in the city, Mr Piero Borghini, Milan's former mayor, made clear at the weekend his preference not to have formal support from the Socialists for his candidature. Mr Borghini, mayor until the city council collapsed earlier this year, was a Communist party member before being appointed mayor as an independent with Socialist backing. Milan has been run by a senior civil servant from the Interior Ministry, pending new elections, after local politicians failed to agree on a new city council.</p>

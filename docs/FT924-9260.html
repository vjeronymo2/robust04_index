			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Just Between Ourselves - Middle class manners are parodied in the theatre this week People often speak of Alan Ayckbourn as if he wrote only one kind of play: a social comedy about the precarious awfulness of lower-middle-class life. Actually - especially in the last 10 years - Ayckbourn has turned his comic talent in many directions. In some plays, he has shown himself to be one of those rare artists who can portray real evil. In others, he has gone beyond the comedy of nervous breakdown into the odd poetry of actual derangement. Elsewhere he has dramatised man's inhumanity to woman. His 1976 play Just Between Ourselves, now at the Greenwich Theatre, is fascinating, for its points in all these directions. Dennis lives with his wife Vera and his mother Marjorie. He can always laugh at everything - not least Vera and her depression. He spends his spare time on disastrous do-it-yourself in the garage. The fact that he cannot mend a kettle successfully has no bearing on the fact that he blithely, laughingly, constantly, insists upon Vera's incompetence. And, when he makes a new friend, Neil, they use each other merely as sounding-boards for their own closet (garage) misogyny. It is astonishing how Ayckbourn makes this, in the first place, hilarious. This is one of his more exquisite studies in the Comedy of Excruciation. And, like all his work, it is an object-lesson in construction. Brick by brick, he painstakingly piles one unfunny detail upon another; and, for many long minutes, we seem to be watching not a comedy but a miniature hell of pettiness and insensitivity. Then, suddenly, he brings all his ingredients together, switches on a light, and lets the comedy erupt and climb. We soon see that we are watching a comedy of psychological collapse; and yet we can only laugh. Then Ayckbourn takes us past nervous breakdown. In his final scene, he exposes all the inhumanity that has been apparent in the whole set-up; and, having shown us the funny side, he never flinches from reminding us of the unfunny. It is his peculiar brilliance that he ultimately steers the play out of comedy without losing his audience's respect. Robin Midgeley, the director, paces and times everything to perfection. Susan Jameson and Robin Nedwell, playing Vera and Neil, are so consistent that their slightest move intensifies the play. As Dennis, the leading but most repellent role, Martin Jarvis gives an expert if slightly over-emphatic performance. And, though everything Rosalind Ayers does as Neil's wife Pam works, her characterisation is not quite robust enough to convince. The great performance, however, is Liz Smith's as Marjorie, hell bent on keeping her son as Oedipal as possible, and determinedly revenging herself on his wretched wife. Of course, she has a field-day with lines like (remembering her late husband) 'He had a very deep and wonderful understanding of suffering' but she also makes us guffaw as she draws out a line like 'Yes, I might as well have a sandwich . . .' even before adding the crowning sadism of the sequel '. . . seeing as she hasn't made cake.' Greenwich Theatre until December 12.</p>

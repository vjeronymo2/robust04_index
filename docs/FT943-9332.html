			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Greyhound chief resigns as losses mount The chief executive of Greyhound Lines, the struggling US long-distance bus operator, has resigned in the face of the company's continuing losses and plunging share price. Mr Frank Schmieder, 53, who led the company out of bankruptcy protection in 1992, stepped down late on Tuesday. He has been temporarily replaced by Mr Thomas Plaskett, previously a non-executive member of the company's board, pending the appointment of a successor. Greyhound is the only nationwide provider of inter-city bus services in the US, but fares and passenger numbers have been driven down by increasing competition from low-cost airlines. In the quarter to June it made net losses of Dollars 45.4m, its third successive quarter of losses. Last month Mr Schmieder unveiled a five-point plan aimed at turning the company around. Its main feature was a move to axe long-distance routes and concentrate on more intensive short-haul services where it could more easily compete with the airlines. The strategy, however, had failed to placate restive shareholders such as Connor, Clark, a Toronto-based investment firm that holds 18 per cent of Greyhound's stock. Connor, Clark had reportedly been seeking three seats on Greyhound's board and the replacement of Mr Schmieder. Greyhound said the strategy put in place by Mr Schmieder, which also involves sweeping lay-offs and the disposal of surplus assets, had been reaffirmed by the board. The shares fell Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 5 3/4.</p>

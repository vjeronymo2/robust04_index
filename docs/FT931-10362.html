			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: 'Fast track' link with rice attacked JAPAN'S Agriculture Ministry yesterday condemned suggestions that the extension of the US 'fast-track' trade mechanism should be linked to the opening of the country's rice market to imports, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Mr Akio Kyoya, a vice-minister of agriculture, said the ministry had heard US officials wanted the rice market opened to ensure that the 'fast-track' mechanism was extended beyond the end of May. 'The issues are totally irrelevant,' Mr Kyoya said, stressing that rice should be discussed in multilateral negotiations, not in the context of US domestic policy. The 'fast track' forces US Congress to accept or reject agreements without clause-by-clause amendments, and aims to ensure speedy passage of a Uruguay Round trade pact. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has already decided, privately, that rice imports are inevitable. But the Agriculture Ministry was surprised last week when a senior official of the Social Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, also said imports might be allowed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marc Ballon: "Parents Find It's Not All in a </F> Name"]    [Text] Julietta Clare Rimmer cannot exist.    She's very much alive. At the age of three weeks, she makes  funny faces and coos at her parents.    But officially, she has no name, even though her parents  have  chosen one they think would suit her fine.    Under Czech law, formal first names must be approved by the  state and middle names are forbidden. In addition, baby girls  normally have the feminine suffix -ova (or in some  cases -a) at the end of their surnames, regardless of  parental wishes.    Officials at Prague 4 City Hall said the name "Julietta"  could not be used because it doesn't appear in "What Should We  Name Our Child," the Czech Government's list of acceptable  names. Giulietta and Juliana are OK, though. Clare is not,  because the communists outlawed middle names in 1949. And  finally, Rimmer must become Rimmerova, even though the baby's  father is British and wants his daughter to have his surname.    Unfair? Kafkaesque? Julietta Clare Rimmer's father thinks  so.    "I can't believe how ridiculous this is," said Julian  Rimmer,  42, a restaurant owner and news editor at Radio Metropolis in  Prague. "You should be able to do something as basic as choosing  your child's name without the state's approval."    Julietta Clare Rimmer's mother, Iveta Placha, a 32-year-old  lawyer and Rimmer's fiancee, agreed. "This is totally,  completely crazy," she said.    It is Miloslava Knappova who has the final word on names in  the Czech Republic. A noted linguist and author of the official  Czech name book, which contains more than 1,550 Czech names and  scores of foreign variations, she adjudicates name disputes. As  a rule, proper names and their foreign equivalents are  acceptable. Nicknames are forbidden. Alena, for example, is  fine, but Alenka, Aja or Ala get a thumbs down.    "A couple recently wanted to call their child Rambo," said  Knappova. "I had to turn it down. I couldn't find the name in  any official name publication anywhere in the world."    Name guidelines make sense to Knappova. It is a matter of  protecting children's rights--without the guidelines, she said,  parents could cause their children emotional harm by naming them  Asthma or Pneumonia, as an American couple recently did.    Most other European countries have similar restrictions.  Austria, for example, has a list of officially recognized names,  while Germany bans "insulting" and gender-neutral names such as  Toni.    Many Czechs seem to accept the system. In her 25 years as  the  local name guru, Knappova has received an average of 100 appeals  per year. If she can find a justification, she grants an appeal,  which costs an average of 200-300 Kc ($6-10) for time and  effort. She even goes so far as to consult with linguists at  Prague's Charles University if a particularly exotic name comes  along, she said.    So where does this leave Rimmer, Placha and their baby? They  say their fight has only begun.    "One way or the other we'll get Julietta added to the book  of  names," Rimmer said, "even if it takes the British Embassy's  intervention."    He has given up on keeping Clare and Rimmer, though. Some  battles just cannot be won, he said, no matter how sound the  argument.    The Czech Interior Ministry is expected to propose changing  existing name laws later this year, but refuses to divulge any  details.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "How Lasting Is the VLD's Success?"] </F>   [Text] For Jean-Luc Dehaene, things can hardly go wrong any  more. His main opponent for Delors' succession, Netherlands  Prime Minister Lubbers, seems to be virtually defeated. Indeed,  generally well-informed Spanish newspapers reported that Prime  Minister Gonzalez no longer supports the Netherlands Christian  Democrat's candidacy. There was good news from Great Britain,  too. John Major allegedly no longer intends to pronounce a veto  against Dehaene. Things would take a dramatic turn for Dehaene  to be kept out of Delors' seat.    For the government, this is obviously not very good news,  because it will become difficult to keep this coalition together  without Dehaene. If the outcome of the European elections is  far from brilliant, the top ministers will certainly want to get  into the spotlight in the next few months. Coming to the fore,  as it is called. It is a well-known fact that this is generally  bad for a cabinet's harmonious functioning. However, if the  polls published in recent days are confirmed on 12 June, the  coalition partners have every reason to go on through the end of  their legislative period. The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] no  longer succeeds in reaching the 30 percent it had a few months  ago. Quite on the contrary, the percentage is slowly but surely  crumbling off, which could indicate that the VLD's success is  inflated and far from lasting. It is not inconceivable that the  recipe worked out by [VLD chairman] Verhofstadt is quite  perishable. In that case, the situation might brighten up for  the government parties. All they should do then, is stay in  power, avoid futile disputes, and postpone the elections as long  as possible. If, in the meantime, unemployment decreases and a  better economic situation reduces the public deficit, they could  present a fairly positive record to the voters at the end of  1995.    At present, there is hardly any sign that the economic  situation is changing for the better. Moreover, the population  is just discovering the new taxes and savings included in the  global plan. So it is possible that the government's popularity  has now reached rock bottom, and that the future can only be  better. If it turns out next Sunday [12 June], that the VLD is  already past its peak, the government parties would have every  reason to be satisfied. Even if they concede further ground  compared to 1991, they could breathe more freely, and hope that  the VLD danger can be averted within the foreseeable future,  thus keeping Verhofstadt from implementing his liberal ideas. A  VLD image-building operation can only be implemented once within  a political career. For the VLD chairman, the next few months  might well turn out to become an agony.</p>

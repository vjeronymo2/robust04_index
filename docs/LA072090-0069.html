			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: NEDJAR TAKES OCCIDENTAL SOCCER JOB  </P> <P> Sami Nedjar will take over as head coach of the Occidental College women's  soccer team next season, the school announced.  </P> <P> Nedjar acted as co-coach last season with Sue Semrau and was an assistant in  1988.  </P> <P> Nedjar has coached the boys' program at Oceanside High and served for two years  as coach of the USC women's club soccer team.  </P> <P> David McDivitt of Canyon High remained in intensive care Thursday at Henry Mayo  Newhall Memorial Hospital after suffering a head injury that left him  unconscious for about 30 seconds during a passing league football game  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The senior running back was mentally sharp Thursday and could move his  shoulders and neck well, Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. McDivitt has undergone  a series of tests, including a CAT scan and an electroencephalogram.  </P> <P> While running a pass pattern, McDivitt (5-foot-9, 185 pounds) was upended and  landed on his head during a game against Newbury Park at Hart High.  </P> <P> "Everyone thought he had the wind knocked out of him," Welch said. "He was  breathing, but it was more like he was in a deep sleep. When we couldn't get  him to come around right away, we sent for an ambulance.  </P> <P> "He is our most gifted player on offense and is a real impact player. If he's  healthy, he'll be one of the best running backs in the area."  </P> <P> McDivitt rushed for 459 yards in 84 carries and scored four touchdowns last  season.  </P> <P> Former Cal State Northridge star Keith Wright caught 10- and 39-yard touchdown  passes from Tracy Ham in the first quarter, helping the Edmonton Eskimos to a  41-23 victory over Doug Flutie and the British Columbia Lions in a Canadian  Football League game Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Former Crespi High and Loyola Marymount standout Mike Yoest will begin his  second effort in the past three years to earn a spot with the Sacramento Kings  when he reports to the NBA team's summer rookie/free agent camp today.  </P> <P> A 6-7 forward who played in Europe last season, Yoest also participated in  Sacramento's 1988 summer camp.  </P> <P> Yoest was a Southern Section 4-A Division second-team selection as a Crespi  senior after a 1983-84 season in which he averaged 15.8 points and 11.2  rebounds.  </P> <P> Former Antelope Valley College runner Greg Crosley will attempt to walk on the  Cal Poly San Luis Obispo track and cross-country teams in the upcoming school  year, according to Mark Covert, his coach at Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> Crosley advanced to the Southern California junior college regional finals in  the 1,500 meters in May.  </P> <P> A redshirt freshman from Monte Vista High in Danville, Crosley was also  selected the Foothill Conference Male Track Athlete of the Year after winning  the 1,500, the steeplechase and the 5,000 in the conference championship meet.  </P> <P> Crosley, who has another year of junior college eligibility, attended San Luis  Obispo in 1988-89 but did not compete.  </P> <P> Sal Garfias of Glendale College, who helped lead the Vaqueros to a second-place  showing at the Western State Conference cross-country championships, said he  will also attend San Luis Obispo in the fall.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo won the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. cross-country  title last November and dethroned four-time defending CCAA track champion Cal  State Los Angeles in May.  </P> <P> The top candidate for the Oak Park High basketball job has rejected the  school's offer and the position remains open, school official Fred Yamano said.  Yamano declined to name the candidate. The school is accepting applications.  </P> <P> Information: 818-707-7944.  </P> <P> Harvard High is looking for assistant football coaches to fill vacancies on the  varsity and junior varsity programs.  </P> <P> Information: Gary Thran, (818) 980-6692  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS LOSE SEGOTA TO INJURY, THEN GAME BY A GOAL TO WINGS  </P> <P> The Sockers' offense, or at least a very big part of it, will be taking a  10-day leave of absence.  </P> <P> Branko Segota strained his right hamstring in the second quarter of Wednesday  night's game against Wichita in front of 11,410 at the Sports Arena. Then  things got very strange.  </P> <P> The final score: Wichita 5, Sockers 4. It wasn't as simple as it sounds.  </P> <P> First, there's Segota, who has been hot lately. He has six goals and seven  assists in the past three games. His services were sorely missed and will be  when the Sockers leave this morning for a two-game trip to Dallas and  Baltimore.  </P> <P> "That hurts," Newman said. "If we'd have had Branko there (the game) would have  been different.  </P> <P> The Sockers (21-18) were trailing, 2-1, early in the fourth quarter but finally  took a 4-2 lead on goals by Alan Willey, Kevin Crow and Paul Wright.  </P> <P> Until then, Socker Coach Ron Newman liked what he saw. He said after the game  his team had played one of its best games of the year. But the Sockers  slumbered through the final six minutes. First, Daryl Green scored. Then Chico  Borja scored. After that, Borja scored again. All within 1:38. Borja's second  goal ended the scoring with 4:21 left to play.  </P> <P> "It was a crazy game," Newman said. "Terrible defensive work on our part. We're  not working as a unit."  </P> <P> Ask Crow -- he'll say the Sockers were too tired in the fourth quarter to work  together and effectively stop the Wings' assault.  </P> <P> "I just don't think we're as physically fit as other teams," Crow said. "When  we play a high-pressure game, we can't last for four quarters. I bet we've lost  13 (of 18 losses) in the last three or four minutes of the game or in  overtime."  </P> <P> The return of Brian Quinn, who has been sidelined with a strained arch, helped.  But Quinn, whose wife, Sharon, gave birth to a girl Tuesday, was only able to  play in spurts after being out since Feb. 3.  </P> <P> So now the Sockers take to the road five games behind first-place Baltimore and  wondering what's ahead.  </P> <P> "If we had won that game, the road trip would have been that much easier,"  Quinn said.  </P> <P> The score at halftime was 0-0. The Sockers haven't been held scoreless in the  first half for 12 games. Last time the Sockers played Wichita (17-22) at the  Sports Arena, they won, 10-6.  </P> <P> Players from both teams did their share of running in the first half, but  scoring opportunities were scarce. Credit each team with one legitimate almost.  Wichita's came midway through the second quarter when midfielder Mike Fox  launched a shot from beyond the penalty arch that required Socker goalie Victor  Nogueira to dive to his left and knock the ball away with one hand.  </P> <P> Socker defender Ralf Wilhelms nearly scored on a bicycle kick four minutes  later, but goalie Cris Vaccaro knocked it down, and an attempt by Crow to head  it in was unsuccessful.  </P></p>

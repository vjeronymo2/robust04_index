			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma on 10 January  told EL MERCURIO that the government maintains its position  toward the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), noting that  the government likes the agreement but cannot join it for  various reasons.    Silva Cimma mentioned the issue after being asked about  press  reports published by EL MERCURIO quoting him as saying in  Brasilia that Chile would negotiate its membership with NAFTA  and Mercosur.    According to news agency reports, Silva Cimma said: "We will  try to move forward, negotiating with both mechanisms." He  reportedly said there is no incompatibility in this approach.    Asked about this report, the minister said he found it very  strange that such a thing has been said, and that he was  misinterpreted.    "I never said that. Chilean policy remains totally the  same,"  he replied.    Silva Cimma denied that he talked about the issue in  Brasilia  during a news conference, explaining that there was no such  conference and that was he was asked by only two journalists  about Mercosur. "I told them: 'Look, we like Mercosur, but for  various reasons we cannot join it.'"    The document that created Mercosur is known as the Treaty of  Asuncion, which was signed in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay.    Under the treaty's terms, there will be a customs union  among  those countries as of 1 January 1995, with zero internal tariffs  and a common external tariff, while their economic policies will  be made as consistent as possible.    The Chilean position toward this treaty has remained  unchanged. Chile has noted its satisfaction over the treaty,  expressed thanks for the repeated invitations to join it, and  refused to do it for technical and not political reasons.    Summing up, there are three reasons that prevent Chile from  joining Mercosur: 1) the difficult short-term coordination of  the bilateral agreements signed within Mercosur on matters like  protection against third countries, nontariff restrictions,  foreign investment, incorporation of new technology,  intellectual property, and pharmaceutical patents;    2) The weight of the Brazilian economy in the group, because  of its protectionist policy and economic imbalances; and    3) The fact that Chile has eliminated all nontariff  restrictions through bilateral agreements, while Mercosur will  not enforce this measure until 1 January 1995.</p>

He gave the information outside the National Palace after  being asked what he knew about the arrest of Guatemalan citizen  Velmar Espina Novo, who was involved in a cocaine shipment in  Nicaragua. Ortiz said: "For the time being we have no official  information only that a person was arrested. We will therefore  solicit information on the alleged Guatemalan drug trafficker  and the alleged member of the military, Byron Robeto Morales."    He said there are signed agreements on antidrug trafficking,  which will be put into effect with the United States, Colombia,  Mexico, and the remaining isthmian countries. Ortiz admitted  Guatemala is becoming more and more a bridge for drugs and a  storage center as well.    Regarding the death of inmates in penitentiaries, he said  each case is being investigated, although most deaths seem to be  prompted by fights or personal vengeance.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Accountancy Column: Closing the gaps between expectation and reality THE RECENT spate of spectacular corporate failures has prompted investors, creditors and commentators to look for scapegoats. Depending on the nature of one's vested interests, it is possible to blame management, the institutions, market conditions or the regulatory system. Increasingly, however, it has been found convenient to blame the auditor. Auditors are, in turn, quick to point out that allegations of their culpability are merely a manifestation of the 'expectation gap'. The expectation gap is a popular professional cliche. It has been defined as the difference between what auditors do and what the public assumes they do or thinks they ought to do. The narrowing of the gap is clearly the principal motivation behind the Auditing Practices Board's (APB) current proposals for the future development of auditing. These include plans for the revision of existing audit reporting practice. The APB has isolated three key public misconceptions. First, misunderstandings of audited financial statements, such as assuming that they carry some element of guarantee that the entity concerned will continue in existence. Second, misunderstandings as to the type and extent of work undertaken by auditors, such as assuming that auditors prepare the financial statements on which they report. Third, misunderstandings about the level of assurance provided by auditors, assuming, for example, that an unqualified audit report provides absolute assurance that no fraud has occurred. In order to address these misconceptions, the APB is suggesting that the form of the audit report be expanded to include descriptions of the respective responsibilities of auditors and directors regarding financial statements. A similar approach has been recommended by the Cadbury report. That the public misconceptions cited by the APB and Cadbury exist is undeniable. Whether or not they are best dealt with through the APB's proposals for an expanded audit report is a different matter. Most of the efforts by the accounting profession to narrow the expectation gap are inevitably flawed because the true nature of the gap has not been fully identified. Up to now, whenever the question is addressed, discussion tends to focus on issues such as fraud, going concern and the responsibility of directors for the preparation of the accounts. What is seldom addressed is the distinction between the two main components of the expectation gap - namely the financial reporting component and the auditing component. In my view, this differentiation needs to be clearly made in order to make sensible judgments as to the way in which the various elements of the expectation gap should be addressed. The financial reporting component of the gap comprises those elements which relate to the purpose, nature and meaning of financial statements. The auditing component relates to the role and responsibility of the auditor in auditing and reporting on those financial statements. The financial reporting gap includes the misconception that a balance sheet gives an indication of the value of a company. More important, there appears to be a general lack of appreciation of the extent to which the figures presented in a company's financial statements are based on judgments and estimates. Furthermore, because of the wide range of alternative accounting options available to directors under existing accounting rules, similar transactions can be reported in the accounts in different ways depending on where the directors wish to be on the spectrum between aggressiveness and conservatism in their financial reporting. The auditors are unlikely to be in a position to do otherwise than to state in their report that the accounts give a 'true and fair view'. It would seem that at present the APB is placing an unrealistic onus and impractical hope on the audit report as a means of narrowing both components of the expectation gap. This is because the principal elements of the gap lie not in the words in the audit report, but in the financial statements on which the auditor is reporting. Or, putting it another way, they lie in the basis of preparation and presentation of the financial statements and not in the method by which the financial statements are audited or reported on by the auditor. While it is undeniable that the audit-related elements of the expectation gap exist, they are of secondary importance compared with the financial reporting-related elements. If the accounting, legislative and regulatory frameworks under which the financial statements are being prepared are inadequate, then it will make little difference whether the audit report runs to two paragraphs or two pages. The narrowing of the gap requires a multi-pronged attack with the co-operation of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), the Stock Exchange and the Department of Trade and Industry, as well as the APB. The expansion of the audit report is an important aspect of this process - but it is only one aspect and should not be dealt with in isolation. Perhaps a good starting point would be to provide an authoritative explanation of the meaning of 'true and fair', which has become a piece of ill-understood jargon. This is an issue which lawyers and accountants have been grappling with for many years, which perhaps indicates that it is a significant element of the expectation gap that needs to be addressed as a first step in the bridging process. Auditors are an easy target when things go wrong. However, at present there is a strong danger that they will simply find themselves assuming responsibility for legal and regulatory shortcomings not of their making. The form of accounts whose authentication is the auditor's responsibility is dictated by law. To blame the auditor for its deficiencies is to blame him for limitations in the wider environment of financial reporting which at present he can do nothing about. Unquestionably the public is entitled to reassurance over the various misunderstandings which the APB has outlined, but the audit report is not the place to pursue these issues. It is not only inappropriate but potentially misleading for an audit report to deal with the nature of financial statements. Moreover, as media comment has demonstrated, the result is to exacerbate the expectation gap. To bridge both the financial reporting and the auditing components of the expectation gap will require much more than defensive, if well-intentioned, proposals from members of the auditing profession. The ASB, the Stock Exchange and the DTI, in addition to the APB, have a part to play in ensuring that a thorough, on-going reform of financial reporting procedures is immediately set in train. The expansion of the audit report will be an important aspect of this process, but only one of a number of much-needed improvements. Merely to make audit reports more compendious just because the DTI, ASB, Stock Exchange and institutional investors are reluctant to face up to their responsibilities will solve nothing. In fact, such a step may well widen the expectation gap rather than bridge it. The criticism already levelled at auditors over the financial reporting expectation gap - an area for which they have little or no control - is wholly unjustifiable. It is time that the profession dropped its air of apologetic defensiveness. The fault lies in the wider environment of financial reporting; its redress is a collective responsibility.

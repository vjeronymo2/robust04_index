			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR AMERASIANS, A WELCOME MAT IS NOT ENOUGH  </P> <P> With the passage of the Amerasian Homecoming Act a year ago, Rep. Robert J.  Mrazek (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Tom Ridge (R-Pa.), the bill's co-sponsors, stated that  these half-American, half-Vietnamese youth "will have the opportunity to become  (American) citizens and realize the dream that millions of others have pursued  . . . ." Arrival in America should not be equated with the realization of that  dream.  </P> <P> Amerasians carry their own "dreams" about life in America. They arrive here  with already intense emotional ties to this "land of their fathers," carrying  inner images that are often highly idealized and unrealistic. All too many of  the Amerasians we are working with are poorly equipped -- socially,  educationally and psychologically -- to make the kind of adjustment and  eventual adaptation to life in America that most of us would judge to be  adequate. Without additional support to help them achieve a reasonable degree  of economic and emotional self-sufficiency, we fear that many may fall into a  cycle of poverty, gang membership and welfare dependency.  </P> <P> Is the success of the Amerasian Homecoming Act to be narrowly defined, measured  only by the "numbers moved" in a particular time frame? The legislation remains  myopic, being almost exclusively focused on expediting emigration. It contains  little balance of attention and virtually no fiscal allocation to address the  hard human issues of actual resettlement. Other criteria of success might  include measures of adjustment, for instance, the degree of economic  self-sufficiency. Important indicators would be rates of stable employment,  amount of time on public assistance and referral rates for medical and  mental-health services.  </P> <P> Over the last five years our work with Vietnamese Amerasians suggests that  diversity is what most characterizes this population. The obvious and striking  differences in terms of height, physique and skin color are matched by the  variety of personal histories they carry within them. Some have shown real  strength and resiliency, excelling socially, academically and economically. As  a whole, however, we have been concerned that on an environmental basis alone  (e.g., loss of a parent, material poverty, being of mixed race, minimal formal  education), most are at high risk for serious problems in long-term adaptation.  The Amerasians who arrived before the passage of the Amerasian Homecoming Act  have required more intensive special services than any other Southeast Asian  refugee group, both at the Philippine Refugee Processing Center and during the  post-arrival period.  </P> <P> Recent research suggests that, in general, this pattern will likely hold. As  many as 15% of the Amerasians in our sample have had no formal education and up  to 75% have had less than four years of schooling. The majority are virtually  illiterate in Vietnamese and arrive with no transferable job skills. The  implications are clear, including the high dropout rate already noted among the  teens.  </P> <P> The majority of Vietnamese Amerasians are now over 16 and have spent most of  their everyday lives outside of school. Given the absence of their fathers,  which has particular meaning in the patriarchal Vietnamese society, few have  been raised in strong, traditional families. They have tended to be poor, even  by Vietnamese standards. Thus, it should be no surprise that few have  internalized the values of academic achievement, discipline and self-sacrifice  that may have typified many of the earlier Vietnamese refugees. These  circumstances, when added to the fact that special support services for all  Southeast Asian refugee youth are extremely limited, will jeopardize their  potential for achieving the dream that the congressmen allude to.  </P> <P> Amerasians and their families are being resettled in about 25 "cluster sites"  across the United States. The ongoing, collaborative efforts of the Office of  Refugee Resettlement and InterAction (an organization of voluntary agencies  involved in resettlement) to help prepare for the increased arrival of  Amerasians and their families must be applauded and further supported. Funding  to increase professional staff at the local level and the extension of  educational and vocational training programs is crucial.  </P> <P> We are strong supporters of the underlying intent of the Amerasian Homecoming  Act. But Amerasians are a high-risk population arriving into a support system  that is already overtaxed. Defining the legislation's success in the narrow  terms of "numbers moved" fails to address the tougher and more long-standing  human problems of actual resettlement.  </P> <P> Historically, fate, circumstance and the arbitrariness of international  politics have not been kind to Amerasians. Only by seriously attending to the  course of resettlement can we assure a more genuine opportunity for them to  "make it" in America. To stop short only further extends the disfranchisement  of thousands of young people, who, under less politicized circumstances, might  already be reaping the benefits of American citizenship.  </P></p>

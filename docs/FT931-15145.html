			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Crisis reaches small insurance companies: Problems in Lloyd's market have spread THE widely publicised problems of the Lloyd's insurance market have distracted attention from the growing difficulties faced by many of London's smaller insurance companies. Over the past two years a dozen of the more than 100 'London market' companies, which insure risk in the same way as syndicates at Lloyd's, have been driven into insolvency by a wave of losses from catastrophes and US pollution and asbestosis awards. Many others have radically cut back their involvement in the specialised marine, aviation, liability and reinsurance business and are drawing on the resources of wealthier parent companies to meet heavy claims. The attempt by Trinity Insurance, a general insurance company which collapsed last year, to reach a new agreement with its creditors has highlighted this growing crisis. 'Many companies are now under a level of duress never previously known . . . several operations no longer appear to have the necessary critical mass for the business they are in,' concluded Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, last year. Larger brokers are refusing to place business with companies which have capital of less than Pounds 50m, says Ms Julianne Jessup, of De Lisle Jessup Scott, the insurance consultancy. 'Brokers take the view that with the current unpredictability of claims there isn't a big enough margin of error with the smaller companies,' said Ms Jessup. Mr Cliff Hampton, of Phoenix Securities, says that smaller companies are missing out on better-quality business provided by the bigger brokers and suffering worse underwriting results, and that many smaller companies may merge. There is scope for rationalisation, as 134 companies trading in London (excluding the branches of foreign companies) in 1990 had average shareholders' funds of only Pounds 16.6m each, according to S&amp;P, which adds that the number of companies whose financial security is rated 'vulnerable' has risen to 41 compared with 27 at the end of 1991. Documents sent last week to creditors of Trinity Insurance said that 'imprudent' investments had contributed to Trinity's collapse last year. But Mr John Winter, the company doctor who has superintended the company's affairs over the past few months, says: 'Trinity would have had trouble anyway simply because of its small capital base.' He says 12 other insolvent London market insurance companies are likely to follow Trinity's example and negotiate schemes of arrangement with creditors and policyholders. Schemes allow directors to remain in charge of companies during their winding down under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner, avoiding the need for a liquidation, which can delay payments to policyholders for years. Companies currently negotiating schemes include other small independent companies such as Bryanston (a sister company of Trinity, also ultimately owned by GFA Holdings), Andrew Weir, Chancellor, as well as a number of subsidiaries of the London United Investments, the property-to-investment group placed in administration early in 1990. Mr Chris Keeling, deputy chairman of English &amp; American, another small independent company, said he was forced to stop underwriting after its backers - which include Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank - refused to inject more capital. English &amp; American, whose management is highly regarded, saw net assets dwindle to below Pounds 29m after losses on its marine cargo account. 'In my view the days of the small independent London market company are numbered,' said Mr Keeling. Among subsidiaries of bigger European or US insurance companies to withdraw are Orion, which is owned by the Dutch group ING, while NWRe, a London market company jointly-owned by Norwich Union, Winterthur the Swiss company, and Chiyoda of Japan has scaled back its involvement in the marine and some other areas of the London market. The reinsurance subsidiaries of Royal Insurance and Prudential are both cutting back on London market business. Since the beginning of 1991 the Institute of London Underwriters, which provides back-up services to companies specialising in marine, aviation and transport insurance, has lost 19 of its 114 members. Mr Anthony Funnell of the ILU expects the trend to continue and says that increasingly companies with less than Pounds 20m in assets will find it difficult to survive. 'It will be the survival of the biggest and the fittest.'</p>

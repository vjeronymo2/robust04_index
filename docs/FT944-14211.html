			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Paris - Other Markets The recent fall in the French market has led brokers to reassess their year-end targets for the CAC-40 index, writes John Pitt. Hoare Govett, for example, has reduced its target to 1,950 - the index closed at 1,842.09 on Friday - although the broker remains overweight in France in relation to the rest of continental Europe. While nearly all company results are now in, a few remain, such as Accor, the hotel and travel services group, which will publish disappointing first-half results tomorrow. The company prepared investors for the worst last week, but added that second-half figures were always better. The French hotel and leisure industry has been experiencing a difficult time, especially as the decline in consumer spending continues. Club Med and EuroDisney have been lowering their prices with mixed results: Club Med has seen occupancy rates climb after price cuts of up to 3 per cent, while the theme park operator has still failed to increase visitor numbers in spite of reducing admission charges. The share prices have also gone in both directions - Club Med rising 20 per cent since the start of the year and EuroDisney down 53 per cent over the same period. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

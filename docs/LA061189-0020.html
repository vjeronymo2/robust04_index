			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SMORGASBORD OF 'PHANTOM' LETTERS  </P> <P> Those who have dashed out of the Ahmanson to praise "Phantom" will no doubt be  searching Bernheimer out with the intent of bodily injury. He has exposed their  lack of taste and ignorance of musicals.  </P> <P> While I've only heard bits and pieces, seen odds and ends of the actual  production, selected excerpts for promotion and general advertising, that's all  that is needed to know that Lloyd Webber's latest offering shows little if any  talent or effort on his part.  </P> <P> Bernheimer is to be commended for having the courage to say that this musical  has phantom music and phantom lyrics, haunted not by a Phantom of the Opera but  rather a phantom of mediocrity.  </P> <P> RICHARD WESTERLIND  </P> <P> Desert Hot Springs  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Arts: Simon Rattle and the CBSO - Carnegie Hall, New York Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra gave three well-attended Carnegie Hall concerts last week. The programmes - big works of 1911-1913, from the orchestra's Towards the Millennium enterprise - have already been reviewed in these pages. Three of the pieces - Ravel's Daphnis, Debussy's Images, and Stravinsky's Rite of Spring - were live manifestations of EMI recordings. More than once, in London, I have felt that the Birmingham orchestra was a band overpraised - because it has so remarkable a conductor and plays so responsible a civic role. I wondered what people would hear and think in Carnegie, where the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonics, Cleveland, Chicago, and Boston set standards for orchestral playing. The LPO came to Carnegie last month, under Franz Welser-Most, played Beethoven, and by American standards did not play well. The New York judgment seems to be that the CBSO is an excellent but hyped regional orchestra - as accomplished as the orchestras of, say, Cincinnati, Baltimore, and St. Louis but not, internationally, in the first league: not in respect of string tone or of woodwind virtuosity. The New York Times critic put it more strongly: 'When the clouds of praise clear away . . . what we hear is an assemblage of very modest skills . . . The wind soloists are undistinguished. The brass is muddy and tends to creak in exposed moments; the strings are dry.' But that was after the first concert. I heard all three and thought that the orchestra as it settled into Carnegie - which, after the recent rebuild, is no longer the welcoming, flattering hall it used to be - began to sound better and better. The strings did bloom in On hearing the first cuckoo (an encore); they positively glowed in a movement of Apollo (another encore). And the orchestra played often with magical softness, such as American orchestras - even the New York Philharmonic under Masur - seldom achieve. It also showed that it could play as loudly as any rivals, but it did not respond to every f and ff indication with an ffff. The only flop performance in a series of eight 1911-13 works (plus four encores) was Pierrot Lunaire, declaimed (in German, not English) and cutely mimed in a spotlight by Elise Ross while the instrumentalists, encouraged by Rattle, played out, eloquently, and drowned her. The only work not worth hearing was Prokofiev's brittle First Piano Concerto. (Forget it unless Richter is the soloist). Nielsen's Sinfonia Espansiva, Daphnis, Images, Jeux, and the Rite were spellbinding. Falstaff was emotionally a knockout to a point where I struggled to stifle sobs distracting to neighbours. Eighty years ago, composers wrote with a richness and thoroughness that makes today's American symphonic lions - Del Tredici, Corigliano, Glass, Reich, Torke, Kernis, Zwilich - seem sadly simple-Simon. Simon - not the simple one, but the Birmingham Simon with high, serious aims  -is a British success story. Nige is another. Mr Kennedy made his New York Philharmonic debut the same week, playing the Sibelius concerto, in Avery Fisher Hall. For the record, he wore a black-and-white patched jerkin and prominent red-white-and-blue socks above sneakers, and sported a colourful scarf; a peacock among penguins, he made the New York players, conventionally clad, look dowdy, middle-aged or old. He played the hell out of the concerto, gave a fearless, high-contrast performance. (Colleagues made comparisons with Huberman, another controversial violinist who put passion above polish.) I thought his performance very exciting. So, evidently, did Kurt Masur, the responsive conductor. The CBSO concerts were supported by the British Arts Council, the New York Arts Council, and many private donors.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs pressured Regional electricity companies suffered as selling by one securities house and disappointing news from one company highlighted their outperformance of the broader market. Scottish Hydro-Electric said its hydro output had dropped by 26 per cent on 1992-1993. Analysts said problems were specific to the company and depressed hydro output resulting from low rainfall in Scotland had been expected. However it combined with a reiterated sell note from UBS to focus attention on the sector. The sector has outperformed the FT All-Share on most timescales yet concern remains ahead of a distribution review expected in July. Scottish Hydro slipped 6 to 376p and Scottish Power fell 14 to 401p helping to lead the sector down. PowerGen hit a low for the year before closing 12 off at 507p Eastern Electricity fell 22 to 663p, and Norweb 27 to 664p.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (9): Christmas spirit never stops - Alan Pike previews the festive season - 1994 Throughout December, the offices of the Charities Advisory Trust have bustled with the spirit of the Christmas after next. The trust is one of the main promoters of charity Christmas cards and Hilary Blum, its director, is already deeply involved in thinking about designs that will go on sale for Christmas 1994. Set up in 1979, the trust was established to advise charities on their trading activities. During the 1980s a growing number moved into various forms of trading, but the business skills for selling and marketing success do not automatically exist on the staff of charities. Christmas cards were the trust's first venture. Ms Blum's aim has been to improve the service, quality and income that charities receive from card operations, and she has consciously driven the trust's range to the top end of the market to improve margins. The trust's Card Aid outlets now sell tens of millions of cards a year, although Ms Blum says that smaller charities able to sell at least 500 packs can sensibly have their own cards. The trust's most recent venture has been its Museum Stores in London, which sell reproductions of items in museums and art galleries around the world. The first store opened in 1988; two more have been launched this year. Ms Blum's staff have also helped real museum shops. Birmingham City Museums and Art Galleries asked the trust to revive the fortunes of its retail outlets, which were losing Pounds 100,000 a year - now returned to profitability. The trust operates on basic business principles of avoiding waste. 'That even applies when I am away from London on business,' says Ms Blum. 'I don't just walk around the local art galleries for pleasure - I'm always looking out for new ideas for Christmas cards and the Museum Stores.'</p>

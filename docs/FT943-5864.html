			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (2): Feeling good under grey skies - The economy: Popular optimism runs ahead of actual recovery The ticket vending machines at Osaka station offer a convenience unknown in other parts of Japan. Instead of having to patiently insert one coin at a time, ticket buyers can throw in up to five coins all at once. Right in front of the station, the traffic lights inform pedestrians how much longer they must wait for the light to turn green. The ticket machines and traffic lights suit the restless nature of the tradesmen of Osaka, the commercial heartland of the Kansai region, where the pace is fast and the people are irachi - or impatient, in the down-to-earth local dialect. Lately, the innate impatience of Osaka folk, coupled with their natural optimism, has extended to their views of the economy, prompting a growing feeling that the recovery which the whole of Japan has been anxiously waiting for, has finally arrived. It has arrived, Osaka street wisdom has it, not in Tokyo but in the Kansai. Even the national press has highlighted the recent plethora of publications on Kansai, the increase in new car registrations in June, and the jump in travellers to the cities of Kyoto and Osaka this year, and has concluded that Kansai is further down the road to recovery than Kanto, the region consisting of Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures. 'Although it may not show in the statistics, people say that there is a liveliness in the Kansai economy,' asserts Mr Takaharu Akitake, general manager of the Kansai economy research department, at Daiwa Research Institute in Osaka. 'There are no bright spots on the horizon in Tokyo as far as the economy is concerned, but as a region, Kansai is feeling healthy,' he says. But available evidence hardly justifies such confidence. The region's gross product fell last year for the first time in 18 years, by 0.1 per cent. Osaka's business district suffers an embarrassing abundance of empty offices, and the streets are littered with 'for rent' signs. Commercial land prices in the Osaka area fell 19.5 per cent in 1992 and 24 per cent in 1993, while residential property prices saw a fall of 23 per cent two years ago and 17 per cent last year, according to the Osaka chamber of commerce and industry. And prices are still falling. 'For the next three years the Osaka market is going to be a tenants' market,' says Mr Paul Boylan, a consultant to Sekisui House, Japan's largest house builder. 'Rents are falling, land prices are falling and the knock-on effect from the Kansai International Airport is not happening.' Large new developments like the Osaka Business Park, Rokko Island and Rinku Town were developed to meet rising demand for office space, but the collapse of the property market since the turn of the decade has left many of the new high-rise buildings only partially occupied. Ambitious plans for Rinku Town, being developed at a site near the new international airport, had to be cancelled, and Osaka prefecture is instead making the space available temporarily for fairs and various events. Nor have the banks based in the Kansai region been spared the massive bad debts that have weighed heavily on Japan's financial system in the past few years. The region has had its share of scandals, stemming from the years of financial and speculative excess in the late 1980s - such as the disclosure that the prestigious Industrial Bank of Japan had made loans of up to Y240bn to an Osaka restaurateur, who made speculative stock market purchases based on seances and has been charged with fraud and forgery. Companies based in Kansai, from Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics company, to Obayashi, the general contractor which owns Bracken House, are still suffering from the debilitating effects of Japan's longest recession since the war. Meanwhile, traditional industries, such as textiles, which used to support the region's economy, have suffered not only from the downturn in consumer spending but also from an influx of cheaper imports from other Asian countries. Nishijin, a town outside Kyoto where expensive, traditional silk kimono are woven by hand, has seen the number of families in the business fall from 270,000 to just 20,000. 'At the present, Nishijin weaving is surviving as an industry. But there is a question as to what will happen in five years' time,' laments Mr Yoshio Katsuyama, a director of the Nishijin weavers' industry union. The slump in consumer spending, which has hit department stores sales particularly hard, has forced Seibu, a prestigious retailer, to take the unprecedented step of closing its store in Kobe. Nevertheless, hopes are rising that, with the worst of the recession behind it, Kansai can take the lead in pulling the country out of recession. With the current coalition government facing an uncertain future, and with many conventional business practices being questioned, Tokyo companies will not be able to take advantage of their proximity to the central halls of power, reckons Mr Yoshihiro Otani, general manager of public relations at the Osaka chamber of commerce. In contrast to Tokyo's current powerlessness, he says, 'Kansai businesses have always relied on their own strength rather than on the central government.' Faced with uncertainty, Kansai is thus better placed to pull itself out of the long downward spiral of the past few years by sheer ingenuity and drive. 'The 21st century is the era of Kansai,' Mr Otani declares. Part of this optimism in Kansai can be attributed to the psychological impact of the many large-scale projects that are expected to significantly improve the area's infrastructure and increase its cultural and academic appeal. Apart from the international airport, which will bring more tourists and businessmen to the area, the new roads and railways, built to accommodate the increased traffic, the need for surrounding facilities, such as distribution warehouses and conference halls, and new services, are expected to raise economic activity. Investment in surrounding facilities totals Y3,000bn (Dollars 30bn) says Daiwa's Mr Akitake. In addition, projects to build facilities such as the Kansai Science City, will bring research and cultural activities to the area. Science City, which spans Osaka, Kyoto and Nara, is the site of the first multimedia experiments being held under the auspices of the ministry of posts and telecommunications. The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, connecting Awaji Island with the mainland, will become the longest suspension bridge in the world. Wakayama, to the west of Osaka, will host an international resort exposition this year on a reclaimed island in the Sea of Japan. All of this activity will help to spur economic growth in the Kansai region by 1.3 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent in 1995, Daiwa Research forecasts. Observers also believe that the push for economic deregulation that is being seen in Tokyo is another reason why Kansai has a better chance of recovery than Tokyo. The region has always fostered an entrepreneurial spirit that has in the past given rise to new businesses, such as instant noodles (which have become a staple throughout Japan), self-service sushi bars and karaoke. But for many years, Kansai has had to watch successful businesses move out to Tokyo in order to be close to the sources of information and the seat of political and bureaucratic power. As the bureaucracy is increasingly forced to relax its grip on authority and on information, more businesses will find it easier to grow in Kansai, and the region will benefit from its intrinsic resourcefulness, Mr Akitake believes. 'It would be dangerous to have everything concentrated in Tokyo,' he warns. With the new airport, improved infrastructure and less red tape, Kansai can now offer an alternative. 'This is not just for the good of Kansai, but the good of Japan as a whole.'</p>

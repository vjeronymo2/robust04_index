			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Vyacheslav Kostikov,  spokesman of the Russian president, warned against speculations  about the health of the Russian president and hinted that Boris  Yeltsin is healthy enough to run for the second term of office  in 1996.    "Political speculations based on rumours and malevolence  about the health of Boris Yeltsin look extremely ugly and  unpatriotic. This does not correspond to the Russian character,"  Kostikov said in a statement on Tuesday.    "I have to tell those who would like to use the question of  the health of the president for their political intrigues and  ambitions that the health of Boris Yeltsin allows him to  reliably and resolutely run the country during the term of  office fixed by the constitution, and in case of state necessity  and the choice of the people, also outside this term," the  spokesman stressed.    He was evidently referring to those political forces who  hope  to replace Yeltsin in case he steps down because of health  reasons before his term of office expires in 1996. According to  the constitution, early presidential elections become inevitable  in this case.    Kostikov confirmed that the president had suffered from a  strong cold of late and said that Yeltsin had to breach the  advised medical regime to hold talks with visiting British Prime  Minister John Major on Tuesday.    The spokesman added that Yeltsin had not yet recovered  completely and thus the presidential "state of the nation"  address to parliament may be postponed.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 100-M.P.H. WINDS WHIP EUROPE, KILL 35;  </P> <P> STORMS: THE SECOND SET OF DEADLY GUSTS THIS YEAR CUTS POWER, DAMAGES BUILDINGS,  DISRUPTS TRAVEL.  </P> <P> Gale-force winds struck Western Europe on Monday, tearing down roofs and power  lines, disrupting transportation on land, sea and air and killing at least 35  people.  </P> <P> Winds were clocked at 100 m.p.h. at Aberporth along the Scottish border, while  Leeds in central England reported winds up to 98 m.p.h.  </P> <P> It was the second major storm to strike Europe this year. Ninety-five people  were killed Jan. 25 in winds that gusted up to 106 m.p.h. Wind speeds in late  January and February were the strongest in 18 years, averaging 15 m.p.h. the  last two weeks at Heathrow Airport, the London Weather Center said.  </P> <P> Flood warnings were posted on the north coast of West Germany and parts of  Denmark.  </P> <P> Twelve deaths were reported in Britain, seven in West Germany and two in East  Germany, five in Belgium, seven in France and one each in Ireland and the  Netherlands.  </P> <P> The dead included a driver whose double-decker bus hit a fallen tree, an  elderly man killed by a falling chimney and an elderly woman struck by a slate  blown from a roof, police and rescue workers said.  </P> <P> A policeman on patrol in suburban Brussels was killed and a colleague was  injured when a tree was blown onto their car. In northeastern Damme, Belgium,  the roof of the tourism office collapsed, killing one worker and injuring  another. Two people died when their home collapsed in Bekkevoort, Belgium. A  motorist was also killed by a tree in Embourg near Liege.  </P> <P> In Hamburg, West Germany, a 76-year-old woman was killed when winds pushed her  in front of a moving car. In France, a 3-year-old girl was killed by a falling  branch in Avesnes sur Helpes.  </P> <P> Police imposed a 50-m.p.h. speed limit in some areas in Britain, and the  Automobile Assn. advised motorists to stay home.  </P> <P> The winds disrupted ferry service between Ireland and Wales, as well as between  the British mainland and the Isle of Wight and Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> In the port of Antwerp, a river ship sank after a 15-ton crane fell onto the  vessel, injuring several people.  </P> <P> In the North Wales seaside town of Towyn, police were evacuating 2,000 people  threatened by a high tide. Huge waves smashed a 200-yard hole in the seawall  and sent a torrent cascading through the streets, flooding homes.  </P> <P> Cuts in the overhead power lines halted some train traffic in Belgium, the  state-owned railroad company said. Thousands of homes in Britain were without  electricity.  </P> <P> At Heathrow Airport, many airlines were unable to load catered meals onto  airplanes, and passengers were instead offered meals in the departure lounges.  Authorities feared winds could upset the trucks that lift trays of prepared  meals onto aircraft.  </P></p>

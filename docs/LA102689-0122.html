Moammar Kadafi acknowledged for the first time that Libya had bankrolled  terrorist groups but said it no longer does so. In an interview with the  Egyptian government-owned weekly magazine Al Mussawar, Kadafi was quoted as  saying that "when we discovered that these groups were causing more harm than  benefit to the Arab cause, we halted our aid to them completely and withdrew  our support." Kadafi also said he wants no confrontation with Washington.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Willfried Penner, legal  adviser of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  Bundestag Group, recommends that German soldiers not use the  airplanes with the AWACS monitoring system in the event of NATO  air strikes against Serbian positions around Sarajevo. He told  the WESTDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, which is published in Duesseldorf,  that the temporary directive of the Federal Constitutional Court  does not cover participation in combat missions outside the NATO  area, even though AWACS serve only an observer function. The  Karlsruhe ruling must come first, he said.</p>

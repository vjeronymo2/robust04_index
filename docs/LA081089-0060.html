			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> A Garden Grove official who feels the city could replace subsidized  performances by the Garden Grove Symphony with free concerts by military bands  was the lone dissenter when the City Council voted 4-1 to allocate $16,000 for  the orchestra's fifth annual free summer concert on Aug. 19. Council member  Robert F. Dinsen also opposed an additional $14,000 for the symphony for the  fiscal year that began July 1. The councilman, who opposes all municipal  support for the arts, including the annual Grove Shakespeare Festival,  complains that the Garden Grove Symphony's overhead has grown too high and says  the orchestra is "overloaded with professionals." Military groups have played  free concerts in the city twice in the last two years, but a spokesman for the  U.S. Navy Band in San Diego says that military groups are limited to performing  patriotic programs and prohibited from replacing an organization of  professional musicians. Union and symphony officials say they are not opposed  to anything that doesn't replace a paid performance. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

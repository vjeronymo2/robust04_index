			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Sellafield discharge figures revised THE public consultation period for British Nuclear Fuels' new Thorp plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, due to end on Monday, was yesterday extended by two weeks after BNF issued new figures showing that some past radioactive discharges had been slightly higher than it had previously indicated. BNF said in a letter to the pollution inspectorate that the 'minor errors' were due to a change in sampling techniques and to confusion between gigabecquerels (a billion units of radioactivity) and megabecquerels (a million units). Dr Patrick Green of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group which yesterday published its own 160-page submission to the inspectorate, said: 'This raises even more uncertainty about what has been put out in the past, so how are we to be sure of what they are putting out in the future?' The revised figures show that the average discharges to the air of alpha radiation from the site's main stacks between 1988 and 1991 had been 0.9 GBq instead of the previously reported 0.7 GBq. However average beta radiation emitted had been 10 GBq instead of the previously reported 11 GBq. BNF said: 'The overall impact of this re-estimation is so small that in BNF's view the proposed discharge limits will not be affected.' The site selected by UK Nirex for its proposed Pounds 2.5bn underground nuclear-waste repository at Sellafield is a poor one, according to a report by Environmental Resources, an independent consultancy. The report is the latest and most critical in a series commissioned by Cumbria County Council. It suggests that groundwater from the repository could reach the surface in about 300 years.</p>

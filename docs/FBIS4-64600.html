			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, would  like to raise the diplomatic status of its information offices  in the Nordic countries. The PLO representative in Finland is  appealing to the Finnish Government to raise the matter at a  Nordic foreign ministers's meeting which starts in Reykjavik  tomorrow. The PLO says that if Finland, as the first Nordic  country, were to set an example in this matter, the Palestinians  would value this as much as they value the contributions of  Norway and Sweden in the Middle East peace process.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Conduct an adequate survey of the radiographic exposure device with a radiation survey instrument after each exposure to determine that the sealed source has been returned to its shielded position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Conduct a survey when approaching the guide tube before exchanging films, repositioning the collimator, or dismantling equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Conduct an adequate survey with a radiation survey instrument any time the source is exchanged and whenever a radiographic exposure device is placed in a storage area (as defined in &sect;34.3) to ensure that the sealed source is in its shielded position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Conduct a survey of the storage area to ensure that radiation levels do not exceed the limits specified in 10 CFR 20.1301. These surveys must be performed initially with radioactive material present in the storage location and thereafter at the time of the quarterly inventory and whenever storage conditions change (i.e., increases in radioactive material present or changes in shielding or arrangement of the radioactive material).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Maintain records in accordance with &sect;34.85.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 39. Section 34.51 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;34.51  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Surveillance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During each radiographic operation the radiographer or radiographer's assistant shall maintain continuous direct visual surveillance of the operation to protect against unauthorized entry into a high radiation area, as defined in part 20 of this chapter, except at permanent radiographic installations where all entryways are locked and the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;34.33 are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40. Section 34.53 is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;34.53  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Posting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Areas in which radiography is being performed must be conspicuously posted as required by &sect;20.1902(a) and (b) of this chapter. Exceptions listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;20.1903 of this chapter do not apply to radiographic operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41. A new heading for subpart E, consisting of &sect;&sect;34.61&hyph;34.91, is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Recordkeeping Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 42.

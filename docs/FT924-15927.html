			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Detroit feels whip hand of the Lopez revolution: The man who is forcing General Motors' suppliers to shape up Listen to the cries of anguish echoing around Detroit these days and you might conclude that Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is a latter-day Spanish inquisitor. After only four months in charge of worldwide purchasing at General Motors, Mr Lopez, who hails from Spain's Basque country, has managed to fill a sizeable proportion of the US car group's parts suppliers with fear, trepidation and anger. The cause: a drive to cut costs through a radical shake-up in the way the group organises its parts purchases in North America and its links with suppliers. This involves methods tested by Mr Lopez during the 1980s at once-ailing GM Europe, which has become one of the world's most profitable car manufacturers. Tall, slim and 51 years old, Mr Lopez has a charming, informal manner that belies his axeman reputation. Supporters say Mr Lopez is implementing a long-overdue shake-up of GM's ties with suppliers. But some parts makers have accused him of undermining their relationship with GM by putting contracts up for renegotiation and demanding unrealistic improvements in what they argue are good productivity records and thin profit margins. There are few more pips left to squeak, they say, after a parts industry rationalisation in the 1980s which cost 100,000 jobs. Not so, replies Mr Lopez. At a press briefing this week he answered his critics for the first time and declared that: Many US parts manufacturers are less competitive than those in Europe and are capable of huge productivity improvements; GM is trying to form a new, closer partnership with its best suppliers, including advising them on efficiency and offering long-term contracts; The company has never said it intends to break existing contracts and has no intention of doing so, although it wants to prod suppliers into efficiency gains that feed into price cuts. The outcome of the Lopez revolution could have widespread repercussions. His attempt to clamp down on GM's costs forms a crucial part of the group's struggle to return its core North American car business to profit. This is why he was plucked last May from his position as head of European purchasing, following a coup by GM board members unhappy over slow progress in turning US operations around. GM obtains 70 per cent of parts from its subsidiaries, which will now have to raise efficiency and compete with outside suppliers. This could mean job cuts, prompting further clashes with the United Auto Workers' union. Practical effects for GM's purchasing policy have been twofold. First, the company has changed the structure of its parts-buying bureaucracy. It previously ran a decentralised system under which parts for North American plants were bought by more than two dozen units. Now contracts are put out to global tender and have to be approved by Mr Lopez's team. Second, Mr Lopez says GM is 'concentrating our efforts on selecting suppliers who put the customer first . . . in terms of quality, service and price'. And it is doing so through a process with the brain-numbing title of Purchased Input Concept Optimisation with Suppliers, or Picos. Picos means working with suppliers to improve relations, for example by reaching agreements on contracts years before a car is brought into production. But its most dramatic manifestation has been GM's intervention in manufacturing processes. Mr Lopez says this involves GM drawing up global benchmarks of price and performance. It then contacts those among its suppliers that are not among the best worldwide and offers to help them improve. Those that accept find themselves put through an intensive week-long study of working methods by members of Mr Lopez's 200-strong Picos team. In four months his team has conducted 101 US workshops These, he says, have yielded an average productivity improvement of 65 per cent, with a 52 per cent cut in material in process and a 35 per cent cut in floor space. He presents Detroit-based General Safety, a manufacturer of seat belts, as one convert to the Picos system. Mr Al Fisher, its president, confirms that the company has enjoyed a 30 per cent productivity rise in areas converted from assembly line system to cell structure after suggestions from GM. 'It has improved our profitability and competitiveness,' he declares. For suppliers that work to meet its new standards, GM says it is prepared to offer the security of long-term contracts, covering the life of a vehicle, rather than contracts of one or two years. However, the future looks grim for manufacturers not prepared to accept GM's criticisms and help. GM may not cancel existing contracts, but will not sign new ones with suppliers that fail to toe the line. Motor industry Cassandras say the new policy will mean a big cut in the number of GM suppliers, with smaller, less efficient manufacturers falling by the wayside. But Mr Lopez says that in Europe GM's supplier base has been little changed by Picos, while so far in the US 'we have not lost 100 per cent of a single supplier'. Parts makers may moan privately, but none can afford to offend a company that buys Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17bn) of parts a year in North America alone. The Spaniard may be an inquisitor, but he is also their hope for salvation.</p>

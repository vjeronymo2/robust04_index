			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Pepe warns of losses and passed dividend PEPE GROUP, the USM-quoted jeans designer and distributor, will make a small loss after tax for the year to end March because of rationalisation of its international operations. It will also pass its final dividend for the first time since it came to the market in 1985. Its shares yesterday fell 30p to close at 42p. The profits warning comes less than a year after the then chairman Mr Arun Shah said the board was optimistic that performance for the current year would reflect a marked improvement on the previous year. Mr Shah, who is now deputy chairman, was succeeded as chairman by Mr Silas Chou in March. Mr Chou has decided to bring forward the reorganisation resulting in big exceptional charges. The group is to concentrate on its brand name, Pepe, instead of spreading its resources on other names such as BSCO, Hardcore and Buffalo. Pepe is also to change its strategy of trying to increase overall sales in favour of chasing higher margins on less turnover. There are likely to be substantial extraordinary charges relating to the sale or closure of subsidiaries. Operating profits, whilst below those achieved in previous years, are likely to be in line with market expectations. In spite of a slight increase in sales from Pounds 81.3m to Pounds 82m, pre-tax profits in the six months to September 29 fell by 13 per cent, from Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3.09m. The interim dividend was cut from 2.5p to 2p. Group borrowings for the year have fallen by just over half to Pounds 14.5m. The balance sheet was strengthened by a Pounds 9.4m convertible preference share issue in July.</p>

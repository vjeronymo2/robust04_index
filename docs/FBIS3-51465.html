			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Harare, 15 Jan (AFP) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina, who is currently in Harare, reacted with  annoyance to the Spanish Government's demand that Cuba free six  political prisoners before Robaina's next visit to Madrid in  March.    "We do not make visits conditional upon someone being  released," the Cuban foreign minister told AFP upon arriving in  Harare, the third leg of his African tour.    He declared that he was not aware of Madrid's effort but  added: "I believe there is someone interested in certain cases  in Spain."    "The Spanish leaders have enough relations and experience to  know how we have studied and treated this type of case in recent  years," Robaina continued. "First, it would be necessary for me  to personally receive their request so I can later tell them  what I think of it."    Last Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana gave  Isabel Allende, Cuban deputy foreign relations minister, a list  of prisoners accompanied by a request for their release.  Allende is on a working tour of Spain.</p>

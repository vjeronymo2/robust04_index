			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucy Castillo from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>   [Text] Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state  for inter-American affairs, is in Nicaragua to gather  information, not to discuss issues that are strictly Nicaraguan  internal affairs. This statement was made by National Assembly  President Luis Humberto Guzman. Guzman explains Watson's visit  by saying he is in Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission.    This morning, Watson met with the leaders of the political  parties in parliament, with the exception of UNO's leaders, and  with the president of the legislative branch.    Sergio Ramirez, the leader of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front's [FSLN] legislative representation,  characterized the U.S. State Department's report on human rights  in Nicaragua as being biased.    [Begin Ramirez recording] I told him the human rights report  looks like an expression of an ingrained antagonism I think  should be expunged from the relations the United States  maintains with the sector of Nicaraguan society represented by  us Sandinists. In many ways, this report is anti-Sandinist and  biased. [end recording]    Contradicting the human rights report, Watson reported in  his  speech at the U.S.-Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce that the  Clinton administration acknowledges the Sandinists comprise a  legitimate Nicaraguan political force, which maintains all of  the rights and responsibilities granted to every political party.    In response to a reporter's question, National Assembly  President Luis Alberto Guzman said internal Nicaraguan affairs  must only be discussed among Nicaraguans.    [Begin Guzman recording] We mentioned the constitutional  reforms issue, but I insisted that we discuss these issues with  the understanding that these are strictly Nicaraguan affairs.  In no way did I request counsel or recommendations on what we  should do in terms of such issues. These matters were discussed  as a courtesy afforded to any foreign visitor, but I insisted  that this would not be done in any way to solicit opinions or  counsel on what we, the Nicaraguan people, should do. I truly  understand that these are matters that concern us, the  Nicaraguan people. [end recording]    This evening Watson met socially with various national  political, social, and economic leaders.</p>

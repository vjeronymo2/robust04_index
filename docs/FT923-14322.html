			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Rates cut in Australia to spur recovery AUSTRALIA cut official interest rates early today to try to give further stimulus to its stalling economy recovery. The Reserve Bank of Australia, the central bank, said it would act in the money market to cut official cash rates to around 5.75 per cent from 6.5 per cent. It also cut its rediscount rate - the rate it pays on treasury notes prior to maturity - to 6.25 per cent from 7 per cent. The rate cuts were less than generally expected. A full percentage point drop had been widely forecast. The last cut in rates came just two months ago but Australia's hesitant recovery from recession has underlined the urgency of further measures. Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said the country's unemployment problems showed the need for a spur to economic growth. But he indicated that the government might lift interest rates again if a pick-up in inflation made this necessary. Pressure for a rate cut grew yesterday with the release of the preliminary budget deficit of ADollars 9.4bn (Pounds 3.66bn) for the year which ended in June. This is higher than the ADollars 9.3bn revised forecast in May and double the original ADollars 4.7bn estimated in August last year. The government attributed the deficit to the slower than expected economic recovery which had led to further falls in revenue and large increases in welfare payments. Outlays rose to ADollars 102.7m from the original estimate of ADollars 101.5m, mainly due to the spending programme introduced in February by the prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, to stimulate the economy. The programme was designed to bring unemployment below 10 per cent before the election which must be held by mid-1993. The Reserve Bank figures released yesterday showed stagnant lending to business. Unemployment figures due tomorrow will bring more bad news for the government. The June unemployment rate is expected to show little change from the 10.6 per cent recorded in May. The run of bad economic news has dented confidence in Mr Keating's government. Only three months ago, Mr Keating appeared to have polished up the battered image of the government left by his predecessor, Mr Bob Hawke. Mr Keating will attempt to regain some ground in a forthcoming 'employment summit' where he is expected to announce more steps to create jobs, especially for young people.</p>

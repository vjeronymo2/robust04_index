			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / US group to spend Dollars 6bn on three gas plants ENRON, one of the largest gas companies in the US, expects to announce plans to build at least three gas-fired power stations worldwide by the end of the year - one in the UK - at a total cost of close to Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.2bn). The company yesterday inaugurated its 1,875MW power plant at Teesside which is the largest combined heat and power station in the world. Mr Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron, said the Teesside plant in which the company owns a 50 per cent stake will be a showpiece for its worldwide power operations. The Teesside station cost Pounds 850m and took just over two years to build, which the company believes is the shortest construction time ever for a plant of this size. Mr Lay said the company was in discussions about a Dollars 600m gas-fired power plant in Kuwait and a Dollars 2bn power project in Turkey, where it is working with Midlands Electricity which also has a stake in Teesside. Enron is also negotiating with India about a Dollars 3bn complex south of Bombay. Mr Lay stressed that Enron would not be investing the full cost of these plants because the company did not plan to take more than a half share in each venture and all would be funded by project finance. 'Our vision is to become the world's first global gas integrated company capable of developing projects in any segment of the gas business like the oil majors 50 years ago,' he said. Mr Lay believes that gas will become a more important fuel than oil early next century. In the UK, he said the company was involved in detailed discussions about three or four new gas-fired stations, one of which he expected to go ahead with by the end of the year at a probable cost of about Dollars 400m. Enron is finalising a Dollars 200m project for Russia's Gazprom to update part of its pipeline system and compressor stations. The company is also talking to China about setting up a joint venture to construct a 2,000MW to 4,000MW power station at a cost of between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 4bn. Enron transports about 18 per cent of US gas usage through its pipelines and had a turnover of Dollars 6.33bn last year. It operates four gas-fired power stations in the US with another under construction.</p>

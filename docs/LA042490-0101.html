			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTS HIT WALL STREET; HUNDREDS ARE ARRESTED;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: DEMONSTRATORS ALSO GATHER IN SAN FRANCISCO, COMPLAINING THAT  CORPORATIONS CO-OPTED EARTH DAY.  </P> <P> More than 250 people were arrested Monday during environmental protests on Wall  Street and in the financial district of San Francisco.  </P> <P> At least 11 people, including seven police officers, received minor injuries.  </P> <P> Hundreds of demonstrators converged on the New York Stock Exchange and the  Pacific Stock Exchange chanting slogans such as "Wall Street kills," and  complaining that corporations had turned Earth Day into a marketing tool  without doing enough to protect the environment.  </P> <P> The demonstrations were organized by a nationwide coalition of environmental  organizations, including Earth First!, the Clamshell Alliance and the Youth  Greens.  </P> <P> In San Francisco, police at the Pacific Stock Exchange were pelted with rocks,  eggs, golf balls and sharpened pieces of metal, San Francisco Police spokesman  David Ambrose said.  </P> <P> A scuffle ensued when police tried to make arrests. The windshield of a police  car was broken and several people were arrested on charges of assaulting a  police officer. The protesters then marched through the financial district,  smashing windows at the Bank of America and turning over several news racks.  </P> <P> The New York protest sparked no major violence, although some protesters  overturned trash bins. A spokesman for Earth Day Wall Street Action said one  protester's arm was broken, although this could not be confirmed.  </P> <P> Despite the number of protesters, which reached at least 700 in New York and  500 in San Francisco, securities trading was not affected. Groups in both  cities had vowed to close the financial centers.  </P> <P> "Except for arriving at work at little early, it was a normal day inside the  building," said Richard S. Torrenzano, senior vice president of the New York  Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Howard Hawkins, a member of Clamshell Alliance and the Left Green Network, said  the protests were meant to counter what he called the corporate co-opting of  Earth Day, the worldwide environmental celebration held on Sunday. Many  corporations helped sponsor events.  </P> <P> "What (corporations) are doing is using the environmental (movement) as a  marketing tool," Hawkins said. "Earth Day missed the boat. The system has got  to be changed fundamentally."  </P> <P> "Any improvements (corporations have) made, they've been dragged kicking and  screaming," said Stephen Dunifer, an organizer for Earth Day Action Coalition  in San Francisco. "They assume we have infinite resources and we can expand the  economy infinitely without regard for the Earth's limits."  </P> <P> The protesters said financial institutions share the blame for doing business  with corporate polluters. "Wall Street is the symbolic center for an economy  based on limitless greed and speculation," declared a protest pamphlet here.  </P> <P> In San Francisco, 49 demonstrators were arrested and two police officers were  treated for minor injuries.  </P> <P> Nine minor injuries, including five to police officers, were reported in New  York. Up to 500 police officers on foot, horseback and motorcycle arrested 204  demonstrators.  </P> <P> The demonstrations took on a carnival atmosphere at times as some protesters  marched in costumes: a clown, Moses, bears and "mutants" covered with toxic  waste or aerosol cans. Walking through the concrete canyons of the Wall Street  district, they chanted "corporate greed has to go," "people over profits" and  "Wall Street kills."  </P> <P> Both actions began at about 6:30 a.m. in their respective time zones.  </P> <P> In San Francisco, the protest kicked off with about 100 people trying to block  entrance to the Pacific Stock Exchange. The confrontation turned to violence  when some people started throwing objects at police after refusing to disperse.  </P> <P> Several people were arrested after they allegedly tried to prevent police from  making arrests and then attempted to free a demonstrator from the police,  police spokesman Ambrose said.  </P> <P> Dunifer and other organizers criticized the use of violence by some protesters.  The crowd rallied peacefully at Justin Herman Plaza, Ambrose said.  </P> <P> Most of the New York arrests occurred in the morning when protesters staged  several sit-ins. Others were taken into custody for blocking traffic on  Broadway and Wall Street after a noon rally on the steps of the Federal Hall  National Memorial. The demonstration ended by about 4 p.m.  </P></p>

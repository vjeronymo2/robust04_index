			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Speciality Shops flotation Speciality Shops has become the fourth property company to launch a flotation within a week. The specialist in-town shopping centre company is raising Pounds 10.6m from a placing which values it at Pounds 28.7m. Speciality Shops is also issuing shares to PosTel Properties, the property arm of the UK's largest pension fund manager, in exchange for the Pounds 12.5m purchase of the Jackson shopping centre in Bishop's Stortford, Herts. The deal will give PosTel a 28 per cent stake in the company. It is in line with the pension fund's policy of increasing flexibility on properties held jointly for the Post Office and BT pension schemes. This would enable it to separate holdings if the Post Office scheme is restructured. Speciality Shops was formed in 1986 with the backing of a number of substantial institutions. It has focused on investing in, and managing, small to medium-sized shopping centres. The company is placing 9.23m shares at 130p a share, of which 490,274 are being sold by existing institutional shareholders. The company will have gearing of 63 per cent after flotation. Its properties have been valued at Pounds 31.3m, or 141.4p a share, putting the shares at an 8 per cent discount to assets. After the latest acquisition, it will own five shopping centres, aside from its small trading portfolio. The issue is sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and trading is expected to comment on May 20.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: GEC hints Defence and electronics giant GEC resisted the market slide for most of the session after weekend reports that it may form a strategic link with British Aerospace to create a powerful single UK defence contracting group. The shares held out for much of the day before mildly succumbing to the market trend and relinquishing 2 at 348p, after heavy trading of 10m. The stock had been left behind and some analysts attributed the day's resilient performance to bargain hunting. Overall, market watchers said such a deal would be particularly good for GEC, giving it critical mass and rationalisation benefits. There was a suggestion that it was unlikely that GEC would put up much cash to bring about such an alliance. Trading in BAe was also heavy, with volume reaching 10m by the close. The shares gave up 9 1/2 at 565 1/2 p, with the market nervous about reports that the group is backing plans to set up a large-scale leasing operation at Airbus Industrie to help it increase sales. BAe is a 20 per cent stakeholder in the Airbus consortium. The row brewing over the payment to the departing chairman was said to have dampened sentiment. Leading blue chip companies which are reporting their figures this week saw their share prices hold respectably in spite of the internationally inspired market slide. Reuters Holdings, expected to produce profits today of about Pounds 535m, outperformed the market with a fall of 24 to 1911p. British Petroleum, which reports on Thursday and is forecast to produce after-tax profits of around Pounds 290m, also outperformed with a decline limited to 3 1/2 at 378p. Likewise, BT held up relatively well, losing only 1 per cent, against a fall in the FT-SE 100 Index of 1.6 per cent: its results are due Thursday. The shares closed 4 1/2 down at 463 1/2 p. Insurer and financial services group Lloyds Abbey Life held to a fall of 2 at 444p ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures. However, cautious analysts predict that profits could be hit by large provisions for mis-selling of pensions. Most analysts forecast a 12.5 per cent rise in 1993 profits to Pounds 335m, from Pounds 297.6m previously. But Natwest Securities, which predicts only Pounds 311m, has included a Pounds 10m provision in its estimate and an unchanged dividend of 17.3p because of uncertainty over pension compensation. Lloyds Bank, which owns 62 per cent of the insurer, and is due to publish its own figures on Friday, dipped 10 to 615p. Abbey National rose 3 to 502p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to be a heavy buyer. Glaxo Holdings recovered early heavy losses on news that the US Food and Drug Administration had granted permission for the group to sell its Serevent asthma inhalation aerosol in the US. The shares, down 17 at one stage, recovered to close only 2 off at 664p. Water and electricity utilities buckled as profit-takers exacerbated the weak market trend. Among the Recs, Midlands declined 14 to 742p. In the water sector, Wessex weakened 16 to 724p and Yorkshire 13 to 602p. Television stocks were firm as pressure on Granada to increase its hostile bid for LWT kept alive prospects of further bids within the sector. Although Granada fell 16 to 570p, LWT held at 702p, Scottish TV eased a penny to 539p and Carlton was steady at 1013p. Brewers fell back with the market, although volumes were equally weak. Dealers blamed continuing worries over margins in the retail trade and the threat of a price war. Among the worst hit, Morland slid 20 to 523p. Turnover in Forte hit 8.4m as a block of 5m shares went through at 257p. The stock retreated 7 to 255p. Food manufacturers saw some punchy performances against the market trend. Dull but worthy results from Dalgety saw the shares slip 3 to 487p. The company said a firm showing from food ingredients and distribution and recent acquisitions helped it report a slight rise in first-half profits to Pounds 56.4m. Dollar considerations helped Tate &amp; Lyle climb 7 to 455p. Bargain hunters lifted Unigate 6 1/2 to 414p after recent underperformance. But margin worries and continuing cash call concern hit Cadbury Schweppes, which shed 8 to 506p. It was a similar story among stores groups, with some resilient displays evident. Marks and Spencer rallied from an initial sharp fall to close 2 down at 419p. BZW was recommending investors to switch into the stock and out of Kingfisher, off 5 at 637p. Pentos slipped 3 to 32p on weekend press reports that it had requested rent reviews for some of its shops. Dealers reported some buying among construction groups, buoyant in recent sessions on the back of interest rate cut hopes. Among those in positive territory yesterday, Bryant Group gained 5 at 191p after reporting first-half profits at Pounds 14.6m, nearly double the previous period's Pounds 7.5m. The company also made a confident trading statement. There were also some good performances among building material groups. Breedon added 4 at 117p. International trading group Lonrho gave up 7 1/2 to 160p after Panmure Gordon was said to have urged investors to sell the stock. The slide in Far Eastern markets, where Inchcape has a large part of its markets, weakened sentiment in the stock, which fell 15 to 572p. The market debut of Slimma, the women's outsize clothing group, proved a success, the shares coming to the market at 120p and closing at 141p.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TRUMPS ENTER PACT ON DATING  </P> <P> Donald and Ivana Trump, though not your average flower children, are taking a  turn at free love.  </P> <P> New York's most-trumpeted couple have signed a two-page agreement allowing them  to date third and fourth parties without such action giving either grounds for  divorce, the Daily News and the New York Post reported today.  </P> <P> "Trump: The Dating Game" is good for at least 60 days, at which point either  side may cancel the pact, the papers said.  </P> <P> Both quoted sources as saying the pact was drawn up at the request of Ivana  Trump, who yearns to date but doesn't want to diminish any divorce settlement.  "She is basically saying, 'I don't want a divorce, and I don't want to become a  nun,' " one source told the Post.  </P></p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Cambodia may get 16,000 UN troops THE United Nations Secretary-General said yesterday a 15,900-member UN force should be sent to Cambodia to keep the peace and help ensure a peaceful transition to democracy after more than two decades of war, AP reports from the United Nations. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended the UN dispatch 10,200 infantry troops, an air support group of 326 members, a naval force of 376 with 20 boats, an observer group of 485 members and other units to Cambodia. In a report to the Security Council, the UN chief said 400 international election monitors should also be sent to monitor polls scheduled for April 1993and that their number be augmented by 1,000 'international personnel.' Mr Boutros-Ghali urged that 4,000 civilian officials be sent to register voters, while UN military or police forces might be needed to provide security at registration stations. The proposed UN peacekeeping mission to Cambodia would be the biggest since the world body deployed 20,000 peacekeepers to the Congo, now Zaire, in the 1960s.</p>

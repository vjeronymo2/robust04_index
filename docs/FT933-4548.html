			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: GM to cut workforce at Opel operations GENERAL Motors is reducing the workforce of its Opel/ Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations by 8.6 per cent, or 7,830 jobs, this year. Staffing levels have been battered by the steep fall in new car demand, Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, said yesterday. Hourly-paid jobs at GM Europe's plants - chiefly in Germany, Belgium, the UK, Spain and Austria - are being reduced by 9.2 per cent, to around 68,000 from 74,929 in 1992. Salaried jobs, meanwhile, are being cut by 4.2 per cent to 15,700 from 16,600. By the end of this year, the number of hourly-paid jobs will have been reduced by 13.3 per cent, from a peak of 78,390 in 1991. Mr Hughes warned yesterday the workforce would be cut again next year, 'with some significant numbers'. Mr David Herman, chief executive of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said Opel had operated profitably in the first half of the year. However, he warned: 'It will be difficult to stay in the black for the remainder of the year.' GM Europe overall would 'earn a significant profit' in 1993, however, said Mr Hughes. He claimed GM Europe again had the strongest financial performance of the big six volume carmakers in Europe, and would perhaps be 'the only one in profit'. He forecast a strong profit recovery in 1994 attributable to measures already taken this year to improve productivity and cut the workforce. GM Europe is forecasting a drop of 17 per cent in new car sales across western Europe this year, to 11.2m from 13.5m in 1993. Mr Herman said the decline in the German new car market had apparently 'bottomed out,' but there had not been 'a clear turnround in sales'. 'We expect the market will increase slightly in the second half of 1994,' he said. Both German new car sales and production were forecast to fall by 20 per cent this year.</p>

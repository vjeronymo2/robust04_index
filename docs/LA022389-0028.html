			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: MAN GETS PROBATION FOR SHOTS AT OFFICER  </P> <P> An Inglewood businessman who sat on a city commission and the mayor's  anti-crime task force has been sentenced to five years' probation for shooting  at an Inglewood policeman last spring.  </P> <P> Francisco Avina, 40, who pleaded guilty last month to assault with a deadly  weapon, was sentenced Tuesday by Torrance Superior Court Judge Hiroshi  Fujisaki. The judge suspended a 6-year prison sentence, saying that Avina will  be jailed only if he fails to abide by the terms of his probation.  </P> <P> Avina was ordered to enter an alcohol rehabilitation program and abstain from  drinking.  </P> <P> Police said the gunshot fired by Avina narrowly missed a patrolman who was one  of several police officers who came to Avina's coin laundry on South Prairie  Avenue to investigate reports of a disturbance.  </P> <P> Investigators said Avina had drinking and marital problems that may have led to  the confrontation with police. At the time, Avina was a member of Inglewood's  Parking and Traffic Commission and Mayor Edward Vincent's anti-crime task  force.  </P></p>

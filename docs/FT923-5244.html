			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / People: Environment at Thames Thames Water, the biggest of the privatised water companies, has promoted John Sexton, formerly head of research and laboratories, to the position of director of environment and science. The move comes at a time when Thames, with the rest of its sector, faces increasingly heavy capital spending requirements to bring drinking and waste water up to national and European Community environmental standards. Sexton, 43, a statistician by training, has been involved with water since leaving university in 1969. He joined Thames in 1976, initially to work on the water resources side. Following spells in water quality and environmental management, he had latterly masterminded the establishment of Thames' two new labs (replacing 25 smaller and out-dated facilities), which will each handle a million and a half analyses a year. He joins the board of Thames Water Utilities, the principal operating company. Sexton's predecessor, Peter McIntosh, who, for personal reasons, has taken early retirement at the age of 58, did not have the additional science responsibilities. Thames has recently been drawn into a number of environmental controversies, notably the debate about the River Darent in Kent that had been suffering from drought, and, allegedly, over-abstraction. 'The Darent is flowing very nicely, and indeed there have been a number of floods ' says Sexton, who vigorously defends the company's environmental record.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / The only game in town Of the three political games in play in Britain the most important is the contest for the succession to Mr John Smith. Next, a long way behind, comes the struggle by the prime minister to avoid a challenge to his leadership of the Conservative party. We must tune in to that ancient soap, although it is running out of plausible plot lines. Third, as significant as an afterthought, we have the elections to the European Parliament. It is not wholly parochial to picture this summer's political goings-on in so Anglo-centric a manner. The victory or defeat of Labour in a British general election in 1996 or 1997 may be of greater importance in the counsels of the European Union in the subsequent years than the precise party balance after next month's low-key contest. On present form, the Conservatives will before long find themselves hovering between a European strategy that is merely obstructive of further development and one that nears the brink of advocating withdrawal from the EU. Labour is subject to all the doubts about continental involvement inherent in the British character, but it would at least start with harmonious intent. This puts the summer games in perspective. The question before the voters on June 9 is merely whether the Strasbourg assembly is to be predominantly socialist. It was put with particular force by the Conservatives yesterday. Ho hum. The forthcoming poll will determine the answer on the basis of national votes which are heavily influenced by the popularity or otherwise of national governments. That is the nub of what Labour and the Liberal Democrats had to say yesterday. So what else is new? Most European socialist parties are expected to do well, the British Labour party best of all. A beneficiary of the first-past-the-post voting system, it may be the largest single grouping. No one expects the Tory contingent to increase; the only question is the number by which it will fall. It is a minor question. The Strasbourg parliament is still a remote body whose effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. The Maastricht treaty gives it powers to negotiate amendments to legislation, or block bills it does not like. It will be asked to approve the new commission before it takes office in January. These powers are of great potential importance, but the parliament's tradition is consensual, not adversarial. The other day, it huffed and puffed before approving the admission of new members, but it did not blow the house down. What really matters is whether Labour wins the next general election. As Europeans know from bitter experience, in a Europe of nations a negative stance adopted by the government of one of the larger member states can block or at least slow down future development. Whether this is beneficial or not depends upon how you regard the evolution of the European enterprise. The proposition I am advancing would be most starkly apparent if, say, Labour was led by Mr Tony Blair and the Tories by Mr Michael Portillo - the moderate Europhile vs the immoderate Europhobe. The EU would have a decided interest in the outcome of such a contest. The contrast would be less sharply drawn if the opposing party leaders were, say, Mr Robin Cook and Mr John Major. Yet the prime minister will doubtless continue to be pushed in a Portillo direction by the chauvinistic wing of his party. We may be sure that Mr Cook would try his best to be a good European. What matters in either case is the nature of the party behind the leader. This is why the previously entrancing political mystery - will Mr Major last and who will succeed him? - has become stale. It is evident that the problem is the Conservative party, not its leader. Tory divisions are stultifying Britain's government. They can only be healed by a period of reflection, or angry argument, an exercise best undertaken in opposition. Even yesterday's manifesto, so seamless in appearance, was fought over to the comma, passionately, with all hatreds showing. The primary purpose of its text, I am assured, is to keep the cabinet in one piece. If it wins votes, that will be a surprising bonus. It might, if incipient Euroscepticism begins to outweigh the anger many detached Tories feel about their usual party. The big question is, what is to become of Labour? If it returns to its old form, Mr Major may yet enjoy more years in office than most people now envisage. If it seizes its chance, the Tory era that began in 1979 will end. Some of us regard Mr Blair as the most convincing representative of what a wholly reformed, late-20th century party of the centre-left should be. We should not be carried away by this. There has been talk of skimping on the cumbersome procedures for the selection of a new leader. If members of parliament nominated only one candidate, there would be no need for the constituency parties and trade union members to exercise their one-member-one-vote muscle. That would be a mistake. The Labour party needs to show its colours, unreconstructed or modernised as they may be. Mr Blair should be put to the test in internal electoral combat. He has his first chance this morning, when he is due to make a speech. He could fluff it, by taking as his text the list of demands made by Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB union, on Sunday. Some of the Edmonds proposals, such as the promotion of full employment, constitute traditional goals for a Labour leader. That is beside the point. Mr Edmonds, once the darling of the modernisers, is becoming a walking disservice to the Labour party. He appears to hanker after the status of a 1960s union boss. A victory won by public pandering to one of such pretensions would not be a prize worth having. The great game of the moment is exquisitely complicated. Politicians win favour in the old Labour party by sounding Neanderthal, or nostalgically socialist. Mr Gordon Brown attempted both noises at the weekend. A campaign like that could produce a leader of the opposition destined to stay in that post until succeeded by another leader of the opposition. Alternatively, Mr Blair or another of his ilk, if there is one, might risk all. He or she might try to carry the party into the changes it has to make to achieve victory where it counts - at the next general election. That would make a difference.</p>

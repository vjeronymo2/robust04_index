			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Littlechild warning to power generators PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, yesterday warned he might try to increase his powers over the industries' two main generators  -or refer them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - if he found they failed to pass the fall in the price of coal to consumers. He was speaking after publishing a report which disappointed supporters of the coal lobby by approving the decisions of regional electricity companies to buy gas from new stations which they are helping to build. The report was welcomed by the regional companies but criticised by the generators, who found 'serious flaws' in the report's analysis. National Power and PowerGen, the main generators in England and Wales, said they were confident the prices in their contracts with the regional companies for coal-fired power were fully justified. Prof Littlechild's investigation into the generators' margins and costs in their coal and other contracts might cast a shadow over the companies for some time. He said 'immediate and unambiguous answers to questions about their future profitability' were not likely. He was still seeking information from the two companies, he added. Although the regional distribution companies were relieved by the regulator's approval of the gas contracts, there is concern about his examination of the application of yardstick price controls to them. This could mean that, if gas stations did not prove to be the cheapest source of electricity available during the period of the contracts, the regional companies would have difficulty in passing the costs to customers. Prof Littlechild said he was looking for a form of price control that provided a sharper incentive to the regional companies to purchase economically. One form of yardstick would mean that the companies would only be able to pass on average costs incurred by all the sector. Alternatively there could be an index related to fuel costs rather than electricity costs. Prof Littlechild said that whatever was decided it would not be appropriate to apply yardsticks to the five-year coal deals already agreed tentatively between British Coal, the generators and the regional companies. This will be a relief to the government, which wants the tentative contracts to underpin any deal it comes up with to rescue some of the 31 UK pits threatened with closure. In clearing the regional companies in their 'dash for gas' Prof Littlechild said that on average contracts with independent gas stations accounted for 17 per cent to 18 per cent of requirements for electricity between 1995 and 1998. Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said his company remained unconvinced of Prof Littlechild's analysis. 'In our view he still does not do justice to our coal-backed offer.' More than 300 jobs are to go in Gloucestershire with the closure of the Meco Mining Equipment factory near Tewkesbury, it was announced yesterday.</p>

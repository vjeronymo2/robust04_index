			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEATHERMAN THROWS A LITTLE LIGHT ON JUNE-GLOOM THING  </P> <P> Weather-conscious Southern Californians have grown to expect gloom in the  morning and gloom at night near the coast in June. That's exactly what they've  been getting lately, but this weekend, the sun is expected to break through.  </P> <P> "We will still have some low clouds and fog in the morning, but by afternoon  Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there should be lots of sunshine for coastal  areas," said meteorologist Dan Bowman of WeatherData Inc., which provides  forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> And, he said, those heading inland should encounter what "looks like great  weather," with a bit of wind in the afternoons and temperatures near 100 in  desert areas. Highs in downtown Los Angeles are expected to be in the 70s  through Sunday.  </P> <P> The predicted improvement in the June-gloom pattern, Bowman said, is because a  cool upper-level low-pressure area 500 to 600 miles northeast of Los Angeles  will move east, making way for the influence of a weak high-pressure area  eroding the deep marine layer along the Southern California coast. The result  will be sunshine.  </P> <P> The rim of overcast clouds, about 3,500 feet deep Thursday -- brought record  rainfall to San Diego's Lindbergh Field. The new record of 0.05 of an inch  broke the old mark of 0.03 of an inch for June 8, set in 1878. The weatherman  thought that was rather funny.  </P></p>

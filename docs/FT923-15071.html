			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor firm on DM revaluation AN OPPOSITION call for the D-Mark to be revalued against other currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was last night derided as a U-turn by chancellor Norman Lamont. He charged Mr John Smith, his Labour opposite number, with backing away from his one firm pre-election commitment. Mr Lamont's attack came after he had endured a difficult time at the hands of Tory backbenchers concerned that Britain's readiness to accept a Community-wide minimum rate of value added tax might restrict the government's future room for manoeuvre. Sir Peter Tapsell, Conservative MP for Lindsey East, warned that with less control over indirect taxation on the one hand and exchange and interest rates on the other, future chancellors could easily find themselves 'boxed in.' Mr Smith's call for 'an upward revaluation of the D-Mark' against other ERM currencies including sterling came in a speech advocating a European strategy for growth and employment. The revaluation should be considered in a bid to secure 'co-ordinated interest rate cuts in every member state,' the probable winner of the current Labour leadership contest continued. It was worth weighing whether 'the highly unusual circumstances of German unification' did not justify such a step, he said. Arguing that Ecofin - the council of economic and finance ministers - should have 'the determining role' in the shaping of overall economic policy, he advised against confining the objective of the proposed European central bank to 'an exclusive concern with price stability.' Flanked by Mr Michael Portillo, his Treasury lieutenant, Mr Lamont rebuffed his Tory critics by insisting his preparedness to accept a 15 per cent minimum EC-wide VAT rate for a limited period would not constrain the flexibility of the government's tax policy. Since the domestic minimum was currently 17 1/2 per cent, it was not 'realistic' to expect a cut to below 15 per cent to be implemented in the next three years, he said. He remained, however, 'highly sceptical' that a minimum VAT rate was necessary for a single market. Conserving his attack on Mr Smith's revaluation proposal until the final moments of his speech, he said that the shadow chancellor had 'told us again and again' before the election that he did not want to see the pound devalued. Opening the debate earlier, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had said the government would not make a decision until the autumn on whether MPs should be asked to proceed with the bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty.</p>

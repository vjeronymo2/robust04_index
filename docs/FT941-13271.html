			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Swedish steel group in black SSAB, the Swedish steel group, swung to a SKr776m (Dollars 96m) profit in 1993 from a SKr165m loss a year earlier, as the effects of cost-cutting and a weak krona helped to compensate for depressed market conditions. Stronger than expected final-quarter profits of SKr421m allowed SSAB comfortably to beat its November forecast of SKr600m for the full year. A 40 per cent rise in the dividend to SKr7 a share is proposed. Mr Leif Gustafsson, SSAB president, said: 'We have shown we can earn money in a very weak market. Of course, the weaker Swedish krona helped but even more important was the streamlining of our steel business at the end of the 1980s and our efforts to cut costs.' The weaker Swedish currency meant krona prices for the group's products were 8 per cent higher than in 1992, helping to lift turnover by 9 per cent to SKr12.9bn. The group said that it benefited from a slight increase in demand in Sweden, even though steel consumption in western Europe was down by 8 per cent. A continuing costs-squeeze meant operating expenses rose by only 1.5 per cent to SKr11.6bn. Processing costs were 4 per cent lower and employees were cut by 5 per cent to 9,500. SSAB is hoping for higher profits in 1994. It expects steel demand to remain weak in western Europe, at least during the first half, but anticipates higher profits from its Swedish activities due to increased demand.</p>

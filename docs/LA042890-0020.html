			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $1.1-MILLION LOAN IS OKD FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The City Council on Friday approved a $1.1-million loan for a controversial  Northeast Los Angeles housing development in what could be a series of battles  pitting single-family neighborhoods against government-funded affordable  housing.  </P> <P> More than 75 placard-carrying residents of the Hillside Village neighborhood  appeared before the council to complain that development of the site, which is  zoned for at least 85 rental units, could harm the fabric of their Lincoln Park  area neighborhood.  </P> <P> "This is a destructional force in our community," said homeowner John Lucero.  "You are destroying us."  </P> <P> Council members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina, backed by Mayor Tom  Bradley's housing coordinator Michael Bodaken, countered that communities  across the city must begin biting the bullet and accept new housing projects  for the city to ease its escalating affordable housing crisis.  </P> <P> "We don't intend to terrorize the neighborhood," said Alatorre, "but to provide  housing for those in need."  </P> <P> Bodaken praised the Eastside council members, saying: "If affordable housing  will be developed in this city in the next three years . . . each community  will have to address (this)."  </P> <P> Further fights are expected as the Community Redevelopment Agency, long  criticized for providing little more than lip service toward affordable  housing, becomes increasingly involved in the effort. In recent months, the CRA  has given starter loans for seven such projects, including ones near downtown  and in Sun Valley, Southwest Los Angeles and South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The council voted 11 to 1 to grant the $1.1-million CRA loan for a development  on the 4300 block of East Hatfield Place, planned by Charo Community and Human  Resources Inc., a 25-year-old nonprofit agency that also operates workshops for  the handicapped. Charo had already received a CRA loan of $1.03 million, but  needed the additional funds to finish buying the property and have designs  drawn that will help determine the number of housing units.  </P> <P> During the debate, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores questioned the decision to  purchase the property before agreeing on the project's scope. But when a vote  was taken, only Councilman Ernani Bernardi opposed the measure.  </P></p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Modern art finds few buyers Christie's big summer sale of Impressionist and Modern Art in London last night was a disappointment. Just over 50 per cent of the 49 lots on offer sold, by volume and value, for Pounds 9.3m, Antony Thorncroft writes. Auctioneer Charles Allsopp blamed falling international stock markets. The top lot, one of Braque's late 'Atelier' works of around 1950, was unsold when the bidding faltered at Pounds 1.8m, well below the Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3.5m estimate. But the other major work of the auction, a 1946 Miro, a brilliant celebration of the end of the war, was in demand, with three bidders in the room above the low estimate and an eventual successful purchaser at Pounds 1,871,500, at the high estimate.</p>

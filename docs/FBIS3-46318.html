			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Moritaka Okazaki in Beijing; received via Nikkei Telecom </F> database]    [Text] Beijing, 20 Dec -- Chinese Primer Li Peng, who  lacked vitality because of prolonged medical treatment, is  making a remarkable comeback. He only met with foreign VIP's  who visited China. However, he has now expanded his activities.  He has hosted important domestic meetings and has even  energetically made a keynote speech. Owing to this, some  leaders, who were calling for Li's resignation at the National  People's Congress [NPC] slated for next March, were placed in  suspended animation. It has become certain that the Jiang  Zemin-Li Peng structure, which was formed with an eye toward the  post-Deng Xiaoping era, will continue to remain in power.    Premier Li took a low profile because of heart trouble in  late April. He did not appear at official events until  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir visited China in mid-June.  After that, he started to attend meetings with foreign VIPs  visiting China. Nevertheless, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, "acting  on behalf of Premier Li Peng," hosted important meetings of the  State Council (government). During this time, many things  happened; Li Guixian, president of the People's Bank of China  who was close to Premier Li, was forced to step down form his  post. This was in contrast to Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji's rise.  Premier Li Peng's retreat seemed apparent.    However, Premier Li Peng started to recover lost ground as  he  regained his health around October. In particular, he made a  long speech on "next year's main tasks" at a national economic  policy meeting, which was held in early December following the  Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee. He  impressed local representatives at the meeting that he was a top  government leader by presiding over the most important final day  of the meeting.    Premier Li Peng, who was reelected at the NPC in March this  year, will remain in his post another five years. Some people  thought, when Premier Li Peng was not attending official events  this summer, that he would step down form his post and be  replaced by Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji during the next NPC  scheduled for March next year. Lately, however, people no  longer have such a view and members of the leadership have  agreed that replacing the premier will not be on the agenda of  the next NPC.    Although it is certain the premier's powers will be  restored,  there is no doubt that Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji will continue  to have overall control of economic policy matters. It seems  that relations with the United States, which is the pillar of  Chinese diplomacy, are under the control of President Jiang  Zemin. Therefore, there is no prospect of Premier Li Peng  displaying his leadership authority.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yueh Feng (1417 7364): "Words of Complaint Uttered at </F> the National Economic Work Conference"]    [Text] The open discontent among representatives at the  National Economic Work Conference shows that acute  contradictions exist between local and central authorities. The  rhetoric that "the whole country is a game of chess," which was  stressed in the past, can no longer be heard. The dissenting  tendency of the local-lord economy, as well as the structural  imbalance caused by the unbalanced developments in various  localities, are potential troubles in future economy.  <H5>  Suggestions From "Varying Opinions" </H5>   Seven, eight, nine, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15...    Is this a game of figures or what?    These are not ordinary figures; they are supposed to be the  economic growth rates on the mainland in 1994.    Why are there so many figures? They represent the different  opinions on economic growth held by various quarters of  Communist China: The Political Bureau says it should be 10  percent; a majority of members [as published] say it cannot be  lower than 10 percent; the State Council's preliminary plan is  that it should be 8-9 percent; the State Planning Commission's  report says it should be 13 percent, and if the problem of power  can be solved, the growth rate can be fixed at 14-15 percent;  the State Council's Economic and Trade Commission suggests a 9  percent growth; the State Commission for Economic Restructuring  suggests an 8 percent growth; the report by the economics  development under the National People's Congress Standing  Committee holds that it should be 7-8 percent....    The above-mentioned are the estimates by the relevant  central  departments, whereas provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions have their own policies, and they struggle hard for the  best growth rates according to their own "national situation."  Among 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, one  province and one municipality suggest that their own growth  rates should be higher than 15 percent, while 17 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions such as Guangdong,  Jiangsu, and Shanghai suggest that their own growth rates should  be higher than 12 percent, whereas other 10 provinces and  autonomous regions suggest that their own growth rates should be  higher than 10 percent.    Through these suggestions from "varying opinions," we can  see  that up to now, the CPC authorities still have no decision on  the economic growth rate for 1994.  <H5>  "Macroeconomic Regulation and Control" Ends </H5>   The National Economic Work Conference, which was held from 1  to 4 December and presided over by Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, made  an assessment of the financial and economic conditions for the  economic development in the new year. For the first time the  conference made public the internal structure of the economic  development on the mainland, as well as changes, and those are  things which the outside world had been guessing and assessing.  However, the figures are incomplete and sometimes contradictory.    What is noteworthy is that Jiang Zemin disclosed at the  conference that the pace of reform in 1994 will be very big. He  said that it will be a year in which an unprecedented number of  reform measures will be announced compared with the past 10  years or so, and he used the slogan of "sustained, healthy,  rapid, and good" economic development. This means that Zhu  Rongji's measures to carry out "macroeconomic regulation and  control" have come to a halt, and what follows would be a new  round of "great leap forward."    Since July 1993 when Zhu Rongji decisively implemented a  series of reform measures, the over-heated economy on the  mainland has cooled down, and the very chaotic financial market  has returned to normal. Under this condition, the CPC  authorities cannot wait to accelerate the economic train, and  the "theory of opportunity" holds sway.    In fact, under the current system, after more than 10 years  of reform, the mainland's economy has not been able to jump out  of the strange cycle whereby "when it is let go, it becomes  chaotic; when it becomes chaotic, it is tightened up; when it is  tightened up, it dies." Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic regulation  and control policy lasted for only a few months, and this has  surprised economists, whose observations hold that there has to  be one or two years of "recuperation" before the economy on the  mainland can embark upon the road of healthy development.  <H3>  Many Provinces and Municipalities Are Experiencing Seriously  Unbalanced Economic Developments </H3>   However, the current macroeconomic regulation and control  has  caused great losses to those who have vested interests.  Utilizing their privileges, they engaged in real estate and  stock market speculation with all their money, and they reaped  huge profits. When the regulation and control was suddenly  implemented, they lost their means to make money, and some even  faced the danger of bankruptcy. Some commentators pointed out  that Zhu Rongji could not get to the bureaucrat-businessmen, who  know many tricks, but it is surprising to see the regulation and  control becoming ineffective in just a few months.    But we want to return to our topic. Are there any  conditions for the mainland's economy to grow rapidly? As the  saying goes, "a skyscraper has to start on the ground floor."  The development structure on the mainland has already had a  problem of serious imbalance, and at the economic work  conference the commissions and offices under the State Council,  the Auditing Administration, and the General Administration of  Customs released some information and figures which showed an  alarming situation. The information revealed that in 12  provinces and autonomous regions the structure and proportion of  economic development showed a serious unbalance, and that in 16  provinces and autonomous regions the total economic returns on  production did not reach the state's target.  <H3>  The External Flow of Funds Reached 150 Billion Yuan in 10  Months </H3>   Other worrisome figures include:    --In 1992 the debt chain among enterprises was 110 billion  yuan. In the first quarter of 1993 it was 42 billion yuan, in  the second quarter of 1993 it was 35 billion yuan, and in the  third quarter of 1993 it was 60 billion yuan.    --In 1992 the external flow of funds was 30 billion yuan.  In 1993, up to October, it exceeded 150 billion yuan; at the  end of October, the state's foreign exchange reserve was $33  billion, and disposable foreign exchange was $20 billion.    --The state received less revenue, and in 1992 the decrease  was 33 percent. In 1993, from the first to third quarter, the  decrease was 38.5 percent.    --Regarding the goods and materials which were smuggled in  or  imported unlawfully in 1992, it amounted to $20 billion based on  a preliminary estimate. In 1993, from the first to third  quarter, it amounted to $30 billion, and about 55 percent of the  imported cars were smuggled in. This year, the unfavorable  balance between import and export will exceed $12 billion.  <H5>  Finished Products in Stock Amounted to 148 Billion Yuan </H5>   In addition, the conference also revealed for the first time  in concrete terms the alarming losses of enterprises on the  mainland:    --At the end of October 1993, the machines and equipment and  whole sets of industrial facilities which ceased working across  the country were valued at 250 billion yuan. Abandoned and idle  factory floors totalled 6.5 million square meters, some 16  million idle and unnecessary workers loitered in factories, and  over 26 million workers could be laid off for streamlining  purpose.    --The finished and semifinished products in warehouses  across  the country were valued at more than 180 billion yuan, while  light industrial and finished or semifinished handicraft  products were valued at 68 billion yuan.    --The normal utilization rate of imported machines and  facilities was 62 percent, and economic returns was only about  70 percent.    --Some 12 percent of the imported machines and facilities  were either not applicable or laid idle in the warehouses.    --Some 8.5 percent of the imported machines and facilities  have to be written off in three years.    --Some 4.5 percent of the imported machines and facilities  were old, outdated, and could not be used. Starting from 1985,  the state lost 8-12 billion yuan every year.    --In 1991, the industrial, light industrial, and electronic  products which were written off in the whole country amounted to  120 billion yuan. In 1992, the figure rose to 140 billion yuan.    --In 1991, the nationwide rate of good quality of heavy  industrial products was 14 percent, and the passing rate was 55  percent. The nationwide rate of good quality of light  industrial products was 19 percent, and the passing rate was 62  percent, and the nationwide rate of good quality of electronic  products was 25 percent, and the passing rate was 60 percent.    --In 1992, the nationwide rate of good quality of heavy  industrial products was 16 percent, and the passing rate was 57  percent. The nationwide rate of good quality of light  industrial products was 16 percent, and the passing rate was 57  percent, and the nationwide rate of good quality of electronic  products was 28 percent, and the passing rate was 58 percent.    --A total of 25 million tonnes of coal was lost during  transport every year, and the writing off of coal pits due to  spontaneous combustion meant losses of 50 million tonnes.    --A total of 3.5 million tonnes of oil was lost every year  during transport, and more than 1 million tonnes were lost due  to spontaneous combustion.  <H3>  The 16-Character "Sincere Remark" Raises a Great Deal of  Opinions </H3>   The economic work conference this time also exhibited  another  unusual phenomenon, that is, in the beginning of the conference,  the persons in charge of various localities remained silent.  Obviously, it was some sort of silent protest against the  central leadership by the "local economic lords."    After detecting this kind of subtle emotion, Jiang Zemin, Li  Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Zou Jiahua came out personally to soothe  them, stressing that they should "talk freely about whatever is  on their minds, offer whatever opinions they have, make whatever  suggestions they like, and air whatever grievances they harbor."    This 16-character "sincere remark" really worked wonders,  and  it suddenly aroused the enthusiasm of the representatives to  talk, hence complaints, discontents, opinions, suggestions, and  examinations were poured into the conference. The CPC Central  Committee General Office and the State Council General Office  made a "general summation," which summarized the contents into  20 points in the newsletters they later issued, and the title  was "Some of the Opinions and Suggestions Made by  Representatives at the Central Leadership Work Conference."  These 20 points are:    Local Authorities Make 20 Points Accusing the Central  Leadership of a Series of Mistakes    1. When central leading comrades inspect localities, they  give instructions and suggestions, without giving concrete  teachings.    2. In actual work, localities find it difficult to  thoroughly understand and grasp the policies and regulations  announced by the central leadership.    3. The instructions by the central leadership, central  leaders, central inspection teams, central on-the-spot teams,  and central work teams are not clear, often leading to conflicts.    4. Regarding economic work, the direction in which reform is  to be carried out and the scope of the opening up, the central  leadership still does not have a set of principles and policies  which are scientific, relatively complete, comparatively  systematic, and in accordance with the nation's situation.    5. Some central leaders have failed to promptly solve  problems arising from economic development, reform, and opening  up. They are not mentally prepared for the problems which are  likely to arise.  <H5>  "The Central Leadership Has a Bigger Responsibility" </H5>   6. Central leaders are seemingly complacent with the  achievements and progress in economic construction, reform, and  opening up. They have not made summations promptly and some  problems have emerged as a result -- the over-heated phenomenon  of the economy became very obvious as early as November 1992.    7. Some comrades in the central leadership and some central  departments put undue emphasis on vigorously creating conditions  for importing foreign funds, without paying attention to whether  those funds have arrived on time or not, or to the facilities  set up by those funds, or to the technology used by  foreign-funded firms, or to the distribution of foreign-funded  firms (only 18.2 percent of foreign funds agreed upon by  contracts and agreements have arrived on time).    8. For a long time the central leadership has no overall  planning for the development of communications, transportation,  railways, roads, ports, power, energy, and water resources, as  well as for coordinated economic development. There are  problems being discovered every year, but the main problems are  not put on the agenda for solution.  <H3>  Loss of Control Over Investment in Capital Construction Is  Approved by the Central Leadership </H3>   11. The problem of IOU's in the rural areas has not been  solved since 1989, and the rural problem has become more acute,  the main reason being that the polices announced by the central  leadership have not be actually implemented.    12. Local protectionism is very serious in the regions which  have rapid economic development and good economic foundations  and conditions. The central leadership has not corrected it  promptly, and this is not helpful to regional cooperation.    13. The scale of capital construction is large, and the  amount of investment is large, leading to loss of control. Many  loans are approved by the central leadership, or reported by  local authorities to the central leadership, which then gives  approval.    14. The rise of living indexes in most areas stays above 15  percent, causing conflicts between the people and government.  Solving the inflation problem relies on the timely  macroregulation and control by the central leadership.    15. Localities think that macroregulation and control by the  central leadership is necessary but a bit late, and that the  scope of macroregulation and control is not clear, causing  ambiguities in local economic reforms.    16. The power and scope of legislation delegated by the  central leadership to localities, are not clear. The central  leadership must maintain long continuity of policies and  systems, so as to benefit industrial development in localities.  <H5>  Many Units and Enterprises Are in a State of Anarchy </H5>   17. The two leading groups -- party and government -- in a  locality often cannot coordinate well in leading the work in  economic construction, reform, and opening up. The central  leadership should give clear policy guidance.    18. There is a serious shortage of funds for scientific and  technological development, and the number of scientists and  technician who quit or change jobs every year exceeds the number  of new recruits in the science and technology contingent;  although the central leadership understands the seriousness of  the situation, it does not have concrete measures to solve the  problem.    19. Localities, enterprises, and nonproductive units  continue to issue shares and bonds, the central leadership  should formulate a legal system and a set of regulations to  exercise control.    20. Quite a large number of the cadres in local party and  government units, and the cadres in state-owned enterprises,  face streamlining and cutbacks in personnel, however, no proper  arrangements have been made based on a standardized policy. As  a result, serious anarchy and passive emotion emerged in units  and enterprises.    Judging from the "summation" of the above-mentioned speeches  by the representatives, acute contradictions exist between the  local and central authorities. The rhetoric that "the whole  country is a game of chess," which was stressed in the past, can  no longer be heard, and the dissenting tendency of the  local-lord economy, as well as the structural imbalance caused  by the unbalanced developments in various localities, have  already laid down potential trouble in economic development in  the future.</p>

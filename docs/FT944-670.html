			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The only wool auction this week was in New Zealand, and prices were generally a little firmer. The official market indicator closed 7 cents higher at 517 cents a kg. and only 11% was unsold at growers' reserves, a little better than recent clearances. Wool markets for some weeks have managed to hold firm, and closed firmly before the Christmas recess, despite some loss of confidence in the strongly rising price trend which applied for most of 1994. There is uncertainty about price changes ahead. Statistically the evidence points to strength in the outlook, but there is powerful resistance to price rises already established in primary markets, but not yet passed on to consumers. The problems in absorbing raw material price increases are not confined to wool or to textiles and trade opinion is that a further price rise would not make things easier.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Lamont's chance to set things straight WHEN MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, rises to deliver the annual Mansion House speech tonight, he will have an opportunity to restore his tarnished image in the financial markets. He is also expected to talk about a new spirit of openness at the Treasury. Addressing bankers and City representatives Mr Lamont will try to end confusion about the government's economic policy and dispel the gloom about the UK economy which has recently knocked the pound and depressed the stock market. While he is likely to provide more details about new thinking at the Treasury, to explain more fully the way in which economic policy is operated, he is not expected to outline significant initiatives on monetary policy or changes in the rules for funding the public sector borrowing requirement. Nor is he likely to do more than touch briefly on the framework for public spending over the next few years, or on measures to entice private-sector cash into infrastructure projects. Both subjects will probably be covered in detail in his Commons address on November 12, part of the Treasury's Autumn Statement. The chancellor's biggest task is to reduce the uncertainty about economic policy that has emerged in the wake of sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday and recent indications that Britain's longest recession for 50 years is worsening. Financial markets have been unsettled by apparent differences in emphasis on economic policy between Downing Street and the Treasury that have emerged recently. While Mr John Major, the prime minister, has talked about Britain putting economic growth at the top of its policy objectives, the Treasury has continued to reiterate the government's desire to bear down on inflation and worry about the level of sterling. Mr Lamont will try to link the two sets of policy statements, emphasising that the government's objective remains long-term, stable growth within a framework of permanently low inflation. There is a fairly remote possibility that Mr Lamont will announce changes to the way in which the government's deficit, or the public sector borrowing requirement, is funded. The Mansion House speech is almost always preceded by calls for a change in the funding rule and every year expectations are disappointed. But this year, says Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at SG Warburg securities, the arguments for change have become 'more persuasive than ever'. The full-fund rule requires the authorities to fund the PSBR by sales of government bonds, or gilts, outside the banking and building societies sectors. Since gilts bought by banks or building societies do not count as funding, the Bank of England has to sell even more gilts to meet the requirements of the PSBR. Many economists expect the PSBR to grow to more than Pounds 40bn in the next financial year. One way of reducing it at a single stroke would be to count purchases of gilts by banks and building societies as funding. This could cut next year's PSBR by as much as Pounds 6bn. As well as easing the funding burden, a break from the full-fund rule could have other beneficial effects on the economy. Since the authorities would have to raise less cash from the public, the supply of money circulating in the economy would be increased. Conversely, if more gilts were sold to the public than were required to finance the government's borrowing, money would be soaked up and the economy left less liquid. Economists also say that a smaller volume of sales of gilts would raise prices and lower yields, encouraging investment by companies as it would let them raise fixed-rate finance more cheaply. Underfunding the PSBR could also boost equity prices, thereby cheapening the cost of equity capital and encouraging rights issues. For all this, the authorities appear reluctant to tinker with the funding rules. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu, and long an advocate of underfunding, says: 'There still seems to be a view in the Treasury that such a move would be pointless.'</p>

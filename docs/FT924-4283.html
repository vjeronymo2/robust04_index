			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Civil Service agencies to grow THREE QUARTERS of the Civil Service is set to have become 'next steps' agencies, operating at arm's length from central government departments by mid 1995. But the annual report on the agencies, published yesterday, makes clear that the government expects there to be little scope for creating further agencies beyond that. The most substantial - and controversial - of the 29 new candidates already identified for agency status is the prison service, which employs some 38,000 staff. Agencies already include parts of government that vary from Companies House to the forensic science service, but the next wave of new agencies will broaden that range even further, to include, for example, royal parks and the meat hygiene service. The planned timescale is that all candidates for agency status, perhaps a further 30 to 50 beyond those already identified, should have been agreed for change by the end of next year, and have been set up within the following 18 months. Announcing the report, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said that half the Civil Service - about 300,000 people - were already working in agencies, and that 'we are beginning to see real improvements in efficiency, productivity and value for money.' The document shows that about three in four of the performance targets, some of which have become harder since last year, were met by the agencies in 1991-92. That average covers a wide variation in performance among the 76 individual agencies. The acceptance by the government that there is a ceiling on which government activities can be turned into agencies reflects a mood among those dealing with the changes in Whitehall that ministers believe that future emphasis should lie with market-testing and contracting out.

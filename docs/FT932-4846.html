A three and a half storey business school is to be built at a cost of Pounds 3.2m for the University of Derby, including two new lecture theatres with seating for 400 students. One of the theatres will feature a mock courtroom to help students on law degree courses familiarise themselves with judiciary surroundings. (This contract follows the construction of a new Pounds 3m science and technology building at the university last September.) Hall &amp; Tawse has also commenced work on a Pounds 2.2m contract to build a music wing at the University of Nottingham's Art Centre. The 57-week building programme will see the development of a recital hall, 14 practice rooms, a music library, and a separate seminar room. In Worcestershire, a Pounds 1.8m order has been won to design and build a library and resource centre at Bromsgrove School. It will have a capacity for 30,000 books, and provide 100 study spaces.</p>

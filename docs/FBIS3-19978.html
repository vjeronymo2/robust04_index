			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The overall expenditure on all the  public and private social services was more than 1 trillion  German marks [DM] in 1993 -- DM1,062 billion, to be exact. The  share of this expenditure in GNP (social services quota) was  approximately 34 percent. This is reported by the first  all-German social report, which Labor Minister Norbert Bluem  (Christian Democratic Union) presented to the Cabinet on Tuesday  [22 March].    The current increase in the burden of social insurance  contributions is largely due to the expansion of social  insurance to all of Germany that resulted from German  unification, the report says. The transfer payments to eastern  Germany corresponded to approximately 3 percent in contributions  to west German social security. About DM118 billion from the  coffers of pension and unemployment insurance went to the new  laender between 1991 and 1993.    In western Germany the social services quota was 30.3  percent  in 1993; in the new laender, however, it was approximately 70  percent. For 1997 the report predicts a decline in the  all-German quota to 32 percent.    In western Germany the share of social expenditure in GNP  declined from a record of 33.4 percent in 1981 to 28.9 percent  in 1991. Most recently it has increased again because of  improvements in the equalization of burdens for families and  rising unemployment. In eastern Germany the quota reached its  record so far in 1992 with 73.1 percent. The number of employed  people in eastern Germany declined from about 9.9 million in  1989 to only about 6.1 million in 1993. The number of  registered unemployed was only 1.15 million in 1993. About 1  million former GDR citizens have found jobs in western Germany,  according to the report.    The Federal Government's social report has been presented  irregularly since 1970. The previous report was published in  June 1990 only for the old laender. At that time social  expenditure of DM703 billion or 29.4 percent of GNP was  predicted for all of 1990 in western Germany.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Premier Li Peng and Uzbek President Islam Karimov had a  wide-ranging and in-depth exchange of views this morning on  bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual concern.    At their formal meeting, Karimov said that with Li's visit,  the Uzbek-Chinese ties have entered "a new stage of maturity,"  according to a Chinese spokesman.    Central Asia, where Uzbekistan is located, represents a huge  market with vast potentials, Karimov said, adding that expansion  of business contact between Uzbekistan and China is in line with  the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and is conducive  to regional stability and prosperity as well.    Along with efforts to develop trade and economic  cooperation,  the two countries should also strive to expand exchanges in  cultural and other fields, he said, adding that he expects Li's  visit to "strongly boost the growth of bilateral ties."    Li, meanwhile, praised President Karimov's contributions to  the growth of relations between the two countries.    On bilateral trade and economic cooperation, Li described  the  successful Sino-Uzbek joint ventures here as "only a beginning."  he invited entrepreneurs of Uzbekistan to go to China for study  tours as a way to forge a more comprehensive cooperation.    The Chinese premier said he was satisfied with the  wide-ranging contact and with the agreements or letters of  intent signed between the two sides in the past two days. A  delegation of leading Chinese businessmen is traveling with the  premier.    On regional issues, Li said the development of China's  relations with Central Asian nations would not affect its ties  with other nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States  (CIS), including Russia.    "We hope the CIS nations would maintain friendly relations  and work together for regional stability and development," he  added.    Li noted that China and Uzbekistan, which have no  fundamental  conflict of interests, share identical or similar views on many  major international issues.    "Therefore, the development of our bilateral relations  enjoys  a comprehensive basis," he said.    "China is ready to have regular exchange of views or  consultations on regional and international issues with  Uzbekistan so as to enhance mutual understanding and trust," he  said.    Li said he believed that Uzbekistan would succeed in  revitalizing its national economy although it might encounter  some "temporary difficulties."    During the talks, the premier, on behalf of Chinese  President  Jiang Zemin, also extended invitation to Karimov to visit China  again later this year.    Uzbekistan is the first leg of Li's 12-day five-nation tour  which will also take him to Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan  and Mongolia.</p>

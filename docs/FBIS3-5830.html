			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Sabah Residents Face an Uncertain Future"] </F>   [Excerpts] Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, president of PBS  [Sabah United Party], was sworn in as Sabah chief minister by  Sabah Governor Mohamed Said Keruak last night. [passage omitted]  Sabah residents are now facing an uncertain future under a state  government which has only a two-seat majority in the elections,  which saw the PBS win 25 seats and the National Front 23 seats.    The only consolation for Pairin against the background of  this unstable political situation is a clause in the Sabah state  Constitution which allows him to appoint six more state  assemblymen. The appointment, announced by Pairin last night,  has enabled PBS to have 31 seats in the Sabah State Legislative  Assembly.    While the said clause is a unique feature of the Sabah  Constitution, it is also the biggest obstacle toward democratic  process and people power in that state. The people's right to  elect state assemblymen of their choice is definitely curtailed  by such a clause and the PBS has suddenly increased its slim  majority. The clause is also unfair to nearly half the Sabah  voters who voted in favor of the National Front candidates in  the recent election. In this connection, Justice Minister Datuk  Syed Hamid Jaafar Albar noted that the said clause is against  the Malaysian Constitution and should be reviewed. To ensure a  fair political process, the clause should indeed be reviewed.    The Sabah residents now must share the burdens of PBS's weak  government because PBS leaders will always think of their  precarious position first. In such a situation, they will pay  more attention to their political survival rather than the  people's welfare.    People are also interested in knowing how long the new Sabah  government will last and to what extent the PBS election  promises will be fulfilled. [passage omitted] This explains why  he has said he wants to meet and hold talks with Prime Minister  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed to discuss various issues. In  view of the massive anti federal propaganda waged by the PBS  during its election campaigns, Pairin's sincerity in this case  is questionable. Besides, because of the solid presence of the  National Front in Sabah, Pairin's initiative is out of place.  The truth is that Pairin is distressed over the fact that a  weak Sabah government may make PBS supporters change their minds  and loyalty. Even though he is now chief minister, Pairin is now  apparently scared of his own shadow.</p>

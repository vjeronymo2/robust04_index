			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556): </F> "Perspective on Guangdong's Hot Spots in 1994: Guangdong  Seriously Deals With `Swollen Investment'"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 18 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) --  Guangdong is the area where the economy has developed the most  rapidly in China, and it is also a major province with a  considerable amount of investment. Guangdong's annual  investment in fixed assets currently accounts for approximately  one-tenth of the country's total. Today, at a time when  macroeconomic regulation and control are being intensified,  whether Guangdong is able to effectively reduce its investment  has become a central issue in the course of economic development  this year.    Over the past two years, Guangdong has witnessed the most  heated economy since the beginning of reform and opening up in  the province, and the scope of investment has swollen rapidly.  In 1992, the province's investment in fixed assets exceeded 70  billion yuan, accounting for approximately one-tenth of the  country's total of more than 750 billion yuan. This represented  an increase of 92 percent, which was 54 percentage points higher  than the national average. Last year, affected by macroeconomic  regulation and control, investment was reduced to a certain  extent, but investment in fixed assets was still booming and  exceeded 146 billion yuan during the entire year, representing  an increase of 58 percent over 1992.    The drastic expansion of the scale of investment has  injected  vitality into Guangdong's economy and has played an  indispensable supporting role in rapid economic operations.  Experts here maintain that the approximate 20 percent economic  growth rate in Guangdong last year was obviously due to the  substantial increase in investment there.    Last year, the province accelerated its construction of  infrastructure facilities with the aid of sharp increases in  investment. A total of 26 key projects with an investment  amount of over 1 billion yuan each were established, and quite a  few infrastructure facilities were completed and put into  production, laying down the foundation for rapid economic  development.    However, the growth of investment in fixed assets at a  super-rapid speed for two consecutive years has also given rise  to the problem of "swollen investment," which has had the  following negative impacts: 1) The funding shortage has meant  that funds have not been available for a number of construction  projects and have affected the macroeconomic results of  investments, 2) The sky-rocketing prices of building materials  -- that of plate glass has practically doubled -- have  constituted an inflationary pressure.    According to statistics, the total amount of investment  projects under construction in Guangdong during the past two  years exceeded 370 billion yuan.    A number of major reform measures will be introduced this  year. Guangdong has proposed to properly handle the  relationships between reform, stability, and development and to  strengthen its control over the scale of investment in fixed  assets. As has been revealed, a set of regulations on managing  investment in fixed assets is currently being drafted. This  indicates that Guangdong has given consideration to fixed assets  investment on a long-term basis.    Guangdong has adopted six measures to reduce investment in  fixed assets this year. One one hand, it has done what it could  to ensure the funds required by the key projects, and, on the  other, it has strictly implemented an investment licensing  system to control the initiation of projects.    Judging from the first quarter of this year, investment in  fixed assets has been brought under control. The investment of  2.9 billion yuan in 33 key construction projects has been  fulfilled with good progress, and investment in fixed assets  amounting to 16.3 billion yuan has also been fulfilled. This  represents an increase of 51 percent, which is lower than that  of the corresponding period last year.    As predicted by specialists, the growth of investment in  fixed assets will be more appropriately controlled within 40  percent in Guangdong this year.    Nevertheless, Guangdong is still faced with quite a few  thorny problems in controlling investment in fixed assets:  First, the task will be difficult and the road will be long as  the province tries to reduce the investment scale of state-owned  enterprises. Last year, in the multiple economic sectors,  investment of state-owned enterprises in fixed assets increased  by the largest margin, reaching 71 percent. Due to the  transformation of operational mechanisms, enterprises now  possess more decisionmaking powers and have the right to define  the orientation of investment, and this will certainly give rise  to the issue of unnatural expansion in investment. Solving this  issue is particularly difficult for the government. Second,  investment projects under construction last year involving more  than 200 million yuan will be transferred to this year, and this  will make controlling the overall scale of investments for this  year considerably difficult.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 FAMILIES AWAIT WORD ON HOSTAGES  </P> <P> Three families, scattered across two continents, were keeping an anxious vigil  this weekend to see whether the pro-Iranian kidnapers who have held their loved  ones will deliver on their promise to release one of the captives, maybe as  early as today.  </P> <P> The faceless group that calls itself the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of  Palestine has raised their hopes many times before over the past 1,184 days,  but this time seems different. In many towns where relatives of the hostages  live, optimistic neighbors are tying yellow ribbons to trees and buildings.  </P> <P> The families' spirits got a big boost late Saturday when the State Department  began notifying them that it expects one of the hostages to be freed within 24  to 36 hours. It was the first time the government has been so encouraging.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty sure that someone will be released," says Ruth Polhill, whose  55-year-old son, Robert, is one of the three captives. "If there is one, I'm  not even allowing myself to think who that one might be."  </P> <P> At first, she thought it would be Jesse Turner, because his picture was  released by the kidnapers Wednesday, when they first announced they planned to  let one of their three prisoners go. But the next day, when they put out an  angry statement accusing the United States of being uncooperative and delaying  the transfer, Robert Polhill's was the picture they included.  </P> <P> Although the release appeared to be back on track Saturday, it was anyone's  guess which hostage would be chosen. The faction holds Polhill, Turner and  Alann Steen, who will mark his 51st birthday today.  </P> <P> All three were professors at Beirut University College when they were abducted  Jan. 24, 1987, by kidnapers who had made their way onto the campus disguised as  riot police. A fourth captive, Indian-born Mithileshwar Singh, who has  permanent resident status in the United States, was released in 1988.  </P> <P> Five other Americans are also being held, apparently by other factions.  </P> <P> Ruth Polhill, a slight, elderly widow, sat in her apartment here, monitoring  television news for the latest developments and patiently answering a drumbeat  of phone calls from reporters or concerned friends. Her living room is  decorated with pictures of her son, family and the other hostages as well.  </P> <P> One photo shows Ruth Polhill standing arm in arm with Singh's wife, and she  also has framed a letter she got from President Bush. "God bless your son," the  President wrote in his own hand at the bottom.  </P> <P> She rummaged through a drawerful of news clippings she has collected. Someday  soon, Polhill hopes her son will see for himself the evidence that his family  and his country never forgot about him while he was in captivity. Last  Christmas, it seemed that half the county turned out when the town invited her  to light a commemorative tree with 10,000 lights.  </P> <P> The widow's Lebanese daughter-in-law, Firyal, has gone to Damascus to await the  release. "She said she would be there to welcome whoever comes out," Ruth  Polhill said. Polhill's two sons from his first marriage spent the weekend in  their apartment in Queens "killing time -- watching gymnastics," 23-year-old  Bryan Polhill said. "It's been all right. I'm trying not to ride a roller  coaster."  </P> <P> In Boise, Ida., a media battalion camped out in front of the three-bedroom  white frame home of Estelle Ronneburg, Turner's 68-year-old mother. She left  her front door unlocked and invited reporters who lounged on her wooden front  porch to come in and watch late-night television. When one journalist showed up  in a taxi, Ronneburg and her husband, Eugene, offered him the use of their car.  </P> <P> Reporters brought the couple breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the Ronneburgs  returned the favor by offering them a share of the food trays delivered by  local grocery stores. A crew from CBS even arranged to have their lawn mowed --  an act of contrition, perhaps, for having trampled it.  </P> <P> Ronneburg, too, has collected her own history of the anguish and uncertainty  that she has known for more than three years. There are newspaper stories,  letters from friends, and telexes from Lebanon. The darkest moments are marked  by the clippings that report death threats, such as the one in 1987, when her  son's captors said they would kill one of the hostages unless West Germany  released a Lebanese man accused of hijacking an airliner.  </P> <P> Just as heartbreaking were the erroneous reports of impending release.  </P> <P> Before Singh was released, for example, the kidnapers raised her hopes by  sending out pictures of her son and Steen. "I was devastated," Ronneburg said.  "We were happy for Dr. Singh, but it was hard to take."  </P> <P> This time, "I'm trying not to let myself become too excited, because I've been  down this road before, and it's not fun when it doesn't work out," Ronneburg  said. "But I can't help but hope and pray that my son is going to be released."  </P> <P> Turner, like Polhill, is married to a Lebanese woman who still resides in the  Middle East. His wife, Badr, was pregnant when he was abducted, and Turner has  never seen his 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Joan.  </P> <P> Steen has also missed important family milestones. Two daughters were married  while he was in captivity, and he may not be aware that he now has a grandson  who lives in Thousand Oaks and bears his name.  </P> <P> Steen's second wife, Virginia, was in seclusion Saturday at a home near her  parents' in rural Clark Lake, Mich., but she did talk to reporters by phone.  </P> <P> She said she hopes the journalism professor "is writing a book in his mind"  about his experiences, and added, "I'm saving clips and videotapes for him. Oh,  God yes."  </P> <P> Tumulty reported from Fishkill and Harris from Boise. Times staff writers Jim  Risen, in Detroit, and Mack Reed, in Ventura, also contributed to this story.  </P></p>

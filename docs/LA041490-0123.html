			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTER SERVICES ABOUND ACROSS THE SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> RITES: THIS IS THE LAST TIME THIS CENTURY THAT THE DATE OF THE HOLIDAY  COINCIDES FOR WESTERN AND EASTERN CHURCHES.  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of Southern Californians will celebrate Easter late  tonight and early Sunday, the last time this century that the date of  Christendom's most important holiday coincides for Western and Eastern  churches.  </P> <P> Eastern Christian tradition requires that the day recalling Gospel accounts of  Jesus' resurrection be observed after the start of the Jewish holiday of  Passover, in keeping with the sequence in the New Testament. Although the  Easter dates for the two branches of Christianity usually coincide every four  or five years, the next time will not be until April 15, 2001.  </P> <P> The 70th renewal of the Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service, which follows  the Western religious calendar, will reflect the dual celebration this year by  having two principal sermons -- one by Father James Pappas, a priest at Los  Angeles' St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral, and the other by Episcopal Bishop  Frederick Borsch of the six-county Los Angeles Diocese.  </P> <P> Outdoor sunrise services are a popular tradition in the normally balmy  Southland. The services atop Mt. Rubidoux in Riverside and Mt. Helix in La Mesa  have been held even longer than the Hollywood Bowl observance.  </P> <P> But few Orthodox Christians are likely to show up. That's because the  liturgical high point for Eastern Christians comes at midnight tonight when  darkened church interiors are brightened to proclaim "Christ is Risen."  </P> <P> At St. Katherine Greek Orthodox Church in Redondo Beach, for instance, Father  Fred G. Fotion, holding a lighted candle, will announce, "Come, receive the  light," and the flame will be spread to candles held by parishioners. The  congregation will then file outside the church to symbolize Christian missions  to the world. At many Orthodox churches, the midnight liturgy is lengthy and  often followed by the exchange of Easter eggs and a fellowship meal.  </P> <P> In Roman Catholic parishes and in many Episcopal churches, Holy Saturday vigil  services are planned for tonight. Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles,  who will take part in the traditional blessing of the animals at 2 p.m. today  at the plaza near Olvera Street, also will preside at the 7:30 p.m. Easter  Vigil at St. Vibiana Cathedral.  </P> <P> Many Protestant churches have expanded schedules of services Sunday morning,  and some have sunrise services on their own grounds. Two such outdoor services  -- in exceptional ocean-view settings -- are scheduled for 6 a.m. at Wayfarers  Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes, a church affiliated with the Swedenborgian  Church, and for 6:15 a.m. at Malibu Presbyterian Church, 3324 Malibu Canyon  Road.  </P> <P> Several interdenominational services for worshipers interested in greeting the  dawn at 5:34 a.m. also are available.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Bowl service is one of the longest -- from 5:15 to 7 a.m. It will  parade 13 clergy, several of them of Eastern European heritage, and half a  dozen choirs off and on the stage. Joining them will be actors Charlton Heston  and Rhonda Fleming as well as soloists Bob Ralston, former musical director of  the Lawrence Welk TV program, and 13-year-old flutist Gregory Jefferson, among  others.  </P> <P> The 5:30 a.m. service on Mt. Rubidoux, a ridge that is easily reached on paths  with the help of flashlight-bearing Boy Scouts, features a talk by Norm Nelson,  speaker for the radio program, "The Morning Chapel Hour," music by the 50-voice  Ramona High School Choir and solos by Horace Stevens.  </P> <P> Sunrise services at four Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks all begin at 5:45 a.m.  About 2,500 worshipers are expected at the Covina Hills park for the 21st  annual servicesponsored by the Pomona Valley Council of Churches and two  ministerial associations. Ted Engstrom, president emeritus of World Vision  Inc., is the main speaker. Music will be provided by the 100-voice Sanctuary  Choir and Orchestra of the Covina Assembly of God Church.  </P> <P> As many as 3,000 worshipers will assemble for the service at the Cypress  cemetery. San Pedro Regional Bishop Carl Fisher of the Los Angeles Catholic  Archdiocese will give the Easter message. The Rev. James Froede, senior  minister of Long Beach's Covenant Presbyterian Church, will speak at the Forest  Lawn Sunnyside service, and the Rev. Bill Miller, pastor of Burbank's Victory  United Brethren in Christ Church, will speak at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> Forest Lawn is not the only cemetery providing a venue for outdoor Easter  rites.  </P> <P> Clergy of six Whittier area churches will conduct the second annual sunrise  service, starting at 5:30 a.m., at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. The  45-voice Long Beach City College Master Work Chorale will sing. The local  council of churches will receive a special offering at the service to help fund  a shelter and food program for homeless of the area.  </P> <P> Clergy of Westlake Village churches will begin their annual sunrise service at  6 a.m. at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park. The Easter message will be  given by the Rev. Robert C. Bos of Westminster Presbyterian Church.  </P> <P> In the resort city of Palm Springs, a community Easter sunrise service will be  at McDonnell Golf Course starting at 6 a.m. For years sponsored solely by Palm  Springs Community Church, the service now has ecumenical involvement. The Rev.  Jeff Rollins, pastor of Ajalon Baptist Church, will speak.  </P> <P> Another annual tradition is the 6 a.m. service at the 400-seat Wagon Camp area  of Knott's Berry Farm. Worshipers may park free and be admitted to the park for  that event. The Rev. Doyle Braden of the sponsoring Orange County Southern  Baptist Assn. will speak.  </P> <P> People who would like to attend an oceanfront service could go to Morro Rock,  where the annual observance at 6:30 a.m. this year features a message by the  Rev. W. Norris Barnes of the United Methodist Church, or to Point Loma at the  Cabrillo National Monument. Navy Chaplain J. James Mowry will speak there  during a 6:30 a.m. service. Kiwanis Clubs sponsor both the Morro Bay and Point  Loma services.  </P> <P> Also in the San Diego area are two more services starting at 6:30 a.m.: The  73rd annual Mt. Helix sunrise service featuring Pastor John Maxwell of Skyline  Wesleyan Church and a 100-voice choir, as well as the seventh annual, broadly  sponsored service in Balboa Park at the Spreckel's Organ Pavilion. Bishop  George D. McKinney of St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ and the combined  choir from his church will be featured at the Balboa Park service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EASTER  </P> <P> Easter Sunday represents the culmination of Holy Week observances for  Christians who recall the Gospel stories of Jesus' trial, crucifixion and  resurrection. Both the Western and Eastern wings of Christianity will celebrate  the holiday this Sunday.  </P> <P> TRADITION: The New Testament declares in various ways the significance for  Christians of their belief that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. Early  church practice was to celebrate that belief every Sunday; indeed, the Russian  word for Sunday is "Resurrection." The Ecumenical Council of Nicea (AD 325)  established that the special annual celebration should fall after the first day  of Spring, but also follow Passover on the Jewish calendar. Because of other  complications, the Eastern and Western calculations of Easter coincide only at  different intervals. The date coincided this year and in 1987, but will not do  so again until 2001.  </P> <P> OBSERVANCES: Roman Catholic, Episcopal and Protestant churches will be filled  with worshipers for Sunday morning Masses and services -- congregations  supplemented by many Christians who do not attend church on a regular basis.  Eastern Orthodox Christians will gather for midnight liturgies tonight. Easter  lilies and brightly colored eggs convey in popular ways the Easter themes of  new beginnings and renewed hope.  </P></p>

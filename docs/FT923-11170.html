			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Canadian helicopter order secures jobs for Westland THE SURVIVAL OF Westland, the UK's only helicopter maker, was secured beyond the year 2000 yesterday with part of a CDollars 4.4bn (Pounds 1.94bn) order from Canada for 50 marine helicopters. Westland said last night that the jobs of its 6,000 workforce were safe as a result of the deal. It would not, however, be recruiting new staff. The deal will also boost the fortunes of Westland's Italian state-owned partner, Agusta. The contract is worth about Pounds 500m to the two companies over the next 13 years. Weapons and other equipment will be supplied by a consortium led by Paramax, a Canadian subsidiary of the US computer company Unisys. That contract is worth USDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 780m). Mr Alan Jones, Westland chief executive, said yesterday: 'This is the first export order for the EH101. The Anglo-Italian partnership has been strengthened by the Canadian involvement and it increases the prospects of the EH101 becoming the standard aircraft across Nato.' Other suppliers include: Canadian Marconi, a GEC subsidiary (logistics support, analysis and electronic equipment); CAE Industries of Toronto (simulators and electronics), Litton Industries (radar), and Lockheed (electronic support equipment). The Canadian department of national defence said yesterday that details of the order were still under discussion and that it was not yet sure when a firm contract would be signed. It is only the second large order for the EH101. The size of the order was a victory for the defence lobby in Ottawa. The Canadian government's political opponents have argued that the purchase of the military helicopters, originally required to hunt Soviet submarines, was no longer necessary. The deal is a blow to Boeing of the US, which had tried to persuade the Canadian defence department to modernise its existing fleet of search-and-rescue helicopters. Westland said construction of the first helicopters should start in 1994, with delivery to the north American companies for fitting out starting in 1996 and the aircraft going into service a year later. The Westland-Agusta partnership is now hoping for 25 more orders from the RAF and a similar sized order from the Netherlands. The timing of the deal adds to its importance for the security of Agusta, controlled by Efim, the Italian state industrial holding in the process of voluntary liquidation. It comes only a week after the Italian government decided to wind up Efim. Last year Agusta had consolidated turnover of L672bn, debts of L2,000bn and carried stocks of L1,700bn.</p>

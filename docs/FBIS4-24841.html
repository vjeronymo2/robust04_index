			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sally Blyth] </F>   [Text] The Government has turned down measures to protect  human rights and increase freedom of information because of  fears of upsetting China.    Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, yesterday told a private  meeting of legislators that the Government had no intention of  supporting legislation that would establish a human rights  commission and introduce an access to information bill. Sources  said that the Chief Secretary admitted that China "had a direct  bearing on the situation".    This is the first time the Government has officially  admitted  this and contradicts earlier suggestions that pressure from  China was not an important factor. Officially, the Government  says that it is still considering a number of proposals and that  an announcement will be made tomorrow. The Government will  announce a package of other anti-discrimination measures.    Chan made it clear to legislators that the Government would  not support the human rights commission proposal tabled by the  legislator Anna Wu and recommended by the House of Commons  foreign affairs select committee in recent report. She also  said the Government would reject the proposal for an access to  information bill put forward by the legislative councillor  Christine Loh.    Instead, the Government will announce tomorrow that it will  incorporate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  Discrimination Against Women into Hong Kong law. This is a UN  convention, which China has signed. The Government is believed  to be in favour of drafting new laws against discrimination on  the grounds of sex, age or disability. In addition it will  propose the establishment of an equal opportunities commission.    These measures will not go even half way to meeting  campaigners' demands for more laws to protect human rights.    Liberal minded legislators are likely to be most angered by  the Government's admission that it is bowing to pressure from  China over the issue. Wu last night accused the Governor, Chris  Patten, of reversing his previous policy of standing up to  Beijing.    She reiterated her view that the Government should first  consider the opinions of the Legislative Council, which she is  convinced would support her proposals. Earlier in the week the  Executive Council gave an initial thumbs down to the idea of a  human rights commission.    It is believed that the Government's willingness to bend to  the wishes of China is prompted by a wish for a thaw in  relations, following the row over political reform. It is  feared that any moves that go against China's wishes on human  rights could jeopardise an agreement with China on the new  airport and other key economic issues.    Lu Ping, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Aifairs  Office, hit out last month at proposals by legislators to  protect against human rights abuses. He said that a human  rights commission would violate the Basic Law and be dismantled  by Beijing after the 1997 handover.    Patten has criticised the proposal on other grounds, arguing  that a human rights commission would cost the Government $60m  and would be bureaucratic and toothless.    Officials have used similar arguments in opposition to Loh's  access to information bill, which they say would strain the  already limited resources of the civil service.</p>

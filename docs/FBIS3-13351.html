Also, Secretary of State Warren  Christopher requested President Yasir 'Arafat to resume the  negotiations with Israel "without prior conditions." While  Moscow announced that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit  the region today.    Responding to this, a high-ranking Palestinian source  contacted by AL-HAYAH accused Ambassador Dennis Ross, U.S.  coordinator of the peace process, and the official in charge of  the Middle East at the National Security Council "of returning  to complete bias toward Israel and exploiting President  Clinton's preoccupation with domestic matters to take control of  U.S. foreign policy." [passage omitted]    A PLO official, who asked to remain anonymous, pointed out  that Christopher had phoned President 'Arafat and demanded that  the PLO resume the negotiations without any prior conditions or  agree to hold meetings between Palestinian and Israeli officials.    The official said: "It is clear that the U.S. Administration  is exerting pressure (on the PLO) in Israel's favor through its  threat to use the veto." [passage omitted]</p>

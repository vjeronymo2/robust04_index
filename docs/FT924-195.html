			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Ashdown attacks complacency THE POLITICAL divide is no longer between Labour and Conservative but between those who want to modernise and those who want stagnation, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said in his new year message. The Liberal Democrats are confident that they can play a leading part in discussions on social issues, even though they are most unlikely to volunteer their views to the social justice commission which Labour set up earlier this month to review taxation and benefits. Senior Liberal Democrats believe that they are better placed than Labour to claim from the Conservatives the role of being the 'party of opportunity'. Mr Ashdown said social security should be 'a route to freedom, not a tramline to dependency', and taxation should create 'opportunities for achievement, not disincentives to success'. He returned to the theme of constitutional reform, which played so large a part in the Liberal Democrats' election campaign. He said British politics caused a deep sense of anger and hopelessness in people because of the antiquated institutions of the political system itself, as well as the mistakes of politicians. He said Britain was governed 'by people and institutions who have grown complacent with power, out of touch with the realities in their country'.</p>

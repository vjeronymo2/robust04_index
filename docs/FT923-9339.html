			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Brewers raise wholesale prices of beer BEER prices in most pubs are expected to rise by between 4p and 6p a pint after increases in wholesale prices by the national brewers. Prices of some premium beers in pubs in the south-east may be up to 10p a pint higher. The brewers, which were criticised last year after beer prices, net of duty, rose 11 per cent, have limited the rise in wholesale prices to about the level of inflation in the past three months. Allied-Lyons has raised wholesale prices by 3 per cent, less than the inflation rate of 3.9 per cent in the year to June. Prices in its managed pubs will be 4p to 5p higher in the north of England and 6p to 10p in the south - an average increase of 4.5 per cent. Bass, the country's leading brewer, has lifted wholesale prices in its northern trading area by Pounds 7.50 a barrel for standard ales and lagers and Pounds 10 a barrel for premium brand products - an average increase of 4.4 per cent. Bass Taverns, the group's managed estate, says retail prices have gone up by 4p to 6p. 'This includes the 2p a pint higher duty imposed in the March Budget, and is the first increase for between 12 and 15 months,' the company said. 'We are doing everything we can to control costs and price our beer as competitively as possible.' Whitbread's wholesale prices went up 3.8 per cent in May, the equivalent of about 2p a pint. Courage increased prices of some leading brands - Fosters, Courage Best and John Smith's - by 4 per cent but has held the prices of Holsten Pils and some other brands at last year's levels. Retail prices in Grand Metropolitan's managed estate, which Courage supplies, have risen by between 4p and 6p a pint. The brewers say the increases are necessary to meet higher production and distribution costs and to improve retailing margins hit by the recession. Wholesale beer prices have been falling in real terms in recent years as a result of more competitive discounts being offered by brewers to the growing number of independent pub operators. According to the brewers retail prices have been increasing because of investment in pub refurbishment and increased rents and costs such as the uniform business rate.</p>

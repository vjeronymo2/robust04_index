			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [(Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; third </F> in a series entitled: "Japan and the United States -- the  Picture Shakes": "The Invincible `Super NEC'"]    [Text]Keeping USTR in Check    "I'm giving each of you 10 minutes. Go ahead." Thus began  Assistant to the President Rubin. It was a late February  meeting of the United States National Economic Council (NEC).    United States Trade Representative (USTR) Kantor led off the  discussion, emphasizing that bringing back Super Article 301 of  the Omnibus U.S. Trade Law (for designating and applying  sanctions against unfair trading countries and activities) was  indispensable for pressing Japan for further market opening.  Taking the opposite position was Chairman Tyson of the  President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). She explained  that bringing back the article would only invite a backlash from  other countries and argued that its effect would be slight.    Following the animated discussion, President Clinton settled  the issue. "Okay, I understand what you're saying. We'll bring  back Super 301 after making it a little more flexible."    This is the NEC, which is now involved in nearly all  important U.S. economic policies. The circumstances of the  NEC's "bringing back Super 301 after four years" were obtained  from the testimony of a number of individuals related to the  U.S. Government.    Under the President, the council consists of approximately  20  individuals centering around Rubin and Deputy Assistant Cutter  (NEC deputy chief). The council usually meets in the small,  windowless Roosevelt Room in the White House's West Wing. The  NEC consists of nearly the same members as the cabinet. The  difference is that the council is composed of deputy chiefs from  subordinate agencies. These subordinate agencies flesh out the  strategic details. On the whole, the NEC has become a powerful  policy management squad.    How much power does the NEC have in this administration? At  a meeting of NEC deputy chiefs in mid-March, Deputy Assistant  Stanley Roth, who had just transferred from the Department of  Defense to the National Security Council (NSC)/NEC, questioned  USTR Kantor: "I'd like you to think about how China and the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) view  Japan-U.S. confrontation. If relations between Japan and the  United States become strained due to trade problems, it will  only give China and others an opening. It wouldn't be in the  U.S. interest at all."    Following the rupture in February in the bilateral summit,  not one person raised the "standard of revolt" against the  USTR's taking a hard line against Japan. But when Cutter and  Deputy Assistant Berger (NSC deputy chief) aligned themselves  with Roth's statement, the entire government made a great shift  to a soft line against Japan.  <H5>  U.S. Business Planning Board </H5>   The NEC had originally been a proposal of Republican Senator  William Roth, who knows Japan well, during the preceding Bush  administration. The aim was "to bring together everything from  macroeconomics to trade and technology policy to make economic  policy consistent." In other words, the NEC was to be "the U.S.  version of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI]."    President Clinton, although a Democrat, quickly latched onto  the concept. Soon after assuming office, he set about  establishing the NEC.    In late April, President Clinton gave a handwritten letter  to  Secretary of State Christopher for him to deliver on his trip to  Saudi Arabia. The letter pressured King Fahd to place his order  with the U.S. company AT&amp;T for the 4 billion dollar  telecommunications upgrade the country was planning.    The NEC is said to have been deeply involved in this letter,  too. The NEC is seen as participating in nearly all large-scale  business negotiations, including Motorola's deal for a switching  system for mobile telephones in Beijing and orders for Boeing  aircraft. The accompanying contracts for U.S. corporations is  thought to total some 10 billion dollars (1.1 trillion yen).    For government and industry to join together to sell, there  naturally has to be a judgment that "comprehensive security"  includes not only economics but diplomacy as well.  Consequently, the NEC's equivalent in Japan would be not MITI  but an organization bringing together the functions of the  foreign, finance, and trade ministries. The proper description  of the NEC would be the "Business Planning Board of the United  States, Inc." Perhaps for that reason, the word making the  rounds in Washington is not NEC but "Super NEC."  <H5>  Trade Order Crisis </H5>   The urgent topic of U.S. economic revival is without a doubt  in the background to the Clinton administration's drastic  changes. However, criticism has begun. As Brookings Institute  Senior Researcher Bosworth puts it, "Government intervention in  private enterprise is seen as excessive no matter what." The  criticism results from the clear contradiction between the  current administration's line and the past U.S. position that  consistently attacked Japanese and European "joint  public-private practices," including subsidies and industrial  policy. In addition, business negotiations tied to diplomacy  are dogged with opaqueness.    It would be easy for Japan, in order to confront a United  States that has established a powerful and centralized  organization to increase exports and resolve trade friction, to  create the same type of system. With an eye on the goal of  protecting the world trade order, however, following the U.S.  lead here is not what is required of Japan. Should not Japan  promote market opening and play the role of advising the United  States?</p>

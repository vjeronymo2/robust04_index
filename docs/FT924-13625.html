			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Observer: Moore critical If former Labour party leader Neil Kinnock had been given the job of editing the Sunday Telegraph, Prime Minister Major could not have had a more hostile critic than its new editor, 35-year-old Charles Moore. This opinion of one seasoned political observer may be over the top but the editorship of a traditionally Conservative paper has been handed to a young man who is not a great admirer of Britain's embattled prime minister. Old hands at reading the political tea leaves will be making their own judgments of what it means. The appointment certainly has the hallmarks of Conrad Black, a proprietor keen to hedge his bets, more than Max Hastings, the editor-in-chief who has overall responsibility for the content of the daily and Sunday newspapers. Perhaps Moore will be more supportive of the PM now he has been made an editor. But many think not judging by his column in last week's Spectator. 'Mr Major may come from Brixton, but he is treating his own people as if he were a Bourbon' opined Moore.</p>

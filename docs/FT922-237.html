			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: Sceptical view of health proposals Sir, It was with a depressing sense of deja vu that I read your praise ('Health Care in London', June 24) of the government's intention, veiled beneath the King's Fund report, to close large specialist hospitals and divert the resources to preventative health. Ten years ago we were told the out-dated psychiatric institutions would be replaced with non-institutional alternatives. The hospitals were closed, but much of the money saved did not go into community care. As a former manager of a voluntary agency for homeless people, I know of countless cases of former patients ending up on the streets. Some were referred directly from hospital to a rundown, insanitary hostel. If this government does announce a plan to transfer resources directly from acute to primary care by closing hospitals, it does not deserve to be believed.

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major and Bush to debate Serbia plan NEW MEASURES to tighten sanctions against Serbia in response to the deteriorating situation in Bosnia are expected to be finalised this weekend at talks between Mr John Major and President George Bush. British officials said yesterday that the two leaders, who meet in the US at the end of a week of international meetings on Bosnia, may also settle the terms of the new UN resolution designed to enforce the no-fly zone over the former Yugoslav province. Mr Major remains more cautious than his US counterpart about the possibility of military action against Serbian aircraft violating the zone. Ministers repeated yesterday their concerns that such action would risk retaliation against British ground forces and might wreck the humanitarian effort. The officials said a compromise was emerging between London and Washington on a package combining tougher sanctions and a new UN resolution. They pointed out that the passage of such a resolution, expected next week, would not automatically imply that intruding aircraft would be shot down. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, suggested that Serbia be treated as an international pariah, with existing sanctions supplemented by cuts in telephone links and diplomatic contacts, possibly the sealing of borders. Mr Major will spend two days with Mr Bush in Camp David at the weekend after an EC-US summit in Washington on Friday. The prime minister will be accompanied at the summit by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, who will also join him later today for an EC-Canada summit in Ottawa. Both of the EC meetings will be dominated by the slow progress of the Gatt talks in Geneva, where last month's breakthrough on US-EC farm trade has failed to unravel all the disputes holding up completion of the Uruguay Round. Mr Major will press the outgoing administration to review its decision to impose countervailing duties on EC steel imports. He will also sound out the possibility of a compromise on the disputes over industrial tariffs that are holding up progress in Geneva. Baroness Thatcher last night called for air strikes against Serbian artillery, tanks and supply lines if they do not withdraw their troops from Sarajevo and other besieged Bosnian towns. The former prime minister said in The European newspaper that by stating in public repeatedly that 'we will not intervene militarily' the west had to some extent not been neutrals but 'more like accomplices'.</p>

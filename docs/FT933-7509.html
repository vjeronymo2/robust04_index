			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays in demand The appointment by Barclays of Mr Martin Taylor as its new chief executive as from January 1 next year triggered a burst of heavy buying in Barclays shares, which touched 494p at one point before ending 19 up at 491p. Turnover in Barclays totalled 16m, well above usual levels of activity and the highest single day's trade since the aftermath of the bank's first-ever preliminary loss and the halved dividend announced last March. The appointment of Mr Taylor was described as 'very good news' by one banks specialist, although he professed surprise at the extent of the share price rise. Mr Taylor is currently chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles. The latter's shares tumbled as the news came out, closing 15 lower at 548p on turnover of 1.5m. The rise in Barclays came at the expense of other banks, notably Lloyds, which fell 10 to 535p on hefty turnover of 4.1m as some institutions switched between the two stocks.</p>

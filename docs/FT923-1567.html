			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / US gives pledge to emphasise peace role PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday promised that the US would place greater emphasis on international peace-keeping and proposed a special summit of the United Nations Security Council to discuss proposals in this field. Mr Bush's speech on the opening day of the UN General Assembly's annual general debate identified the need for enhanced international peace-keeping capabilities, the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and promotion of economic prosperity as the three greatest challenges facing the international community. 'Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective engagement to transform our collective institutions and will require each of us to look seriously at our own governments and how we conduct our international affairs,' he said. His speech, which rejected isolationism and stressed the need for nations to adopt outward-looking policies, was seen as a powerful endorsement of the 'Agenda for Peace' published earlier this year by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, at the request of the Security Council summit in January this year. Specifically, Mr Bush endorsed the proposal for standby military forces to be made available by member countries at short notice to the UN secretary-general for peace-keeping and humanitarian relief operations, subject to the approval of governments providing these forces. The president underlined the need for these forces to be able to train together and for joint planning, crisis management and intelligence capabilities. The US was prepared to make available its bases and other military facilities for training and field exercises and he had instructed Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, to work closely with the UN to see how US air transport, logistics and intelligence capabilities could best be employed to support peace-keeping roles. Mr Bush also promised that the US, which owes a total of Dollars 733m (Pounds 414.1m) in regular and peace-keeping contributions to the UN and is the world organisation's biggest debtor, would in future ensure that adequate US financial support would be provided for UN peacekeeping and humanitarian activities. Mr Boutros Ghali has proposed that funding should be provided from member states' defence budgets in order to prevent delays in transfers of financial contributions. Emphasising that 20 countries were currently developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ways to deliver them, Mr Bush proposed that the Security Council give assurances to non-nuclear weapon states that its members would help any such state party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which was a victim of aggression or the threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. In the economic field, the president urged a strengthening of the Group of Seven industrialised states' co-ordination process, although he gave no details. In a clear reference to France's endorsement of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Bush said the exact form of European economic integration was for the Europeans to decide. But he pledged the US would stand by the Europeans. He also promised a reform of US aid policy, moving to a more effective form of economic partnership. He proposed setting up a Dollars 1bn economic growth fund which would provide grants and credits to support businesses in need in countries which had undertaken to restructure their economies.</p>

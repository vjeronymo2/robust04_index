			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (10): Tackling new competitors - Profile of Dunlop MR BOB MAY, managing director of Dunlop Zambia is the kind of industrialist Zambia needs. A blunt, straight-talking Scot, his task is to bring Dunlop's Ndola tyre factory up to speed to face the new competition from direct imports sourced in South Africa and the Far East. His approach is a refreshing blend of optimism, hard-headed realism and entrepreneurial flair. He has to convince his London shareholder, BTR, with its reputation for running a tight ship, that Zambia is a country worthy of a Dollars 7m investment in the modernisation of the tyre factory, giving foreign competitors a run for their money while convincing BTR an acceptable hard-currency will be earned, remittable return on its investment. In a country with three-digit inflation and a tumbling exchange rate this is no easy task. Dunlop is able to beat the imported competition partly because it can undercut suppliers burdened with the amalgam of transport costs, devaluation, import duties and massive importer margins. But earning an adequate hard-currency return when the exchange rate has fallen is a formidable task, the more so since 'existing' investors, of which Dunlop is one, may remit only 15 per cent of their paid-up capital or half after-tax profits, whichever is the lesser. Dunlop plans a modest investment - Dollars 7m over four years - in modernising its plant, drawing on technology from Dunlop International Technology in Birmingham. By mid-1993, Dunlop Zambia will introduce a new generation of tyres, capable of double the mileage of existing products. The Dunlop story is a familiar one for those with experience of structural adjustment elsewhere in Africa. After 15 years or more of a de facto monopoly, Dunlop is now faced with competition from half a dozen direct importers. An industry where marketing used to mean rationing supplies to desperate buyers has changed beyond all recognition. 'We have to change the marketing mindset,' says Mr May, who is sending his sales staff to work with Dunlop Nigeria to learn how to market in a competitive environment. Skills are a problem. The expatriate count is down to six from 17 in 1985. 'We would like to get it down to three,' says Mr May because expatriate staff are 'savagely expensive'. One way out is networking within the region, sharing skills with the larger, more modern factory at Bulawayo in neighbouring Zimbabwe. If Dunlop's three main investor groups - BTR has a controlling 57 per cent stake, the government 26 per cent and Anglo American Corporation 16 per cent  -agree, the modernisation project will go ahead and qualify for the new investment incentives introduced towards the end of 1991. Mr May is optimistic about Zambia's industrial potential arguing that existing firms alone have the scope to expand operations by 30 per cent to 40 per cent although this will have to await the strong farm-led economic recovery forecast for 1993.</p>

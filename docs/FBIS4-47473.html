Nevdakh, Institute of Physics imeni B.I. </F> Stepanov at Byelarusian Academy of Sciences; UDC 621.378.33]    [Abstract] Earlier studies having indicated that gain  limitation in electric-discharge CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers is not  related to underexcitation by electrons but rather to  insufficiently selective pumping of CO[.sub]2[/] molecules  by the discharge into the 00[.sup]o[/]1 upper level, this  evidence is explained theoretically on the basis of the  temperature model referring to P-branch of the 00[.sup]o[/]1  10[.sup]o[/]0 transition. The corresponding expression  for the gain k with respect to the rotational lower-level  quantum number J is analyzed, considering first the ideal case  of the entire pump energy W expended either on excitation into  the antisymmetric vibrational mode _n_[.sub]3[/] or on  raising its vibrational temperature T[.sub]3[/] while the  temperatures of the vibrational two other modes remain equal and  constant (T[.sub]1[/]= T[.sub]2[/]= T. The dependence of  gain k(J) on pump energy W is then governed by the  X[.sub]3[/]= exp[-h_n_[.sub]3[/]/kT[.sub]3[/]] term (h-  Planck constant, k- Boltzmann constant), the gain being maximum  when X[.sub]3[/]= (_a_ + X[.sub]1[/]/2_a_ (X[.sub]1[/]-  referring to the first vibrational mode, _a_= exp[2BJ/kT, B-  rotational constant approximately equal for both levels).  Assuming that T[.sub]3[/] is proportional to the pump energy  W, when J= 20 the gain is accordingly maximum when  T[.sub]3[/]  4880 K. Next is considered the real case of  unequal and rising rather than constant T[.sub]1,2[/]  temperatures, also saturation of T[.sub]3[/] temperature and  dissociation of CO[.sub]2[/] molecules. The results of this  analysis confirm that, indeed, the maximum attainable gain in  any kind of CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and the corresponding  T[.sub]3[/] temperature on the degree of selectivity with  which CO[.sub]2[/] molecules are being excited.

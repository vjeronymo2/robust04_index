			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate hopes drive rally in blue chips DOMESTIC political worries returned to the sidelines yesterday in the London stock market, which focused on the chances of a cut in German interest rates this week. Equities took their lead again from the currency markets, and hoped that Thursday, whatever happens in the important UK by-election in Christchurch, will bring action on rates by the Bundesbank policy council. Shares opened firmly, but it was left to the stock index futures market to provide the impetus which took the FT-SE 100 Index ahead 18.3 by mid-morning. However, this early level of 2,846 on the Footsie proved to be the day's best and the rest of the session, while lively enough in terms of specific corporate features, lacked further development. Supported well at the close by a 15-point gain on the Dow Industrial Average in early trading on Wall Street, London finished just under the best but on a firm trend. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 16.5 ahead on the day at 2,844.2. The index rise was swollen by the strong gain in Reuters Holdings, the global communications group, which yesterday confirmed reports of a substantial repurchase of stock on terms generous to current market levels. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the broader-ranging measure of UK stocks, also recovered ground, ending 12.3 up at 3,215.2. Business in the non-Footsie stocks increased smartly to make up about 66 per cent of the day's total Seaq volume of 483.6m shares; but Seaq business was down sharply from Friday's 539.6m, worth Pounds 1.2bn. The fall in equity trading volume was seen by many analysts as a warning of thin times ahead as the summer months take their toll of a stock market still seeking confirmation of a recovery in corporate profits. While the standing of Mr Major's UK government remains uncertain and is expected to suffer a serious setback at the Christchurch poll on Thursday, attention in the stock market has now moved back to more general prospects for the British economy. With the latest data signalling improvement in the domestic economy, and currency markets pointing to pressure for a cut in German interest rates, which would imply a further cut in UK rates, equity strategists see the UK stock market continuing to rally from the lower end of its Footsie 2,800 to 2,900 trading range. The market was assisted yesterday by renewed support for some of the sectors badly hit in recent weeks. Pharmaceutical shares extended their gains and leading oil issues were also wanted by both UK and US buyers. There was support for the UK bank stocks ahead of the reporting season due shortly, which is expected to bring confirmation of improvement in profits and in the bad debt situations leading from the worst days of the property recession. Although the strength of sterling is seen as a threat to the export performance of the blue chip market leaders, investors still chose to concentrate on the improved likelihood of a cut in domestic interest rates. However, gains in the store and retail groups were fairly modest yesterday, with some sector analysts pointing to the heavy pressure of price competition. Dealers commented that investors were hunting for bargains rather than chasing underlying value.</p>

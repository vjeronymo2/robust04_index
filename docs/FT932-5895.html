			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Sharp rise in job fears among professionals and managers FEAR OF unemployment among professional and managerial employees has increased sharply during the past few weeks, according to the second of a monthly series of Mori surveys published exclusively in the Financial Times today. Four out of 10 of people in social groups A and B now say they are worried that they might lose their jobs within the next 12 months. In April, only 28 per cent of ABs said they feared losing their jobs. Overall, 43 per cent of workers in Britain are worried that they might lose their jobs during the year, compared with 41 per cent last month. As well as the marked loss of confidence among those in professional and managerial jobs, there was also a significant increase in fear of job loss among part-time workers and employees with mortgages. Workers appear to have become more anxious about losing their jobs in spite of unexpected falls in unemployment in each of the past three months. In April, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit dropped by 1,400 to 2.9m, or 10.5 per cent of the workforce. Mr David Martin, a director of Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group which commissioned the survey, said the latest results of the IRS/Mori index showed that 'fear of redundancy and job loss remains a potent threat to confidence and therefore to the reality of sustained economic recovery'. The 41 per cent of ABs who this month said they were 'very or fairly concerned' about the possibility of becoming unemployed during the next 12 months compares with the 47 per cent of skilled manual and craft workers who fear unemployment. The figures for social groups other than ABs have changed little since the survey was last conducted. However, among part-time workers - 80 per cent of whom are women - 41 per cent now say they are very or fairly concerned about job loss, compared with 33 per cent last month. Among mortgage payers, 40 per cent were very or fairly concerned last month and 45 per cent this month. Social group A takes in professionals such as doctors, solicitors and architects, senior civil servants and senior business executives and managers. Group B includes bank managers, university lecturers, middle managers in business and heads of local government departments. The toll taken by the recession of service-sector jobs, plus companies thinning out levels of management, have heightened anxieties among ABs. The survey shows a correlation between levels of general economic optimism and strength of concern about individual job loss. However, it is impossible to tell whether individuals are depressed about their personal prospects because they are pessimistic about the economy, or whether their views on the economy follow fears for their jobs. Mori interviewed 982 adults aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work, face to face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points throughout Britain on May 20-24. Data were weighted to match the profile of the population.</p>

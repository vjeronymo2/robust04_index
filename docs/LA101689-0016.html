			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRONCOS SHUT DOWN DICKERSON AND COLTS  </P> <P> The National Football League's top-rated rushing defense smothered Eric  Dickerson and Denver's Bobby Humphrey and Sammy Winder ran for short-yardage  scores as the Broncos beat the Indianapolis Colts, 14-3, Sunday.  </P> <P> The Broncos (5-1) held Dickerson to 35 yards in 13 carries and the Colts (3-3)  to 44 yards on the ground and 128 total yards.  </P> <P> That defense mounted a fierce goal-line stand midway through the third quarter,  as the Colts came up empty on four plays after having a first-and-goal at the  Denver three. On fourth down at the one-yard line, Dickerson was dumped for a  one-yard loss by Karl Mecklenburg and Steve Atwater.  </P> <P> Mike Horan subsequently punted the ball out of bounds twice inside the 20-yard  line, helping preserve a precarious 7-3 lead.  </P> <P> Following a 24-yard punt return by Ken Bell, who had mishandled two previous  returns, the Broncos drove for a clinching score with 1:56 left.  </P> <P> Sammy Winder, subbing for Humphrey after the Broncos' leading rusher suffered  bruised ribs in the second quarter, capped the 27-yard drive with a one-yard  plunge. The touchdown was set up by a 12-yard pass from John Elway to former  Ram Michael Young on third and nine. Young, from UCLA, is a Plan B free agent.  </P> <P> Clarence Verdin's 40-yard punt return to the Denver 46 midway through the first  quarter set up a career-best 55-yard field goal by the Colts' Dean Biasucci.  The Colts were blanked the rest of the way.  </P> <P> After Biasucci's field goal, the Broncos drove 66 yards in 12 plays as Elway  had 11-yard completions to Vance Johnson and Steve Sewell before Humphrey  sliced two yards off the left side for a touchdown early in the second quarter.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Horan punted 39 yards out of bounds at the Indianapolis  five. The Colts couldn't advance the ball and punted to Bell, who atoned for  his earlier misdeeds with his 24-yard return to the Indianapolis 27.  </P></p>

Japan is deeply concerned about escalating armed hostilities  that have caused a large number of civilian casualties in  various regions of Afghanistan since January, Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a statement.    Japan strongly calls on all concerned parties in Afghanistan  not to use force to obstruct humanitarian aid activities, Terada  said.    He was referring to reports that some armed groups have  blocked aid efforts by groups such as the International  Committee of the Red Cross.    Last week, a UN official said that hundreds of thousands of  internally displaced refugees could die of cold and lack of  food, and estimated that 200,000 citizens are trapped in  fighting in Kabul.    Terada said the Japanese Government is also concerned about  the effect of the hostilities on the repatriation of Afghan  refugees.    Some 5.2 million Afghan refugees are waiting to return home  from Pakistan and Iran, Terada said.    From 1979 to 1993, Tokyo extended 420 million dollars worth  of aid to Afghan refugees through the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Program (WFP).    Japan has not yet recognized the Afghan Government, which  was  established after the fall of communist President Najibullah in  April 1992.    In January, hostilities intensified between the rival forces  of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and loyalists of Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar.</p>

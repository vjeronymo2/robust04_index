			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "hen": "Rexrodt Announces Economic and </F> Monetary Policy Initiatives"]    [Text] Bonn -- According to Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt, the Federal Government plans to work out a number of  economic and monetary policy priorities by next autumn and to  introduce measures to put them into practice as much as  possible. Next week, a program will be presented that will  suggest improvements in the fields of medium-size businesses,  the labor market, and deregulation. The government will also  set out details of the fiscal policy it considers necessary to  safeguard Germany as a business location over the next few  years, Rexrodt told journalists in Bonn.    According to the economics minister, the program, which was  agreed upon within the coalition at the beginning of the week,  is not a "traditional economic policy program," as the  largest-ever economic policy program currently is being enforced  in eastern Germany. The 1994 perspectives of up to 1.5-percent  growth, as described in the [government's] draft Annual Economic  Report, do not justify a large-scale anticyclical program.  There is no "purposeful optimism" in the 1994 Annual Economic  Report, Rexrodt said. The improved economic situation abroad,  especially in the neighboring European countries, clearly shows  this. But still, everything must be done to improve the  framework conditions for a long-term decline in unemployment  figures in Germany.    He said that one of his top priorities during this  legislative period is to strengthen confidence in the  government's economic and monetary policy by consistently  consolidating public funds. This is an objective that will also  be worked on in close cooperation with the economics and finance  ministers. This Monday [17 January], he, Rexrodt, wants to  contribute his share to enabling Finance Minister Theo Waigel to  cut expenses by 5 billion German marks [DM], as laid down by the  budget committee. In spite of the need to economize, the  coalition is determined to enforce measures stimulating the  economy, as proposed in his Report on Germany as a Business  Location dated August 1993, Rexrodt said. Various measures to  promote medium-size businesses are being planned. By way of  example, the minister mentioned the plan to reactivate the  program on promoting capital resources in the old laender,  promoting vocational training through low-interest loans, as  well as more liberal regulations for practicing various  professions.    Rexrodt also announced new initiatives to privatize public  services, as well as deregulation. As an outstanding example,  he mentioned the abolition of demarcation agreements in the  German power supply industry. Yet, this initiative will only be  successful if laender and municipalities stop resisting the  ensuing stimulation of competition between power suppliers.    Rexrodt advocated "radical rethinking" in matters concerning  labor policy. This includes maintaining the gaps between wages  and introducing a low-wage sector. Germany can no longer afford  to exclude entire groups of the population from the labor market  by laying down wages that are too high. All opportunities for  additional employment must, therefore, be explored. This  includes jobs in private households that must no longer be done  illicitly. By fully taking into account wages paid and their  tax-reducing effects, in the end, this policy will pay for  itself by means of additional jobs and higher social insurance  contributions, Rexrodt said.    The economics minister also announced that the Federal  Government will present a fiscal policy concept for the next  parliamentary term by mid-1994. In addition to measures  simplifying taxes, this will include a reduction of  nonprofit-linked taxes, a reduction of taxes on profits, a  return of trade tax under a municipal tax reform, as well as  abolishing income tax on wages and salaries for  subsistence-level incomes.</p>

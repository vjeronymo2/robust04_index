			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC TRIES THE BITTER TASTE OF LEAK SOUP  </P> <P> I was outraged when a TV "investigative" show reported the private memo Gumbel  wrote to an executive. In my family, it's taboo to touch another's mail or  repeat something told in confidence.  </P> <P> Just before the report was broadcast, I asked a family member, "Where in hell  is TV headed?" Soon after, I added: "Pardon me; I just answered my own  question."  </P> <P> R. ROBERTS  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

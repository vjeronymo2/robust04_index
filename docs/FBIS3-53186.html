			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Jan 10 (INA)--Four Arab countries and  Turkey would sign shortly in Baghdad an agreement to connect  their power grids. A source at the Ministry of Industry and  Mineral told THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER.    Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Turkey will hold a meeting in  Baghdad on January 15 to agree that each two neighbouring  countries of the five can connect their national grids.    The aim of the project which was ratified in Ankara in 1989  by ministers of these five countries in charge of electricity is  to make available a power reserve that can be used by any of the  five countries and the exchange of power among these countries  particularly at the times of peak in power consumption.    For example, in Iraq the peak in power consumption is during  summer while in Turkey the peak is in winter. So, these two  countries can exchange power.    Baghdad meeting which will be attended by directors-general  of electricity in the five countries will also discuss  feasibility studies of the project.    The source said the first phase of the project is expected  to  start in 1995 and each country would start to extend its power  to bordering areas.</p>

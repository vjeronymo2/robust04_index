			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Charlotte Sectional Chart and the Charlotte Terminal Area Chart would have to be revised, but the FAA would make these changes when those charts are routinely updated. These changes are considered part of the ordinary cost of chart revision, and therefore, the FAA would incur no additional costs. Because pilots normally use current charts, they should not incur any additional charting costs either; as the charts become obsolete, pilots should replace them with charts that depict the modified Class B airspace area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would impose little costs to VFR users for several reasons. The FAA expects that Lincolnton, Jaars/Townsend, and Lake Norman airports would be the only public airports affected by the lower floor. North of Charlotte, the Class B airspace area floor would change from 6,000 feet to 4,600 feet (over Lincolnton) and would create a 6,000 foot floor over Lake Norman. South of Charlotte, the Jaars/Townsend airport would be affected by the floor of the Class B airspace area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changing from 6,000 feet to 3,600 feet. Those pilots who currently use this airspace and wish to remain free of Class B airspace area control would incur circumnavigational costs. However, the added time and cost to circumnavigate is expected to be minimal. Those pilots who continue to operate in this airspace by participating in the Charlotte, Class B airspace area would be inconvenienced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VFR operators who do not routinely fly inside the Charlotte, Class B airspace area may be potentially inconvenienced by having to participate in the Class B airspace area, (i.e., contact ATC and follow operational rules), if they operate in the areas of proposed Class B airspace area expansion. The FAA believes that most VFR operators would not be significantly inconvenienced because they are already participating in the Class B airspace area, either by voluntarily contacting ATC when in areas adjacent to or under the Class B airspace area by monitoring ATC frequencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those aircraft operators who wish to avoid the Class B airspace area could face circumnavigational costs in those areas where the floor would be lowered north and south of the airport. However, the FAA believes that the costs would be negligible. Nevertheless, the FAA welcomes comments from those individuals that could potentially be affected by increased circumnavigational costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, sailplane pilots, such as those representing the Chester Soaring Association, could face increased costs by having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to relocate to a new airport should they not be able to fly at Chester. In general, these users could incur costs if the FAA determines that a desired level of safety to the flying public could not be maintained if sailplanes are permitted in the proposed Class B airspace area. Sailplane pilots who use the Chester, SC airport may have to drive longer distances and incur added transportation costs before they can assemble and fly their gliders. In addition, the local economies of Chester and Charlotte may be adversely affected by those pilots and families who attend major national-level contests at Chester. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, under this proposed rule, the FAA would try to accommodate users of sailplanes even though soaring activities are somewhat random and unpredictable (as they are dependent upon thermals and other weather conditions). These users would be accommodated through Letter of Agreement procedures. These procedures should allow all parties use of the airspace provided that an optimum level of safety to the flying public is maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefit Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule is expected to enhance safety by reducing the risk of midair collisions. The risk of a midair collision would be reduced by increasing the controlled airspace around Charlotte, North Carolina. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the proactive nature of the proposed changes, the potential safety benefits are difficult to quantify in monetary terms. Aircraft operations within the present configuration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Charlotte, Class B airspace area have increased since the Class B airspace area was created and the airspace has become more complex (a greater mix of large turbine-powered air carrier aircraft with other aircraft of varying performance characteristics). In addition, future operations are projected to increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fortunately, there have been no midair collisions within the Charlotte, Class B airspace area. Without the experience of an actual midair collision, estimating the probability of a potential occurrence in the absence of a proposed rule cannot be reliably determined. Due to the projected increase in traffic (see earlier discussion), there is a potential safety problem, although it is not yet critical. Without the proposed rule, aviation safety in the Charlotte area could be reduce in the future, which could lead to catastrophic consequences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comparison of Costs and Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The precise reduction in the risk of a midair collision avoided by the proposed rule and its monetary values cannot be estimated at the present time. However, system efficiency would be improved and safety enhanced. In view of the negligible costs of the proposed rule, coupled with benefits in the form of enhanced safety to all aircraft operators, the FAA believes the proposed rule would be cost-beneficial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The precise reduction in the risk of a midair collision attributable to the proposed rule and the associated monetary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values cannot be estimated at the present time. However, system efficiency would be improved and safety would be enhanced. In view of the negligible costs of the proposed rule, coupled with non-quantifiable benefits in the form of enhanced safety to all aircraft operators, the FAA believes the proposed rule would be cost-beneficial. An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination, has been placed in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The small entities that the proposed rule could potentially affect are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire owning nine or fewer aircraft. These unscheduled air taxi operators would be affected only when they were not operating under VFR. These operators fly regularly into airports with established radar approach control services. The FAA believes that unscheduled air taxi operators are already equipped to fly IFR. Because they can fly IFR instead of VFR, the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on any of them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

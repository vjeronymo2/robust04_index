			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Mattel bids Pounds 52m for Spear - The scrap over Scrabble gathers pace The battle between America's two leading toy makers moved to the Scrabble board yesterday after Mattel trumped Hasbro's bid for JW Spear, the word game's UK maker. In the corporate finance equivalent of getting all seven letters out on a triple word score, Spear's advisers solicited a Pounds 52m bid from Mattel which was launched just five minutes before Thursday night's deadline. The offer of Pounds 10 a share beats the 900p bid from Hasbro and was immediately welcomed by Spear's board. However, Action Man maker Hasbro, which has the rights to Scrabble in North America, is widely expected to return with a higher offer. 'There must be a pretty good chance,' admitted a member of the Mattel team. The scrap over Scrabble continues a rivalry which spilled over into the law courts 18 months ago when Mattel claimed Hasbro's Sindy doll looked too similar to its own Barbie. Mattel dropped its lawsuit after Hasbro agreed to give Sindy a facelift. Hasbro, which has held a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear since 1990, launched its bid after it received undertakings to accept the offer from Spear family trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings were to become irrevocable if a higher offer was not received by midnight on Thursday. The trusts have little option but to accept the highest bid. The original bid split Spear's boardroom with Mr Francis Spear, chairman, saying it was 'fair and reasonable' and the other directors dismissing it as 'totally inadequate'. Although welcoming the new offer Mr Spear has yet to join the other directors in advising shareholders that the Mattel offer 'represents a better prospect for the future development of the business of Spear'. Mr Spear is close to the Hassenfeld family which founded Hasbro but the rest of the management are understood to be worried that Spear would disappear within Hasbro's international games business. In contrast, Spear would be the first sizeable move into board games for Mattel, which has previously expressed interest in the area. This made it a natural target for Barings, Spear's advisers, when searching for a rival bidder. Mattel finally responded at 5pm and Robert Fleming, its swiftly appointed merchant bank, launched the bid six hours later. The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Mattel's offer represents 18.4 times Spear's earnings last year.</p>

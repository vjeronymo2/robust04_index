			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Malaysia may be hit by oil spillage A BLAZING supertanker fully laden with almost 2m barrels of crude started spilling oil into the sea off the northern tip of Sumatra yesterday triggering a regional anti-pollution alert. Salvage experts were flying to the scene to check the extent of the spillage from the 255,312-tonne Danish owned Maersk Navigator, abandoned by its crew and still drifting after colliding with another tanker. Fire-fighting vessels and tugboats were also on their way from Singapore amid indications that the spilled oil was being driven by winds towards the coast of Malaysia. The supertanker was carrying about 1.9m barrels of crude from Oman to Japan. At least one of the supertanker's cargo tanks was ruptured and spilling oil, fuelling a blaze that might take days to extinguish, a spokesman for owner AP Moller (Singapore) told Reuters. He said pollution was so far reported to be minimal. 'A salvage tug is now hosing down the front of the tanker but the ship remains on fire along the port side,' the spokesman said. He said oil was spilling from at least one of 12 cargo tanks of the ship, which collided with another tanker near the entrance to the Malacca Strait between Malaysia and Sumatra early yesterday. Oil experts said earlier that most of the leaked oil, which was a light crude, would evaporate before hitting the coast, and the environmental impact was therefore likely to be limited. The smaller ship, the Sanko Anna is believed to have escaped with only minor damage. The Malaysian authorities have put their coast guards on alert and say the collision once again demonstrated the need for concerted action on navigation problems in the Malacca Straits, one of the world's busiest waterways. The accident was the second tanker mishap this month. The Braer spewed thousands of tonnes of oil into the sea after running aground in the Shetland Islands off the Scottish coast.</p>

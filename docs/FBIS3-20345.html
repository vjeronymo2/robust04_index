			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Alain Peyrefitte: "Votes Versus Street </F> Demonstrations"]    [Text] No one expected the second round of cantonal  elections to contradict the results of the first round, the  lessons of which hold true but for a few nuances.    Point one: The controversy generated by the youth  professional training contract (CIP) turned these  run-of-the-mill elections into a political test. The prime  minister had been careful not to participate in the campaign,  not wishing to tie his career to an interrim election that could  be the medium for an exaggerated expression of malcontent. The  results were so unexpected that he was unable to resist  interpreting them as the test that, beforehand, he had played  down. That is fair enough.    In fact, the second round confirmed that the people refuse  to  censure the Balladur government, unlike in the previous local  elections of 1982, 1985, and 1992, which were used in that way  against the Socialist government. The dissatisfaction of  various categories of society did not prevent the rejection of  Socialist policy nor did it prevent a vote of confidence for the  government.    Point two: The Left can pride itself on its renewal. The  Communist Party has halted its decline and [Socialist Party  Secretary General] Michel Rocard is right when he says that his  party has made up half of the ground it had lost.    The second round evened things up even more.    The Right is reassured. It has not been bowed by this first  year in power. The rumor of a dissolution of parliament,  supposedly to again bring the "real world" into line with the  "legal world," is fading. This election gave the government the  room for maneuver that even its own majority had balked at  granting it.    However, the Left is even more reassured. The PS is again  becoming France's largest political party. It is fully capable  of playing its role of opposition. It is no longer absurd to  think that it could win a presidential or legislative election.  Tactical withdrawals [at the elections in favor of a  better-placed candidate on the same side] and the "republican  discipline" went like clockwork, generating a fair degree of  surprise.    We have returned to the bipolar logic of the regime. The  Right has returned to its role of managing and the Left has  returned to its role of contesting -- doing what they both do  best.    The electoral page has been turned. France is faced with its  destiny. The real difficulties are just beginning.    The streets are ready to explode although the voters have  spoken. The government now knows that, while it is opposed by  the French who are demonstrating and making trouble, it enjoys  the support of the French who voted. The latter would not  forgive it if it favored the former. The voters expect the  government to energetically continue its policy of reform, for  which they voted a year ago and whose legitimacy they have just  reconfirmed on its first birthday.    You do not govern by bending to the whims of manipulated  crowds. However, at the end of the day, nor do you govern a  country by opposing youth. The prime minister will need a lot  of skill and a lot of tenacity if he is to calm the aberrant  expression of justified adolescent anguish. Let us hope that  the initiatives he announces will give him the opportunity to do  just that.</p>

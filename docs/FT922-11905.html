			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Continuing pressure on margins leaves Helene down at Pounds 2.61m Helene, the womenswear group, recorded record sales for 1991 but continuing pressure on margins cut the pre-tax profit by Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 2.61m. Mr Michael Harris, chairman, said the increase in turnover to Pounds 73.5m (Pounds 67.9m) was creditable in the face of the recession and the low level of sales in high-street shops. Exports rose by 33 per cent to more than Pounds 13m. The second half showed some improvement over 1990's second half and the new year had started well. Both sales and orders in hand currently showed an increase over the same period of 1991. Extraordinary charges were Pounds 737,000 (Pounds 198,000), which, broken down, related to the cost of uncompleted acquisitions Pounds 254,000 (Pounds 84,000), the elimination of amounts owed under profit warranties Pounds 255,000 (Pounds 114,000), and closure costs of a subsidiary Pounds 228,000 (nil). Earnings were 2.6p (3.7p) and the final dividend is again 1.36p to hold the total at 2.01p.</p>

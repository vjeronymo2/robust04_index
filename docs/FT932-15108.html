			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Technology: Breathing life into the oilfields - The Brent field is making world oil history Shell UK rolled out the superlatives last week when it announced a Pounds 1.3bn project to extend the life of the Brent field in the North Sea. It said the project was unique, a landmark in world oil history and the biggest single project undertaken in the history of the UK North Sea, with the possible exception of the development of Brent in the first place. The scheme, which Shell and its subcontractors have already begun, is aimed at extracting more oil and a great deal more gas from the Brent field, already the biggest combined oil and gas field in the UK North Sea. It means Brent should still be in production by about 2010, instead of closing as originally planned in 1998. The project entails reducing the pressure in the field, by making large modifications to three of its four production platforms. Depressurising an oilfield is almost unheard of, but depressurisation is standard practice in gas fields. What is happening is that Brent is gradually being converted from an oilfield into a gasfield. Shell UK believes this operation has been carried out on an oilfield only once before, on a tiny scale in the US. The Brent redevelopment is unique because of its scale and because it is being carried out in the notoriously hostile waters of the northern North Sea - about 120 miles off the Shetland Islands. The field will remain in production at a reduced level during the five years the work goes on. Though the work will be carried out on the vast steel platforms, its effect will be felt in the unseen world of the hydrocarbon reservoirs, lying between 8,700 and 9,400 feet below the seabed. The two reservoirs, one above the other, consist of porous sandstone which contains oil in which gas is dissolved. In common with most reservoirs, pressure in Brent was high when Shell began producing in 1976. This helped the oil to flow through the wells up into the platforms, but so that pressure was maintained as oil was removed, water was pumped in, a standard oilfield method known as waterflood. The high pressure locks the gas into the oil and currently the gas is separated from the oil on the platforms, which are really offshore process plants. The theory behind depressurisation is that the gas is allowed to come out of the solution of oil and gas naturally. The first stage of depressurisation, beginning in 1997, after two of the platforms have been converted to low pressure facilities, is to stop injecting water. The reservoir pressure will begin to fall, liberating increasing amounts of dissolved gas from the oil. However, to prevent the reservoir ceasing to produce oil at all, some gas will be injected into the wells to bring the fluid up to the platforms for separation. The second stage - deep depressurisation - will begin early in the next century. This time, pressure will be allowed to drop further by limiting the flow of water into the reservoir from the aquifer which lies underneath it. To do this the wells and pumps which were previously used for injection will be used to extract water, supplemented by submersible pumps. By the end of the operation in about 2010 the pressure in the reservoir should have fallen to 1,000lb per square inch (70 times atmospheric pressure at sea level) from the 5,500lbs per sq inch in 1997. To make the operation possible the Brent Bravo, Charlie and Delta platforms will each be shut down for a year to remove redundant gas separation and compression equipment and install new process modules. Brent Alpha will be upgraded but not converted to low-pressure operation. All four will be refurbished and upgraded for longer life and new safety standards. By the time the Brent field is abandoned, some 55 per cent of all its oil and 80 per cent of its gas should have been recovered. Brent's recoverable gas reserves should have been boosted by 1,500bn cu ft to 5,400 bn cu ft, and its recoverable oil reserves increased by 34m barrels to almost 2bn barrels, the equivalent of adding a small oilfield and a medium-sized gasfield to the UK's hydrocarbon reserves.</p>

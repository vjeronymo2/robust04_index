			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Sacred Symphony - Sadler's Wells Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to emerge from the Royal Ballet. A young dancer with the Birmingham troupe, he has made some workshop essays, and on Friday night we saw the premiere of his first professional work, Sacred Symphony. His musical text is Andrzej Panufnik's Sinfonia sacra, a score whose clear musical voice hymns the millennium of Polish Christianity and statehood. Hindle's concern seems with the survival of faith in prayer, set against imagery expressive of national identity forged through suffering. He begins well, with four male soloists whose leaps echo the trumpet fanfares of Panufnik's first movement, and then brings on a group of grieving and contemplative women. So far, so brave in vision. The language is serious, classically direct, somewhat reminiscent of Massine's symphonic style. Jan Blake's restrained design of two pendant banners, with the dancers in autumnal, earthy colours, is handsome. But the score, and the rather static inspiration behind the ballet, do not allow much further choreographic development, and the later sections of the piece rely too much on those ecstatic lifts and communings which MacMillan uses so powerfully (because so intimately allied to the language of the Mass) in Requiem. Yet Mr Hindle, speaks with his own voice, and poetically, and I want to see his next works. He is well served by his cast. The other novelty of the evening was Paul Taylor's Airs. It is good to our national ballet essaying mainstream American dance, and Airs, with its springy steps and evident delight in its Handel score, is an apt choice. On Friday it was rather reverentially done - with Taylor's troupe it looks so fresh as to be almost improvisatory - but let BRB's interpreters relax their attitudes to it (and their torsos) and it will gain that sense of joyous spontaneity that makes it such a delight. Marion Tait, in her solos, has the right physical grace and happily natural air. And to close this programme - well worth seeing - Ashton's Valses nobles and Facade. I suppose Valses nobles should really only be given by dancers in their late 'teens, the bloom of innocence quite as necessary to it as the bloom of Ashton style. It is a tiny, quiet marvel, and I love watching it, and the current cast is adept at suggesting the sudden joys (and the evanescent shadows) of this party where the moment is very sweet. Facade looked a bit boisterous on Friday: it needs to be treated with more dead-pan humour and driest wit. And for the Dago, someone as wickedly funny as Robert Helpmann must be found, to destroy the audience with a raised eye-brow and too many diamond rings.</p>

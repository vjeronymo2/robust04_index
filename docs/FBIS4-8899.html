			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following reports on developments in  the Republic of Croatia are drawn from recent issues of the  Zagreb news weekly GLOBUS.  <H5>  Weekly Charges Zagreb Mayor Involved in Illegal Sugar Imports </H5>   In 1992, while he was Croatian trade minister, current  Zagreb  Mayor Branko Miksa signed 230 permits allowing the illegal  importation of 280,000 metric tons of sugar, from which  "skillful merchants" earned at least $50 million, charges GLOBUS  (25 March). The weekly states that it has at its disposal  "carefully concealed documents which could reveal the greatest  importing scandal in the recent history of Croatia." The "Sugar  Affair" created an "entire new class of rich people," GLOBUS  alleges, explaining that all one needed was a bank loan to  purchase, for example, 3,000 tons of sugar at $350 per ton,  import it, and resell it for a net profit of $1 million. The  Zagreb Voce enterprise began importing sugar in 12,000-ton  shipments, and "a certain Robni Promet enterprise" received a  permit to import 22,000 tons of sugar valued at $7 million,  GLOBUS says. Although Miksa's permits, without which the sugar  could not have been imported, cite authorizations from the  Croatian Economic Chamber, GLOBUS says that it has a letter from  the chamber addressed to Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Seks  stating that it did not issue any such authorizations in 1992.  GLOBUS further reports that in 1993, Attorney General Stjepan  Herceg had publicly accused three Croatian enterprises, Sibenka,  Vinoplod, and Veti, of smuggling sugar. Not long after making  these charges, Herceg was forced to submit his resignation.    Along with large, well-known enterprises that were illegally  importing sugar, GLOBUS reports, hundreds of "totally unknown"  small firms, some with "comic names," had also received permits  to import sugar and, after importing just a few batches,  disappeared. The paper publishes the names of the following  firms that it says engaged in such activity: HA-ST, Vedison,  West Commerc, Zenit Company, Idea MGG, Fijomi Trade, Newa  Internacional, Anik Impex, Boss Impex, Ida Komerc, Alfa Impex,  HVH Trade, K.V.A.K., Sun Markt, Equus Caballus, Panex West,  Teuta Trade, and Stella Mare Commerce. Representatives of the  finance police, customs office, public prosecutor's office, and  trade inspectorate have discovered falsified documents and  abuses by the Ministry Of trade, but the public does not know  whether any of these discoveries has led to misdemeanor or  criminal charges, according to GLOBUS.    In a detailed account in its 10 March issue, GLOBUS also  accused Miksa of illegally importing a Mercedes-Benz vehicle for  his personal use and of "defrauding the state of 35,253 German  marks" by not paying customs fees and taxes.  <H5>  Dismissals in Ministry of Foreign Affairs </H5>   GLOBUS reports that numerous dismissals of diplomats have  occurred in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MIP]. In an 18  March article entitled "Why Is Dr. Mate Granic Removing His  Diplomats en Masse?" the weekly reports that the first important  persons to go were Vice Vukojevic, chief of the MIP's  intelligence service, and Benjanin Tolic, also of the  intelligence service, followed by Zeljko Bujas, ambassador to  the United Kingdom, who was recalled at the beginning of 1994.  "Two-and-one-half months later" Milan Ramljak replaced Ivan  Brnelic in Vienna, and on 1 May Ambassador to Poland Milivoj  Slavicek and Ambassador to Bulgaria Bernardo Jurlina will be  replaced. Additional dismissals of ambassadors in countries that  "are very important for Croatia" are planned but have been  postponed due to difficulties in finding "adequate  replacements," GLOBUS claims. The paper states that Tomislav  Simic, MIP adviser on the international media whose "propaganda  circulars to foreign journalists provoked sneers and aversion,"  is also scheduled to be removed. GLOBUS welcomes the changes in  the MIP, saying that they are caused partly by "pressure" to  remove "old cadres" from responsible positions.  <H5>  Former Foreign Legionnaire Commander of New HVO Brigade </H5>   Brigadier General Zeljko Glasnovic, one of the 50 members of  the French Foreign Legion who returned "to defend their country"  at the beginning of the "war against Croatia," is today  commander of the Ante Bruno Busic First Guard Brigade of the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in Capljina, Herzegovina,  according to the 18 March GLOBUS. The brigade is one of four  that are currently being formed in Herzegovina. GLOBUS says that  Glasnovic is, together with General Ante Roso, "the most  significant man of the HVO." The weekly further reports that  Glasnovic has been tasked with forming "the real army in the  Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna." According to a brief  biography provided by the paper, Glasnovi was born in Zagreb on  24 February 1954 and moved to Canada at the age of eight. In  1974 he joined the Canadian Army and in 1988 the French Foreign  Legion, as a member of which he participated in the Gulf War. To  show that Glasnovic believes that the Croatian Army in Bosnia  needs strict discipline, GLOBUS cites his remark: "Look at our  army! What army in the world has soldiers who wear earrings!"</p>

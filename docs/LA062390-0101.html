The ring reportedly involved a TRW employee  who leaked credit information to outsiders. They, in turn, used the information  to fraudulently obtain merchandise and for other illegal purposes. While both  Secret Service and TRW officials confirmed an investigation was under way, they  said they could not give any more details until the indictments are unsealed.  </P></p>

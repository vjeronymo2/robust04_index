			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mie Kawashima] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- In the chilly rainy  morning, about 230 people lined up in front of East 21, a Tokyo  downtown shopping mall affiliated with Uny Co., and the woman at  the front had been waiting for more than two hours.    At the 10 A.M. opening, the shop provided the first 150  customers with four kilograms of domestic rice, which was sold  out in 10 minutes. The remaining 80 bags -- some containing  imported rice, some a domestic-foreign rice blend -- were sold  out in half an hour.    "We cannot endure unappetizing foreign rice, being familiar  with domestic rice," said Hitomi Terai, 43, a local resident and  one of the pleased 150.    Terai had tried Thai rice, but "could not manage to eat it  because it tasted dry and bad."    The morning queue began on February 28, a day before the  Food  Agency began offering full supplies of imported rice, and the  line has since grown, said Hisao Nakaya, store manager of East  21.    Such a scene has been seen every morning, everywhere in  Japan, with the apparent disappearance of domestic rice from the  shelves.    The agency has sold rice imported from China, Thailand and  the United States to make up for a shortfall caused by a record  poor harvest last fall and the government's limited stock.    The government blames consumers for the shortage, saying  they  shy away from foreign rice and stockpile the domestic crop.    The woman at the front of the line said she has no choice  but  to wait because her neighborhood shops sells rice only for  restaurants and other bundle use, not for individual customers.    Nakaya said customers are anxious about the quality of  imported rice, especially since a lawmaker remarked in early  March that Thai rice being sold in Japan is infested with mice  and cockroaches.    Eating foreign rice is a rare experience because Japan has  banned imports for many years.    The coalition government decided in December to partially  open the market through the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations.    The Food Agency plans to supply 500,000 tons of rice in  March, equivalent to last year's volume, that will be a  half-and-half of domestic and imported rice.    From April through June, the percentage of imported rice  will  be raised to 70 percent.    Terai's husband, Masahiko Terai, 46, said the queues may  have  swelled to twice their size from the previous day before due to  the Food Agency's most recent announcement.    The agency said that retailers will not be allowed to sell  domestic rice unless it is mixed with at least 20 percent thai  rice in order to prevent consumers from rushing to the Japanese  crop.    "The move will worsen the situation. When all official rice  is mixed with foreign rice, people will then be after domestic  rice on the black market," he said.    Black market prices for the staple have soared 60 percent  from the end of last year.    Nakaya, the manager, said the measure may ease panic if pure  domestic rice truly becomes unobtainable. However, about 30  percent of domestic rice is said to be independent from the Food  Agency's control and will go to the black market.    People panic because, Nakaya said, "rice is very special for  Japanese. Other food would not cause such a confusion."    Hitomi Terai blamed the government for its policy that  forced  farmers to reduce their acreage of paddies in order to control  production, resulting in the current shortage.    Toshiharu Nishiguchi of Beikoku Data Bank, a rice market  research agency in Tokyo, said consumer demand differs from the  intentions of the government, wholesalers and retailers to  maintain a constant supply.    "At the end of February, wholesalers and retailers  apparently  had a little more domestic rice than a year earlier to sell  later to their regular customers when foreign rice prevails. It  may have upset consumers," he said.    He predicted that more imported rice will be sent to shelves  as early as mid-March. "So the shortage, at least of imported  rice, will ease before long."</p>

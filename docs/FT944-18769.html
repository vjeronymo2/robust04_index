			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Motoring: Flying start for dynamic duo - On test, a new Range Rover and Jaguar's latest For those fortunate motorists allowed by their employers (or accountants) to drive cars in the luxury class, it has been quite a week. First, a new Range Rover to replace the 24-year-old classic that began life as a dual-purpose vehicle for farmers and is now put forward as an alternative to a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7-Series or a Jaguar. Second, a new Jaguar XJ series - perhaps the last of a line that the late William Lyons, who founded the company, could himself have styled. The new Range Rover is recognisably descended from the original. But it is more rounded, has bigger windows, a gigantic boot - the spare wheel now lives under the floor - and standard air suspension, giving it four ride heights. It can lower itself to make entry and access easier, squat just a little for motorway cruising, come up a bit for minor roads and crossing fields, and go higher still for extreme off-road use. On the highway, it rides and handles better than any other on/off-road vehicle, with heavy beam axles back and front. And it is incredibly agile over really rough country - although only a handful of people buying this mobile drawing room will ever discover that. Engines are four-litre and 4.6-litre versions of Rover's own everlasting V8, plus a 2.5-litre, BMW-sourced, turbo-charged and inter-cooled diesel. With the petrol V8s, automatic transmission is standard. The five-speed manual diesel - for me, the best all-rounder, with an up-to-28 miles per gallon (10.8l / 100km) consumption - will be joined by a two-pedal diesel version next summer. Only short road mileages could be driven in the Range Rovers at their launch in south-east England, so the experience served only as a taste of things to come. But I learnt enough to be convinced that if you feel you must have a 4x4 as a road car, and your company can afford to pay between Pounds 31,950 for the 4.0 V8 and Pounds 43,950 for a fully-loaded 4.6 HSE, then this is the one to have because it is the best. Taking part in the launch of the Jaguar XJ series was a motoring enthusiast's idea of heaven. There were four new luxury cars to drive as hard as one's conscience (and wandering sheep) allowed in the wide open spaces of the Scottish Highlands. (But not on the dangerous A9, dotted with warnings of speed cameras and unmarked police cars.) First, the XJR - a Pounds 45,450 super-charged, 326 horsepower four-litre with massive pulling power at low speeds and a real flyer for the businessman who feels he is not yet old enough to have a Daimler V12. It offers super-car muscle with refinement, ease of driving, and seemingly limitless grip from the massively wide 45-series Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres. The most remarkable feature of this fiery new Jaguar is the way the chassis engineers have combined super-sports handling with the marque's traditional limousine-ride comfort and silence. The only clue that the tyres are getting on for a foot wide is their tendency to tram-line - that is, dodge around slightly from side to side on certain kinds of road surface. Jaguar engineers were urged by the marketing people to stiffen the suspension to make the car more overtly sporting (for which read less comfortable). They resisted, and good for them. The XJR has more cornering grip than can possibly be used on public roads, yet it does not thump and bang over potholes. Its steering, while being much more direct than on past Jaguars, is never twitchy. It was, I thought, one of the best luxury cars, regardless of price, I have ever driven. The Pounds 34,450 four-litre XJ6 4.0 Sport (249 hp) lacks the XJR's super-charger and 17in wheels but, standing-start acceleration apart, seemed to go almost as well. And the Pounds 53,450 XJ12 (318 hp) was everything one expects of a chairman's carriage, with apparently unlimited performance on tap. Most user-choosers will go for the least-expensive, 219 hp, 3.2-litre XJ6, a best buy at Pounds 28,950. They need not feel deprived, though. It might not have the sling-shot acceleration of the more muscular versions but there is more than enough power to cope with any conceivable situation. It cruises in near silence and has Jaguar's superb ride. I am told the Jaguar's enlarged boot will now take two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys. We shall see - in the very near future, I hope.</p>

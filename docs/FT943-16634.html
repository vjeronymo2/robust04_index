			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Clinton to give private sector a policy role The Clinton administration is planning to give the private sectors of North and South America an unprecedented role in constructing the policies governing the economic integration of the two continents. This will begin with the presentation at the Miami Summit of the Americas in December of an action plan for liberalising trade and harmonising business regulations. The plan will be based on a white paper which the administration has requested from US business organisations and their Latin American counterparts. Senior administration officials are currently criss-crossing South America meeting government ministers to draw up the summit's agenda. Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, who returned at the weekend from a trip to Brazil, Argentina and Chile, said he had asked ministers to request participation from their business sectors. He plans to write to the governments of the other countries involved in the summit to request similar input. When President Bill Clinton in March this year announced plans for the first summit of democratically elected leaders in the Americas, he promised that labour and non-governmental organisations would have a role in planning the agenda. A successful summit, laying out long-term plans for closer integration of the American economies as a means of shoring up democracies, could provide some rebuttal to the administration's detractors. Mr Clinton has been widely criticised for the the absence of a broad vision in post-cold war foreign policy. Mr Brown, speaking on his flight back to Washington, said the Miami summit would be followed next spring by a hemisphere trade and commerce forum hosted by him and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative. This would be the start of an annual process reviewing the action plan and adopting new measures to ensure economic growth and integration across the Americas. While in Chile, Mr Brown reiterated US commitment to work on a free trade pact with Santiago. Canada and Mexico still had to be consulted on whether it was to be a bilateral pact or an enlargement of their North American Free Trade Agreement with the US. US and Chilean officials have been studying each other's trade regimes in preparation for talks which must wait until Congress has given the administration new 'fast track' trade negotiating authority. This was requested by the White House along with the implementing legislation for the Uruguay world trade round. Mr Brown said his trip left him more convinced than ever that change had really come to Latin America. Chile and Argentina were serving as 'beacons' of economic liberalisation. 'Even in Brazil you get the impression it's going to happen,' he said.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Saudi diplomat seeks asylum A high-ranking Saudi diplomat at his country's United Nations mission sought asylum in the US yesterday, after accusing his own government of human rights abuses, terrorism and corruption. Mr Mohammed al-Khilewi, a first secretary at the Saudi UN mission in New York, signed an affidavit that he had 14,000 documents, some of them classified, which reveal a history of terrorism and rights abuses by the Saudi government. Among the organisations which Mr Khilewi alleged his government was supporting is Hamas, a radical Moslem group opposed to the peace accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Khilewi also claimed the Saudi government had asked its UN mission to spy on two US Jewish groups. He further alleged that officials at both the UN mission and the Saudi embassy in Washington had misused millions of dollars in official funds, depositing them in New York banks and diverting the interest for personal use. The incident is unlikely to jeopardise US relations with Saudi Arabia, considered Washington's closest Arab ally in the Middle East, but it could embarrass both governments. There has been no official comment from US or Saudi officials. Mr Khilewi has received multiple threats, warning him to return to Saudi Arabia or be killed, said Mr Michael Wildes, his attorney.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Betzy Villarreal Rodas] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- Today, Governor  Javier Lopez Moreno, federal and state coordinator of peace  efforts in Chiapas, said he is awaiting a reply from the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] to begin exchanging  work plans and commitments that will lead to the signing of a  regional peace agreement.    Lopez Moreno, however, pointed out that he is not currently  seeking a dialogue with the EZLN in the buffer zones. He added  that he will meet today with Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, when the  prelate returns from a trip.    The state governor delivered a message to the people of  Mexico and Chiapas: "We are not experiencing the worst of  conditions, and we are making progress." I trust the EZLN's  conditions will be appropriate for the holding of elections, and  even the electoral campaign.    He admitted he has good relations with all political  organizations in the state. He also said he was in a position  to resolve the agenda proposed by the State Council of the  Indian and Peasant Organizations as well as to resolve the  concerns expressed by the small landholders, particularly the  cattle ranchers.    He advised that there are problems in some municipalities in  the state, such as land seizures, the blocking of highways, and  unrest in the zones of conflict. Nevertheless, he said, the  situation is under control.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The political movements of the Hungarian community  in Slovakia, after many earlier conflicts and disputes, are,  according to the signs, striving for more intensive cooperation.  Ildiko Nagy reports from Bratislava.    [Nagy] At its session yesterday, the National Council of  Coexistence authorized the movement's executive body to begin  discussions, with the involvement of the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement [MKDH] and the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS],  about setting up a close triple coalition.    Although the delegates took tacit cognizance of the fact  that  discussions are to be pursued with the MKDH, the current  coalition partner, they are of the view that the close unity of  Slovakia's Hungarian community will in future be rendered  possible by their union. However, on account of the criticisms  connected with it, they are presuming that it cannot be  developed at the moment, and that is why discussions have to be  started about the establishment of a triple coalition.    According to Coexistence, the two partners -- that is the  MKDH and the MOS -- must undertake a commitment to form a joint  deputies' group in parliament, to put forward a joint candidate  for the local government elections in October, to create a joint  local-government and foreign affairs council, and in the future  to take a united stand on forums abroad.</p>

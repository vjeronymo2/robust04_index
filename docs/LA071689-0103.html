			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING REFUSE FROM HOUSEHOLDS  </P> <P> My cleaning lady, a longtime family friend, and I are responsible for recycling  everything possible in this household and the apartment complex. On her  biweekly visits, all sacked newspapers, aluminum cans, glass bottles and  plastic bottles are collected. The newspapers are donated to her church and  everything else she sells to Santa Ana Recycling Centers. She uses all small  glass jars for canning jams, jellies and fruits and vegetables, and I am lucky  enough that some come back full.  </P> <P> As I dump my trash, I always fill up the waste basket at the dumpster with  recyclable materials. From my long experience at this large apartment complex,  practically no one recycles. This is a tremendous waste and an unnecessary cost  to the taxpayer on landfill dump fees. There is room at the rear on the  sidewalk for one large recycling bin. Let everyone put everything recyclable  into this one bin and the city can sort it out upon collection.  </P> <P> Make it simple to recycle at apartment complexes, such as this one, and you  will have a great success. I would estimate that a third of the contents of the  dumpsters were recyclable materials.  </P> <P> RICHARD D. MERKER  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

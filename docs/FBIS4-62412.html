			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A large-scale operation against the criminal  world was carried out in Tbilisi today. [passage omitted]  Operations aimed at establishing peace and challenging criminal  gangs and mafia clans were carried out in eight towns and rayons  in the Republic.    This morning, Tbilisi was completely sealed off. Roadblocks  were put up at the city's key junctions, and police, security  and guard units started apprehending crime suspects,  confiscating fire-arms and explosives from the population and  unmasking drugs dealers.    More than 40 suspects, including 11 people wanted for  serious  crimes, were detained by 1000 in the morning. Some 30 automatic  guns, machine-guns, dozens of hand grenades, pistols and grenade  launchers were confiscated from citizens and criminals. The  police discovered 100 stolen cars. A large number of drug  addicts and dealers were unmasked. The operation is still under  way.    It can be said that operations like this, especially when  hundreds of law-enforcement officials are involved, can rarely  be prepared in absolute secrecy. Nevertheless, one can say that  the criminal world suffered a telling blow. [passage omitted]    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] As for the fact that  there is military hardware in the streets, I would like to  stress that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and its units have  nothing to do with politics. We are not taking part in  political discussion. Roadblocks were erected in order to give  peace to our city. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

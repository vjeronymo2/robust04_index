			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel returns to profits MacMillan Bloedel, Canada's biggest forest products group, was profitable in the fourth quarter because of strong timber markets and the lower Canadian dollar. Net profit was CDollars 5.1m (USDollars 3.89) or 3 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 16.5m, or 17 cents a share a year earlier, on sales of Dollars 939m, against Dollars 789m. For all 1993, profit totalled CDollars 53.2m, or 42 cents a share, against a loss of of CDollars 49m, or 52 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 3.8bn, against CDollars 3bn. Mr Robert Findlay, president, said MB expects better performance in 1994 with strength in wood products and packaging and some improvement in pulp and newsprint. For the full year, strength in wood products was partly offset by poor pulp and container board prices. 'Downtime' taken in some mills due to market weakness led to higher overall production costs. A joint engineered products venture in North America did well but KNP BT, in western Europe, was adversely affected by the recession but improvement is expected in 1994 following reorganisation of this company. Housing stocks in the US and Japan, two key markets for MB wood products, should be strong again this year, said Mr Findlay.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Arts: (Openings): London South Bank The most modern jazz, levened by dry humour and sprinkled with quirky quotation from all manner of Americana, is guitarist Bill Frisell's stock in trade. At the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday he applies himself to the live accompaniment of classic Buster Keaton silents in what should be a treat for fans of either or both. The Go West tour continues to Belgium, Italy and Germany.</p>

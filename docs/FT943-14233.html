			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Shareholders criticise BT management: Broker's survey asks opinions of 15 largest institutional investors British Telecommunications has found that several of its largest shareholders are either unenthusiastic or critical of its senior management, after a survey conducted through its stockbroker. The shareholders said the exercise was conducted within the past two weeks through Cazenove, BT's broker, which promised them anonymity. Yesterday BT confirmed that 'structured interviews' had taken place with 15 of its largest institutional investors, based on a faxed questionnaire. 'Some of the responses were good, some indifferent, and some could be described as giving cause for concern,' a spokesman said. He added, however, that he was confident there was no criticism of named individuals. The survey did, however, ask for opinions about three executives: Sir Iain Vallance, chairman and chief executive, Mr Michael Hepher, managing director, and Mr Robert Brace, finance director. Five shareholders were contacted by the Financial Times. One said he had expressed general disappointment with the senior management. Another said: 'We told them we viewed Sir Iain as sort of a figurehead and we are not really too sure about exactly who is running the company.' A third shareholder said that while he rated Sir Iain as doing a reasonable job under difficult circumstances, he could venture no opinion on the other two named executives because he was unsure what they did. Shareholders were also asked questions covering six areas of BT's business: profits, dividends, regulation, competition, cable and overseas activities. One BT executive said the interviews were motivated partly by concern at the steep fall in BT's share price in the first half of the year, and a belief that City confidence in the company needed to be boosted. BT's share price fell by nearly a quarter between February 1 and July 1. BT conceded it was the company's first such approach to its large shareholders, but declined to disclose the results or to say whether the survey had been authorised by the board. The shareholders said they were taken aback at the style of the survey, which they felt had been clumsily handled. 'It's a very odd way of conducting your shareholder relations,' said one investor, arguing that in recent years BT has been aloof from its largest investors, sometimes leaving years between visits to its largest shareholders. City analysts noted recent initiatives by BT including an analysts' briefing by line managers on BT's response to local competition from new cable operators.</p>

Under the decree, those who  want to enter or leave the Chechen Republic will have to  register with the republican security department five days in  advance.    The president explained that the move has been prompted by  the need to "thwart attempts of subversive activity against the  Chechen Republic and block routes of escape for dangerous  criminals." There are over 20 such criminals in the republic,  according to the Chechen public prosecutor's office. Their  names have been published by the local press.</p>

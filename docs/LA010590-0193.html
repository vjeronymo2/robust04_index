			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRASH RECYCLING: IT'S THE LAW NOW IN L.A.;  </P> <P> HE STARTED IT ALL IN HIS BEAT-UP VW VAN  </P> <P> If every great odyssey starts with a modest first step, then the city of Los  Angeles' quest to recycle its trash can be traced back to a ride around the  block that self-styled hippie Gary Petersen took in his beat-up VW van.  </P> <P> The year was 1972 -- July 7, 1972, to be precise -- when Petersen revved up the  van and went door-to-door in his hometown of Santa Monica in an effort to  obtain peoples' trash and sell it for profit.  </P> <P> The 18 years since then have seen Petersen, 42, go from being one of the first  recyclers in Southern California to one of the most successful for-profit  recyclers and environmental consultants in the United States, if not the world.  </P> <P> Today, Petersen is a clean-cut, bespectacled -- and wealthy -- businessman. His  recycling company, Ecolo-haul, was acquired two years ago by Waste Management  Inc., the nation's largest trash handler, for about $2 million. He tools around  in a white Porsche 911 convertible. He lives with his wife and two children in  Pacific Palisades when he is not traveling the world preaching the gospel of  recycling.  </P> <P> It is impossible, environmentalists and city officials say, to imagine the  ambitious recycling plan proposed for Los Angeles without crediting Petersen,  and the work he has done to prod Southern Californians into thinking of  recycling as an alternative to merely dumping their trash.  </P> <P> "He has been so influential because he has helped orient the thinking of the  people in the city to look at this as all being possible," said John Stodder,  an environmental aide to Mayor Tom Bradley, who signed the new citywide  recycling plan into law Thursday.  </P> <P> "If it weren't for the pilot plans Gary designed and worked for on the  Westside," Stodder continued, "we would never have done the citywide plan, I  can guarantee you that."  </P> <P> The fact that Petersen has gotten wealthy along the way has, if anything, only  helped to embellish his near saint-like status among those involved in the  complicated and bothersome task of teaching the public to recycle.  </P> <P> "He deserves it," said Dennis Nishikawa, vice president of the city Board of  Public Works.  </P> <P> "He put in his blood, sweat and tears when no one else was around. He  introduced me and everyone else to what recycling was all about," said  Nishikawa, who oversees the city's effort to engineer the nation's largest  curbside recycling program, which eventually is intended to reach 720,000  homes.  </P> <P> "He is much too decent a man to be a saint," said City Councilwoman Ruth  Galanter, a longtime recycling activist. "But I don't think you'll find anybody  that doesn't respect the work that he has done. I'd much rather have him get  rich from recycling than from polluting."  </P> <P> In the beginning, things were not so rosy.  </P> <P> In 1972, Petersen was back from a voyage he and his wife made to 23 countries  around the world, and eager to start some kind of business that was  "environmentally responsible" but could make him money as well.  </P> <P> People thought he was crazy. And they resented his intention of making money  from something traditionally done as volunteer or nonprofit work.  </P> <P> But Petersen makes no apologies. "I'm from the '60s," he said in an interview  this week. "I wanted to do . . . something really positive in the environmental  area and make a business out of it. I had to find a vehicle, and recycling was  it. I would have something tangible to sell."  </P> <P> "I said, 'We're going to institutionalize recycling -- make it something people  do just like brushing their teeth. I've got to make it make money or nobody is  going to listen to me.' At the time, people looked at me like I was Attila the  Hun."  </P> <P> And that was the reaction of his friends in the environmental movement. The  strangers he greeted at their doorsteps and asked if they wanted to get rid of  their garbage were less charitable.  </P> <P> "At first, people would ask, 'What are you, some kind of communist?' " he  recalled.  </P> <P> It took a while for things to get better, but they did, slowly. Petersen was  able to quit his second job at the local Mayfair market and move his company,  which he dubbed Ecolo-haul, into an office at the corner of Sepulveda and  Ventura boulevards in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> Starting with a small effort in several Westside communities in the early  1970s, Ecolo-haul became one of the first coordinators in the nation of  curbside recycling for single-family homes. It also set up a system of zoned  collection for multifamily buildings and buy-back recycling centers.  </P> <P> By the early 1980s, the company operated the largest network of community  drop-off centers in the nation, with 36 in Southern California. By 1983,  Ecolo-haul had offices in West Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Glendale.  </P> <P> In 1980, Petersen designed and implemented for Santa Monica a citywide  recycling program that is still regarded as the most comprehensive of its type  in the nation. Ecolo-haul still recycles trash for Santa Monica and for a pilot  recycling program the city of Los Angeles has begun in each council district.  </P> <P> In all, Ecolo-haul now serves a community of 1 million people and has diverted  about 500,000 tons of recyclable materials away from Los Angeles landfills.  </P> <P> "Gary deserves credit for being one of the earliest pioneers and an innovator,"  said Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude, whose Pacific Palisades district was  the location of the city's first and most comprehensive recycling effort. "He  was a lone voice in those days, and one who took a lot of the hard knocks at  first" from citizens and lawmakers resisting recycling.  </P> <P> That Westside program is being copied in the recycling programs now under way  in each of Los Angeles's 15 city council districts.  </P> <P> Now that he works for Waste Management Inc., Petersen has no formal connection  with the new citywide recycling program, but he has met with Mayor Bradley, his  staff and city officials to discuss recycling efforts so many times over the  years that he has lost count. "We are constantly working with them," he said.  </P> <P> In recent years, Petersen has promoted recycling around the world. He has  consulted with governments and private firms across the United States and in  nine foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, England and Japan.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, big business has finally discovered what Petersen has been saying  all along -- that there is good money in recycling. Attracted by potential  profits and spurred by a proliferation of laws requiring recycling, the  nation's five largest waste-handling corporations all started clamoring several  years ago for Petersen's know-how and business savvy. He eventually decided  sell Ecolo-haul to Waste Management, the largest company, in 1988.  </P> <P> Waste Management went after Ecolo-haul, according to Jane LaPorte, the  company's vice president for recycling, because Petersen was "the pre-eminent  recycler."  </P> <P> "It was the right time, the right place and the right thing to do," she said.  "Gary has been a tremendous advantage to us -- altruism is not one of the  things we look for. We look at recycling as a money-making venture . . . and we  use his skills wherever we can."  </P> <P> Petersen continues to run Ecolo-haul, now a Waste Management subsidiary, and  holds the title of vice president of Waste Management's California division. He  helps the firm with its commercial and residential recycling contracts in more  than 200 communities throughout the United States.  </P> <P> The coming years will be busy ones on the recycling front in California. After  years of resistance to recycling, the Legislature has lately begun to take an  interest. A container law implemented in 1987 provides for a 2 1/2-cent return  for most beverage containers. Last year, lawmakers approved a bill that will  require each city to recycle 25% of what it throws away by 1995 and 50% by the  year 2000. To encourage compliance, the bill requires municipalities to submit  plans in 1991 describing how those recycling goals will be reached.  </P> <P> Petersen also is engaged in another, more personal project: He is restoring the  VW van he started out with.  </P> <P> "It reminds me of some of those days being out there at midnight, throwing  newspapers in the pouring rain in Malibu, going, 'What am I doing here?' "  </P></p>

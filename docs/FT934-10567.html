			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Subscriptions open for Bank Slaski flotation POLAND's fledgling capital market faced a major challenge yesterday with the opening of subscriptions for 30 per cent of Bank Slaski, the big state owned bank. The flotation, worth 1,395bn zlotys (Dollars 69m), follows the bank's recent failure to attract a strategic partner. Last week the finance ministry cancelled a tender for 45 per cent of the bank after failing to receive an offer for the 20 per cent open to a major foreign bank investor. The ministry says it is continuing to search for a partner. Bank Slaski, which has a loan portfolio weighted towards the country's chemical, steel and coal industries, reported a gross profit of 735bn zlotys for the first six months of this year on a balance sheet worth 33,147bn zlotys. The current stock market issue, open to both foreign and domestic investors, is for between 5 and 5,000 shares at a price of 500,000 zlotys each. It gives Bank Slaski a price-earnings ratio of around 3.5 compared with a range of 17 to 29.5 for the other three banks listed on the Warsaw exchange.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean tugboat  anchored in Vladivostok harbor Thursday to tow an obsolete  Russian submarine back to North Korea, the TOKYO SHIMBUN  reported from the Russian Far East naval port Friday.    The North Korean boat is scheduled to pull up anchor and  start towing the submarine Friday, the report said.    In November last year, Russia concluded a deal to sell 12  obsolete diesel-engine submarines to North Korea, and has  already delivered one to the North Korean port of Najin in  December.    But delivery has been suspended since January when the  Western press first reported on the contract.    Although Russian officials in Vladivostok say the obsolete  submarines are being sold to North Korea as scrap iron,  Pyongyang reportedly plans to use them for military purposes,  the Japanese- language newspaper said.    The paper quoted a Russian official as saying Moscow would  deliver the remaining 10 submarines in the near future under the  terms of the contract.    The official added the contract provides for the presence of  Russian officials at North Korea's dismantling of the submarines  for scrap iron, but Pyongyang has yet to issue entry visas to  Russians to monitor the work, raising suspicions that the  submarines will be used for military purposes, the newspaper  said.</p>

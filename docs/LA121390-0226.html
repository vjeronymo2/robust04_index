			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> HOW TO FLY RIGHT  </P> <P> Combine the stress of the holidays with the anxiety of flying and the average  passenger will come up with Excedrin Headache No. 358. But not the average  Orange County traveler using John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> Courtney Weircioch, public information officer for John Wayne Airport, said  airport administrators are predicting smooth sailing both in and out of the new  Thomas F. Riley Terminal. "Thanksgiving went so well," Weircioch said. "And  we're expecting the same easy flow of traffic throughout December."  </P> <P> Here's a guide to using the new terminal and taking advantage of a few special  airline services.  </P> <P> PARKING -- Two main lots are located at either end of the new terminal, a north  lot and a south lot. Driving up to the airport, signs will designate lots A1  and A2 or B1 and B2. The north lots (A1 and A2) provide access to gates 1  through 5, which serve American, Midway, Delta, Continental and Alaska  airlines. The south lots (B1 and B2) provide access to gates 6 through 10 and  serve Northwest, TWA, American West, USAir and United airlines. Parking garages  A1 and B1 provide direct access to the terminal through doors at the ends.  Garages A2 and B2 provide parking directly in front of the terminal building.  Parking fees are $1 an hour and $14 a day, changing to $7 for the third day and  each day thereafter. Departing passengers should use the upper level for  curbside baggage check-in, ticket counters and gates. To pick up new arrivals,  use the lower roadway to reach garage areas on the baggage claim level.  </P> <P> AIRLINE TICKETS -- The upper level of the terminal houses ticket counters,  baggage check-in and gates. Ticket counters for American, Midway, Delta,  Continental and Alaska airlines are found at the north end of the terminal.  Northwest, TWA, America West, USAir and United airlines ticket counters are  located at the south end of the terminal. After picking up tickets, passengers  walk a few yards to the gates, where they board their waiting planes.  </P> <P> BAGGAGE -- For departing passengers, skycaps (located at the upper level front  entrance) can tag and check baggage through by placing the baggage on a  conveyor belt that leads directly to the baggage-handling area. Baggage  check-in is also available at each end of the terminal at the ticket counters.  Arriving passengers collect luggage from four carousels on the lower level,  accessible by stairs, elevators and escalators. Exit doors open out to lower  roadway for curbside pickup of arrivals and luggage.  </P> <P> GATES -- Each airline is assigned a specific gate, but during the crowded  holiday season gates may be shared. The terminal has telescoping loading  bridges that connect 14 gates to individual aircraft. Waiting areas are  separated by short, two-foot-high dividers. Gates at ends of north and south  concourses serve small commuter carriers.  </P> <P> Special services offered by airlines:  </P> <P> MEALS -- People with dietary needs can request special in-flight meals. Menus  vary from low sodium to Hindu, and can be requested through a reservations  agent at least 24 hours in advance of the flight.  </P> <P> CARGO -- Each airline has specific rules and rates regarding package shipping.  Call the airlines directly for information.  </P> <P> CHILDREN -- A meet-and-assist program is available where airline personnel  accompany unassisted children at the terminal to meet their landing party. This  program requires signed releases and the name(s) and phone numbers of the party  meeting the child at the airport. Special arrangements can also be made to have  someone stay with the child during the flight.  </P> <P> DISABLED TRAVELERS -- Two types of wheelchair services are offered: one will  escort the passenger from the curb to the plane, the second will take the  disabled passenger to a seat on the plane. Most airlines board people with  physical disabilities first, but be sure to let the airline know of any special  needs when reserving tickets.  </P> <P> SEATING -- For extra legroom, request seating at the emergency exit. Those  seats have wider aisles than the rest of the seating on the airplane.  </P> <P> OVERBOOKED FLIGHTS -- According to the Civil Aeronautics Board, a passenger who  is bumped from an oversold flight is entitled to up to $450 in denied boarding  compensation.  </P> <P> LOST OR DAMAGED LUGGAGE -- Before leaving the baggage claim area, fill out a  lost or damage claim report. Get the proper phone numbers to call and check on  the baggage; some airlines deliver recover baggage free of charge.  </P> <P> Source: John Wayne Airport, various airlines APRIL JACKSON  </P></p>

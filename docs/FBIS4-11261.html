			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Norys Nata] </F>   [Text] On 19 April, Andean Parliament [Parlandino]  President Paciano Padron said that the goal set for  Colombian-Venezuelan trade integration has been estimated at $3  billion, a $1.5-billion increase over the 1993 level. Padron  made this statement following the inauguration of the  Parlandino, which includes representatives from Bolivia,  Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, at the La Perla Building  -- Parlandino headquarters.    Following the inauguration, Padron told journalists that the  signing of the Cartagena Agreement will commemorate its 25th  anniversary in May. The Cartagena Agreement was an extremely  slow process during the first 20 years, but it began to take off  in the past five years, particularly in the financial arena -- a  circumstance no one can deny.    Padron stated that in 1992 commercial exchange between  Colombia and Venezuela surpassed $1 million; in 1993, it  exceeded $1.5 billion; and, in 1994, it is expected to exceed $3  billion, which is considered significant progress compared with  other countries. Currently, Colombia and Venezuela are  considering moving from mere economic integration to social,  cultural, and political integration.    Padron explained that the Andean Social Summit, which will  be  inaugurated at 1100 today on the Senate floor in the presence of  President Rafael Caldera and which ends on 22 April, seeks  mainly to obtain the approval of the Andean Social Charter. The  Andean Social Charter contains alternatives for improving the  living standards of citizens of the five member countries that  unfortunately have not moved in a parallel manner toward  economic development.    Padron believes that the charter contains elements  fundamental to solving the problem, but, in addition to that,  these elements deal with establishing responsibilities which,  according to him, set the charter apart from other documents  issued by international organizations. Padron added that the  Andean Social Charter assigns responsibilities among the  international organizations operating in the area and, of  course, among the governments and parliaments from the five  countries.    Padron believes that events of this type lead to popular  support for the integration process, which has lacked it. This  is why they view lending popular support to the integration  process as an objective essential for bringing to life the union  of the five countries as epitomized in the dream of our  liberator Simon Bolivar.  <H5>  Integrationist Vocation </H5>   During his inauguration speech, Congress President Eduardo  Gomez Tamayo indicated that recently our countries have made  significant progress in the area of commercial and economic  integration.    Gomez said: "We could even say that we have begun to  overcome some political differences that limited the integration  process in the past. This is the time to surpass difficult  circumstances and persevere on the path of integration. We must  advance in the identification of policies as Colombia and  Venezuela, which have experienced more than promising results in  the commercial sector, have done."    He also said that the current international situation  demands  the most determined integrationist vocation from Venezuela. As  it is true that the situation has changed, it is also true that  today's world requires an innovative vision in various aspects.  Gomez noted that the trend toward forming economic blocs is a  most pressing circumstance, adding: "Insofar as our peoples  consolidate intraregional trade and strengthen their political  and cultural relations, we will be able to hope to compete in  the world context."  <H5>  The Andean Social Charter </H5>   The seven subjects the Andean Social Charter is  contemplating  include social integration and poverty eradication; children,  women, and the family; health and nutrition; basic needs and  housing; education and culture; productive employment and the  informal economy; and jobs. The discussion of these subjects  began during the Parlandino meeting in Caracas on 19 April, and  their approval is expected at the closing session on 22 April.    Regarding education, participants are proposing to their  governments the reinforcement of literacy programs. In the area  of housing, they are urging the relevant authorities in the  Andean nations to implement plans designed to face the housing  shortage typical of the region's urban and rural areas.    The need to implement health programs ranks among the most  critical, especially regarding the decentralization of services.  In the area of nutrition, food assistance plans targeting the  poor are deemed necessary.    Regarding jobs, they recommend that their governments  implement policies that lead to the creation of new businesses,  cooperatives, and other organizations linked to the informal  economy in order to reduce unemployment, specifically in  depressed groups in the rural sector.    As for children, women, and the family, they propose the  implementation of political, economic, and social programs. They  recommend assigning human, technical, and economic resources to  centers of attention, protection, and development as well as  promoting and strengthening the [words indistinct] all children,  women, and the family in general.    Regarding social integration and poverty eradication, they  propose the adoption of policies that facilitate the  incorporation of all social sectors in the subregional  integration growth-and-development processes.</p>

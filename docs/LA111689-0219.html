			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUBBLE ROVERS TO THE RESCUE IN DISASTERS  </P> <P> They squeeze into spaces barely big enough to breathe in, searching for victims  of earthquakes, hurricanes or mudslides. And they do it for a dog biscuit or a  pat on the head.  </P> <P> Search and rescue dogs, trained to pick up human scent in the air, sniff out  victims before rescue crews bulldoze their way through the rubble of a natural  disaster.  </P> <P> "We can put them into an area where we have no idea who may be lost," says Mark  A. Pennington, who helps coordinate the dog teams through the Virginia  Department of Emergency Services, "and they'll find any human being in that  area."  </P> <P> Actually, Pennington says the dogs are successful about 75% of the time. "They  can have a bad day just like anybody else."  </P> <P> The department has coordinated 148 searches in Virginia since January,  including those for downed aircraft and people missing in wilderness areas.  </P> <P> Pennington and Ralph E. Wilfong, who heads the search and rescue division, also  sent teams on earthquake missions to Mexico City in 1985, El Salvador in 1986  and Armenia last December.  </P> <P> Teams were sent to aid in the Puerto Rico mudslides of 1985 and most recently  to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas. They offered to  help with the San Francisco earthquake rescue, but workers managed without  them.  </P> <P> "If it's a very good dog, it can differentiate between a live and a dead  victim," says Pennington's wife, Winnie, assistant program manager of the  search and rescue unit.  </P> <P> Most dog teams adhere to standards that are being developed on the national  level. Dogs used for search and rescue missions average 3 years of age and  represent various breeds. They generally work until they're about 8 or 9, but  some work well into their teens.  </P> <P> "It used to be shepherds were the best breed," Pennington says. "But now  they're using anything, as long as it's a working or hunting-class dog. We have  everything from mastiffs to Newfoundlands. Labrador retrievers are popular,  because they're very gentle dogs, particularly when dealing with children and  old people."  </P> <P> A dog must be proficient at wilderness rescues and undergo two years of  training before it is ready for disaster work.  </P> <P> "For disaster work, they do an extensive amount of agility training for the  dogs," Winnie Pennington says. "People think a dog can automatically jump over  a fence or jump through a small opening, but that's not true. Dogs can't  naturally do that. They have to learn how to use their pads and their claws a  certain way to be able to balance."  </P> <P> The animals must also learn to travel in all sorts of vehicles.  </P> <P> "You don't know whether you're going to be riding in the back of a pickup truck  or hoisted in by helicopter," Pennington says. "All the dogs have to be  operational -- airworthy -- in all modes of air transportation."  </P> <P> During the Hugo mission, dogs, equipment and handlers were loaded onto a C-130  cargo plane while the engines were running full throttle.  </P> <P> "The dogs have to be pretty self-controlled to function in that," he says.  </P> <P> But the animal is only half the story. No dog search team is complete without  the handler, in most cases the dog's owner, who is a volunteer trained and  certified in rescue missions.  </P> <P> Each handler provides his own food, water and shelter. "We'll provide the  transportation," Pennington says.  </P> <P> Handlers must be able to find their way out of the woods, survive in all sorts  of weather and know first aid, because they often are the first people to reach  a victim.  </P> <P> No dogs have been killed during a rescue, though one was hit by a car during a  wilderness search.  </P> <P> But danger is ever present for dogs as well as handlers.  </P> <P> "They're on the rubble piles along with the dogs," Pennington says. "A lot of  times they go into the buildings. In the case of an earthquake, if there's an  aftershock while they're in the building, that's it."  </P></p>

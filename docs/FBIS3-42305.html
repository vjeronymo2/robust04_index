			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Text] Political sources have stated that preparations are  underway to hold a meeting between the Syrian Foreign Minister  and the U.S. Secretary of State to discuss the removal of  Syria's name from the list of states that support terrorism.  The meeting will discuss the conditions which U.S. President  Bill Clinton conveyed to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad during  their recent meeting in Geneva. The sources said these  conditions are:    1. Syria should support the U.S. efforts to fight the  current  of fundamentalist terrorism in the region by handing over files  on the Iranian personalities who support this current, on Iran's  role in giving material support for this, and on Iran's present  contacts with some Arab personalities to intensify the  fundamentalist terrorists' operations.    In this regard, the United States has asked Syria to  disclose  the intricate details of Iranian-Syrian relations. Clinton  alleged that the United States has information that Syrian  intelligence services have complete files in this connection.    2. Syria should halt the Palestinian factions opposing the  peace process and turn over to Israel about 23 Palestinians  wanted for committing serious (terrorist) incidents where many  Israeli citizens were killed. These individuals are living  under the protection of the Syrian regime.    3. Syria should halt all forms of support for the  pro-Iranian  Hizballah forces in Lebanon and hand over files regarding  Hizballah's plans, the main figures behind the terrorist  operations, and the Iranian personalities who have direct  influence in Iran.    4. Syria should condemn the intifadah in the occupied Arab  territories.    The sources said there are some differences between the two  sides regarding the U.S. conditions. Contacts are underway to  narrow these differences and bring about a meeting between the  Syrian foreign minister and the U.S. Secretary of State.</p>

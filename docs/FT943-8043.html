			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Observer: Teflon Tim's table talk The rumpus over J Paul Getty II's reasons for wanting to save Canova's 'The Three Graces' for Britain seems to be petering out. Unlike the brouhaha over Timothy Clifford, the director of the National Galleries of Scotland, whose slip of the tongue nearly cost Pounds 1m. Clifford seems to have a knack of upsetting wealthy sponsors. Earlier this year Air UK cut short a sponsorship deal with the Scottish National Galleries after Clifford had rearranged the seating plan at a special dinner in the gallery's Impressionist Room. The airline had wanted husbands and wives to sit next to each other. Clifford was horrified. Such a table plan was all very well for a 'mayoral dinner or a Co-Op bean feast', he claimed, but not for his gallery. Air UK overruled the bossy man and thereupon cancelled its free flights around Europe for Clifford and his chums. But on that occasion Clifford seems to have been in the right. Mary Killen, the Spectator's agony aunt, says it is 'very down market' to have husbands sitting next to their wives, the whole point of social life being to meet new people. The only possible reason for placing couples together is anxiety that some guests are having affairs. Indeed, the row over Clifford's seating arrangements would have helped make the occasion a success by breaking the ice and getting people talking, says Killen. Sadly, no one knew about the tiff until after dinner.</p>

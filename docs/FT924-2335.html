			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: A precious piece of Richter - Andrew Clements takes his pick of the year's best releases TWO Christmases ago Rene Jacobs' version of Monteverdi's L'Incoronazione di Poppaea arrived just too late to squeeze into the year's best releases. This time Jacobs' Il ritorno d'Ulisse (Harmonia Mundi 901427.29, three CDs) has made it with a month to spare. If the performances are not quite on the exalted level of Poppaea, there is much admirable singing, especially from Christoph Pregardien's Ulisse and Bernarda Fink's Penelope, with the remarkable counter-tenor Dominique Visse appearing in the prologue as L'Umana fragilita and as Pisandro in the opera proper. There is also the pleasure of Jacobs' wonderfully flexible, non-dogmatic direction. With its judicious cuts in some monologues and the interpolation of early 17th century choruses by other hands where the manuscript is wanting his musical text may well offend purists, but it produces a convincing, spirited piece of theatre, sublimely moving in its final scenes. Many of the most touted operatic sets of the year have proved big disappointments, but the reissue as a single mid-price set of Karl Bohm's 1960s versions of Wozzeck and Lulu (Deutsche Grammophon) was a much needed resurrection. Whatever one thinks of the individual performances (Fischer-Dieskau's Wozzeck and Schoen, Evelyn Lear's Marie and Lulu), Bohm's conducting and the playing of the Vienna Philharmonic have an idiomatic sense that no other Berg performances on record have ever captured. Equally convincing, in its different way, is Anne-Sophie Mutter's brand new disc of the Berg Violin Concerto, with the Chicago Symphony under Levine (DG 437 093-2). Setting highly wrought solo playing among anguished orchestral textures the work seems more desperately tragic than ever before; the coupling, Wolfgang Rihm's very recent Gesungene Zeit, is imaginative and intriguing, with solo writing tailor-made for Mutter's finely drawn, silvery tone. Stravinsky has been served well this year. Best of all were Kent Nagano's coupling of an uplifting, lithe account of the neglected melodrama Persephone and a much more than adequate Le Sacre du printemps with the London Philharmonic (Virgin Classics VCK 791511-2, two CDs); and Boulez's crystalline account of the exquisite Le Rossignol with the BBC Symphony and a first-rate cast headed by Phyllis Bryn-Julson and Felicity Palmer (Erato 2292 45627-2). Of the large crop of discs of Debussy's orchestral music, the clear winner was Michael Tilson Thomas's ravishing Jeux, Prelude a l'apres-midi and, the clincher, La Boite a joujoux with the London Symphony at the top of its considerable current form (Sony). Contemporary music now comes on disc from all directions. In its quiet way the Paris-based Disques Montaigne has established itself now as one of the most important labels for contemporary music, concentrating on the European mainstream with issues this year taking in Xenakis and Kagel, Nono, Rihm and Aperghis. Rihm's voluminous output is hard to survey on disc but the collection of three string quartets (Nos 3, 5 and 8, Disques Montaigne 782008) played by the Arditti Quartet offered a handy chart of his expressive range, while Irvine Arditti's version of Nono's late solo-violin meditation La Lontananza nostalgica utopica futura (Disques Montaigne 782004) offers an intensely intimate, absorbing experience. Nearer home, NMC has continued its invaluable series of discs devoted to contemporary British composers. It was good to have an album devoted to the Composers' Ensemble's imaginative Songbook project, the inspiration of the soprano Mary Wiegold and the composer John Woolrich to invite more than 50 composers to write short settings for the group. The CD (NMC 005) samples 14 of them, though the quality inevitably varies; Birtwistle's crystalline setting of Paul Celan's 'White and Light', and Dominic Muldowney's intense version of Brecht's 'On Suicide' are the highlights. NMC also offered the first disc devoted to James Dillon (NMC d004), containing three of his most impressive pieces. Even the most sceptical follower of Dillon's progress will be convinced by East 11th St NY 10003 for six percussionists from 1982, which has a grip on structure and articulation that some of his music lacked. Finally scraping in, literally in the last post, a new concert recording from Sviatoslav Richter instantly commands attention. Recorded at the Yamaha Centre in Vienna during his 1989 European tour it consists of a series of the small-scale contemporary works with which Richter has consistently spiced his recitals - Stravinsky's Piano-Rag-Music, Webern's Variations, Hindemith Suite 1922 - and which he plays with a flair that is peculiarly his own (Decca 436 451-2, two CDs). The sound is not perfect - distant, slightly noisy - but new recordings from the greatest of living pianists are precious things.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Observer: Controversial candidate Why recruit legendary warrior Finn McCool - also known as Fingal of the eponymous Cave and of the Giant's Causeway - to spearhead the UK government's attempt to pull in Pounds 350m by selling shares in Northern Ireland Electricity? Students of things Celtic, at least, will have a field day with the topic. Not the least controversial question is whether he was even a Celt. One translation of his name is 'fair stranger' - which, it is suggested, is what the Irish might have called a visitor from Scandinavia. Even so, he is credited with having one idea ahead of its time. Legend says the spectacular rock formations on the Antrim coast are the remains of Fingal's attempt to build a road to Scotland. Now NIE is proposing to bridge the same gap with an electricity interconnector.</p>

The rudder system includes a yaw damper, rudder limiter, and an auto-trim function which can affect loads. The follow-on design for the elevators has many similar features. System failures can lead to design load conditions not envisioned by the certification rules for transport airplanes. These special conditions are issued to ensure the same level of safety by providing comprehensive criteria in which the structural design safety margins are dependent on systems reliability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. SC&hyph;93&hyph;7&hyph;NM for the SAAB Model 2000 airplane was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64700). One commenter (an organization representing professional pilots) responded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Our comments are fundamentally in support of the proposed special conditions. However, one commenter is concerned regarding the reliability of providing hydraulic power by the two back-up pumps mentioned in the `Background' information. This apprehension stems from the fact that both back-up pumps are powered from a common motor with shear out features. The commenter questioned this system as redundant or a single point where the `system' could break down and not provide the required hydraulic power necessary to operate the rudder. The commenter's concern extends to the elevators if a similar design is used.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter's concern is addressed in the SAAB 2000 design. The SAAB 2000 can be flown without hydraulic power to the rudder for most hydraulic failure conditions. However, if during takeoff, one engine fails, hydraulic power is necessary to maintain control of the airplane. With this in mind, the SAAB design provides the rudder's two hydraulic actuators with power from two independent hydraulic circuits. One actuator with one functioning circuit is capable of driving the rudder if the other hydraulic circuit is lost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each hydraulic circuit is supplied by an engine driven pump, and for a short duration, power can also be supplied by accumulators. Each circuit is isolated fore and aft by fuses in case the circuits are severed by engine debris. Each circuit, aft of the fuse, has a back-up pump and an accumulator. The back-up pumps, driven by a common electric motor, are activated by low hydraulic pressure in either hydraulic circuit. To protect the independence of the two hydraulic circuits and to eliminate the single point where the ``system'' could break down, as expressed by the commenter, a shear out feature is provided between each back-up pump and the common electric motor. As a further precaution, the AC motor is automatically started (tested) as part of the preflight reliability check. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the commenter's concern for the elevator system, that system will have three hydraulic systems which have many of the same features provided for the hydraulic systems supporting the rudder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on one model of airplane. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1431, 1502, 1651(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE GENERAL loss of confidence that hit the London market yesterday led to a sharp retreat in stock index futures, breaking through the 2,480 support level and leading the underlying cash market lower, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened firmly at 2,502, but after a brief rally September came under pressure as a wave of negative news hit the market leading to a loss of confidence and pulling the underlying cash market down. By 11am, the contract had fallen to 2,475, below the recent support level of 2,480 and trading at a discount to fair value of 18. After a bout of sideways trading around lunchtime, September continued downward, and the poor Wall Street opening added to a further bout of selling. The contract closed at 2,438, down 66 on the previous close and some 13 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash. Turnover reached 9,589. In traded options, the day was dominated by the mid-morning expiry of the July index options. Total volume reached 42,613 lots with the FT-SE 100 option trading a total of 19,922 contracts.</p>

In the program,  he touched on how Japan should deal with the DPRK's (North  Korea's) suspected possession of nuclear arms in its diplomacy  toward the country. He stressed: "It is important that the  United States, Japan, and the ROK will get united in dialogue  with the country gradually and step by step." He also added:  "Because some members of the ruling coalition parties have had  close relations with North Korea, it would be possible to hold  dialogue with the country via them." Thus, he indicated that  the ruling parties would also seek dialogue with North Korea  through diplomatic efforts with the Social Democratic Party of  Japan and other parties playing a mediatory role.</p>

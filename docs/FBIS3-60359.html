			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 18 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Minister of  the Environment Valentin Bosevski handed to Ambassador Thomas  O'Sullivan, head of delegation of the European Commission to  Bulgaria, the memorandum signed by himself and Romanian minister  of water resources, forestry and the environment late in  December last year.    Declaring their common position and their intention to  assist  each other fully in the application of coordinated environmental  measures, Bulgaria and Romania make a request to the European  Union [EU] to provide funds for the implementation of a regional  project for the protection of environment along the lower  Danube. A month ago the two ministers of the environment  considered the development of the project stating that its  implementation was only possible if the intellectual and  financial aid was provided by the EU. The project envisages  joint activity aimed to improve the quality of waters in the  Bulgarian-Romanian section of the Danube, to raise the level of  nuclear safety and protect the air against transboundary  pollution.    Your request to the European Union is going to be the  superstructure of good cooperation between us and your ministry,  ambassador O'Sullivan said on accepting the memorandum. He  described the EU cooperation with the Bulgarian Ministry of the  Environment as an excellent model for all countries to follow in  the implementation of operation PHARE [Economic Reconstruction  Aid For Poland And Hungary] programmes.    Ambassador O'Sullivan promised further support for  environmental protection activities, especially those aimed to  resolve Bulgaria and Romania's common problems.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (5): Principal anchor THE BUDGET deficit has become the principal 'anchor' of financial policy, replacing the dollar/zloty exchange rate which played this role during the 'heroic' first stage of the Balcerowicz economic stabilisation plan after January 1990. After informal talks with the IMF in March the government announced that the deficit would be kept to within 65,500bn zlotys or 5 per cent of GDP, compared to 31,000bn zlotys or 3.3 per cent of GDP in 1991. Reducing the budget deficit to 5 per cent of GDP required substantial cuts to pensions, unemployment pay and public sector salaries and assumes no further fall in industrial production. Other budget assumptions include a 3 per cent rise in hard currency exports to Dollars 13.5bn and a slightly smaller, 2.5 per cent rise in imports to Dollars 13.4bn. It also assumes real money supply growth will not exceed 8 per cent. On the revenue side the budget assumes a 60.3 per cent increase, although that includes a provision for 10,000bn zlotys from privatisation receipts which could be over-optimistic. Spending is expected to grow by nearly 63 per cent. The government is hoping to broaden the tax base and modernise the taxation system by introducing VAT and shifting the burden to personal income taxes and consumption taxes. Until now, around 80 per cent of tax revenue has come from state-owned enterprises, many of which are now technically bankrupt. The zloty, which is now measured against a trade-weighted basket of five currencies, has been steadily depreciating on a crawling peg basis since May 1991. It is expected to depreciate faster this year in order to compensate for domestic inflation, curb imports and generate the higher export earnings needed to service foreign debt.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ruben Dario Carles, Panamanian presidential </F> candidate of Change '94, marking the conclusion of his campaign  for the 8 May presidential elections, at the El Panama Hotel in  Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Shouting: "Chinchorro, Chinchorro"] Fellow  citizens. I have dedicated my life to my fatherland. I have  worked very hard in very important positions in the government  and private sector to achieve the maximum development of Panama,  with the purpose of improving as much as possible the living  standards of all Panamanians.    The current campaign has been very difficult. On the one  hand, I had to act as a retaining wall against the aspirations  of those who served militarism, and, on the other hand, against  those who know that we will not permit corruption in our  government. The struggle has been hard and many times I have  been misunderstood. I know my image on television has not been  the best. I have been what advertisers call a hard-to-sell  product. [laughter, applause] Nevertheless, after touring the  entire country, and with the experience of many years of  dedication, I know that with your resolve and faith we can build  a better Panama.    Today I want to speak to Panamanian youths. I dedicated over  30 years of my life to university teaching. I know -- I was  also young -- that in the classrooms I saw the illusions  reflected in my students' faces, their thirst for knowledge,  their hope in the future, their desire to excel, and their  desire to work. Today I want to say that, as president, I will  work fervently for their hopes, for their future. [applause]    Panama must strive to have its children and youths not only  educated but that the education imparted be top quality.  Education must contribute to the overall development of  individuals. A country's most important resource is its own  people. As a teacher, and as an offspring of teachers, I also  want to address the teachers. Education must be placed in the  very best hands. Legal instruments must be adopted to guarantee  the education sector the income, the job stability, and training  of all those who have the dedication and aptitude to teach.  Education is not a job, nor is it a profession. It simply is  an apostolate. [applause] Just as one cannot learn with hunger,  one cannot teach well if one is hungry.    Now I want to address the Panamanian women -- that woman who  is mother and father at home and the family's only means of  support. I want to speak to the housewife, to the professional  woman. I, Ruben Carles, profess infinite faith in the  Panamanian woman. My love for my mother and my wife, and the  distinction I have afforded women in the companies that I have  administered and in the public posts I have held are my best  credentials. Our government will see to it that women occupy  the posts they deserve in our society. [applause]    Today I also want to address the men in the countryside,  many  of who are here -- the farmers and cattlemen. The agricultural  and livestock production in the country must not only be  protected, it must be augmented and stimulated. As president, I  tell the agriculture-livestock producer and  agriculture-industrial producers that they will find in our  government the most determined cooperation and protection, both  for the domestic market as well as to promote and increase  exports. [applause]    I also want to speak to the doctors, dentists, and all of  those professionals in the field of health. We need a healthy  population. A sick population is a living accusation against the  state and government. A country, in order to prosper, needs to  have a healthy population, both physically and spiritually.  That goal will be a priority concern in our government.  [applause]    Additionally, I have excellent running mates, individually  and collectively better than those on any other slate. We have,  and they are here, a team that understands all the peculiarities  of the Panamanian situation, a team made up of workers,  peasants, teachers, lawyers, engineers, architects, bankers,  executives, businessmen, and clerks. I don't hide anybody in  the closet. [applause]    I ask all the Panamanian people to have faith in the future.  The government that will result from the victory of 'Change 94  will be made up of men and women of this country, with the  knowledge, capacity, honesty, experience, character, and vigor  required from them by the current Panamanian situation.  [applause] This team, which basically consists of yourselves,  will be enriched by youngsters who are willing to participate  and make contributions to the building of the country.  [applause] The new government must immediately work to meet the  most urgent needs of the population. It must promote the  generation of new jobs, which will reduce the unemployment  affecting so many families. To do this, we have concrete and  realistic projects, with viable financing. Our programs do not  include fantasies, poetry, novels, or songs. [applause]    Our government must create conditions to improve real  income,  permitting Panamanians to achieve a better standard of living.  To that end, we must create the atmosphere of confidence that  invites and attracts private investments, be it domestic or  foreign. Panama needs in the near future a government that is  capable and honest, not one just honest in words but honest as  certified by a clean public and private life. [applause] It  must be a government determined to make decisions, with the  wisdom to ensure those decisions are wise, with the experience  to ensure they are practical, with the moral integrity to ensure  they are honest, with the character to ensure they are  implemented, with the vigor to implement them without delay, and  with discipline to ensure they are executed well. [applause]    And we are going to win. [applause] My conviction is  supported by the fact the Panamanian people in these elections  will not only elect the government that will govern their  destiny over the next five years, but they will decide their  future for the 21st century. We must enter the world of  development, otherwise, it will take us many decades to achieve  it and it will be the poverty-stricken people who will suffer  the consequences of that failure.    Panama can achieve that development because our country has  diverse natural resources and institutional opportunities. We  only need to develop and take advantage of them to turn them  into facts that the country's entire population can fully enjoy.  We must also provide public services efficiently. The  existence of adequate electricity, telephone, water, garbage  collection, and security services are indispensable for new  investments.    Deficient and costly public services hamper the overall  development and well-being of Panamanians. We must effectively  defeat crime and eradicate violence in our streets. We must  protect the life and well-being of individuals and their  properties. We must have zero tolerance for drug trafficking,  distribution, and consumption. We must eliminate the impunity  that prevails regarding these offenses. We must prevent and  persecute money laundering.    The country demands security at all levels, everywhere, and  in all activities. All of this will be accomplished if we have  as our objective the benefit and well-being of the people of  Panama. Also necessary are other transportation and port  facilities that must be efficient and competitive. After the  country elects our government on 8 May, we will immediately take  measures to receive the Panama Canal efficiently. We will,  however, steer the inter-oceanic region toward the creation of  an international maritime center, and this must be accomplished  prior to 31 December 1999. Thus, the country will truly receive  the economic benefits from its extraordinary geographic  position. The Panamanian state was created to serve its  population and not to serve itself. The authorities should only  be an instrument through which the state fulfills its lofty  goals and duties. Our government will fulfill this mission.  This is why victory will be ours if the Panamanian people have  faith in God and the future. [applause]    Our government, which will also be the government of all of  you, will be, as Lincoln defined it, a government of the  people, by the people, and for the people. Thank you very much.  [applause]</p>

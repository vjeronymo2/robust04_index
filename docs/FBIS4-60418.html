			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad by Ya'el Dan and </F> Itay Engel; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Dan] We will now move on to the crisis of  confidence between the PLO and the Israeli Government. In a  unilateral step, which contravenes the agreement with Israel,  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat published a decree in the East  Jerusalem press abrogating all Israeli laws in the Palestinian  autonomous areas. The decree states that from now on, the only  laws in effect are those that existed before 1967. Contrary to  the promise 'Arafat made to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, the  PLO's insignia, with a map of all of Eretz Yisra'el, appears on  the decree. Furthermore, in the decree, 'Arafat is referred to  the president of the Palestinian National Authority, and this  constitutes a violation of the agreement. Good morning to  Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, a senior PLO official.    [Abu-Zayyad] Good morning.    [Dan] Why is 'Arafat in such a rush to violate the agreement  before he has even begun to keep it?    [Abu-Zayyad] In my opinion, there is a problem here with the  Israeli opposition, as well as with some of the Israelis who  support the peace process. They immediately get into a panic  and start looking for ways to prove how unreliable the other  side is. Several moments ago, you said that 'Arafat had issued  a decree canceling the Israeli laws that were in force in the  territories. I have the decree here in front of me, and there  is no mention of the things you just reported. I do not know  where you got the information for your report.    [Dan] 'Arafat says: the laws, regulations, and decrees that  prevailed in the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip before 5 June 1967 will remain in effect.    [Abu-Zayyad] Okay, what else?    [Dan] The civilian, ethnic, and religious courts at the  various levels will continue to operate according to the  existing laws and regulations, with the reference apparently  being to those that have been in force since 1967. I do not  want to go on in detail, however....    [Abu-Zayyad, interrupting] No, just wait a minute. As a  legal expert, I would like to take this opportunity to say that  I do not see anything here that violates the agreement with the  Israeli party.    [Engel] Before you get into any details, perhaps you could  tell us: Since when does 'Arafat have legislative powers?    [Abu-Zayyad] I will explain myself in a moment. This decree  stipulates that the situation will remain as it is. The  decision does not mention the Israeli military decrees or the  Israeli military courts.    [Dan] But is there not a contradiction, at the very least,  here?    [Abu-Zayyad] No. There is a chapter in the Oslo agreement  that refers to a committee that will review all the military  decrees currently in force in the territories. As far as the  Palestinians are concerned, there is an even tougher clause in  the Cairo agreement, which states that the Palestinians have the  authority to legialste in those fields turned over to their  control; however, any law they wish to enact must be brought  before a joint committee that will decide within 45 days whether  or not the law is relevant. In other words, the Cairo agreement  gives Israel veto rights even in those fields that were turned  over to the Palestinians.    [Dan] Mr. Yo'el Singer, who helped formulate the  agreements in Oslo, asserts that the decree published by 'Arafat  constitutes a very flagrant violation of the Oslo agreement.    [Abu-Zayyad] I beg to differ. I disagree with him on this  issue. I think that the decree states that some of the laws  that have been in force in the West Bank up to this moment also  existed prior to 1967. Therefore, they will remain valid.  Second, in the same decree, 'Arafat states that the civilian,  shar'iyah, and other religious courts will continue to operate  according to the existing laws and regulations. This means  that, practically speaking, he is not canceling anything. The  judges and prosecutors will also keep their jobs. In my  opinion, there is nothing new here and certainly no violation of  the agreement. I have no intention of whitewashing things or  misleading anyone. I think that anyone reading this decree  should immediately ask himself what is missing and what is not  mentioned here. The fact that something is not mentioned here  does not mean that it has been canceled or annulled. The  contrary is true.    [Engel] Well, there is no point in expanding on this  subject, because it appears that beyond the gap in positions,  there are also quite large differences with regard to what has  already been agreed and both parties' legal interpretation of  the agreement. But before we get into details, let me ask you  about the principles. Who gave the PLO or 'Arafat legislative  powers? The agreement stipulates that such powers will only be  awarded to the Palestinian Authority, which has not yet been  established, and even when established, the Palestinian  Authority must coordinate all legislation with Israel.    [Abu-Zayyad] Look, in principle, legislative powers derive  from the people. Legislative authority is bestowed by the  people. Now, within the specific and unique conditions under  which we are operating, there is an agreement, and all parties  must uphold the agreements they sign and implement them both in  spirit and letter. In my opinion, the question of whether we are  violating the agreement will only be proved by developments in  the field and by the way we interpret and implement the  agreement in practice.    [Dan] Even the symbolic step of using the PLO insignia with  a map of Palestine that includes all of Eretz Yisra'el also  constitutes a violation of the agreement. Above all, it is an  ostentatious provocation.    [Abu-Zayyad] I have a copy of AL-QUDS with the published  decree right here in front of me. There is no such insignia.    [Dan] But I see it right here in front of my eyes.    [Abu-Zayyad] No. Which newspaper are you looking at?  AL-QUDS?    [Dan] No, I am looking at MA'ARIV, which copied the decree.    [Abu-Zayyad] Look at page 4 of yesterday's copy of AL-QUDS.  There is a box. Inside the box you can find the decree. I do  not know where MA'ARIV got the insignia from. I must also say  that I have seen a great deal of incitement in the Israeli  press. It is inciting Israeli public opinion against the  agreement. I can discern an intention to undermine trust  between the two parties. I would like to make the following  suggestion to my colleagues in the Israeli press: We have  enough doubts and fears on both sides. There is no need to add  additional doubts and fears on top of what we already have. It  is totally uncalled for.    [Dan] Thank you, Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Another dragon awakes - The charms and hassles of doing business in Hanoi Only an hour by air from other Asian business centres, with their towering office blocks, glitzy hotels and pollution, Hanoi could inhabit another world. Its crumbling colonial villas and tree-lined avenues give it the appearance of a town in southern France. It has only one five-star hotel and its most common form of public transport is the cyclo, a sort of bath chair pushed by a bicycle. Anyone who has spent hours in a Bangkok traffic jam will appreciate one of the Vietnamese capital's greatest pleasures - it rarely takes more than 15 minutes to get anywhere. But this is the only time-saving aspect of doing business in the city. 'If you think you're going to fly in to Vietnam and sign a deal after one week you're naive. And if you do sign a deal after a week you're foolish,' says David Drinkard, Digital Equipment's representative in Hanoi. Whereas in Hong Kong or Singapore business can be conducted by fax or phone, in Hanoi almost everything requires at least one, often drawn-out, meeting. The Vietnamese delight in formalities requiring elaborate ceremonies, complete with champagne (Russian) and photo sessions. Meeting venues are dingy rooms where low-slung sofas are usually placed on either side of a coffee table across which delegations face each other, sometimes peering around a vase with a couple of dusty plastic roses in it. Compared with their counterparts in other Asian centres, Hanoi officials and businessmen are inexperienced when it comes to international deals. 'They're not uneducated but they haven't been exposed to such things as business plans and requests for proposals,' says Mr Drinkard. This makes it advisable to reiterate detail as Vietnamese, like most Asians, hate losing face and so rarely question things they do not understand. Yet any foreigner who thinks he or she is dealing with people who have no knowledge of the outside world is wrong. Hanoi is a city of linguists. Languages spoken range from French and Russian to Chinese and Spanish (with a Cuban accent). Links with communist countries were once strong and many Vietnamese studied or worked in eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union. From its own communist past, Vietnam is being hurled into the 21st century at an alarming pace. In offices which seem unchanged since the 1940s, there will be a cordless telephone. And the crumbling terracotta roofs of ministries sprout satellite dishes. There are signs that Hanoi is quickly learning how to accommodate the hordes of businessmen clamouring to enter what they predict will be the next dragon economy. It is now possible to phone for an air-conditioned taxi or order a take-away pizza from a restaurant run by an Australian. Decent accommodation, however, is less easy to find and expensive when you can. The Metropole remains the only hotel meeting western standards and is usually fully booked. But a host of tels are springing up. These are eight- to 10-room wonders where, among the kitsch statues of Greek goddesses and hideous nylon bed linen, staff are friendly and satellite TV and IDD facilities are available. Since credit cards and travellers cheques are not in wide use it is best to take cash. Dollars are eagerly accepted and it is adviseable to have a supply of dong, the local currency, since a cyclo ride costs only a fraction of a dollar. But Hanoi, whether charming or frustrating for the traveller, is changing fast. Multi-million dollar hotel projects, high-rise apartments and office blocks are planned, and these threaten to alter radically one of Asia's most delightful cities.</p>

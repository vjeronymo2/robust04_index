			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wyevale grows to Pounds 3.1m WYEVALE Garden Centres yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.09m, in the six months to June 30. Turnover of this USM-quoted group, helped by the integration of the Cramphorn garden centres, increased by Pounds 8.68m to Pounds 20.3m. Like-for-like sales from the Wyevale centres, taking out the effect of the Cramphorn acquisition, showed a 3.1 per cent improvement. Net operating margins increased from 16.9 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Mr Christopher Powell, chairman, said the anticipated post-election upturn had failed to materialise in a sustained manner, and trading conditions remained extremely tough. As a result of the Cramphorn acquisition, current levels of debt were higher than previously experienced. However, the group remained in a strong financial position, with gearing of 40 per cent at the period end, he added. Basic earnings per share were unchanged at 7.3p. Fully diluted earnings increased slightly from 6.8p to 7p. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.48p.</p>

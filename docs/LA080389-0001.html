			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INDIANS, MISSION AGREE ON PLAN TO SCRAP HALL AT DISPUTED SITE  </P> <P> The Kumeyaay Indians have reached an agreement with Mission San Diego de Alcala  that will scrap plans for a meeting hall on a disputed mission site, an elder  for the tribe said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "It's settled," Kumeyaay elder Clarence Brown said after Indian negotiators  approved the latest proposal by the Roman Catholic parish.  </P> <P> The Kumeyaay will formally announce the agreement today once both parties sign  it, Brown said. The two truckloads of Indian remains taken from the site will  be reburied there in Catholic and Kumeyaay ceremonies Friday and Saturday, he  added.  </P> <P> The agreement is similar to the compromise proposal by the office of the state  attorney general, which rules out construction on the site "for the foreseeable  future," Brown said. Another source close to the negotiations confirmed that  wording. The Kumeyaay had previously demanded that the site remain undisturbed  "in perpetuity."  </P> <P> The settlement, which follows three weeks of negotiations, also calls for the  diocese to give the Indians two months' notice before applying for any  development permits for the site, Brown said. And the mission has reportedly  agreed to designate a part of the lot as a cemetery. A source close to the  talks confirmed these provisions, as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Certainly Good News'  </P> <P> "If the Kumeyaay Indians have accepted our offer, then that's certainly good  news," said parish spokesman William Finley. The mission had not been notified  of the Kumeyaay decision as of Wednesday afternoon, he said.  </P> <P> Msgr. I. Brent Eagen, who heads the meeting hall project, could not be reached  for comment Wednesday. Kumeyaay officials said they would not respond to  further queries until today's announcement.  </P> <P> The settlement follows a month of controversy over diocese plans to build a  meeting hall on a site that contains historic ruins and human remains. And,  although it represents a setback for the 10-year-old proposal, the hall's  ultimate fate remains unclear.  </P> <P> A parish committee formed by Eagen to find alternative sites for the building  met for the first time Tuesday, said committee member Janet Bartel. But the  parishioners worry that archeological ruins and human bones will also be found  on other prospective sites, Bartel said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Layer to Obscure Ruins  </P> <P> Under the new accord, a layer of earth will once again obscure much of the  ruins, believed to be those of an early mission church, sources said. Only one  of the pits excavated on the site did not contain human remains and could thus  be left open, said Joy Massa, chairwoman of a committee of preservationists  opposing the meeting hall. Massa said her group supports the Kumeyaay demands.  </P> <P> The agreement also raises questions about the hearing on the controversy before  the city council Monday. Last week, a City Hall aide said the hearing would  proceed regardless of an accord between the Kumeyaay and the diocese because  historic preservation issues were not addressed in the negotiations. But a  Kumeyaay source said Wednesday that the agreement alters the tribe's role at  the hearing.  </P> <P> Before the agreement, preservationists had been preparing a lawsuit against the  city and the diocese aimed at barring construction on the site. Massa said last  week that such a lawsuit may still be filed, even if an accord is reached, in  order to force the mission to release archeological data.  </P></p>

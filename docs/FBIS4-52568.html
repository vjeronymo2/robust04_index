			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government  sought more information on the discovery of 70 kg of plutonium  that is not registered with the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) at a Japanese nuclear fuel plant, and is prepared  for "necessary measures" once details are revealed, a Foreign  Ministry official said Wednesday.    The ministry instructed the embassy in Tokyo to find out  more  about the discovery, especially how such a large quantity of  plutonium escaped past IAEA inspections, the official said on  condition of anonymity.    The plutonium is enough to produce nine nuclear bombs, the  official pointed out.    He said he believes the plutonium was left in plant  facilities during the reprocessing cycle.</p>

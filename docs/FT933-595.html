			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fanuc cuts profit, sales estimates as yen rises FANUC, the Japanese machine tool maker, yesterday cut its sales and profits estimates for the year, blaming the rise in the yen and a decline in demand. Pre-tax profits are expected to fall by 28 per cent to Y21bn (Dollars 198.11m) in the year ending March, after plunging by 44 per cent in the previous 12 months. Earlier, Fanuc had estimated that it would make Y27.6bn before tax in the current year. Sales are set to fall by 10.4 per cent to Y105.4bn, said Fanuc. Earlier this year, it had forecast a slight rise in turnover, to Y120bn for 1993-94 from last year's Y117.7bn. In response, the group plans to cut spending on research and development done outside the company, buy more components from overseas and seek more repair work, said Mr Koji Saito, senior managing director. Fanuc expects tough conditions in the industrial robots market in the second half of the year. In this sector it depends heavily on exports, where the yen's rise has pushed up Japanese prices in foreign currency terms. At home, Fanuc's industrial customers are curbing investment as they slim capacity in line with declining demand.</p>

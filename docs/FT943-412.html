			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / The Russians are coming, seeking Western investors: Self-styled 'blue chips' want wider access to capital Senior managers of five of Russia's self-styled blue-chip companies will today address institutional investors in London as part of a plan to attract more European and US capital to the country's growing equity market. Russia's newly listed companies are already attracting at least Dollars 500m (Pounds 324m) a month from foreign investors, with numbers rising sharply in the past few months following share price rises. Some of the biggest companies are now seeking to improve their access to international markets by issuing global depositary receipts (GDRs) during 1995. The five companies are part of the London 'roadshow' organised by Moscow-based CA, a brokerage house founded in November 1990 and one of the largest market-makers in Russian shares. Unified Energy System of Russia, an energy company which controls more than 90 per cent of power generation and transmission and incorporates 69 regional utilities, power lines and other systems, is one of the largest. Established as a joint stock company in December 1992, its shares have more than doubled during the year. Western investors are already estimated by CA to own 16 per cent of Unified Energy. Foreign investors also own a large chunk - an estimated 6 per cent - of Norilsk Nickel, a mining company which produces about a fifth of the world's output of nickel and cobalt. Some 11.5 per cent of the company's shares have already been sold and a further 10 to 15 per cent may be sold in the next year. The Siberian Far East Oil Company (Sidanko) has grown to be the second largest oil company in Russia, behind Lukoil, although it was only established in May 1994. The Russian government is preparing to privatise Transneft, which controls Russia's oil pipelines. Almazy Rossii-Sakha, which controls Russia's largest diamond mine, has been a joint stock company since May 1991. Over the past few months investors, including a range of specialist funds launched by US and UK institutions, have seen some spectacular returns, in some cases of up to 600 per cent. 'A lot of negatives come out of Russia. People like to dwell on crime and the pyramid selling scandals but there is a whole lot of brass among the muck,' says Mr Richard Chenevix-Trench, head of emerging markets at Barings Asset Management. It is planning to launch a Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m fund for institutions next month. Investors, however, must confront a series of problems and some unusual risks. Most trading is over the counter. Price transparency is poor and insider trading is common. According to CA, the government has only recently begun to address the issue of securing property rights. The quality of information at many companies is often weak, with Russian managers frequently reluctant to give information or meet demands linked to due diligence. 'In many cases we know the business of companies, but when it comes to detailed accounts things are much hazier,' says Mr Chenevix-Trench. 'Valuing these companies can be very difficult,' he adds. The fact that privatisation was rapid in Russia means that employees and managers often directly own large chunks of equity, minimising the extent to which shareholders can influence the direction of the company. In particular, these 'worker-manager alliances' are able to secure continued government funding, given their responsibility for social services. Many medium-sized and large firms are still responsible for the provision of hospitals, schools and kindergartens for their workers. Companies continue to carry out these functions despite privatisation. Vague notions of social responsibilities are one reason why many assets are valued so cheaply. Russian companies are now beginning to plan for the long term and a number of banks are already planning GDR issues for Early next year. Utility companies could follow suit in 1995. Mr Victor Tokarenko, managing director of CA, says: 'We are now ready for partnership with Western firms, not only speculative investment, but strategic investment which is part of a long-term investment policy. We are here to focus on investors interested in normal profit.'</p>

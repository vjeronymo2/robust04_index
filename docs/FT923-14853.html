			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Belgian defence cuts upset Nato NATO and the Belgian chief of staff have made highly unusual appeals to the government over its plans for huge defence cuts which include an end to conscription, according to a television report, Reuters reports from Brussels. Belgium's centre-left government said on Friday it would end military conscription by 1994, which will roughly halve the 86,000-strong armed forces. Defence spending would also stay below current levels for at least five years. BRT television reported on Saturday that the country's chief of staff, General Jose Charlier, had written to the government complaining that the plan was unworkable and that it would be impossible to maintain Nato commitments. It also said Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner had asked Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to reconsider the plans. No comment was immediately available from Nato, which has its headquarters on the outskirts of Brussels. Mr Dehaene's spokeswoman refused to comment on whether there had been any appeals but said the government would not reconsider its decisions on reshaping the military. 'The government's decision is clear,' she said. Belgium badly needs the savings brought by the 'peace dividend' after the end of the cold war to cut its crippling budget deficit. Defence Minister Leo Delcroix told a news conference on Friday Belgium would not let its Nato partners down or renege on other commitments, such as taking part in UN missions. Belgium had some 22,000 troops stationed with other allied forces in western Germany during the cold war. It plans to bring all but a brigade of 4,000 home by 1995, reflecting similar moves by some other western allies.</p>

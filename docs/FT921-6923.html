			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rates little changed UK RATES ended the day 'if anything slightly firmer', as one dealer put it, as the market came to terms with the realisation that there was unlikely to be a base rate cut before the Budget on March 10. 'I think a lot of people came in this morning with lingering hopes of a cut,' said the dealer, 'but realised that wasn't likely.' The key three months interbank rate, which closely shadows base rates, ended the day unchanged at 10 5/16 -10 1/4 per cent. Short sterling futures opened two basis points higher at 89.82, but ended at 89.80, unchanged from Friday. This indicates that, although the market may not be expecting an immediate base rate reduction, one is still anticipated before the contract falls due on March 18. The overnight rate swung throughout the day, opening at 10 3/4 -10 5/8 per cent but falling as low as 9 1/2 per cent by early afternoon. It then firmed all the way back up to 10 1/2 per cent at the close as several big banks found themselves short. The forecast shortfall was originally put at around Pounds 1.4bn, much higher than expected. The Bank of England acted early to take out most of the shortage, buying Pounds 750m of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent outright, and Pounds 450m of paper for resale to the market on March 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. The shortfall was later revised upwards to Pounds 1.5bn, and the Bank bought another Pounds 250m of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. In spite of the publication of economic data showing that French GDP was flat in the fourth quarter, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.60 per cent at a securities repurchase tender to allocate funds for injection into the money market today. It accepted bids for FFr41.8bn in new liquidity, FFr3.1bn less than the FFr44.9bn that will leave the market today. German call money rates were unchanged at 9.45/55 per cent as dealers waited for this week's repurchase transaction. In the US, the Federal Reserve refrained from open market operations, in spite of analysts' expectations that it would add reserves to the banking system. Federal funds were trading at 4 per cent, up from Friday's 3.90 per cent average. Traders are awaiting testimony today by Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, before the senate banking committee.</p>

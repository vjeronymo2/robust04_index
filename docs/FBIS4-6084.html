			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has decided to abolish three export-related acts,  including the export inspection act and the export goods design  act which control quality and design of export goods produced by  Japanese firms, by the end of 1997. The decision will be  incorporated in a basic guideline for a deregulation promotion  program, which will be compiled by the government in June. The  government adopted a system of controlling export goods in the  late 1950's in an effort to promote credibility of Japanese  products. However, it has decided to withdraw such regulation  because quality of Japanese products has been improved. The  government also intends to demonstrate the shift of its trade  policies both at home and abroad by abolishing these acts which  have been regarded as a symbol of joint efforts by the  government and the private sector to promote exports.    The three acts to be abolished are: the export inspection  act; the export goods design act; and the unified trademark act  on products of small export enterprises. Under the export  inspection act, enterprises which export designated products are  obligated to undergo inspection of quality of their products.  The export goods design act requires registration of design and  trademarks of export products. Under the unified trademark act  on products of small export enterprises, the government  formulates trademarks for products of small enterprises and  guarantees quality of their goods. Firms which export designated  products have to pay inspection and certification fees to  inspection organs.    MITI plans to hold a meeting of the Export-Import  Transaction  Council on 15 April and a meeting of the Export Inspection and  Design Council in May to obtain their consent for its decision  to abolish these three acts. It will promote coordination on  plans to gradually decrease items subject to the export  inspection act and the design act beginning this fiscal year and  to submit a bill on abolishing these acts to an ordinary Diet  session in 1997. A bill on abolishing the unified trademark act  on products of small export enterprises will be incorporated in  a package bill on deregulation which is to be submitted to the  current Diet session.</p>

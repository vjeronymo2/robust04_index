			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iran assured Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France that some Western hostages  held in Lebanon will be freed soon, the official Kuwait News Agency reported.  Dumas flew to Kuwait for a brief state visit after a two-day visit to Iran. The  news agency, quoting diplomats traveling with Dumas, said, "He obtained a  promise from responsible officials (in Tehran) that a number of Western  hostages held in Lebanon will be released within a short period." The diplomats  did not elaborate, the agency said. Most of the 16 missing foreigners,  including nine Americans, are believed held by Shiite Muslim extremists loyal  to Iran.  </P></p>

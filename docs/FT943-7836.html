			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Asian growth nations lead UK exports rise Asia's 'tiger' nations and Latin America are the fastest growing markets for British exporters, with much of the growth coming from the engineering and chemicals sector, according to official figures released yesterday. The report, from the Central Statistical Office, also says Britain's trade position with non-European Union countries has gradually improved. Excluding oil and other erratic items, exports to non-EU countries, which represent about 40 per cent of UK trade, rose by 3 per cent in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April. Imports fell by 0.5 per cent in this period, gradually reducing the UK trade deficit. Although there was a rise in Britain's exports to most regions of the world, the fastest growth occurred in goods sent to the Asian 'tigers', Japan and Latin American countries. Exports to the newly industrialised Asian countries of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand were 25 per cent higher in the three months to July compared with the same period a year ago. Exports to Latin America were 30 per cent higher in the three months to July compared with the same period a year ago, and 15 per cent higher than in the three months to April. The CSO said that the growth was occurring from a relatively low base. Total UK exports to the Asian 'tigers' were about Pounds 650m last month, while exports to Latin America were about Pounds 200m. By contrast, exports to North America were Pounds 1.55bn in the three months to July, 5 per cent higher than in the previous three months. But with most of the growth in the emerging markets coming from engineering, chemicals and pharmaceutical sectors, UK trade groups called on British companies to step up their efforts to exploit the export potential, not least because they enjoy an advantage over other European rivals given sterling's weakness against the D-Mark. Mr Robin Eader, deputy director general of the Institute of Export, said: 'The potential for export growth in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan is enormous - Glaxo is out there, ICI - all the big UK companies.'

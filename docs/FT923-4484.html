			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Devaluation candidates if the ERM realigns EUROPE'S finance ministers are adamant. There are no plans for a realignment of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism. But the markets have not been convinced, as the weakness of sterling and the lira and the very high level of Italian interest rates demonstrates. If a realignment makes no sense, why are the markets so nervous? And if it would help, why are finance ministers so stubborn? The currency markets are old hands at the devaluation game. They know that most devaluations lead directly to higher inflation. And while commitment to the ERM parities is supposed to preclude the inflation option, the markets also know that inflation is the normal escape route for economies saddled with heavy public or private debts. Yet the exchange rate is not solely a tool for monetary policy. The interaction of the exchange rate and the level of domestic prices also determines industrial and export competitiveness and profitability. If the internationally fixed price of a traded good is DM2.95 or Pounds 1, but the domestic price of labour and other non-traded inputs needed to make it is Pounds 1.20, then the manufacturer will be unprofitable and will go out of business. This ratio of non-traded goods prices, largely wages, to traded goods prices is known as the real exchange rate. Too high a real exchange rate spells trouble. But what is too high? Measuring competitiveness is a tricky business. But the two charts offer an unscientific attempt to discover which countries currently have a competitiveness problem within Europe. The left-hand chart shows two indicators of industrial profitability: the fall in producer prices relative to overall consumer prices and the rate of return on capital over the period 1987-1991. The dashed line shows the weighted European average for each measure. Below average spells competitiveness problems: and the UK is the only country which has depressed profitability on both measures. UK producer prices have fallen by 6.3 per cent relative to consumer prices since 1987 compared with 4.5 per cent in France and only 1.5 per cent in Germany, implying a tighter squeeze on the profits of UK manufacturers. Italy has a similar fall in relative traded prices but a higher level of business profitability. Spain's high rate of manufacturing productivity growth explains both its high profit rate and the fall in traded goods prices relative to less productive services. Depressed profitability can lead to a shrunken manufacturing sector and persistent trade problems. Germany's profitable manufacturing sector is large and delivers above-average trade surpluses as a percentage of gross domestic product as the right-hand chart shows. But the UK, Italy and France have smaller manufacturing sectors and persistent trade deficits relative to the European average. The UK and Italy, and possibly France, probably needed a real exchange rate devaluation in the late 1980s. But France, unlike the UK or Italy, has been suffering slow economic and real wage growth for a number of years in order to reduce the relative price of non-traded goods and rectify its competitiveness. France has eschewed the alternative: a rise in the relative price of traded goods via a devaluation, because of the risks of re-igniting inflation. The UK and Italy still have all the pain to come. And devaluation is a tempting risk. But do not tell the markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

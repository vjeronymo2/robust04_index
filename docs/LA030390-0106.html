			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP JOINS FIGHT OVER RIGHTS TO A TITLE DEFENSE BY DOUGLAS  </P> <P> Donald J. Trump filed a $50-million lawsuit against the Mirage Hotel and Casino  Friday, claiming unlawful interference by the Las Vegas resort with Trump  Plaza's contractual right to be the site of a heavyweight championship rematch  between Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> John J. Barry, one of Trump's attorneys, said his client and promoter Don King  agreed on a rematch Feb. 12, two days after Douglas won the title with a  10th-round knockout in Tokyo.  </P> <P> The rematch would have taken place June 18 in Atlantic City, N.J.  </P> <P> King, who claims to have promotional rights to Douglas' next three fights, has  also filed suit against the Mirage, which wants to promote a fight between  Douglas and No. 1 contender Evander Holyfield in September. Barry said he hoped  both the Trump and King suits could be consolidated for purposes of a quick  trial.  </P> <P> "Trump's position is he has a contract with King for June 18 and at the time it  was signed, King had the rights because of an exclusive contract to promote  Douglas' next fight.  </P> <P> "If Douglas has a contract with King and King has a contract with Trump, the  Mirage is interfering with Trump's contract."  </P> <P> Trump's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, seeks an injunction  against the Mirage and, if the rematch continues to be interfered with,  punitive and compensatory damages in excess of $50 million. Douglas and his  manager, John Johnson, were also named as defendants.  </P></p>

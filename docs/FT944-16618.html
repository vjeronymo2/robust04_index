			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Dassault climbs 22% in first half Dassault Aviation, the French maker of fighter and business-jet aircraft, yesterday reported a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax group profit to FFr279m (USDollars 53m) for the first half of this year, on turnover which fell to FFr5.5bn compared with FFr5.7bn in the same period of 1993, writes David Buchan in Paris. Dassault, which is 70 per cent dependent on military sales, was badly hit in the early 1990s by the slowdown in French defence orders, heavy development costs for the Rafale fighter and a dearth of export orders. However, it recently capped a 1992 contract to supply 60 Mirage fighters to Taiwan with a deal to sell Qatar a dozen Mirages in return for taking some old ones back, refitting and selling them on to Spain.</p>

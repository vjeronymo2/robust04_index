			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Boost for Tecs on specialist training TRAINING and Enterprise Councils will from next month be given financial incentives to train people with reading or numeracy difficulties. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, made the announcement at the launch of Grand Metropolitan Trust's training centre in east London. The trust is one of the largest providers of training to young people and the adult unemployed, and many of its clients have special needs. Government funding through Tecs of training for people with special needs has been criticised, particularly by voluntary groups which have provided most of such training. Provision for people with special needs has suffered disproportionately from cuts in training budgets, it is claimed, because Tecs have favoured candidates who can get qualifications most quickly. Part of Tecs' funding is related to the qualifications trainees achieve. Mr Howard said: 'From next month achievement by those with severe literacy or numeracy needs will be recognised.' This will be because the acquisition of new qualifications which certify numeracy and literacy will count towards the output-related part of funding. Astra Training Services, created in a management buy-out of government skillcentres, has raised nearly Pounds 20m from new investors including Schroder Ventures, the venture capital group, which is investing Pounds 5m in return for an equity stake.</p>

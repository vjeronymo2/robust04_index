			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Long Beach Civic Opera Loses Leaders: The Long Beach Civic Light Opera is  losing its producer Martin Wiviott and associate producer Keith Stava, who have  led the organization into the top ranks of Southland musical theater companies  since Wiviott arrived in 1983.  </P> <P> The board has begun "a national search" for a successor, said managing director  Pegge Logefeil. Wiviott and Stava are going into an unnamed Southland  theatrical enterprise together, said Wiviott, who declined to be more specific  before leaving his job after the group's next show, "1776." Admitting that his  refusal to discuss his new venture sounds "mysterious," Wiviott quipped that he  might create "the first lunar civic light opera." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

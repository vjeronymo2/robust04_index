			<p>BFN     [Text] Doboj, June 2 (TANJUG) -- Moslems continued strong  attacks on Serb positions in northern Bosnia even though talks  on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis are scheduled to  continue Thursday [2 June] in Geneva, where a ceasefire  agreement is expected to be signed. Moslem forces launched the  fiercest attacks in the night Wednesday/Thursday and the  previous day on Serb positions on Mt Ozren, south of Doboj, Serb  military sources report.    The Moslems tried to cut off Serb defense lines launching  several infantry attacks supported by artillery, but after the  Serb units fired back and at some places even engaged in  hand-to-hand combat they returned to their initial positions.  Moslem attacks continue in the Teslic front, west of Ozren, and  several Serb villages in this area, including the town of  Teslic, have come under Moslem artillery fire. Two women were  killed and two injured in a Moslem artillery attack Wednesday  afternoon on Doboj and extensive material damage incurred.    Simultaneously Serb positions west of Doboj came under  combined infantry and mortar fire and fresh grouping of Moslem  forces which were brought in by columns of motor vehicles was  registered. Around midnight Moslem forces opened strong  anti-aircraft fire from their positions six kilometers southwest  of Brcko, a town under Serb control in northern Bosnia, on Serb  positions, Serb sources report. According to the same sources,  during the whole night local Croat forces and forces of the  regular Croatian Army from the region of Orasje, northern Bosnia  opened light arms fire on Serb positions and villages.    In the early morning Thursday Moslem units in the Gradacac  front, west of Brcko fired 10 shells on Serb positions but the  Serbs did not return fire.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell in syndicated loan link Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell have joined forces in the syndicated loans market and their first co-arranged loan is a Pounds 200m revolving credit facility for the Co-operative Insurance Society, the UK insurer. A syndicate of 14 banks has been formed for the five-year loan, the first by the society for four years. It was priced at 22.5 basis points over London interbank offered rate (Libor) and was signed yesterday. Deutsche Bank, which is AAA rated and has assets of more than DM570bn, recently signalled greater co-operation with its merchant banking subsidiary Morgan Grenfell, which it bought five years ago for Pounds 950m. Mr Rick Abbott of Morgan Grenfell said yesterday: 'This is the first of what we hope will be a series of joint syndication activities. The approach we have taken in this case has proved to be effective.' Both Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche already had a relationship with the Co-op, and a banker close to the deal said: 'It is the first time that the two houses in London have co-operated together. The combination of Deutsche and Morgan Grenfell coming together was seen as a strength, and brought value to the transaction.' ABN Amro and UBS have arranged a Dollars 700m standby loan for Akzo Nobel, the Dutch-Swedish chemicals group formed this year through the merger of Sweden's Nobel Industries and Akzo of the Netherlands. There are 15 banks in the syndicate, all of which already had a relationship with the company. The seven-year loan is priced at 22.5 basis points over Libor. On the undrawn part of the loan, banks receive a commitment fee of 12 basis points.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Johnny Majors, Tennessee football coach, said that prize recruit Derric Evans  will not be allowed to play for the Volunteers because of his arrest Tuesday  night in Dallas.  </P> <P> Evans and a high school teammate, Gary Edwards, were charged with two armed  robberies at video stores. Evans was released Wednesday on $50,000 bond.  </P> <P> Majors said that he would release Evans, a 6-foot-3, 195-pound safety, from his  letter of intent if Evans asked. That would allow Evans to accept a scholarship  at another school, but he would have to sit out a year and would lose a year of  eligibility.  </P></p>

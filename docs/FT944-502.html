			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Toys were us The scene is familiar. Breathlessly they line up and shyly pass on folded scraps of paper with their secret wishes for the coming season. Children queuing for the Christmas grotto, or voters entering the polling booth? In truth, they have something in common. They share a sense of wishful anticipation, of belief that their desires will be satisfied. But once the ritual is done, awe passes too. All too often, disappointment follows as the outcome falls short of expectations. As disappointed children punish their toys, so do voters their politicians. The victims are all around: John Major, plumbing new depths in the opinion polls; Bill Clinton, still reeling from the Republican landslide; Boris Yeltsin, manoeuvring ineptly for advantage in Moscow; Silvio Berlusconi, now the helpless plaything of Italian politics, not its saviour. At the sixth Christmas since the fall of the Berlin Wall, leaders in industrialised and former communist countries have discovered how rapidly the fashions of politics can turn against them. Their product life-cycles, like those of the trinkets dispensed by Santa Claus, modern toys, have become ever shorter. In most of eastern and central Europe, former communists have regained a place in power; not only in Italy, but also in Japan and Canada, the ground has caved in under governing parties during the past 15 months. The last great survivor of European politics is Helmut Kohl, who four years ago promised east German voters that Christmas would come every day. It is no coincidence that he rules the European nation most enduringly attached to traditional fairy-tales. The extension of democracy increases the risk that it will be over-burdened with unrealisable expectations. Too little belief in the capacity and legitimacy of elected leaders can produce authoritarianism or anarchy; too much leads inevitably to disillusionment and cynicism. Voters should be like wise children: thoughtful, and slow to succumb to the blandishments of the flickering image, the unsubstantiated promise, and the free gift. Instead they persist in over-burdening their politicians with contradictory demands that even a sorceror could not reconcile, while politicians hope that the length of the electorate's memory will be inversely proportional to the list of problems they have been put into power to solve. A new compact between governments and the governed is needed, not for perfect truth and perfect democracy - for neither exists - but for better balance between the two. Politicians must cut the wrapping and improve the content of their packages. They must inform and, at times, indulge, the voters without pandering to gullibility or greed; and they must admit their mistakes. The voters should show more consistency, and greater rigour. They should foresake the cycle of extremes under which suspension of disbelief on polling day gives way, on the morrow, to disenchantment. The child's Christmastide, wide-eyed and tantrum-torn, must not become their daily lot. We voters need a healthy mix of sceptical hope and hopeful scepticism all through the year.</p>

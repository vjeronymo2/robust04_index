			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Sky is distant limit: 'The best kept secret in personal finance' Every day of the week between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m pours into a single unit trust run by Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial. The success of the new Higher Income Plan in attracting almost Pounds 500m in under a year symbolises the new competitive power of the unit trust industry as short-term interest rates have fallen within the space of three and a half years from 15 to 5 1/2 per cent. Unit trust companies celebrated a new record this week as net investment of Pounds 9.1bn was announced for 1993, eclipsing the previous peak of Pounds 6.3bn in 1987. Total funds under management, boosted by the strength of stock markets all around the world, rocketed by almost 50 per cent to Pounds 95.5bn during the year. A breach of the Pounds 100bn level is expected any time. Yet unit trusts still form a comparatively tiny part of the savings industry in the UK. The industry's trade association Autif admitted this week that probably no more than 1 1/2 m people out of a working population of 25m invest their savings directly in unit trusts. 'We are the best-kept secret in personal finance,' said Autif's director general, Mr Philip Warland, promising a 1994 campaign to boost awareness. The British unit trust industry can only boggle at the amazing success of its mutual fund counterpart in the US. Net sales of US mutual funds (excluding money market funds) were Dollars 30bn in December 1993 alone. Total assets held by equity and bond funds have reached almost Dollars 1,500bn, and there are mutual fund investors in 28 per cent of all American households. In the UK the unit trust industry is still struggling to establish its independent identity. It operates under the shadow of the Pounds 400bn-plus life assurance industry, which last year absorbed nearly half of unit trust sales into unit-linked life products and other life portfolios. Only Pounds 5bn worth of unit trusts were sold directly to the public last year. Official statistics suggest that no more than Pounds 40bn or so in units is directly held by the public. But the sky is the limit. There are some very good reasons to believe that unit trusts could greatly increase their share of the savings market in the next few years. Low short-term interest rates, likely to fall further to five per cent or even less, will cause money to drain out of building society and bank savings accounts. Investors will be looking for more attractive returns, especially from the securities markets. Hard-selling life companies are coming under regulatory pressure, and from 1995 will be required to disclose more clearly their relatively high charges and onerous early cash-in penalties. Unit trusts, which have always had a lower and more transparent charging structure, should benefit. Unit trusts now qualify for one of the most attractive savings tax shelters, the personal equity plan, which is exempt from taxes on both income and capital gain (and they can also be packaged into personal pension plans). Net sales of unit trust PEPs nearly trebled last year and accounted for a third of overall business. The building societies, in particular, are under great competitive pressure at present. Until the past year or so Halifax Building Society on its own - with savings deposits of some Pounds 50bn - was comparable in size to the entire unit trust industry. But in the second half of last year deposits started to drain out of the building societies. Most cheques accompanying application forms, unit trust men say, are drawn on building society accounts. Unit trusts have been slow to develop bond funds, the most direct competitors to building society savings. Such funds, invested in fixed income securities, are the biggest sellers for mutual fund groups in the US. They are the natural first step for savings depositors who want higher income but are unwilling to accept the risks of equity-based funds. One problem in the UK is that pure bond funds are not 'peppable'. But the Hypo F &amp; C product has been an ingenious answer. It is a complicated package, consisting of a unit trust containing a balance of equities and company loans, seasoned with derivatives and presented in a PEP wrapper. It has been widely criticised for being opaque and for being possibly vulnerable to unforeseen market hazards or design faults. But its promise of a near-10 per cent yield has been eagerly welcomed by financial advisers seeking high income for their clients. More traditional unit trusts investing in risky equities have also been booming. In December, for instance, the most popular sectors were UK smaller companies and the Far East excluding Japan. This week Autif's Mr Warland was enthusing over charts projecting a huge increase in the unit trusts' share of the savings market by the year 2000. 'We must make unit trusts more understandable and accessible to the missing 23 1/2m savers.'</p>

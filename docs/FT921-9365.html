			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Index plan to assess council reform A 'COMMUNITY INDEX' to evaluate the intangible costs and benefits of reorganising local government is suggested by advisers preparing the government guidance to be given to the planned local government commission. The commission, charged with the largest review of local government since the present structure was established in 1973, will be set up after the local government bill is enacted in the next few weeks. The report by CSL Group, published yesterday for consultation with local authority associations and the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, looks both at financial costs and benefits and those which are less straightforward. Among intangible effects, ministers have emphasised the need for authorities to have a strong local identity. The report emphasises accessibility, democracy and responsiveness. The four elements cover factors such as physical geography, historical identities, co-ordination of services, high election turnouts and the adverse effect of losing experienced councillors and officers. Each proposal for re-structuring would be judged on how it measured up against the index. While the index is intended to minimise subjectivity in assessing the intangible effects of changes, the report accepts that where financial and non-financial effects point in different directions, decisions will be up to the commission.</p>

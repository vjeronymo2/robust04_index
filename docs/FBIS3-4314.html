			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "The Big Freeze For Women in Job Mart"] </F>   [Text] Zhang Ling recently attended a Beijing job fair  full of optimism.    She was sure she could find a teaching job at a college,  particularly at a time when education is the last choice for  many university graduates.    But Zhang, who holds a master's degree from Beijing Normal  University, was greeted by so many recruiters saying "we only  want men" that she went to a corner at the bustling fair, angry  and frustrated and on the verge of tears.    Zhang is not the only female who feels frozen out of job  markets held for college seniors.    More than half of the posts at the exchanges read "men  only."    Even occupations which are traditionally reserved for women,  such as secretaries and teachers, are being taken by men.    While China's hot economy is demanding well-educated talent,  bosses are ready to reject qualified female applicants.    And the problem is growing worse this year.    One reason is the streamlining of staff in government and  enterprises to improve efficiency.    Also, some employers are reluctant to hire women because  they  think the women cannot go on business trips alone, cannot serve  as business representatives abroad and are less career-minded  once they get married and have children.    Liao Aidong, who majored in textile engineering, an industry  which is not hiring many people this year, said no one responded  to her applications, while male classmates readily secured jobs  in Beijing textile mills.    Even women who graduate with "hot" degrees, such as computer  programming and foreign languages, have to swallow their pride  when men who didn't perform well in school are chosen over them  by employers.    The Beijing Foreign Studies University has 300 graduates  this  year, 60 per cent of whom are women.    Nearly all the male graduates who wanted to stay in Beijing  have signed contracts with employers, while less than half the  women with the same desire have met with success. This is  despite the fact that many of the women at the university do  better on tests than the men.    Some schools are now taking steps to give women an equal  chance.    The Beijing Foreign Studies University, for example, insists  that a woman must be interviewed by a company before a man is  recommended for an interview. Many schools have similar  policies to persuade obstinate employers to hire women.    But according to an official with the University of  International Business and Economics (UIBE), this tactic is  backfiring this year. Many employers are now saying that if  females are forced on them, they'll stop recruiting altogether.    Women at UIBE are told not to compete with men for the best  jobs with the highest salaries or a chance to go abroad,  according to school authorities.    "Girls must lower their expectations," said an official with  UIBE.    But the situation is not always this downbeat. Some  specialty areas are so short of qualified graduates that  employers have no choice but to ignore the gender of applicants.</p>

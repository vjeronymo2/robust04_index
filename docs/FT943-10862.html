			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Tokyo to miss emissions target Japan is unlikely to meet its official target for cutting carbon dioxide emissions, set under a UN treaty which aims to tackle global warming. In a report to be submitted to the UN next month Japan's environmental agency forecasts that carbon dioxide emissions will rise to an annual 330m tonnes by the year 2000, a 3.1 per cent rise from 1990. Japan had agreed at the UN Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992, to cut greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Some industrialised countries, including Germany and Denmark, are now calling for stricter targets, requiring governments to reduce emissions rather than simply stabilising them. The Japanese agency had initially tried to include a carbon dioxide emission tax in its environmental protection bill approved last year, but was forced to remove the clause following pressure from business and the government's own ministry of international trade and industry.</p>

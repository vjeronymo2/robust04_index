			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / SmithKline pays Dollars 2bn for US group: European companies step up transatlantic assault; Kodak to sell drugs division SmithKline Beecham yesterday launched a further European assault on the troubled US drugs industry, offering Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) for Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services. In a separate move, Eastman Kodak of the US is to sell its pharmaceutical division, valued at well over Dollars 5bn, possibly to its French partner Elf Sanofi. Together with Monday's Dollars 5.3bn sale of US drug group Syntex to Roche of Switzerland, this brings the total of US healthcare assets changing hands this week to more than Dollars 12bn. The moves follow acute pressure on the US healthcare industry, partly caused by the Clinton administration's effort to contain costs. European companies are increasingly seeking bargains in troubled sectors of the US economy. Last week the UK tobacco giant BAT Industries paid Dollars 1bn for American Tobacco, in an industry also under pressure from the Clinton administration. SmithKline Beecham is paying cash for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, one of the four largest drug wholesalers in the US. The deal mirrors Merck's Dollars 6.7bn acquisition last year of the leading drug wholesaler Medco, which sent shock waves through the US drug industry. Like Medco, Diversified Pharmaceutical is a so-called pharmaceutical benefit management company, seeking to obtain bulk discounts from the drug companies on behalf of a claimed 11m patients. SmithKline Beecham's chief executive Mr Jan Leschly, who recently described the Merck deal as 'a stroke of genius', said: 'We must evolve from a pharmaceuticals manufacturer selling pills to managing total pharmaceutical care.' He said the deal marked a transition in the company's strategy that reflected the change in the business environment in the US. Rather than simply selling disease treatments, SmithKline Beecham would use economic data gathered from the millions of patients and potential patients on Diversified's books to 'manage diseases'. SmithKline Beecham is the UK's second-biggest drug company after Glaxo. The deal will not increase its drug sales directly, but aims to use Diversified Pharmaceuticals to promote its products to drug buyers in preference to rival drugs. The deal comes a fortnight before the expiry of the US patent on SmithKline's ulcer treatment Tagamet, once the company's biggest product and the world's largest selling drug. US drug buyers have been increasingly swift to switch to generic versions of drugs as soon as patents run out. Mr Leschly said: 'We all know the environment in which we work is changing rapidly . . . Those who fail to adapt will lose.' United Healthcare, owners of Diversified Pharmaceutical, said it had been approached by a number of companies since the Medco deal took place 10 months ago. Mr Leschly said discussions had opened last August. Mr Hugh Collum, SmithKline Beecham's finance director, said the deal was likely to reduce earnings by less than 3 per cent this year and next. The price is equivalent to almost 60 times Diversified's operating profits last year. However, Mr Collum said the purchase was justified by the rapid growth prospects. Although Eastman Kodak did not name a firm buyer for its healthcare business, Elf Sanofi has first refusal on parts of it through joint ventures with the Kodak subsidiary Sterling Winthrop, bought for Dollars 5.1bn in 1988 in an auction against Roche. Elf Sanofi said yesterday the Kodak announcement was 'an opportunity to go the final stage in merging the two businesses', adding that it was considering the sale of assets to finance a possible purchase. Kodak's share price rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 at the close, as the market welcomed its moves to reduce its heavy debt burden. Elf Sanofi's fell FFr43 to FFr975. SmithKline Beecham's share price rose 26p to 416p.

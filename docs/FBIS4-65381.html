			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States is considering alternative ways to  implement the confidence-building measures, not the substance of  the Cyprus issue. In Vienna, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State  Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, and  Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special  representative on Cyprus, are trying hard to find ways to amend  the 21 March UN document, with the goal of persuading the Turks  and Turkish Cypriots to agree to the implementation of the  confidence-building measures.    U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher said clearly: "We  will consider alternative ways if the effort to implement the  confidence-building measures fails."    Boucher questioned the 21 March UN document--although the UN  secretary general and UN Security Council adopted it--and said  the goal is to reach an agreement on the original  confidence-building measures package, exactly as Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas wants.    The U.S. diplomat reiterated that the United States and the  United Nations will make every effort to implement the  confidence-building measures. They are also discussing the  upcoming report that the UN secretary general will submit to the  Security Council.    Boucher said the effort on the confidence-building measures  is not dead and added that "if there is another way to implement  the measures, an effort will be made to find it."    Boucher refrained from commenting on the Vienna talks. But,  according to reliable sources, eight points of the 21 March  document--identified by Lamb during his talks in Nicosia earlier  this month--are being discussed.    Feissel, representing the United Nations, and two  representatives of Denktas are participating in the talks. The  U.S. coordinator and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay  Ulucevic attended the talks as "observers."    Speaking for the Cypriot Government, Foreign Minister Alekos  Mikhailidhis stressed that "there are no prospects for progress  in the Vienna talks."</p>

It knew that the most popular leader and  organization in Pakistan was Benazir Bhutto and her Pakistan  People's Party [PPP]. In any case, be it the U.S. government or  any other Western government, Benazir Bhutto would be their  first preference, because Benazir's philosophy and beliefs fit  perfectly into the framework of their international policies and  the new world order. For example, Benazir is the political  heiress to a family and a father who had impressed the Western  countries by their education, insight, diplomacy, and  cosmopolitan viewpoint. Her father had made the whole third  world his supporter by raising the slogan of a new international  order on the other side. Then, with the discussions about the  nuclear bomb, he had made a soft spot for himself in the whole  Arab world. Now there is a fight. The sister, brother, and the  mother had been benefitting from the soft spot in the heart of  the Arab world for many years. They are still benefitting one  way or the other. It is true that the Arab nations could not  save Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto from hanging, but that was because of  General Ziaul Haq had no other alternative. Both of them were  close to the hangman's noose at that time. Had Ziaul Haq saved  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto from hanging and sent him abroad, he would  have been hanged himself sooner or later. Freeing Bhutto for Zia  meant inviting his own death.    Anyhow, General Zia made a deal that was less harmful to  him.  He knew well that Bhutto's hanging would make him a martyr, and  he also knew that this martyrdom would make the PPP and the  Bhutto family triumphant. General Ziaul Haq was safe behind the  international atmosphere, the flare-up in Afghanistan, and the  swirl of the revolution there. The world powers were forced to  cajole him. Interestingly enough, when the Afghan revolution  after the first phase began to appear pro-Soviet Union and  anti-United States, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto began to give the  impression from jail that communism was spreading and Southeast  Asia was being taken over by communism, and that it was only  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who could save this communist invasion.    We tend to forget history, may it be old or recent. In 1978,  when Afghanistan and the Soviet Union signed their 20-year  friendship agreement, the central executive of the PPP expressed  grave concern over it and passed a resolution at Zulfiqar Ali  Bhutto's insistence. The purpose of this resolution was to  convince the United States that the situation created by the  changes and the revolution in Afghanistan might hurt U.S.  interests, and that if there was anyone who had the fortitude  and courage to stop this process it was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.  Therefore, his release was in the U.S. interest. Bhutto's brain  was working fully even when he was in jail fighting to stay  alive. He was analyzing the foreign politics and changes there  very carefully and wanted the United States to use pressure for  his release. The efforts that Bhutto made all by himself in his  jail cell during that period can be important subject of  research and analysis. However, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was just  unlucky as detailed in the diaries kept by the British High  Commissioner Sir Marlese James. These diaries were published  recently under the title Pakistan Chronicle. The fact is that  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had lost trust at the diplomatic level. The  United States understood well that if it helped Bhutto's release  it would be creating an enemy of America who was very popular.  That is the same fact that has convinced not only Benazir Bhutto  but most of our politicians that the first condition to rule  Pakistan is to get approval from the military and the United  States of America. The United States also needed a popular  leader to help meet its own goals in this region. This need,  according to it, could be best filled by Benazir Bhutto. Thus,  the drama of elections was staged to achieve this goal. The U.S.  administration started to hint about holding elections a year  and a half ago. As soon as armed confrontation started in  Kashmir, the United States got worried about the situation in  this region. For the last two or three years, the way Pakistani  government's under Nawaz Sharif's leadership was trying to make  Kashmir an international issue had forced the United States to  be serious about this issue or at least give the impression of  its being serious to the Pakistani people. At the same time, the  Nawaz Sharif government joined the nuclear issue with the  regional and international politics. Nawaz Sharif's greatest  achievement was to propose the five-nation conference to resolve  the nuclear issue in Pakistan and India. It left India alone and  friendless at international level because four countries were  supporting this conference and only India was against it.    This was the international situation in which the elections  were held. The U.S. government and nonaligned and aligned people  assumed that Benazir Bhutto would emerge as the power. However,  as the adage goes, "I was bathing and the fly was washed away."  It was the most prominent misconception in Pakistani politics  that the PPP has the largest vote bank and Benazir Bhutto is the  most popular leader. However, when the elections were held,  Nawaz Sharif also joined the race. He presented his charismatic  personality ahead of his inexperience and neglectful deeds on  the political chess board. This development has changed the  whole political framework. This situation has puzzled the U.S.  administration and has surrounded Benazir with whirlpool of  problems. Benazir Bhutto and the PPP had thought that they would  be able to force the U.S. point of view on the people using  their popularity. It has begun to appear difficult now. Nawaz  Sharif and his opposition group is fully aware of Benazir and  PPP's helplessness. That is why Nawaz Sharif is talking about  Kashmir and the nuclear program in every breath he takes.    Meanwhile the United States had shown some flexibility and  had tried to convince the people that the U.S. attitude was  changing after Benazir's arrival, and Benazir had also tried to  use this to her advantage. However, when the U.S. government  observed the reaction of the opposition party and the people, it  changed its approach, and began to repeat its old stand of  depriving Pakistan of aid as long as it was suspected of making  nuclear weapons. Although Benazir is emphasizing that she will  not accept any pressure over the nuclear program, her refusal to  open debate on this issue in the National Assembly only  intensifies many suspicions. Saying that the nuclear program  cannot be made a topic of discussion in every street and corner  is childish. There have been demonstrations in Japan against the  nuclear program for months. Why cannot we discuss this issue in  our assembly?</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  HINTS FROM HELOISE: BEST WAY TO AVOID FREEZER BURN  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have had to throw away a whole lot of beef, chicken and pork  pieces because of freezer burn. There is only my husband and me (we're  newlyweds) so I buy meat in bulk, on sale, and freeze it in two serving  portions.  </P> <P> I wrapped the meat in aluminum foil but found holes in the packages I had to  throw away. Evidently a pin hole was enough to cause freezer burn.  </P> <P> My sister uses plastic and claims she never has this problem, but I would think  even plastic can get holes. Is freezer wrap the only thing that is safe for  wrapping meat that is to be frozen?  </P> <P>  -- READER, Arlington, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR READER: If meat is not wrapped correctly before freezing, it will become  freezer-burned. When the meat is exposed through a tear or hole in the  wrapping, it will discolor, losing its flavor and appearance.  </P> <P> To prevent this, always use paper or plastic that is manufactured for wrapping  food to be frozen. Remove as much air as possible from the bag or seal the  paper well.  </P> <P> Never freeze meat in the store package. This wrapping is not airtight or  moisture-proof, and the meat will become freezer-burned rather quickly.  </P> <P> Don't throw away your hard-earned money by having to throw out ruined meat.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Each time I grocery-shop I find myself in a long line at the  checkout stand with some of the shoppers complaining that there is not enough  space between the check stands and the grocery aisles for them to get around  the lines.  </P> <P> I have observed that most shoppers stand behind the shopping cart while waiting  in the checkout line. How simple it would be if each shopper stood on the right  side of the shopping cart while in line to check out so the carts could be  closer together, thereby shortening the line.  </P> <P>  -- F.M., Littleton, Colo.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a double kitchen sink with a very small counter work  space. I keep a dish drainer in one side of the sink, and to increase counter  space I turn the dish drainer upside down and put my chopping board on top of  it.  </P> <P> It provides a great place to chop vegetables and fruit with ever so easy a  cleanup -- just turn on the faucet and send the peelings down the disposal. In  my book, this beats cleaning up a messy counter any time.  </P> <P>  -- BARBARA, Upper Sandusky, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I cover some food dishes with plastic wrap and cook them in the  microwave. More often than not, I end up burning myself from the steam that  escapes when I lift the plastic from the dish after cooking. Do you know of a  remedy?  </P> <P>  -- DOROTHY  </P> <P> DEAR DOROTHY: When placing plastic wrap on a dish that will be cooked in a  microwave, lift back one corner of the plastic wrap slightly to make a vent, to  let the steam escape during the cooking process if the recipe allows it. Also,  a good rule of thumb to remember is to let it sit for a few minutes after  removing from the microwave.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P></p>

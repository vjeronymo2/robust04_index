			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Brokers who fail to deliver the goods - Insurance intermediaries are sharply criticised in a new survey INSURANCE brokers are quick to recommend their services as the best route to obtaining value for money from home and motor policies, as well as good advice and service. But a Consumers' Association (CA) survey, published today, suggests that brokers and other intermediaries rarely deliver on their promises. 'The incompetence of some of the insurance intermediaries was truly alarming,' said Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the CA. 'Breaches of relevant codes were common and flagrant. Too many intermediaries claimed false status, offered inappropriate policies, and refused to answer legitimate questions.' CA conducted the survey by sending anonymous CA researchers to visit a random selection of 82 intermediaries - brokers, who sell policies on behalf of a number of companies - and agents, who sell for a limited number of companies - in six towns - Rotherham, Chichester, Preston, Bolton, Norwich and Hemel Hempstead. Each of the researchers sought advice over the purchase of a home contents insurance policy. Their requirements were standard apart from two factors: an expensive portable computer (not used for business) and a possible absence on holiday of more than 30 days. The conclusions of these interviews show that too 'often, intermediaries were incompetent and ill-informed.' The survey shows that the majority of insurance intermediaries breached 'virtually all the provisions of the codes of practice which supposedly govern the sale of non-life insurance.' Flagrant breaches of the codes of the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade association, and Insurance Brokers Registration Council included the following: Sixty-five of the 82 intermediaries did not disclose the amount of commission they received, even when asked. Many brokers did not state whether they were tied or independent. Some of the insurance sellers 'clearly did not understand the requirement to disclose their status: one even said that he did not know what being tied or independent meant.' Only four intermediaries were able to hand over a full copy of the insurance policy they were selling. Most of the intermediaries surveyed did not appear to have a copy of their policy for their own reference, usually working from rating guides. One intermediary said as he handed over a policy document: 'Will you understand it? We don't' Among other shortcomings highlighted in the report: Intermediaries rarely warned buyers about the consequences of non-disclosure of information. Some 53 intermediaries recommended 'clearly inappropriate' insurance policies. Few intermediaries provided adequate information about policy details. 'In the majority of cases, terms with a distinct meaning under the policy, such as 'valuables', were left undefined . . . information on exclusions was virtually never volunteered . . . researchers were rarely warned of any excess (the part of any claim that the policyholder must pay).' Most intermediaries asked too few questions to establish customers' needs - out of six possible questions (picked from typical proposal forms), 50 intermediaries asked questions in only one or two categories. 'It is therefore hardly surprising that whether policies were suitable (eg in terms of having few exclusions that would be a problem for the customer) appears to have been a matter of chance,' says the CA. Concluding, the CA report pulls no punches. It says that although the insurance market is highly competitive, individual consumers are poorly placed to benefit without good information and good advice. 'At the moment, in too many cases, they are receiving neither, and instead are burdened with the costs of being sold unsuitable products,' it says.</p>

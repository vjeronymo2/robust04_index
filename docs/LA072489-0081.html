			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRESCHOOL TEACHERS FALL INTO AN O.C. PAY GAP  </P> <P> Child-care centers in Orange County are finding it more difficult to attract  and keep qualified preschool teachers as salaries continue to hover near the  minimum wage and benefits are largely non-existent, according to industry  specialists.  </P> <P> "Wages and benefits are the sleeper issues that will put the brakes on day  care," said Betsy Mathis, a child-care consultant and former head of Irvine's  municipal child-care committee. "The joke is that it is better to take a job at  McDonald's. It is a tremendous problem."  </P> <P> According to the state's Employment Development Department, there were 3,799  day-care workers and preschool teachers in the county in 1987. Pay for day-care  teachers and workers ranges from $5 to $12 per hour, and many teachers with  bachelor degrees in early childhood development are forced to work for $6 to $8  per hour, which is $12,480 to $16,640 per year.  </P> <P> "The shortage has become really critical the last two or three years," said  Nancy Claxton, who runs the child development program of the county's  Department of Education. "It used to be when I had a teacher opening, I might  get 50 to 60 applications. Now I might get five applicants."  </P> <P> Officials said part of the problem is the strong county economy and low  unemployment rate. They said many choose not to enter the field because they  know that pay is low and few positions offer benefit packages found elsewhere.  </P> <P> Last year, the average full-time weekly pay of child-care workers nationally  was $187, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- less than  $4.68 an hour. For preschool teachers and kindergarten teachers it was $321  (about $8 an hour), while elementary-school teachers made $481 (about $12 an  hour) and high-school teachers made $521 (about $13 an hour).  </P> <P> Benefits, such as Social Security and work breaks, rarely go beyond what is  required by law. Health coverage is rare.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subsidizing Profession Women  </P> <P> Experts said child-care workers are subsidizing other professional women. "What  it really boils down to is, one group of women is virtually forced to exploit  another group of women," Claxton said.  </P> <P> "We have young people who have prepared to work with young children and have 12  units (of college courses) to a bachelor's (degree) who are leaving the field  because they cannot afford to stay."  </P> <P> For example, Mary Flaczinski, a teacher at the Irvine Child Development Center,  said she especially likes to deal with infants and toddlers. But now she and  her husband have decided that she needs a job that provides medical coverage  for their family.  </P> <P> "I'll probably look for a job," she said, "at a grocery store or a bank. . . .  It is very upsetting to leave because of economic reasons."  </P> <P> Even the UC Irvine child-care program -- which can afford to pay lead teachers  $1,600 per month, a very high salary in the field, and offers unmatched  benefits -- has had teachers leave for better-paying clerical jobs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 42% U.S. Turnover Rate  </P> <P> According to the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children, the  turnover rate for child-care workers is 42%.  </P> <P> Dan Wollent, a spokesman for Kinder-Care -- the nation's largest profit-making  day-care chain, which operates 18 centers in the county -- said the turnover  rate in day care is comparable to the rate in the fast-food industry.  </P> <P> "We can't pay much because we are trying to offer the parent the lowest  prices," Wollent said.  </P> <P> In addition, the shortage of qualified teachers has led to competition among  child-care centers. This market mechanism plays havoc with the lives of young  children, who thrive on stability, said Karen Bocard, head of child care at UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> "Children must bond with their care-giver," she said. "If their care-giver  changes one, two or three times in a year, then the child is not able to bond  and is not able to feel secure in the environment."  </P> <P> Unless salaries improve, there is the fear that fewer and fewer people will  enter the child-care profession or make a long-term commitment, said Mathis,  the former chief of Irvine's day-care panel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warmth 'Is a Gift'  </P> <P> She emphasized that the quality of a day-care program is directly linked with  the quality of its staff: "There is an amorphous quality when you walk into a  center. You can feel the staff that relates to the kids. It's a gift . . . the  warmth of how they speak or move the groups of children around."  </P> <P> The best preschools offer children, especially 3- and 4-year-olds, a continual  kaleidoscope of experiences difficult for parents to match at home. Child-care  professionals continue to struggle against the idea that anyone can provide  effective day care and that staff members are merely baby-sitters.  </P> <P> "It is a very difficult job," said Roberta Berns, head of the human development  department at Saddleback College, "because it requires knowledge of child  development, and children of the same age are not necessarily at the same point  of development. . . . You have to keep changing your style of interaction."  </P> <P> Orange County Assn. for the Education of Young Children surveyed all child-care  centers in the county in 1988 and found that 41% of teachers and directors have  bachelor degrees. Also, 22% had graduate degrees or had done graduate work.  Almost 70% had at least one year of college.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Next-Best Paying  </P> <P> After the college-based programs, the day-care centers in the county offering  the best salary and benefit packages are those run by the county's Department  of Education and the Garden Grove Unified and Fullerton Unified school  districts.  </P> <P> Many of their teachers are members of the California Teachers Assn., which  represents teachers in labor negotiations. "The pay is not quite equal to  elementary teacher pay, but the benefits are equal," said Claxton, the director  of the county's Department of Education child development program.  </P> <P> A national Louis Harris poll taken in April found that 73% of Americans were  willing to increase their taxes to pay for child care. Nine of 10 surveyed were  concerned about day-care staff being underpaid.  </P> <P> At the federal level, President Bush has proposed a child-care tax credit of up  to $1,000 per year for low-income parents, while Democrats in Congress have  countered with the Act for Better Child Care, the so-called "ABC Bill" that  would provide money for salaries and training of day-care teachers and urge  states to set standards for child-care centers. (California already has  standards for child-care centers.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demand in County to Climb  </P> <P> In Orange County, officials said the demand for child care is certain to  increase.  </P> <P> According to county officials, the number of children in the county is expected  to increase by 11% in the next decade. In 1984, nearly half the children under  5 years old in the county had working mothers, according to the Orange County  Commission on the Status of Women.  </P> <P> "Everyone is building facilities," said Bocard, UCI's head of child care. "But  where is the staff going to come from?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preschool Children With Mother In The Labor Force 1970-1995  </P> <P> The tremendous growth in child care and early education sservices that has  occurrd over the lastdecade is expected to continue.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters, including the AOPA and the AOPA Air Safety Foundation, indicate that while they agree with the proposal to amend the specific number of hours of instruction that holders of flight instructor certificates must complete in an approved FIRC to renew their certificates, they believe that 16 hours should be the minimum number of hours in an approved FIRC and that this minimum requirement should be written into the rule to avoid any misinterpretation. The FAA has determined that instructional technology and training techniques will continue to change and develop over time. Therefore, the FAA has concluded that the appropriate response is not to state the specific number of hours in the rule, which may change over time, but to address the standards and recommended number of hours required for an approved FIRC through an Advisory Circular that the FAA will develop to ensure that a high level of safety is maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hoffman Pilot Center, Inc. and one other commenter are opposed to reducing the number of hours currently required in an approved FIRC. Hoffman believes that reducing the number of required hours in an approved FIRC to 16 hours is a marketing ploy rather than an accurate accounting for the changing information in the aviation industry. The other commenter believes the current 24-hour requirement is inadequate and that by going to a reduced number of hours in an approved FIRC would only serve to make the entire FIRC class ``one large video program.'' The FAA has determined that reducing the amount of hours that holders of flight instructor certificates must complete in an approved FIRC to renew their certificates will not have an adverse effect on safety. The FAA has concluded that the recent advances in instructional technology and training techniques allow for a reduction in the specific number of hours in an approved FIRC while maintaining the current level of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Cost Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter feels that the FAA overestimated the value of flight instructor time; in the economic evaluation the FAA assumed that a flight instructor earned approximately $20 per hour, the commenter believes it is more like $11 per hour. The FAA has determined that while some flight instructors earn $11 per hour, other flight instructors earn $35 per hour. The FAA has concluded that on the average a flight instructor earns $20 per hour and that this is a reasonable number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Richmor Aviation and one other commenter agree with the proposal to allow for approval of the number of hours of instruction that holders of flight instructor certificates must complete in an FAA approved FIRC to renew their certificate but points out that a parallel provision in &sect;141.79(c) also needs to be amended to be consistent with &sect;61.197(c). Section 141.79(c) requires each chief flight instructor in an approved FAA part 141 school, to complete at least once each 12 months, a flight instructor refresher course consisting of not less than 24 hours of ground or flight instruction, or both. While &sect;141.79(c) deals with a school setting as opposed to &sect;61.197(c), which deals with the individual, the FAA has determined that it is a parallel provision with identical issues as those presented in Notice No. 93&hyph;11. Therefore, to afford part 141 chief flight instructors the benefits given to part 61 flight instructors, the FAA will make a conforming amendment to &sect;141.79(c) that will be reflected in this final rule. The FAA has concluded that under Section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 553(a), the notice and public comment requirements of Section 553(b) of the APA are unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: BNL finds itself back under the spotlight - Haig Simonian reports on the surprise decision by the Italian bank's chief to step down Italy's treasury-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro shot back into the headlines this month after its chairman, Mr Giampiero Cantoni, decided to step down temporarily. Mr Cantoni was brought in to remove the bank from the limelight in 1989 when revelations about Dollars 4bn in unauthorised loans to Iraq from its Atlanta branch triggered an international outcry. BNL has maintained a fairly low profile since then. Apart from a flurry during the 1991 collapse of the Federconsorzi farm services group, the new management, under Mr Cantoni, has steered a reasonable recovery at the once scandal-ridden bank. Parent company figures for 1993, revealed yesterday, showed a 68 per cent surge in gross operating profits to L1,527bn (Dollars 911m), confirming the bank's continuing recovery since the Atlanta affair. However, Mr Cantoni's decision last week to step down temporarily has catapulted the bank back on to the front pages. Although he stressed the move was for personal reasons - Mr Cantoni is being investigated about alleged bribes to accelerate planning procedures in a Milan suburb where his family engaged in property speculation - matters have become more complicated. BNL has also attracted the attention of Bank of Italy inspectors looking into loans made to the now-bankrupt Mandelli robotics group. Among the companies Mandelli bought in the rapid expansion which largely accounts for its plight, is a concern in which Mr Cantoni had a substantial interest. Although the Bank of Italy has not yet reached formal conclusions, the fact that BNL's chairman potentially faced a conflict of interest in approving big credits to Mandelli has not helped the bank's reputation. Matters worsened this week after leaks about other potentially questionable lending by Efibanca, the bank's long-term industrial lending subsidiary. to entrepreneurs, some now in financial difficulties and closely associated with the now-discredited Socialist party. Although Efibanca has rejected most of the claims, politically-influenced lending is nothing new in Italian banking, where the majority of banks are state-owned. BNL is a Socialist stronghold, while Mr Cantoni is close to the party's former leaders. Whatever the facts, the mere suggestion the bank may be heavily exposed to entrepreneurs linked to the Socialists is highly unwelcome now attention in Italy's mushrooming political corruption scandal has shifted to the banking world. The latest mishaps have led to calls for a management shake-up. BNL's unions this week demanded a 'clarification' of the bank's policies. The upsets have also refocused attention on its deeper structural problems. BNL has for some years been under-capitalised. A November 1992 treasury paper outlining the government's privatisation plans estimated it needed at least L2,000bn to improve its capital ratios. The treasury has done little to resolve the problem. Last week, Mr Mario Draghi, the treasury's director general, acknowledged money had to be pumped into BNL but he would not say when that might happen. One solution would have been to merge with a better-capitalised state bank. The two candidates frequently cited were Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the profitable financial services group, and Artigiancassa, a well-capitalised specialised lender. However, neither option is now on the cards. IMI has been privatised this month, while a marriage with Artigiancassa appears to have been eliminated. Even the idea of merging with Milan's Banca Commerciale Italiana - always less likely - is no longer available because BCI is next on the privatisation list. BNL's latest problems means it will have to repolish its image and further improve earnings before the treasury can think seriously of such options - let alone privatisation. Yet the need to find a solution is pressing given the bank's size and status as the the primary bank for the Italian state and public administration. Another management shake-up seems virtually certain. However, matters are complicated by the fact that Mr Cantoni has not resigned, although he will not seek a further term after his contract expires later this year. That may be too late for the treasury, which seems determined to impose new management. The changes may also involve Mr Davide Croff and Mr Umberto d'Addosio, BNL's two managing directors, who are under fire for not controlling the bank more stringent-ly. But any changes will not take place quickly. Finding replacements for Mr Cantoni and the two managing directors could be difficult given the need for executives combining both proven integrity with strong experience in Italian finance and a willingness to take on the challenge of running BNL. Any management changes will probably be accompanied by a slimming down of its bloated 19-member board to reflect similar changes at other big treasury-controlled companies. BNL has to observe a 45-day notice period before it can call the extraordinary general meeting necessary to approve a cut in its board of directors. That means the move will only come after Italy's general elections next month, which may confuse matters further.</p>

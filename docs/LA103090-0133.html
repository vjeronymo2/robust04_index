			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW FALLS 5.94 DESPITE UPBEAT BUDGET NEWS  </P> <P> Stocks fell Monday as concern over the Persian Gulf crisis and weaker bond  prices outweighed optimism over the budget package and expected lower interest  rates.  </P> <P> The battered banking group once again suffered some of the day's most notable  losses, even as the Federal Reserve apparently eased credit slightly.  </P> <P> Blue chips slid for the third session in a row, with the Dow Jones industrial  index closing down 5.94 points at 2,430.20. The 30-share index has fallen 74.01  points since last Thursday.  </P> <P> The broad market also took a hit, with declining issues outnumbering advances  by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. There were 486 issues up,  1,037 down and 451 unchanged. Big Board volume was 133.98 million shares, up  from Friday's 130.19 million.  </P> <P> The $500-billion deficit-reduction package, finally approved by Congress after  five months of wrangling, was positive, but "everyone expected it, so it was a  non-event," said Jeffrey Kaminsky, Mabon Nugent's director of institutional  sales.  </P> <P> The market took numerous turns throughout the day, with the Dow up more than 20  points and down more than 20 points at various times. The seesawing suggests  investors have no conviction, and that patience overall is wearing thin, some  analysts say.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * It was just another bloody day for financial stocks of all kinds as investors  again showed that they see serious problems ahead for the banking system. The  pessimism was undaunted even as the Federal Reserve poured money into the  system, letting interest rates fall.  </P> <P> The Standard &amp; Poor's financial stock index plunged 2.7% for the day. Wells  Fargo led the banks lower, falling 2 3/4 to 45 1/8. Security Pacific dropped  7/8 to 17 3/4, a new 52-week low. First Interstate lost 1 to 17 1/8, also a new  52-week low.  </P> <P> Other losers included Mellon Bank, off 7/8 to 18 1/8, Banc One, down 1 1/4 to  19 1/4 and Bank of New York, down 1 5/8 to 14 1/2.  </P> <P> * Among the S&amp;Ls, CalFed plunged 7/8 to 3, a loss of 23%. Ahmanson fell 1/2  to 11 1/2 and Glenfed dropped 5/8 to 6 1/8. Home builders also were weak,  including J. M. Peters, off 5/8 to 1 5/8.  </P> <P> * Brokerages and insurers tumbled with the banks. CNA Financial dropped 2 7/8  to 50 3/8, Aetna lost 1 to 30, Merrill Lynch fell 7/8 to 16 3/4 and Paine  Webber slumped 1/2 to 11 7/8.  </P> <P> * Media and entertainment stocks were particularly weak. Disney lost 2 1/8 to  90 7/8, Time Warner fell 2 5/8 to 69 1/4, Times Mirror dropped 1 1/4 to 21 3/4  and Knight Ridder fell 5/8 to 37. Viacom class B lost 1 3/8 to 14 3/8 after the  company said its quarterly profit did not indicate a long-term turnaround.  </P> <P> Playboy class A lost 1 1/8 to 3 1/4 on word that a major investor was  liquidating his position.  </P> <P> * Profit taking was heavy in health-care stocks. Lilly fell 1 7/8 to 71 1/8,  Abbott dropped 1 5/8 to 41 1/4, Humana lost 1 1/4 to 42 1/4, and Amgen gave up  1 1/8 to 44 5/8.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks closed higher, with buying of cash indexes by futures arbitragers  accounting for the bulk of the day's gains. The key 225-share Nikkei index rose  323.67 points, or 1.3%, to 25,329.31.  </P> <P> German share prices dived at the opening on Gulf fears and reports of weak  earnings at Volkswagen and Deutsche Bank. But they drifted higher on  bargain-hunting later. The 30-share DAX index ended 2.56 points lower at  1,454.49.  </P> <P> Stocks finished mixed after light trading in London. The Financial Times-Stock  Exchange 100-share index lost 1 point to 2,062.1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Fear of Bond Glut Offsets Fed Easing  </P> <P> Bond prices fell sharply as traders shrugged off an apparent easing of credit  by the Federal Reserve and focused on what they feared would be an oversupply  of Treasury issues.  </P> <P> The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 5/8 point, or about  $6.25 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield surged to 8.83% from 8.77% late  Friday.  </P> <P> Analysts said the market was anticipating a Fed move on rates after the weekend  passage of the federal budget package. The Fed had made an easing of credit  contingent on the measure's passage.  </P> <P> The Fed move was apparent in a fall in the federal funds rate -- the rate banks  charge each other for overnight loans -- to 7.75% from about 8% Friday. The Fed  directly influences that rate as it pumps money into the system or drains it.  </P> <P> But analysts said the Fed action was such an anticlimax that it failed to move  the market. Scott Winningham, a bond analyst with Stone &amp; McCarthy  Research, said the market was more concerned about supply.  </P> <P> The Treasury will announce later this week how many bonds it will be selling in  its quarterly refunding auction, scheduled for next week. The government's  borrowing needs are expected to be near record levels. If too many bonds are  available, their prices will have to drop to attract buyers, and interest rates  will jump.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Ends Mostly Higher in Dull Day  </P> <P> The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets, but traders said  dealings were dull.  </P> <P> Traders said that, despite the advance, the dollar remained within its current  trading range. With no fresh news to direct trading, "there was no reason to  sell and no reason to buy," said Robert Ryan, a trader at Bank of New York.  </P> <P> In New York, the dollar closed at 1.522 German marks, up from Friday's 1.513.  It rose to 128.65 Japanese yen from 128.25 Friday. The British pound fell to  $1.949 from Friday's $1.956.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Oil Prices Rise as Peace Hopes Fade  </P> <P> Oil prices shot up more than $1 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  as traders expressed concern over the apparent failure of Soviet diplomatic  efforts in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark West Texas crude for  December delivery ended the day up $1.67 over Friday at $34.68 a barrel.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, hog and pork belly futures plunged their daily  limits, copper retreated and grains and soybeans were mixed.  </P> <P> On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures ended $2.10 to $2.80 higher,  with October at $373.70 an ounce. October silver jumped 7.7 cents to $4.13 an  ounce.  </P> <P> Market Roundup, D10  </P></p>

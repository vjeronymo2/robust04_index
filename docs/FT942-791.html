			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Venezuela imposes controls Venezuela's President Rafael Caldera last night announced a series of measures that include controls on foreign exchange transactions, new price controls covering mass consumption goods and special payments to workers to help offset inflation. Mr Caldera, who took office in February, also said that his government would suspend 'constitutional rights.' It was not immediately clear if this suspension covered civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, or only rights associated with freedom of economic activity. He said his administration was forced to adopt exchange controls by waves of 'rumours and speculation' that sharply drove down the value of the country's currency in recent months. Venezuela removed exchange controls in 1989 when the last government initiated market-oriented reforms. These reforms, however, have generally been discontinued by the Caldera government. Mr Caldera asserted that the new measures would not be a drag on private investment.</p>

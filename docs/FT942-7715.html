			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Exports help Kenwood rise 14% to Pounds 11m Higher sales, continued cost control and improved results from overseas subsidiaries were behind a 14.5 per cent rise in annual profits at Kenwood Appliances, the household appliance maker which was floated in June 1992. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March rose from a pro forma Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 11m, after Pounds 700,000 of exceptional charges. Turnover increased by 19 per cent from Pounds 101.6m to Pounds 120.4m. 'We see these as very good results,' said Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, adding: 'We can't see how things can be anything but better this year.' Sales in the UK, its single biggest market, rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 41.2m. The company had 94 per cent of the UK tabletop food mixer market. Waymaster, the water filter and kitchen scales maker acquired for Pounds 4.3m last October, contributed Pounds 524,000 to profits in the last five months of the year, and is expected to bring in Pounds 1.5m this time. The Hampshire-based group, which last month won a Queen's Award for Exports, increased sales to continental Europe from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 44m, and to the rest of the world from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 35.1m. Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 6.6m, and is expected to reach a total of Pounds 9m this year. Mr Parker said the group was continuing to look for further opportunities to expand. Earnings rose to 20.8p (17.8p). A final dividend of 6p brings the total to 9p (7.8p). The shares rose 3p to 348p. COMMENT The results show solid progress on the back of sound acquisitions, and there seems no reason why the maker of the Kenwood Chef mixer should not continue to grow. It needs to be careful to protect the quality image of its single brand when selling lower margin goods like kettles and toasters, where competition is intense. Overseas distribution is being sorted out, particularly in Germany, where the group has been severely underexposed. With profits of Pounds 13.5m pencilled in for this year, the shares look good value on a p/e of 13.5.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Pause for breath in technical rally THE TECHNICAL rally in the UK stock market was taken a stage further yesterday, still encouraged by sterling's firmness and by a steady performance from Wall Street. But some doubts crept in when both the FT-SE Index and the stock index future contract failed to move above levels regarded by equity chart analysts as important testing points. The Footsie recovered another 28.7 points of Monday's 103 point loss, to close at 2,517.1. Trading volume increased, boosted by a 26.5m share placing in Anglian Water and the market buzzed with hints that City offices were alert and that a number of corporate deals were about to be launched. The Pounds 780m cash bid from Hanson for Ranks Hovis McDougall, followed by takeover activity in the leisure sector, has re-alerted traders to the attractions of UK stocks to predators, especially from overseas bidders which have the additional benefit of sterling's effective devaluation. Dealers believed yesterday that a German group may be about to take a hand in the speculative interest in Owners Abroad. Many of the long-identified bid targets on the Footsie list found themselves in the frame again yesterday, and speculators were also looking at stocks just below the market's top 100 stocks. However, with the UK Conservative government coming under fire at its annual conference, which will be addressed today by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, the big investment institutions remained unwilling to chase shares too vigorously until official strategies on sterling and interest rates become more clear. Equities benefited from a firmer tone in stock index futures but the Footsie topped out at mid-session after moving to within four points of 2,530, identified by Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon, the UK broker, as the level at which either the technical recovery will peter out or the market will stage a renewed advance. Seaq volume of 545m shares compared with 467.1m on Tuesday. More significantly, stock exchange data showed that retail or customer business remained low on Tuesday, with the Pounds 811.5m value figure disappointingly below the Pounds 1.2bn plus totals recorded daily since sterling quit the ERM, and the stock market sensed that UK interest rates could be reduced. Confidence in further cuts in domestic interest rates before the end of the year remained strong enough to support shares in the consumer and retail sectors. But shares in those sectors advanced only modestly and investors sought out bargains rather than chasing prices higher. The best gains came among the blue chip sectors, although support was very selective, and no longer based merely on currency considerations. Glaxo, out of favour with UK investors recently, found renewed support from the US, although interest died away at the close as trade in New York appeared subdued. The chemical sector was unsettled by bearish reports from a presentation to analysts in London by the chemical division of Shell.</p>

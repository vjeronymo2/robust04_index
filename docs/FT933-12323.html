			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: Buffeted equities emerge unscathed again - Wall Street ONCE AGAIN, the stock markets have been buffeted by the rapidly shifting winds of corporate earnings, economic fundamentals, monetary policy and bond price movements and, once again, they have emerged unscathed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average even managed to set a record high during the week when it closed at 3,555.40 on Wednesday. That achievement, however, was marred by the failure of other indices to match its performance. On the same day the Dow peaked, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite and the American Stock Exchange composite all fell - an indication that the buying which lifted the Dow into previously unexplored territory was limited to a few leading stocks. There was a further qualification to Wednesday's record-breaking gains: they were achieved in the final minutes of business on the back of a series of late computer program trades. And the fact that prices dropped sharply on Thursday suggested that investors viewed the markets' breakthrough as an opportunity to profits, not celebrate. By midday yesterday, stocks were about back where they started the week. Clearly, the equity markets remain trapped in a trading range between 3,450 and 3,550 on the Dow and, barring a big move from the Federal Reserve on monetary policy or a dramatic shift in bond yields, they will probably stay in that range for the rest of the summer. The performance of corporate America appears unlikely to break the pattern, although a cluster of surprisingly bullish second-quarter earnings' reports were disclosed this week. There were strong showings from a wide variety of industry groupings, including Sears, Roebuck (retailers); American and Delta (airlines); Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Salomon and Primerica (banks and financial services groups); Texaco and Exxon (oil companies); Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas (defence and aviation contractors; and SmithKline Beecham, Schering-Plough and Merck (pharmaceuticals companies). A large part of the quarterly reporting season is now out of the way, although IBM has yet to announce its earnings. (This week, IBM shares dropped to their lowest since 1975 as investors anticipated that the computer group would announce further job cuts when it publishes its results next week). For a couple of reasons, though, the latest batch of good earnings news had little positive impact upon the markets as a whole. First, the latest quarterly results represent snapshots of past performance. Investors are much more interested in the future, and how well corporate profits will hold up during what could be a sustained period of weak economic growth. Second, with markets at or near record highs, many stocks are looking expensive and strong earnings are priced into share values already. If corporate profitability is not greatly influencing equity markets, then what is? The answer: interest rates and bond prices, the same factors that have dominated stock market sentiment for the best part of a year. Share prices are hovering around record highs because interest rates and bond yields are hovering near record lows. Yet, share prices are struggling to break from a narrow trading range and move any higher because many investors fear that interest rates and bond yields may have bottomed. These fears were not soothed by this week's comments from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. In his semi-annual Humphrey Hawkins address to Congress, he made a series of statements about inflation, the economic outlook and interest rates that unsettled the bond market and further rattled equity investors' already frazzled nerves. There was nothing particularly new or shocking in what he said. He indicated he was ready to raise interest rates at any time if warranted by inflation, although he remained cautious about the inflation outlook in spite of welcome improvements in recent consumer and producer price data. In ordinary times, the bond and stock markets might have taken Greenspan's remarks in their stride. But these are not ordinary times. Bond yields are at record lows, share prices are near record highs, and investors are quick to sell at the first hint of higher interest rates. There is little doubt that rates will be raised sometime within the next six to 12 months. In an accurate, but not particularly helpful, phrase, Greenspan said on Thursday that a tightening of monetary policy was 'somewhere out there.' The only question is: can corporate profitability and economic growth improve sufficiently quickly so that, when a rate rise comes, the stock markets will be strong enough to take it on the chin and stay upright? Monday     3535.28 +  6.99 Tuesday    3544.78 +  9.50 Wednesday  3555.40 + 10.62 Thursday   3525.22 + 30.18 Friday     3546.74 + 21.52</p>

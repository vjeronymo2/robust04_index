			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Management exercise cuts the council sick list: Reduced absenteeism in London boroughs THE NUMBER of days council workers in London take off sick has fallen by a third in the past year, following an investigation by the Audit Commission, the public-sector efficiency watchdog. A critical study by the commission, published in 1990, found sickness absence averaged more than two-and-a-half times the national norm in the 10 London councils studied in detail. The cost was calculated at Pounds 25 for each ratepayer. The commission's follow-up report, published today, finds that local authorities have succeeded in cutting days off from an annual average of 16.7 days per employee in 1990 to 11.5 days in 1991-92. The study says the saving is the equivalent of Pounds 1.5m for each council. Hammersmith and Fulham, and Camden councils have both halved sickness levels  -in Camden's case releasing Pounds 2.4m of additional resources - while Brent has generated more than Pounds 3m, the commission found. The public sector in general has a poorer record on absenteeism than the private sector and these differences are accentuated in London, a Confederation of British Industry survey showed earlier this year. Across all sectors, workers take an average of eight days off a year, although there are large differences between blue-collar and white-collar workers. The CBI found non-manual workers take five to six days, while manual employees take an average of 10 days. In spite of councils' relatively poor record, the sharp reductions achieved over the past year by the London boroughs studied by the Audit Commission are relevant to all organisations which are attempting to cut absenteeism. Evidence that the subject is one of growing interest across sectors came earlier this week, with the findings of a survey of personnel managers in 500 organisations conducted by Personnel Today magazine. While just 9 per cent of companies had so far made cuts in sick-pay schemes, nearly 20 per cent were considering doing so in the next year or two. Cutting sick pay is a very direct, if crude, method of attempting to control absenteeism or, at least, minimise its financial effects. The Audit Commission sets out how the improvements in the London boroughs have been achieved, within a framework of five principles identified as essential to the successful cutting of absenteeism: Commitment by senior management: Half the councils had set quantifiable targets for overall absence levels. Clear responsibilities: Most of the councils had started to make line managers more directly responsible for controlling absence. Appropriate information: Almost all the councils had introduced monthly or quarterly reporting of absence levels. Computerised information systems played an important part, the Audit Commission found. Suitably-trained managers: Most councils had introduced training for supervisors and line managers in controlling absence and two had produced handbooks on procedures. Attention to staff welfare: Improvements in occupational health services were considered by some of the councils to have been one of the factors that had the greatest impact on reducing absenteeism.

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / London Forum seeks backing LONDON FORUM, the private-sector initiative launched earlier in the year to promote London, will ask ministers next month to back efforts to promote inward investment into the capital with government funds. A feasibility study on the potential for a 'First-Stop Shop' has been carried out for the City Corporation - the local authority for the City of London, the capital's business district - by Jones Lang Wootton, the estate agents. This found that other European cities such as Frankfurt and Paris have central organisations for promotion to inward investors, with budgets of several million pounds a year. Representatives of London Forum will meet Sir George Young, inner cities minister, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to discuss funding a First-Stop Shop which would provide a showcase for inward investors thinking of locating in London. The shop would provide information about all aspects of London, including office accommodation, transport and living conditions. The post of chief executive is likely to be advertised soon.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IBM, BAXTER FORM VENTURE TO TAP HEALTH-CARE MARKET  </P> <P> The world's dominant computer firm and the nation's largest hospital supply  concern said Thursday that they would join forces to develop computer products  and services for the rapidly growing health-care information management market.  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp. and Baxter International Inc. said they  will form a joint venture information management company that will serve all  segments of the health-care industry. The new company, a 50-50 partnership  between IBM and Baxter, will employ 800 when it becomes operational.  </P> <P> The joint venture will sell products and services to hospitals of all sizes as  well as to individual doctors and group practices, said Scott Roeth, director  of health industries at Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM. "We will have services for  financial applications and clinical applications of health care," he added.  These software products would, for example, manage hospital billing and  patient-care records.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $11-Billion Market  </P> <P> The joint venture is expected to be in place by the end of the year to compete  in the $11-billion worldwide market for health-care-related computer products  and services. The companies declined to disclose financial terms of the  transaction.  </P> <P> Both IBM and Baxter currently provide a range of computer products and services  to the health-care industry. Baxter, based in Deerfield, Ill., said it will  spin off its Systems and Annson Systems divisions into the new partnership.  </P> <P> IBM said certain of its health-care software products and development projects  will also be transferred to the Long Island, N.Y.-based joint venture, as well  as a small number of IBM employees.  </P> <P> The joint venture will take over the software applications portion of an  ongoing IBM project to develop an integrated bedside workstation for nurses,  Roeth said. "We have a great interest in the nursing area," he said. The goal  of the project is to provide nurses immediate access to patient records,  allowing them to update those computer records at the bedside. "We want to  automate as much as we can for the nurse at bedside," he added.  </P></p>

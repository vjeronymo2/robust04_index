			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has been  interviewed by the information agency POSTFACTUM. The interview  raised issues of dual citizenship and the language policy of our  republic, prospects for integration processes in the CIS, the  forthcoming elections to the parliament of Kazakhstan, and the  personnel policy at the highest echelons of power. [Words  indistinct] all Kazakhstanis are interested in the president's  position on these issues. KAZTAG, having received this  information through its own channels, presents it to the wide  circle of readers.    If the Russian-speaking community in Kazakhstan does not  have  any problems, then why does the republic refuse to adopt a law  on dual citizenship -- especially as Russia does not want to  abandon its intention?    Our Constitution does not allow dual citizenship, said the  president. But this is not what concerns people. In 10 months,  154,000 Russians arrived in Kazakhstan, including 54,000 from  Central Asia. There are those who are leaving the country. At  present, migration has increased by [words indistinct] of  Kazakhstan. This year, 300,000 of them left the country. The  balance is not in our favor. But if we take the embassies of  the United States, Israel, and other Western countries --  citizens of Russia queue there for exit visas and leave the  country forever. Why don't we talk about this? To use  emigration as an argument is political populism.    People are worried about a different thing. I have been told  the following -- during the time of the present policy, which is  pursued by Nazarbayev -- there is no reason for us [Russians] to  worry. But we [Russians] should think about the future of our  children. I do understand these people and therefore, by my  statute, several amendments to the Constitution have been made.  In particular, the original version says that the closest  relations of Kazakhstanis wishing to move [word indistinct] have  to wait from five to 10 years for citizenship. At present, the  documents for getting citizenship should not be examined for  more than six months. Apart from this the term during which  Kazakhstanis should make up their mind with regard to  citizenship, is extended until 1 March.    By the way, said Nazarbayev, I have sent to Boris Yeltsin  and  Viktor Chernomyrdin a draft agreement on the main principles for  obtaining citizenship in Kazakhstan and Russia. I think we will  sign it.    In accordance with this document, the negotiating sides  pledge to urgently adopt relevant legislature that will simplify  the procedure for obtaining citizenship both by Kazakhs and  Russians. Their applications should be examined for no longer  than six months from the day of submission [words indistinct].  I believe that this agreement will eliminate all problems.  There is nothing there to divide Russians and Kazakhs.    Journalists displayed interest in the issue of the second  language. [passage omitted]    Our Constitution enshrines that Russian is the language for  interethnic communication, noted Nazarbayev. The main law  clearly stipulates that the language for interethnic  comminication is used along with the state language. [passage  omitted]    Kazakh, the language of 8 million people, is on the brink of  extinction. Due to this we have been forced to elevate it to  the status of the state language. Russians themselves spoke  about the need for that. [passage omitted]    POSTFACTUM asked President Nazarbayev to touch on the issue  of international integration.    You know, I believe in prosperity through unification and  not  disintegration, said the president. Well I have not succeeded  in maintaining the ruble zone. There is nothing we can do about  it. We are not to be blamed for this. As an economist, I  understand the Russian side but as a politician, I do not. The  strategic loss of the ruble zone is Russia's loss. [passage  omitted] By the way, said Nazarbayev, a draft of an economic  union agreement belongs to Kazakhstan, a draft of the defense  union has been submitted by Kazakhstan. A proposal to eliminate  inter-state barriers has been put forward by Kazakhstan. You  cannot lay any claims. This is my position -- useful contacts  should not be disrupted.    Have you ever been reprimanded for a pro-Russian policy?    Yes, he admits. We do have our own nationalists.  Fortunately there are not many of them. [passage omitted]    We are wrongly accused for pumping resources out of Russia.  We have been told that in the old days, without Russia we would  not survive. Now we neither depend on Russia for power supplies  or for food. On the contrary, Russia owes more to Kazakhstan  than Kazakhstan to Russia. [passage omitted]    Does Kazakhstan intend to take into consideration the  Russian  experience in elections?    Naturally we are going to take into consideration the  experience of Russia, said the president. But we have a  slightly different situation from Russia. [passage omitted]    During the news conference, journalists asked him about a  rumor that is circulating in Kazakh political circles: That  Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko is going to resign.    I do not have any intention to replace the prime minister,  said the head of state. I do not think that any government has  gained anything from replacing their prime ministers three or  four times. The frequent change of prime ministers led to the  situation that there is nobody in these republics with whom you  can have business. In addition, Tereshchnko is an experienced  leader.

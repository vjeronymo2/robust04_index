			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOUGHNESS NEEDED IN SEAL TRAINING  </P> <P> This is in response to Jennifer Crane Hahn in "Letters in View" concerning SEAL  training.  </P> <P> Ms. Hahn likens SEAL training to "an insane extension of the prevailing  mentality in high school and college sports."  </P> <P> The military's job is to train men for combat and not for sports.  </P> <P> Sure the training is "brutal" and even "abusive," but as the article pointed  out, the combat missions are 10 times worse than the training. Gen. William  Sherman said that "war is ALL hell," so I would say that training best reflect  the real world.  </P> <P> As long as war is used as an extension of foreign policy, it is criminal not to  provide the most effective training for our soldiers, sailors and Marines.  Better to shed some tears now (and perhaps offend Ms. Hahn's tender feelings)  than to spill blood needlessly later because of poor training. Jennifer Crane  Hahn and her ilk are living in fantasy land.  </P> <P> ED SCHAEFER,  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yevgenia Lents] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok June 29 TASS -- During their tour of the  Kamchatka Peninsula, the Sakhalin region and the Maritime  territory, members of a State Duma delegation confirmed that  Russia's Far East needed a special economic status, according to  Ivan Rybkin. The speaker of parliament's lower house addressed  on Wednesday a news conference, summing up results of the  lawmakers' trip.    When asked by TASS about the possibility of granting such a  status, Rybkin said the Duma intended to back the region's  legislative initiatives on the issue.    "The defence of our eastern borders is to be reasonable and  sufficient. Proceeding from this principle, we should help the  Far East in every possible way with material and technical  resources so that local residents could not feel deprived", the  Duma chairman believes.    Speaking of his visit to the South Kuril islands, Rybkin  expressed support of their residents' aspiration to retain these  economically beneficial territories.</p>

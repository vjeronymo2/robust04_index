After the  audience, the two leaders said they held talks with the head of  state on the appointment of a new prime minister. The two  political leaders will be meeting tomorrow with the head of  state at the latter's residence to continue the discussions.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] The president  has just received you and Edem Kodjo. What was the purpose of  your discussions?    [Agboyibor] During the last discussion we had with the head  of state, we expressed the desire to be received together with  UTD. The opportunity was offered us and we have continued our  reflections on the choice of a prime minister. The meeting  lasted for some time, and we decided to meet tomorrow at 1100 to  discuss the same issue.    [Correspondent] Does that mean that you have not yet agreed  on the choice of a prime minister?    [Agboyibor] It simply means that the consultations continue.    [Correspondent] Your Excellency, I put the same question to  you.    [Kodjo] As my colleague has rightly pointed out, the  discussions continue. They have been very interesting, and we  will resume the talks tomorrow at 1100.    [Correspondent] The people are waiting. They hope to obtain  a reply at all costs. Are you ready to make concrete proposals  to put an end to this wait?    [Kodjo] That is precisely the purpose of these  consultations.  [end recording]</p>

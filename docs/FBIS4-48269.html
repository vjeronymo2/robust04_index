			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 16 May (AFP) -- Congo is ready to put  more than 100 soldiers at the disposal of the United Nations for  the formation of a new international peacekeeping force in  Rwanda, a senior official of the Congolese Ministry of Foreign  Affairs in Brazzaville stated today. "It will be a company of  120 to 125 soldiers, all volunteers, who will be put at the  disposal of the organization to be part of the peacekeeping  force in Rwanda," said this senior official who preferred not to  be named. The Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a  request from the organization and the request is expected to be  given a "favorable response," he stated.    Last week, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali,  proposed  to increase to 5,500 the number of blue helmets in Rwanda for an  essentially humanitarian mission. The strength of the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] was reduced from 2,500 to  400 men when the massacres began in that country following the  death of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents on 6 April.  Twenty-five Congolese were in the UNAMIR.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The multiple component pricing (MCP) plan was originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for Orders 30, 68 and 79 by National All-Jersey, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NAJ) and other dairy organizations. In addition, Land O'Lakes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inc., proposed that the multiple component plan be considered for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Orders 65 and 76. Most other proposals considered at the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were modifications of the NAJ proposal and are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The first NAJ witness stated that the current milk pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system used in the five orders does not meet current marketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs and should be replaced with a multiple component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Much of the general NAJ testimony in favor of multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing was later reiterated by witnesses expert in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field of economics and dairy chemistry testifying for NAJ, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative for Land O'Lakes. Also testifying in favor of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAJ proposal were two dairy farmer members of the cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association Swiss Valley Farms Company, a representative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders Association of U.S.A., Inc., and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of Tri-State Milk Cooperative. It was indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in testimony that Alto Dairy Cooperative also supported the NAJ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The representative for the proponents said the intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their proposal was to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  1. Use the M-W price as the base;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  2. Pay all producers on four factors_pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat, pounds of protein, pounds of other solids,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and each producer's share of the fluid differential on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a per hundredweight basis;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  3. Leave Class I handler obligations on a skim-butterfat basis;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  4. Determine Class II and III handlers' obligations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis of pounds of butterfat, protein, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  5. Change only the order provisions needed to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NAJ proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The NAJ witness said that there were five reasons for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacing the current milk pricing system with a multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing system. The first reason, according to the NAJ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness, is that the current skim-butterfat pricing system does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not give dairy farmers economic incentives to produce milk high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in nonfat solids, especially protein. He stated that under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current pricing system a pound of water receives the same price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a pound of protein or other solids, yet it is these solids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that give milk its functional and nutritional value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The second reason given by the NAJ witness for adopting MCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was that over a period of years much of the value of milk has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shifted from butterfat to the skim portion of milk. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proponent's witness said that in 1960, butterfat represented 77%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the value of the M-W price, and skim represented 23%. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, he testified, these values were reversed, with butterfat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representing only 23% of the value of the M-W, while the skim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the milk represented 77%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  According to the NAJ witness, the shift in value from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> butterfat to skim was partially caused by the USDA decision to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease the support price for butter and increase the support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price for nonfat dry milk. The support price for butter declined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from $1.53 per pound in 1981 to 65 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 --> &cent; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per pound in 1993, with most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the decrease occurring since 1989. Nonfat dry milk purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices under the support program increased from 72.75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 --> &cent; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per pound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1988 to $1.034 per pound in 1993. In addition, the witness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> said, the butterfat differential under Federal orders has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dropping since the mid-1980s because of a decline in the market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price for butter. This drop was accelerated by a change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method of computing the butterfat differential, implemented in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990, that had the impact of reducing the butterfat differential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even more.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The third reason the witness gave for implementing multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component pricing was the shift in types of dairy products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers are purchasing. According to the witness, some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline in butterfat value relative to skim value has been caused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a shift in consumption from whole milk to lowfat and skim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluid milk products. The witness presented data to show that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 1970 to 1991, national fluid milk sales of lowfat and skim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk increased 232%, while sales of whole milk declined 50%. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, he stated, consumption of lowfat manufactured products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is growing faster than consumption of relatively high-fat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The NAJ witness discussed equity in Federal orders as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fourth reason for implementing multiple component pricing. He  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> said that the current skim-butterfat pricing system is equitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for neither producers nor handlers since it does not properly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognize the value of protein, especially in manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products such as cheese. The witness provided examples to show  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how a producer with high protein milk may currently receive the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same Federal order minimum price as a producer with low protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk. Similarly, a cheese maker who purchases high protein milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could have a cost advantage at minimum order prices over a cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maker who purchases low protein milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The fifth reason presented by the NAJ witness was the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of a number of voluntary multiple component pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans in the areas covered by the five orders. Data were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented to show that nearly all producers in the five orders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently are eligible to be paid under one of these voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple component pricing plans. The witness stated that many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the plans have inadequacies which contribute to disorderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketing. According to the witness, these inadequacies would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed by adopting the NAJ proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

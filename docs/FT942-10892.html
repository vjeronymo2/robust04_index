			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses resist the temptation to overreact Bourses responded to the US jobs data, but resisted the temptation to overreact, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was flat on the session, and volatile before and afterwards as it awaited, then digested the US news. The Dax index rose 1.18 to 2,237.02 on the session, a fraction lower on the week, after an early high of over 2,250; it fell to an Ibis-indicated 2,222.48 before closing the afternoon at 2,233.55. According to Mr Nigel Longley, at Commerzbank, the afternoon recovery was driven by short covering in bunds. However, Daimler dipped after hours, by DM9.50 to DM882 in London, on news that it made a DM70 per share loss for 1993 according to the DVFA standard accounting formula. Turnover fell from DM7.8bn to DM7.1bn. Mannesmann's loss and dividend cut from DM6 to DM5 came too late to reverse the rise in the shares, up DM4.50 to DM465. Lufthansa recovered to DM210 after Thursday's profit-taking. PARIS resisted a sharp correction following the US news and the CAC-40 index closed only 4.40 lower at 2,158.22, barely changed over the week. Interest was noted in the 'Euro stocks', with attention focused on the official opening of the Channel tunnel and Euro Disney's results, disappointing as expected. Eurotunnel slipped 90 centimes to FFr38.85, with investors more concerned at present about the timing of a rights issue. The theme park operator, off 75 centimes at FFr31.65, noted a 12 per cent fall in first half turnover to March 1994 and said that the effect of its restructuring programme would not come through until the second half of this year. UAP slipped FFr1.20 to FFr156 in line with the market: the government announced a price of FFr155 per share for institutions and said that the public offer had been 2.5 times subscribed. MADRID was hit late in the day by the resignation of another prominent socialist MP, Mr Baltasar Garzon, but still managed to close with the general index 1.97 higher at 318.22, 2.2 per cent down on a painful week. The gains were broadly based with banks strong, and some of the more volatile construction stocks even stronger. But the US influenced Repsol fell Pta45 to Pta34,455. AMSTERDAM closed slightly ahead, although the market fell back from a session high of 414.63 following the US data. The AEX index ended up 0.62 at 411.35, marginally lower on the week. Royal Dutch and Unilever improved, respectively by Fl 2.80 and Fl 1.00 to Fl 203.50 and Fl 204.20, before first quarter results due out next week. Hoare Govett expected a slight increase in Unilever's earnings per share; but because of negative sentiment which has arisen following the so-called 'detergents war' with Procter &amp; Gamble in Europe, the broker maintained its hold recommendation. MILAN was heartened by signs that Mr Silvio Berlusconi was nearing agreement with the Northern League on a government team, and the Comit index rose 26.90, or 3.5 per cent to 800.94, erasing declines suffered earlier in the week. Montedison advanced L54 to L1,572 while Edison, its subsidiary, was L376 higher at L9,119 after announcing improved 1993 results and plans for a share conversion. ZURICH caved in under pressure from US stock and bond markets and the SMI index fell 40.8 to a year's low of 2,641.4, down 3.5 per cent on the week. Banks remained out of favour. C S Holding bearers fell SFr15 to SFr584 after Standard &amp; Poors, the credit rating agency, said that Credit Suisse's acquisition of a stake in Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein could lead to a deterioration of the bank's credit quality. UBS fell SFr24 to SFr1,078 and SBC was SFr7 lower at SFr366. Roche continued its decline, the certificates losing SFr75 to SFr6,450. The shares have fallen by 9 per cent since it reported a 29 per cent rise in net income on April 19. ISTANBUL rushed to buy state-controlled companies after the Turkish parliament passed a privatisation law, and lifted the composite index by 1,239.24, or 7.8 per cent to 17,139.92, up 13.5 per cent over five days after an 18.3 per cent fall in the preceding week. WARSAW fell after a brief rebound, the Wig index closing 537.1, or 4.7 per cent lower at 10,852.3 as speculators unloaded shares.

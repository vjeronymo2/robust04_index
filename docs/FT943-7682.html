			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / This Week: Sport Football Wednesday, August 24, Glasgow, 8pm. Rangers v AEK Athens European Cup, Qualifying Round, Second Leg. Glasgow Rangers spent heavily on players again this summer. But their expensive team was outplayed in the first leg in Athens and lost 2-0. They must reach the second round, with its lucrative round-robin playoff system, to profit fully on the investment. Worse, another early exit could jeopardise Scotland's European Cup place and doom Rangers, even if they win the league yet again, to a UEFA cup place next season. Motor racing Sunday, August 28, Formula 1, Belgian Grand Prix, Spa Francorchamps. The Formula 1 season stages another roaring instalment of on-course tedium and off-course melodrama. All the cockpit cameras, pit-lane cameras and helicopter cameras, lovingly replaying every explosion and every crash, cannot disguise the predictability of the racing: Berger following Hill following Schumacher round one track after another. The only question that remains is whether the authorities can suspend Schumacher before he amasses an insurmountable championship lead.</p>

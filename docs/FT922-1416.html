			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / People: Stanic's charter to develop standards Vlad Stanic, former head of management development at TSB group, has been appointed development director for the Management Charter Initiative, the UK body which aims to set standards in management training. He faces a stiff challenge. The MCI was launched in 1988 only to find - a year later - it lacked the support of UK managers who described the organisation as bureaucratic and uninspiring. Since then, the response from employers has been patchy. Already christened 'the Impaler' by waggish MCI staff, Stanic believes the approach may be useful in his new post: 'I would like to impale all those senior managers who go through the motions but do not actually relate their management development to their business objectives.' He has a reputation for asking people penetrating questions; former colleagues say he is intelligent and confident and has a knack of putting those around him at their ease. He describes his working style as informal and flexible but is determined to meet the business objectives he sets even if that means working all night. During more than 20 years in personnel he has left some scars on the human resources he managed. At Spicer &amp; Oppenheimer he put reluctant partners through their paces with the introduction of performance appraisal, while senior managers at Rank Xerox found they were required to acquire MBAs. Born in Yugoslavia in 1941, he was educated and has worked largely in the UK. He is a chartered psychologist who describes himself as a maverick: 'Most psychologists have a purer than white approach. They have never heard of the idea of customer services or user-friendly psychology. I have dirtied my hands in industry so I see things from a business point of view.' Most recently he has worked as an independent consultant advising blue chip companies on personnel issues. ***** Tony Rieger has resigned from TIP Europe, the trailer rental group he helped to a 1988 stock market listing after it had been the subject of a management buyout. Rieger's role as managing director of the company's trailer rental division will be assumed by David Callear, the chief executive. Callear had organised TIP Europe's financial restructuring after it breached a loan agreement in 1990. Jim Davis, chairman, says there are 'no hard feelings'. 'Tony Rieger had great entrepreneurial flair but what we are seeking at the present time is a more steady approach.' Rieger is understood to be receiving about Pounds 250,000 in final remunerations. ***** Sears has appointed Ian Thomson to be managing director of BRITISH SHOE in a renewed attempt to sort out the quagmire that is its footwear subsidiary. Thomson, 46, can point to some useful experience for the task, coming as he does from the South African Edgars Group where he returned its loss-making Sales House business to profit. Sales House, primarily a clothes retailer, makes over 30 per cent of its sales in footwear so Thompson clearly knows one end of a shoe from the other. His brief will be to differentiate British Shoe's retail brands far more clearly. The problem has been that many of British Shoe's formats, which include Freeman Hardy Willis, Saxone, Dolcis and Cable &amp; Co, overlap in the marketplace. ***** David Allen has taken over from Kurt Huber as md of The Clayton Aniline Company; he was previously managing a factory in Brazil for the parent, CIBA-GEIGY. ***** David Simpson, formerly sales director of Steetley Roofing Products, has been appointed sales director of REDLAND Roof Tiles. ***** Graham Bog has been promoted to INCHCAPE's regional director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. ***** Paul Hussey has been appointed company secretary and group legal adviser of BUNZL. ***** Norio Osawa is promoted to md of QUICK EUROPE at its London headquarters. ***** Peter Nicholson at RIVA; Andrew Cummins has resigned. ***** Ian Menzies at WESTCOUNTRY TELEVISION on behalf of Henderson Venture Managers. ***** David Orr, chairman of Chateau Latour, at HARVEYS OF BRISTOL. ***** Peter Kent is changing his responsibilities from executive to non-executive at NOBO. ***** Paul Lever, chairman of Lionheart, as chairman of BSM GROUP. ***** John Turner, recently retired senior partner of the Norwich office of KPMG Peat Marwick, at PROPERTY PARTNERSHIPS. ***** Robert Upsdell at SUNLEIGH, which has acquired Gavel Securities of which he was chairman.</p>

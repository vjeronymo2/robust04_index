			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HORSE RACING INDUSTRY WON ITS BIGGEST GAMBLE OF DECADE  </P> <P> The winner of the last race of the decade at Hollywood Park was Litigator, in a  bottom-level claiming event Sunday. It was not a particularly memorable  occurrence.  </P> <P> But slightly more than five years earlier, the most memorable American horse  race of the decade took place at the Inglewood track, according to Andrew Beyer  of the Washington Post.  </P> <P> Beyer writes:  </P> <P> "On Nov. 10, 1984, the horse racing industry didn't know what to make of an  innovation called the Breeders' Cup. Pessimists wondered whether the owners and  trainers of top horses would support this day of racing offering $10 million in  purses; they feared that the Breeders' Cup would upstage or eliminate other  long-established championship events.  </P> <P> "But all of these concerns evaporated after one spectacular afternoon of racing  at Hollywood Park. The sunny day was so glorious that the event seemed  heaven-blessed; the races drew the best horses from America and Europe, and  they produced one heart-stopping drama after another.  </P> <P> "The event came to a fitting climax in the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic.  Wild Again, a 31-1 shot, led on the final turn, where he was challenged by the  odds-on favorite, Slew o' Gold. The two battled head to head, and then the  stretch-running Gate Dancer swooped outside them.  </P> <P> "Now, the Classic was a three-horse race, with inches separating the rivals,  until Slew o' Gold was bumped and squeezed back. Wild Again finished a head in  front of Gate Dancer, but the 'Inquiry' sign was lighted on the tote board.  </P> <P> "With NBC's cameras scrutinizing their deliberation, the stewards made the  right call: Gate Dancer had initiated the contact. Wild Again was the official  winner of the world's richest race, and the success of the Breeders' Cup seemed  to have been made official, too."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What do the wives of Golden State Warriors Winston Garland, Uwe  Blab, John Shasky and Manute Bol, Warrior assistant coach Gary St. Jean and  trainer Tom Abdenour have in common?  </P> <P> Close to the vest: Bill McCartney, University of Colorado football coach, has  closed practices and limited the availability of his players for interviews as  the top-ranked Buffaloes prepare for their Orange Bowl game against Notre Dame  Monday night.  </P> <P> McCartney said: "I'm going to try to make sure that's my team playing New  Year's Night -- protect them from the media onslaught, and gear the practices  so we're ready to play that night and not prematurely."  </P> <P> Second choice: Doug Moe, coach of the Denver Nuggets, on his craft: "Actually,  my No. 1 goal is retirement, but I can't afford that. No. 2 is coaching. I want  to retire, but I can't. So I have to coach, mainly because I can't do anything  else."  </P> <P> Wake-up call: After being booed in San Francisco, rookie cornerback Deion  Sanders of the Atlanta Falcons said of the fans: "They'll have to get up in the  morning at 6 o'clock to go to work. I may get up and go to the bank and count  my money. I don't care about those people."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: All are pregnant.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Mike Webster, Kansas City center, on 250-pound Chief running back  Christian Okoye: "I've learned to get out of his way. If I can't move my man  out of the hole, I leave him there and let him take the brunt of it. I don't  want to be in the pile when Okoye hits it." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

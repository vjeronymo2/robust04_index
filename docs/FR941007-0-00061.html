			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> &bull;Have a Federally-approved Medicare supplemental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory program under section 1882 of the Act; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Submit a timely application to us that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of section 4360 of OBRA '90; 42 CFR part 403,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart E; and our solicitation for grant applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Availability and Duration of Funds for Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule specifies, at &sect;403.502, that grants for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal period will be approved subject to congressional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation of funds and, if applicable, satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress in each State's project under a preceding health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance ICA grant. (The criteria by which progress will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be evaluated and the performance standards for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether satisfactory progress has been made will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the notice of grant award sent to each State.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note that we may, at our discretion, set aside a portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appropriated funds to be used for ICA-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. The grant award is based on a 12-month period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is made by the close of a fiscal year for each State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application approved by that date. However, information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the timing of the award and its duration will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the notice of grant solicitation, rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> C. Number and Size of Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule revises the provisions at existing &sect;403.504.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We continue to provide, at &sect;403.504(a) for two types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants: (1) New program grants, and (2) existing program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhancement grants for States with ``substantially similar''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health insurance ICA programs. We are interested in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing or enhancing health insurance ICA programs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all eligible States. Therefore, under &sect;403.504(b), each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible State that submits an acceptable application will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive a grant that consists of two parts: a fixed amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the minimum funding level) and a variable amount. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;403.504(b), the grant available to each of the 50 States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia equals $75,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the fixed amount), plus a per capita payment per resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare beneficiary. Because of their relatively small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations, the grant available to the Virgin Islands,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guam, and American Samoa is $25,000 each (the fixed amount),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plus a per capita payment per Medicare beneficiary residing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the territory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of the fixed amount portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant award as the minimum funding level is a change from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum funding level described at existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;403.504(b). (Existing &sect;403.504(b), which was applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for fiscal years 1992 and 1993, provided that the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding level consisted of two parts: a basic (fixed)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion and a variable portion.) We believe it is clearer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (more descriptive) to establish as the minimum funding level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a fixed, stated dollar amount and to consider the variable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount as being in addition to the minimum funding level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change will not affect the amount of the grant award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grant award will still consist of the fixed portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount and the variable portion amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The calculation of the variable portion of the grant is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described at existing &sect;403.405(c). We base the variable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the grant on the amount of available funds and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison of each State with the average of all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States except the State being compared with respect to three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors that relate to the size of the State's Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population and where that population resides. The three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors are: the percentage of nationwide Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries residing in the State, the State's proportion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Medicare beneficiaries to its total population, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiary population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that resides in rural areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nationally, the average variable payment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.75 cents. A State with a higher than average proportion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Medicare beneficiaries to its total State population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or a higher than average proportion of rural Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiaries will receive variable funds greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.75 cents per beneficiary under this grant program. Of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total variable portion of the award, approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75 percent is based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the State; approximately 10 percent is based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of Medicare beneficiaries to the total State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population; and approximately 15 percent is based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiary population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that resides in rural areas. (We based population estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the U.S. Census estimates for 1990. The Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary estimates came from our beneficiary enrollment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database as of July 1990. We consider ``rural areas'' to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counties located outside of metropolitan statistical areas.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time we announce the availability of grant funding,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we provide each State with an estimate of the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds that may be awarded to it. As part of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, the State submits a budget based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated amount. When the grant awards are made, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocate all available monies based on the methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above. If the grant amount the State receives is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different than the anticipated amount on which its budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was based, the State must submit, along with its acceptance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the grant award, a revised budget that is based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

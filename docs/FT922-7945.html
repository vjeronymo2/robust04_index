			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcan agrees 4-year pay deal ALCAN Aluminium's Quebec smelter workers have accepted a new four-year contract providing a total 8.6 per cent in pay increases retrospectively to May 1, 1991. The unions also negotiated tighter job security clauses covering plant modernisation and technological change. The new agreement covers all Alcan's smelters in Quebec, except a small plant near Montreal. In all the company has about 700,000 tonnes of ingot production capacity in the province. Alcan laid off about 4,000 employees world-wide in 1991 and shut down 8 per cent of its smelting capacity because of low world prices. It has warned further cuts of about 1,000 jobs world-wide might follow this year. About half of US aluminium producers have already agreed short-term contracts.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bibby raises bid for Finanzauto to Pounds 86m J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural conglomerate owned by Barlow Rand of South Africa, has raised its bid for Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar distributor, to Pta 1,500-a-share in the face of growing doubts that its original Pta 1,300 offer would succeed. The new price values the Spanish company at Pta 15.9bn (Pounds 86.2m), but Bibby failed to secure Finanzauto's backing in talks with management on Wednesday. Finanzauto said yesterday that the offer was a clear improvement and that it would pronounce on it early next week. It is expected that it will drop its opposition - the company has valued its stock at about Pta 1,700 - and adopt a neutral position. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, Bibby's chairman, said in Madrid yesterday he would not increase the offer again. For technical reasons, he said citing Spanish takeover regulations, 'it would be impossible to increase that price'. He was 'very confident' that the raised bid would be sufficient. 'We thought we had an odds-on chance at Pta 1,300 and we feel it is a certainty at Pta 1,500.' The new price would represent a price earnings ratio of 22 on Finanzauto's 1991 consolidated profits. Heavy buying of Finanzauto stock hours before Bibby announced its new offer, pushed the price beyond Pta 1,300 for the first time since the takeover was launched. Bibby has requested an inquiry by the stock market commission into the buying.</p>

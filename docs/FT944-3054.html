			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Show of resistance disguises unity of business purpose: The postal strike masked broad agreement between management and staff This week's Post Office dispute, which closed more than 100 main offices, caused a predictable spat. The UCW communication workers' union said that Monday's walkout, over 'backdoor privatisation' of main offices, was a tremendous success. Management dismissed it as a flop. One might conclude that the UCW, which campaigned so successfully to stop the government's privatisation plans for the Post Office, was still at daggers drawn with senior management, which had lobbied strenuously for a sell-off. However, appearances can be deceptive. Last month the UCW recommended that its members accept a 2.8 per cent pay rise from November 1 to rise to 3.4 per cent from anuary 1. Mr Alan Johnson, the union's general secretary, said that closure of main offices and their transfer to franchised stores or supermarkets had been happening since 1987. This week's walkout was merely an attempt to give the issue a higher profile. Although the counters side of the business employs about 9,000 UCW members, the union stressed that 'this dispute does not epitomise our relationship with the Post Office'. But Mr Johnson said industrial relations were 'very tense' in the much larger Royal Mail letters business, which employs 130,000 of his members. The union is in the process of conducting about 40 strike ballots on local disputes over hours and conditions. The union said the Post Office's own attitude survey showed that employees' morale was 'abysmal'. It said it would be pressing in forthcoming negotiations for shorter working hours - and in particular for an end to routine six-day working by most delivery staff. Mr Johnson said: 'Seven-day working was stopped in 1849. So delivery staff came into this century working on six days a week. We don't want them to go into the next century still doing the same.' Mr John Roberts, the Post Office's managing director of group services, took a more relaxed view of the group's industrial relations. 'This is our busiest time of year - disputes over overtime are almost traditional. Five years ago we lost 5 per cent of man-days because of industrial action between April and Christmas. Since April this year we have lost less than 0.1 per cent.' However, Mr Roberts said: 'We had two-and-a-half years of total uncertainty  -that certainly had an impact on morale. It is difficult to run a business when you don't know which way you are heading. 'Now that it is clear we will remain in the public sector - at least for the foreseeable future - we can focus on longer-term issues.' Management is not unsympathetic to the UCW's complaint that low basic pay means that postal workers rely too much on overtime to achieve reasonable average pay. In the new year negotiations, the union will be seeking reduced working hours, enhanced job security and a productivity scheme. Mr Roberts said: 'Now is a very good time for us to take stock. We are going to have a period of stability - we have got to make the most of that. There is a lot of common ground on which to build.' Mr Johnson is also anxious not to overstate the degree of industrial unrest, and agrees with management that most of the present local disputes in Royal Mail are likely to be settled without industrial action. He said: 'We realise we're better off than in a lot of industries. We have a fairly sophisticated industrial relations environment. While there might have been some hawks passing through, most managers realise they need to work with the unions.' One goal that both the UCW and the management will press for is the achieving of more commercial freedom for the Post Office, now that the government has backed away from immediate privatisation. There is some resentment on the union side that Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, and Mr Michael Heron, chairman, both pressed so vociferously for privatisation. Post Office leaders apparently felt they had little choice, given the conditions with which the government seemed intent on hedging the option of staying in the public sector. Mr Roberts said: 'The issue for us was always commercial freedom - not ownership. But the government said ownership within the public sector would condemn us to slow decline. The key thing is that we must not let go of the argument for commercial freedom.' The union plans to launch a Postal Forum - to include consumer and industry associations, charities and disability groups - in the new year to campaign for greater commercial freedom. Union and management will again press for a cut in this year's Pounds 226m government levy on post service profits. Mr Johnson said: 'We're dealing with the art of the possible - trying to build a coalition. Our members are not naturally militant - we take the brunt of any industrial action. Many of my members meet more members of the public every day than senior management do all year.'</p>

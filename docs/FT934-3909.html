			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: TV listings saga lives on - Robert Rice reports on a copyright issue before the European court The five-year television listings battle between British and Irish television companies and the European Commission returned to the European Court of Justice last week. Most people could be forgiven for thinking that the dispute over the refusal by the BBC, Independent Television Publications, the publisher of TV Times, and Radio Telefis Eireann (RTE), the Irish broadcaster, to supply scheduling information to independent listings magazines was a dead issue. In a sense it is - at least in the UK where, since the 1990 Broadcasting Act came into force, broadcasters have been required to license their schedules, in which they have copyright, to other publishers. But the question of whether a refusal by a copyright owner to authorise third parties to publish such copyright material can amount to an abuse of a dominant position outlawed by Rome treaty competition rules is still very much a live issue. The Commission's view, upheld in 1991 by the Court of First Instance, is that it can. If that decision was confined to the narrow issue of TV listings, it would hardly seem worth pursuing. Indeed, the BBC has dropped out, but RTE and ITP, which have been joined by Intellectual Property Owners, a Washington-based lobby organisation, are concerned by the wider implications of the CFI judgment and have appealed to the full European Court. The oral hearing was held in Luxembourg last week. Their concern is that the Commission will use the TV listings case to force owners of intellectual property rights in other areas, such as computer software, to license those rights to third parties. According to Mr Guy Leigh of City solicitors Theodore Goddard, which is acting for IPO, the danger is that we may be moving towards a system of compulsory licensing of intellectual property in the European Union in circumstances where the exercise of those rights is deemed by the Commission to conflict with EC competition rules. Lawyers close to the case suggest that the CFI decision leaves it open to the Commission to act as a compulsory licensing authority in areas such as telecommunications and computer software. In the immediate aftermath of the judgment, Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, said the Commission intended to use it to open up these markets. But since then the Commission appears to have backed away from the idea of compulsory intellectual property licensing. According to one lawyer, there is a suggestion in Brussels that a body of opinion within the Commission legal service does not agree with the legal basis of the CFI's decision. If this is so, the Commission may see problems in trying to get any wider application of the compulsory licensing principle past the legal service, he says. There also appears to be some confusion within the Commission as to what its precise role would be in forcing owners of intellectual property rights to license third parties to manufacture or supply protected products. It appears prepared to order rights' holders to grant licences but then shies away from getting involved in setting the terms of those licences. The current Commission position is that the terms of a licence are a matter for negotiation between the parties involved and it will only intervene if the third party complains to it that the terms are unreasonable. Lawyers say that is a long way from the role of a compulsory licensing authority. The TV companies' main ground of appeal to the ECJ is that the CFI misconstrued the concept of abuse of a dominant position. It was wrong to rule that the Commission had the power to require the owner of an intellectual property right to grant compulsory licences. Their argument for saying this is based on the ECJ's judgment in the 1988 Volvo spare parts case, where the court said that the exercise by the owner of intellectual property rights of his exclusive right to refuse to grant a licence cannot of itself amount to abuse of a dominant position under Rome treaty competition rules. In the Volvo case, the Swedish car manufacturer launched an action against a UK distributor of Volvo cars for breach of its registered design in spare body parts, which the distributor had imported and sold in the UK. The issue was whether Volvo could be guilty of abuse of a dominant position by refusing to license others to supply body panels even where they were willing to pay a reasonable royalty. The ECJ said the right of an owner of a protected design to prevent others manufacturing, importing or selling products incorporating the protected design constituted 'the very subject matter' of his exclusive right. It followed that an obligation imposed on the owner of the design to license others to supply products incorporating it, would deprive the owner of the substance of his exclusive right. A refusal to grant such a licence could not in itself constitute an abuse of a dominant position. However, the court went on to say that there were circumstances where the exercise of such an exclusive right could amount to abuse of a dominant position under Rome treaty competition rules if it involved abusive conduct such as: the arbitrary refusal to supply parts to independent repairers; the fixing of prices for spare parts at an unfair level; or the decision no longer to make spare parts for a particular model even though many cars of that model were still in circulation. The TV companies admit that when the case began they had a monopoly on their TV schedules and were thus dominant but, relying on Volvo, argue that their refusal to license other publishers to use their copyrighted material did not amount to an abuse caught by European competition rules. The Commission argues that a licensing policy engaged in by a dominant company which is discriminatory or involves charging excessive royalties or is intended to drive a competitor from a market or prevent new competitors entering the market, may be an abuse of a dominant position under Rome treaty competition rules. Its analysis of the Volvo judgment is that the TV companies' refusal to license other publishers could fall within one of the three exceptions outlined in Volvo to the general rule that a refusal to grant a licence cannot of itself amount to an abuse of a dominant position and in any event that the list of exceptions outlined in Volvo was not exhaustive. The Commission argues that Magill TV Guide, the Irish publisher which made the original complaint to Brussels in 1986 after the TV companies had sued it for publishing full listings of their schedules, was in a similar position to that of an independent car repairer who is dependent on the supply of the 'raw material' from the upstream market and is competing with his supplier. The Commission maintains that Magill was in an even more disadvantageous position, being entirely dependent on the broadcasting companies. Without a licence Magill could do nothing with the supply of information on TV programmes. According to ITP's lawyers, Allen &amp; Overy, it is impossible to tell from last week's oral hearing which way the court will decide. The advocate general's preliminary opinion will be delivered on February 9. But it seems hard not to conclude that, if copyright owners cannot refuse to license the right and exploit it themselves, their intellectual property rights are being undermined.</p>

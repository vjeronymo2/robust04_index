			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Stagnation seen for Venezuela The Venezuelan government does not expect the economy to grow this year, but is laying the groundwork for annual GDP growth of 4 to 5 per cent from 1995, according to Mr Enzo del Bufalo, economic planning minister. The government of President Rafael Caldera, which began a five-year term on February 2, inherited a recession, high inflation and a large fiscal deficit. The government views 1994 as 'a year of stabilisation', during which it will curb government spending, introduce tax reforms, revive a privatisation programme and streamline bureaucracy. Mr Caldera has proposed a series of 'strategic' economic measures, including 'a battle against inflation', austerity in government spending, opening the economy and greater competitiveness, efforts to control waste and corruption, and a tax reform package. But the government has been short on specifics, saying only that it will raise the minimum monthly wage from the current level equivalent to Dollars 81 (Pounds 55) and drop an unpopular value-added tax. The government also plans to re-start the country's privatisation programme, stalled since two failed military coups in 1992 plunged Venezuela into political instability. The first step in reviving the programme is the sale of a state-owned airline, Aeropostal, due in late March. Venezuela's GDP last year showed a 1 per cent decline after three years of strong growth. Inflation in 1993 reached 46 per cent and was 4.3 per cent last month. The leftist party, Radical Cause, has reiterated its call for the dissolution of Venezuela's new Congress and the installation of a constituent assembly. Congressman Pablo Medina of the party called the Congress 'illegitimate' and 'fraudulent', claiming there was widespread cheating in counting Congressional votes after elections in December.</p>

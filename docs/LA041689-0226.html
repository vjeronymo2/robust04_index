			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL CREATES MEMORIAL ART SCHOLARSHIP FUND  </P> <P> In memory of Megan Hart Jones, who attended the Art Institute of Southern  California when it was known as the Laguna Beach School of Art, the school has  established a scholarship fund. Contributions will be used to provide studio  art scholarship awards for bachelor of fine arts students pursuing degrees in  painting, drawing, sculpture or photography.  </P> <P> Individuals who contribute $250 to the fund will receive a small etching by  Jones, either "English Sheep" -- tiny sheep scattered on a field sloping down  from a panoramic landscape -- or "Flowers and Shells" in which the subjects are  scattered within an abstract grid format. Those who contribute $25 or more will  receive the tiny, privately printed booklet "Portrait of a Story" in which  Jones writes with humor and passion about the experience of creating her major  work, "Eternal Force."  </P> <P> Checks can be made payable to AISC -- Megan Hart Jones Scholarship Fund, and  sent to the Art Institute, 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach, Calif. 92651.

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: GPA sets preference conversion price at Dollars 8 a share GPA GROUP, the aircraft leasing company, yesterday set the conversion price of its Dollars 350m (Pounds 178m) preference share issue at Dollars 8 a share. In a letter to institutional shareholders, GPA confirmed its intention to seek a listing for the convertible share issue in Luxembourg by the end of the year. This would be followed by a listing of the ordinary and convertible shares on the Dublin stock exchange early next year. GPA's planned flotation of ordinary shares, aborted in June, would have been priced at Dollars 20 a share. The ordinary shares are currently quoted on the Dublin grey market at between Dollars 6 and Dollars 8. GPA said it had commissioned a study which showed new investors might be attracted at a price of Dollars 11.90. However, after listening to advice from its institutional shareholders, it decided to set the price at Dollars 8. The decision means that shareholders will have to write-down their existing shares to Dollars 8 apiece. Many institutional shareholders had only written down the value of their shares by Dollars 5 to Dollars 15. GPA is planning to meet with prospective shareholders next week if it can secure the agreement of most of its existing shareholders to take part in the convertible share issue. Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and founder of the group who controls 8 per cent of the ordinary shares, plans to take up a 'sizeable' amount of his rights in the new issue. The injection of fresh equity is part of an overall recovery programme which includes two more asset-backed securitised issues and the renegotiation of its aircraft acquisition programme. GPA is locked in talks with Boeing, Airbus, Fokker and McDonnell Douglas about cutting the Dollars 12 billion of orders for the rest of the decade to Dollars 5 billion.</p>

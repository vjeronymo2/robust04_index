			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The environmental group Greenpeace said a recent federal study found tiny  amounts of highly toxic dioxin in virtually all U.S.-produced pulp used to make  bleached paper products such as coffee filters and diapers. Paper industry  officials contend the dioxin levels found in paper products are so low they  pose no threat to consumers. But an Environmental Protection Agency official  said the long-term health risks remain unclear. The study, conducted by the EPA  and the paper industry, surveyed all U.S. paper mills that use a chlorine-based  bleaching process to convert brown pulp to white. Dioxins and other toxic  compounds are formed as a byproduct of that bleaching process. Shelley Stewart,  a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, said the study found that 103 of the 104 mills  had detectable levels of dioxin in their pulp.  </P></p>

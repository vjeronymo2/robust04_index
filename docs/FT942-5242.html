			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: Is your boss Britain's meanest? There is a new generation of British bosses out there. They are egalitarian, intelligent and highly principled. They are hardworking and meritocratic. They live by their corporate mission statement and strive to offer their customers the very best value. So says City journalist William Kay who has just interviewed two dozen of the new guard for his book The Bosses. After hearing ad infinitum about their flat management structures and modern management methods, he has jumped to the conclusion that the flashy old captains of industry are gone, and a more homogenous group of deserving high-flyers has replaced them. I don't buy it. The average boss may be brighter than before - after all, business has got harder, so also-rans tend not to make it. But are our corporate leaders really more fair minded? More egalitarian? Human nature being what it is, surely there are as many boors in the boardroom as ever before? For every executive with the admirable qualities that Kay has found in his research, I bet there are just as many successful bosses who are bullies, tyrants or impossible to work for. I could list a few off the top of my head but that would get me into trouble. Therefore, I am passing the buck and inviting readers to nominate their own candidates for Britain's meanest boss. The rules are as follows: The bosses must be chairmen or chief executives of Britain's biggest 350 companies. Relevant criteria include: intimidating or unreasonably demanding behaviour; tantrums, abusive language, failure to listen, impatience, ruthlessness, bullying, intransigence, intolerance, unpredictability, arrogance, vindictiveness. Readers may nominate up to three bosses each, listing them in order of meanness. It is not necessary to have worked for any of them directly, but anecdotal evidence should have been collected. All nominations should state in a few words why each candidate deserves to be considered for the Financial Times Mean Boss Award. Nominations sent in anonymously will be accepted. Signed nominations will be treated with the utmost discretion. My decision will be final. Nominations should be sent by post to: Lucy Kellaway, Financial Times, Number One Southwark Bridge, London SW1 9HL, or by fax to 071 873 3196. If anyone from the Economist is reading this, they may be feeling vindicated. That periodical has just published a leader complaining that the British view 'trade' with suspicion and liken all entrepreneurs to that shady character Arthur Daley in the TV comedy Minder. Let me set the record straight: I do not hold British businessmen and women in low esteem. On the contrary, some of my best friends, etc etc. My point is that some of the people who have got to the top in business  - as in politics, and any other area you can mention - are power- crazed and difficult to work for. The magazine's view is at least a generation out of date. Businessmen are better known and better respected than ever before. People at the Economist must watch nothing other than sitcoms or they would have noticed the popular new genre of business documentaries on subjects such as venture capital which are watched by millions. If they still need convincing, they should invest in Kay's glowing book. Our nanny has just regaled me with the story of a friend who has got a job looking after one docile baby for Pounds 140 a week net plus a two-bedroomed flat and a car. It was not the unfavourable comparison with her own terms and conditions that took me aback. It was that the balance of power between us had shifted: throughout the recession it was she who was lucky to have an acceptable job. Now it is I who am lucky to have a (more than) acceptable nanny. When I advertised in The Lady a year and a half ago I had 70 desperate replies. A friend who last week placed a similar ad received only four. The story at London's nannying agencies shows this to be no freak. They say they are finding jobs for 30 per cent more nannies every week than they were six months ago. This is the most tangible sign I've seen that the economy is picking up, and that confidence is well and truly back - among London's professional classes at least. During the recession, freelance women fired their nannies as soon as they feared their work might be drying up, only to reemploy them once they started feeling more optimistic. Similarly, women who do not work get rid of the nanny the minute their husband's job looks precarious, but once he seems more secure, they are on the phone to the nanny agency in no time. Anyone who is not impressed by this powerful new economic indicator should try to book a table at Quaglino's. A few months ago you could have walked in off the street. Now two weeks' notice is required.</p>

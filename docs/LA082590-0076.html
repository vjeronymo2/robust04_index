			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS QUESTION IN-HOUSE HIRING;  </P> <P> PERSONNEL: THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION HIRES ITS OWN CHAIRMAN AS AN ANALYST,  EXACERBATING A FEUD WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OVER NEPOTISM.  </P> <P> A Ventura County Civil Service Commission decision to forgo county recruiting  procedures and quickly hire its own chairman as a staff analyst has prompted a  letter of concern from the county's personnel chief and a sharp rebuke by the  district attorney.  </P> <P> The commission hired Chairman Robert C. Embry on July 26, shortly after veteran  staff member Ray Charles died suddenly. It conducted no search for applicants  and considered only Embry and another member of the five-person commission for  the $15,298-a-year part-time job.  </P> <P> "As soon as these two people declared themselves, we figured that either one  would be an excellent staff representative," Vice Chairman Edward Flores said  Friday. "We didn't think we'd ever get another candidate as qualified."  </P> <P> So instead of taking at least a month to recruit applicants, Embry and  Commissioner Carolyn Goldsborough dismissed themselves from the closed-door  deliberations, and the other commissioners picked Embry to work 60 hours a  month researching county employee appeals, Flores said.  </P> <P> Ratification of Embry's contract will be on the Sept. 4 agenda of the County  Board of Supervisors. In a letter, Personnel Director Ronald W. Komers  recommends approval of the contract but told the board that he was concerned  about the procedure used to pick Charles' successor.  </P> <P> "I have no knowledge of the criteria involved" in Embry's selection, Komers  said in an interview. "I am concerned that there was not a formal process so  everybody would know what the criteria was."  </P> <P> Reacting to Komers' concerns, the commission has agreed to work with him to  create a procedure for future hirings, he said.  </P> <P> Komers said he was bothered by how Embry was selected, not by his  qualifications. Embry, 55, is a professor of business management at Cal  Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> "I think Dr. Embry is a fine person and will make a fine staff representative,"  Komers said.  </P> <P> A key Civil Service rule requires competition for vacant jobs, which in Ventura  County usually includes advertising openings in a newspaper, he said.  </P> <P> Civil Service commissioners and their staff adviser are technically not county  employees and do not have to follow that guideline, even though their salaries  are paid by the county, Komers said.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said Friday that he agrees that no law was  broken when the commission chose Embry.  </P> <P> "But it strikes me as a little incestuous to have two members of the commission  ask for the job and the remaining members make the decision," Bradbury said.  </P> <P> "I think the public should expect more from a commission that is the gatekeeper  of the merit system. If there's such a thing as institutional nepotism, this is  it."  </P> <P> Bradbury's comments represent a continuation of his long-running feud with the  commission and with Embry.  </P> <P> The commission found in April that the district attorney had violated county  nepotism rules by allowing a division head to keep his new wife on his staff.  Embry, who called the situation "blatant nepotism," abstained from voting after  Bradbury accused him of prejudging the issue.  </P> <P> Bradbury rejected the nepotism finding, saying that the commissioners were  irresponsible, incompetent tools of the county employee union. County lawyers  said they found no violation of county work rules in the district attorney's  office, but Bradbury eventually agreed to move the employee from her husband's  office.  </P> <P> r Embry, who also directs the Center of Management Development at Cal Lutheran,  said Friday that he warned his fellow commissioners that they should not hire  anyone at their July meeting and instead should ask the Personnel Department to  recruit candidates.  </P> <P> "I strongly advised them that they should go through that process," Embry said.  "I anticipated that there may be some people who would view this as being  incestuous."  </P> <P> Embry said, however, that the commission's decision made sense because members  had been told by at least one top county administrator that there would be  little interest in a part-time job that paid only $15,000 annually.  </P> <P> Komers said Friday, however, that he thinks there would have been other  applicants for the job.  </P> <P> "I know there are a number of people in the community interested," most of them  retired administrators, he said.  </P> <P> In addition to his new county job and his full-time post at Cal Lutheran, Embry  is the bargaining representative for an association of civil engineers and  technicians employed by Santa Barbara County, he said.  </P></p>

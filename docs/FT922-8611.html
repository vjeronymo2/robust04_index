			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Technically Speaking: Legal rights of the copycats IT IS obvious to personal computer users that Microsoft's 'Windows' program makes an IBM-compatible personal computer look like an Apple Macintosh. Why then has a San Francisco judge gutted Apple's copyright suit against Microsoft by rejecting most of Apple's claims? More important, what impact will the ongoing legal battle between these two companies have on the rest of the information technology industry and on computer users? In 1988, when Apple filed its copyright suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard (which at the time was touting its NewWave program as an extension to Windows), industry critics charged that Apple's legal action might retard advances in computer software by limiting the use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Implicit in such charges was the acknowledgment that Apple's Macintosh GUI with its 'icons', pull-down menus and overlapping windows, represented a significant step forward in making personal computers easier to use. Four years, three judges and 10m copies of Microsoft Windows later, Apple has been unable to persuade the courts that the overall 'look and feel' of its Macintosh software can be protected by copyright. Instead, the court decided to dissect the Macintosh images and consider whether each element of the computer screen displays represented 'unique expression' that was copied by Microsoft, as well as whether that element was covered by a prior licensing agreement between the two companies. Thus Apple finds itself arguing that the design of the 'trash can' icon that represents the function of discarding unwanted data is somehow unique. This analytical approach to considering copyright claims has been invented by the courts in an attempt to apply to computer software laws that were created to protect works of art and written materials. The precedent was set recently by an appeals court in a little-known case involving a now defunct software company called Brown Bag, versus Symantec, best known for its anti-viral programs. Following the analytical approach recommended by the appeals court, the San Francisco court surprised all parties in the Apple case by summarily rejecting most of Apple's claims. For Microsoft, the rulings represented a big step towards a victory that will enable the company to continue its drive towards domination of the personal computer software market. Apple's case is in shreds and the company's lawyers are pouring over the pieces in search of some way to reconstruct their arguments. For other software publishers, the way is now clear to produce programs that may share the overall appearance of existing products, thereby weakening the protection that copyright laws offer. Publishers of the written word may also be given pause for thought. Following the approach adopted by the US courts, newspaper publishers, for example, would not be able to protect the design or layout of their pages which is the 'signature' of a publication. With programs expected to reach the market later this year that will make it possible to reproduce the typestyles and layout of any publication quickly and cheaply on a PC, can it be long before a newsletter, or magazine, or newspaper finds itself defending the 'look and feel' of its publication against an imitator? Microsoft may well prevail in defending Windows against Apple's copyright claim. In the short term, Apple's loss will be a victory for all of its competitors in the personal computer market because the reverse decision would have brought the industry to a grinding halt. The longer-term implications of the court's rejection of the 'look and feel' argument should, however, be of concern to all publishers of original works because computer technology will soon make exact reproduction of everything from artist's masterpieces to the front page of the Financial Times not only possible, but probable.</p>

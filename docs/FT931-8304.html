			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber dampened by its price - A producer-consumer accord hangs in the balance When trading in natural rubber became computerised on the Singapore commodity exchange last year, producers were hoping prices might lift from a three-year trough. One year on, prices remain low and a bitter argument rages between producing and consuming nations over support for the industry. At the end of this year, the current five-year agreement of the International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO), which groups together 26 producing and consuming nations, will expire. Producers have set a deadline for the end of March for consumers to indicate whether or not they are willing to negotiate a new agreement. INRO's system of intervention prices and buffer stock management now hangs in the balance. Industry officials say the US and tyre companies, including Goodyear and Michelin, support renewing the agreement. But the European Community is proving indecisive they say, and tends towards abandoning it. Under INRO regulations, if the average market price over a six-month period is below the buffer stock intervention price, the intervention price must be cut by 5 per cent. When the price was reviewed on January 28, the six-month average was 175.95 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo, fractionally below the 176 cents a kilo intervention level. The market price has risen to 183.71 cents a kilo and producers fear a cut in the intervention price will damage the fragile market recovery. Consumers insist that the cut be implemented. Producers are arguing for intervention levels to be raised under a renegotiated INRO agreement. Dr AF Budiman, executive director of the Indonesian Rubber Association, says the current 'market price is not remunerative enough to guarantee a long-term re-investment in natural rubber'. Producers still gripe that the international pricing system for rubber is weighted in favour of the tyre companies, which mostly buy direct from processors at a price related to that prevailing on the commodity exchange in Singapore. The producers allege the exchange price is depressed by the low volume and quality of rubber traded in Singapore. Tyre companies have responded by saying they will reduce direct sales and improve the market's liquidity. While producers complain direct sales are having a dampening effect on the market, they feel in a weak position vis-a-vis the tyre companies. 'There are five major buyers against hundreds of sellers,' says Mr Teddy Chua, managing director of Transworld Rubber brokers in Singapore. 'They feel the five can hold up better than them.' Producers' complaints, however, may be overblown. Traders say rubber is a fickle commodity and while marginal oversupply at present has resulted in low prices, a shift to a small excess in demand could lift prices sharply. A recent report by Free University of Amsterdam, funded by the Dutch government on behalf of natural rubber producers, estimates world production will rise from 5.24m in 1990 to 6.66m tonnes in the year 2000. In the same period, world consumption will rise from 5.23m tonnes to 6.69m. Longer-term forecasts have world production of 8.57m tonnes and consumption at 8.51m tonnes in 2010. The report concludes that while supply exceeds demand, 'the likelihood of more buffer stock intervention in the next few years is considerable'. Last year the stock rose from 60,000 tonnes to 170,000 tonnes and could reach its ceiling of 550,000 tonnes 'before 1995'. But a world economic recovery, the report says, could mean a big change. The long period of low prices has led to a fall in the growth of new planting. 'If the (world) economy recovers . . . it may be difficult to produce enough natural rubber in the second half of the current decade and in the first decade of the next century to satisfy demand.' Increases in production are expected to come from Thailand, rising from 1.27m tonnes in 1990 to 1.76m tonnes by 2000, and Indonesia, from 1.25m tonnes to 1.67m tonnes in the same period. These large increases will be necessary to offset an expected decline in Malaysia's production from 1.32m tonnes to 961,000 tonnes in the current decade. Donor agencies say farmers replanting now will get a good price when their trees reach maturity. In Indonesia, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have committed more than Dollars 300m in projects to rehabilitate and expand smallholder plantations.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Greek-language Nicosia dailies on 2 June  carry commentaries on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  report to the Security Council on the outcome of negotiations on  the confidence-building measures which was released 1 June.    Pro-Democratic Rally ALITHIA carries a 650-word commentary  on  page one entitled, "Implementing the Butrus-Ghali Report," which  the writer describes as satisfactory in its description of  events. However, the writer notes: "The second part of  Butrus-Ghali's report with the five alternatives he suggests to  the Security Council may not be considered a dramatic cure with  radical (depending on the seriousness of the interpretation)  measures, but it is a prescription based on the recognition of  the other side's responsibility for the impasse." The writer  discusses the first option, which is the withdrawal of the  United Nations from Cyprus, and notes that this would be unfair  for the weaker side, the Greek Cypriot side. He adds: "The UN  secretary general's alternatives may not be absolutely  satisfactory, but they offer our side the possibility to demand  safety and security in accordance with the principles of  international law and the UN Charter. Besides the fact that  Butrus-Ghali suggests alternatives, he leaves no doubt as to  which can be implemented and productive. At the same time, he  does not avoid the extreme suggestion of exerting pressure on  the other side by taking steps so that it will accept the  confidence-building measures." The writer concludes: "The most  positive aspect of the report is that it condemns the other  side's firm negative stance. It objectively describes reality  and makes the Security Council aware of its responsibilities.  It is a report on wise use and not irresponsible rejection."    The conservative, nationalist I SIMERINI carries a 700-word  editorial on page one entitled, "Disengagement Now" in which the  writer says that following a "scandalous" tolerance toward  Denktas, the UN secretary general was "forced" to blame the  Turkish side for the impasse. The writer says: "Expressions  like, `the situation is not satisfactory,' `there is no  political will for a solution,' and `we should search for new  processes,' muddies the waters and actually attributes blame  where it does and does not belong. The blame for the outcome of  the latest negotiating effort is placed on Denktas, but there is  an attempt to create the impression that everyone is responsible  since, for 30 years `it has been proven that there is no  political will for a solution.' The UN secretary general  proposed five alternatives on which the Security Council is  called upon to decide. The very first `option' is a punishment  for the victim, which is the Greek Cypriot side!" The writer  says that this is not a new proposal but one that first came to  light two years ago, and concludes: "If there is time and  willingness to muddle along and make a new mockery, it does not  depend on us. Because, let us not kid ourselves, the backstage  now promotes a `new beginning' with another framework and pseudo  names for the same things, and with new deadlines and new  wishful promises. Anyone who wants to can get tangled deeper by  assuming political and historical responsibility."    The independent O AGON carries a 300-word commentary on page  four entitled, "The Post-Report Period." The writer says that  following the long-awaited report, everyone now wonders what  will happen with the secretary general's suggestions. The  writer says: "Unfortunately, the placement of blame on the  Turkish Cypriot side is not accompanied with clear views on how  to bend Denktas' intransigence. The five options for  alternative actions submitted by Butrus-Ghali cannot be  considered positive because they either turn against our side  (withdrawal of UNFICYP, UN Forces in Cyprus) or limit the Cyprus  issue to the confidence-building measures and a plan." The  writer concludes with the following: "We want to believe that  our side will not waste time in a never-ending discussion over  the positive and negative points of the Butrus-Ghali report. We  want to believe that this time with what we have learned from  the process we will enact a policy different from the ones that  only lead us to `descriptive reports.'"    KHARAVYI, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party AKEL,  carries  its commentary in the 400-word "Controversy" column by "Arkanis"  (pseudo name for the writer) on page one under the headline, "A  First Evaluation." The writer says the UN secretary general's  report justifies AKEL's positions and dissolves the Kliridhis  Government's illusions about alternative plans of action. He  adds: "The most substantive part of the UN secretary general's  report is the one that talks about how to proceed. This part of  the report is also dissatisfying because, despite the fact that  it stresses the Turkish intransigence, the five points of the  Butrus-Ghali proposals to the Security Council on how to proceed  are not the ones that our side would have liked." He says:  "The UN secretary general's report justifies AKEL's position  for return to the substance of the Cyprus issue based on a plan  and map, and the implementation of alternative actions that will  force the Turkish side to withdraw its unacceptable conditions  on substance and adjusts its positions based on the Butrus-Ghali  proposals." The writer concludes: "Unfortunately for our side,  the developments fully justify the positions of AKEL. Perhaps  the direction of developments could have been different if  AKEL's views and suggestions regarding Security Council  Resolution 789 were taken into consideration and not destroyed  to serve election expediencies. The way out of today's situation  is offered only through our proposal for a return to the  substance of the Cyprus issue."</p>

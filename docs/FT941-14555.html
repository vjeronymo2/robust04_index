			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Plutonium gets star treatment Plutonium may be one of the most toxic substances on earth, but it is safe enough to drink, says the Japanese government, which is promoting plutonium before the launch in April of Monju, the country's first fast breeder reactor. A cartoon video made last year by Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development (PNC), an affiliate of the Science and Technology Agency, shows Pluto, an atom-shaped cartoon character, informing a boy taking gulps from a jug that drinking water containing plutonium is harmless to the body since it is not easily absorbed by the stomach and intestines. The government has been trying to reverse the negative image of nuclear power which spread among ordinary Japanese since the wave of international criticism over a shipment of plutonium from France in 1992, and Russia's dumping of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan last October. The video, however, intended for a teenage audience, has alarmed environmental groups which claim the explanation is highly misleading. An official at PNC said although the video explained that plutonium was hazardous to the human body if it was taken into the lungs or absorbed by the bones, 'we didn't want people to be too scared of plutonium'. Meanwhile, Japan's nine electricity companies yesterday officially approved the construction of Monju's successor. The companies expect the construction of the fast breeder reactor, almost three times as powerful as Monju, to start early next century, although plans for financing have yet to be finalised and the site decided on. The move came as 11 leading US anti-nuclear groups urged the companies to give up the plutonium programme.</p>

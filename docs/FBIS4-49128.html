			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Zhigao] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, May 2 (XINHUA)--The Hong Kong dollar  notes issued by Bank of China (BOC) are officially put into  circulation here today with a ceremony held inside the BOC tower  and thousands of customers on long queues outside the tower  waiting for getting the new banknotes. Long queues were seen  at 31 sub-branches and 44 automatic teller machines of the BOC  Hong Kong branch throughout the territory. Many of them started  waiting for their turns at midnight. "It's very memorable," an  old customer told reporters in the BOC tower with the new  banknotes in his hands. Speaking at the celebration ceremony,  Wang Qiren, chairman of the directors board of the BOC,  described the issuance as "a very significant event for BOC  throughout its over 80 years of operation" and "an important  occasion in the economic life of Hong Kong". "BOC's  participation in note-issuing indicates China's confidence in  the future of Hong Kong and the bank's readiness to undertake,  with its strength and reputation, the responsibility for Hong  Kong's smooth transition," Wang said. "As one of the note  issuing banks, bank of China will operate strictly in accordance  with the financial laws and regulations of Hong Kong and, along  with the Hongkong Bank and the Standard Chartered Bank, continue  to play its part for the monetary stability and development of  Hong Kong," he said. Citing an old Chinese saying: The  ability of horse is known by travelling far and the faithfulness  of a person is revealed by the lapse of time, he said, "ever  since its establishment, Bank of China has always followed its  objective of taking root in Hong Kong and rendering services in  Hong Kong." "For a long time," he said, "the bank has actively  contributed to maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong  Kong and has won the confidence and trust of the public. By the  same token, our issue of banknotes has also received extensive  support from the local community." Wang said the issue of Hong  Kong dollar notes by Bank of China, from planning to official  circulation took only 20 months to complete. This speedy  process has been made possible through the great support and  cooperation given by many related parties in Hong Kong and in  the mainland. He expressed, on behalf of Bank of China head  office, heartfelt gratitude to all those who have rendered their  great support towards the issue of new banknotes. Among  hundreds attending the ceremony were Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok  Ying-tung, both vice chairmen of the national committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Lu Ping,  director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State  Council, Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong  branch, and Jin Renqing, vice minister of finance, as well as  well-known figures Li Ka-shing, Kuok Hock-nien and Li Kwok-po.  Cutting ribbon for the ceremony were Chen Yuan, vice president  of the People's Bank of China, Wang Qiren, chairman of BOC  Directors Board, Huang Diyan, vice chairman of BOC Directors  Board and chief executive of BOC Hong Kong-Macao regional  office, and Zhou Zhenxing, general manager of BOC Hong Kong  branch, as well as Joseph Yam, chief executive of Hong Kong  monetary authority.

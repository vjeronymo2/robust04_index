			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 19  April.    A study by oil specialist Leonardo Montiel Ortega indicates  Venezuelan refineries overseas, far from being profit makers,  produce net losses of more than $96.3 million. These losses are  due to the $.86 price differential at which Venezuela sells its  crude to the refinery Citgo in the United States. Venezuela  dispatched to that refinery 305,000 barrels during 1993, at an  average price of $13.01 a barrel, while the average price for  Venezuelan crude was $13.87. In addition, this refinery does not  process heavy oils, resulting in diminished Venezuelan sale  possibilities. Montiel recommends these loss makers be sold.  (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 11 April 1994 p 1-21]    Mexico is backing Venezuela' efforts to get the  Brussels-based Customs Affairs Council to accept its Oremulsion  as a bituminous oil and thus avoid tariff difficulties in world  markets. Venezuela has no vote or veto power in the council and  has enlisted Mexico's assistance. Venezuelan Petroleum President  Luis Giusti estimates Venezuelan oil will fetch $10.50 a barrel,  but he did not rule out the possibility of reaching $11.50, the  budgeted amount for 1994. A recent decision by the European  Union Nomenclature Committee classified Oremulsion as a bitumen  (Code 2714), which increases the possibility of placing greater  volumes of oil on the world market. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in  Spanish 14 April 94 E-8)    The Council of Ministers approved an initiative on 13 April  to raise urban minimum wages to 15,000 bolivares, 12,500  bolivares in rural areas. Observers believe, considering the  state of the Venezuelan economy and the constant protests by the  public and private sector, this increase in the minimum wage  will be well received. An important aspect of this decree, which  was not disclosed to the media because certain adjustments were  still pending at the time of approval, is that only 30 percent  of the increase will be used as a base rate to estimate  contributions to social security, a possibility already  anticipated in Articles 138 and 171 of the Labor Code.

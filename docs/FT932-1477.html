			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollars rises to just below DM1.70 HEAVY BUYING of the dollar by big US investment funds helped the currency rise to just below DM1.70 as favourable sentiment towards the dollar gained momentum, writes Sandeep Deol. After a subdued morning session, the US currency hit a high of DM1.6990 before light profit-taking pulled it back to DM1.6970 by the close of European trading, to show a gain of 0.8 pfennig on the day. In New York it finished at DM1.6960. A breach of DM1.70 is the next target many dealers have in mind. The catalyst for this could be an easing today in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase tender - known as the repo - or the release of US May durable goods data. The announcement by the German central bank that the repo would be at a variable rate dashed hopes of a sizeable rate cut. Even so, the market is still looking for an easing in the order of 5 to 10 basis points from 7.60 per cent. Whatever happens, Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS, suggested that over the next few months the D-Mark will weaken against most major currencies on the grounds that German interest rates will almost certainly decline. Mr Persaud expects the US currency to continue to climb in the near term, hitting DM1.72 in the next few weeks. Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson, disagrees. He expects the dollar to pause and consolidate at around DM1.67 before resuming its climb. Mr Callow believes that until the US Federal Reserve gives more tangible signs of a monetary tightening, the US currency could find a move to levels above DM1.70 difficult to sustain. The dollar strengthened slightly against the yen, ending at Y111.35, up from Monday's close of Y111.10. Near-term gains are seen limited in spite of the political uncertainty in Japan. The US unit eased back in New York to end at Y110.92. The weakness of the D-Mark yesterday allowed the Irish central bank to trim its short-term facility rate by  1/4 percentage point to 7.75 per cent and its overnight lending rate to 4.50 per cent. The punt held steady after the cut, trading at DM2.4427 in late European trade. The French franc, which had softened a touch on Monday following the Bank of France's easing of official interest rates, finished little changed yesterday at FFr3.364 against the D-Mark from FFr3.360 the day before. Sterling saw a quiet session and ended down  1/2 pfennig at DM2.5075. Against the dollar it lost nearly a cent, finishing at Dollars 1.4780. Better than expected first-quarter GDP data for the UK showing a revised quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.4 per cent against an initial estimate of 0.3 per cent had little effect on the market. The current account deficit widened to Pounds 4.01bn in the first quarter of this year from Pounds 3.88bn in the fourth quarter of 1992.</p>

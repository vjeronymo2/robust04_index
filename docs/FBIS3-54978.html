The ITAR-TASS correspondent  was told today by the department of press and information of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] that on Monday evening subunits  of the Azerbaijani Army, which had gone on the offensive, were  forced to retreat to their original positions after losing two  armored vehicles and with around 90 soldiers and officers  killed. Five soldiers were killed and 13 injured on the  Karabakh side.    According to a report from the news service of the NKR  defense army, instances of Azerbaijani servicemen voluntarily  giving themselves up as prisoners have increased. Fourteen  people have done this over the past two weeks. The prisoners  say that they are being forced into this because they are  frightened of being shot by mine-laying detachments coming from  behind. Among the soldiers in the mine-laying detachments are  Afghan mojahedin and the fact of their involvement in the  Karabakh war on the Azerbaijani side is admitted by both  military experts and independent observers.    According to the NKR State Committee for Defense, there are  more than 40 seized documents in Stepanakert that show that  around 1,500 Afghan mojahedin are involved in the conflict on  the Azerbaijani side. They came to Azerbaijan as far back as  July last year. The mojahedin's subunits are also suffering  losses.</p>

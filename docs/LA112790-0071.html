			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAW AND GOVERNMENT MAGNET SCHOOL SLATED TO OPEN IN L.A.;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: IT WOULD BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE STATE. THE EXPANSION OF THE  PROGRAM DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE DISTRICT MAY USE FEDERAL GRANT MONEY.  </P> <P> California's first magnet school specializing in law and government is expected  to open next fall at Monroe High School in Sepulveda, Los Angeles school  officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The new magnet program would offer students the chance to study firsthand the  workings of criminal and civil courts, police operations and a host of related  fields, including court reporting, forensics and even politics, the officials  said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District also hopes to expand its Downtown  Business High School magnet to include its first fashion design program and to  create its first public administration magnet at Wilson High School. In  addition, district officials are hoping to open a math and science magnet at  Westchester High School and a foreign language and international studies magnet  at Gardena High School.  </P> <P> Officials said final approval depends on whether the U.S. Department of  Education will allow the district to use federal grant money for the projects.  The financially strapped district hopes to use a portion of a $3.4-million  grant it received two years ago, district officials said.  </P> <P> The new magnets would join more than 90 specialized learning centers that serve  about 30,000 of the system's 625,000 students. Currently, the magnets  specialize in the sciences, performing arts, business and humanities, and are  among the system's most popular programs.  </P> <P> Courses in the fashion program would include design and marketing, with help  expected from downtown garment industry professionals. The proposed public  administration magnet would teach students how city and county government  agencies operate.  </P> <P> As part of the law and government program, Monroe Principal Joan Elam said she  would like to convert one of the classrooms at the San Fernando Valley school  into a simulated courtroom, where students could stage mock trials and hold  debates.  </P> <P> "Beginning in the 10th grade we are hoping to have regular trips to local  courthouses, probation departments and police stations," Elam said.  "Eleventh-graders will study state law and government, while seniors will  concentrate on national and international law and government."  </P> <P> Despite the chance that money troubles could delay the opening of the projects,  Elam next week will visit law and government high schools operating in New  York. Elam's trip is being subsidized in part by the Los Angeles Educational  Partnership, a nonprofit organization sponsoring academic programs to improve  city schools.  </P> <P> "We support the law and government magnet," said Judy Johnson, the group's  program director.  </P> <P> School board member Julie Korenstein, who represents the area where Monroe is  located, has also pushed for the magnet. "We hope students become intrigued and  interested enough to pursue a law-related profession," she said.  </P> <P> Even if students do not enter one of those fields, establishment of the school  is important, said Marshall Croddy, program director for the Los Angeles-based  Constitutional Rights Foundation. The foundation, a nonprofit educational  group, has pushed for establishment of such a magnet in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "There are underlying values that infuse our entire governmental system," said  Croddy. "We want students to have a much better understanding of those values  and see how they are applied and to have a basic understanding of democratic  principals and the value of the Constitution."  </P> <P> Croddy said the Monroe magnet could attract students to law-related fields and  help train good citizens and "adults who will be prepared to deal with a legal  system that dominates our lives."  </P></p>

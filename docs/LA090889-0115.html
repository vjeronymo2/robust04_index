			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN  </P> <P> When Zsa Zsa Gabor, queen of carats, goes for her day in court Monday, don't  expect to see her swathed in her usual get-up of diamonds and furs. Gabor tells  Listen she is going to dress in basic black and pearls. "I'm going to wear my  black Donna Karan. She's been my favorite designer for the last year, you know,  dah-link, her clothes fit me so well." The Karan black wool wrap-around style  is one of many by the same designer that Gabor says she buys in Palm Beach and  wherever she finds them on sale. "I love to buy things on sale," she confesses.  As for accessories, she says she will stick with her pearls, and as an  afterthought, maybe will add a rose, but not a hat. "My hair will be done  beautifully by Michael Disney," she says. (He has a salon in Los Angeles.)  That's a switch from her regular, Julius Bengtsson, who also styles Nancy  Reagan's hair. It sounds as if he's been busy. "If I waited for him, I'd be  doing it myself in the bathtub," Gabor says. She hasn't made any wardrobe plans  beyond day one of her court appearances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arsenio Goes Italian  </P> <P> Get ready to see Arsenio Hall in nothing but custom-tailored, double-breasted  Italian suits when he hosts his talk show on Channel 13 this fall. Along with  the debonair suits by Canali, the genial host will turn up in zippy accessories  that range from lapel pins, wide ties and tie clips down to "beautifully  patterned socks," says Sami Dinar, whose Beverly Hills' menswear store is  responsible for Hall's new sartorial image.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mystery Designer  </P> <P> Superstars Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass and Adolfo hit the road a dozen times  a year to hype their collections nationwide. And then there is Linda Allard.  Hardly anybody recognizes her name, even though her high-profile client list  includes newswomen Mary Alice Williams, Deborah Norville, Tawny Little and  Tritia Toyota, all of whom probably think of her as Ellen Tracy -- the label  she designs for. In her first Southland store emergence in about a decade, at  Bullock's, Allard kept a low, low, low profile. But Listen heard enough about  her to compile a thumbnail sketch, which ought to please her silent silent  majority fans (wholesale sales are a walloping $150 million per year, she  says.) Allard joined the Ellen Tracy company in 1962; five years ago her name  went on the label alongside the fictitious Tracy. Fortysomething, she is single  ("Basically my life style revolves around my work."), a benefactor of the  American Ballet Theatre and she spends weekends in Connecticut.

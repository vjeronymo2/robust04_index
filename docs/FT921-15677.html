			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / French Socialist high-flier keeps eyes on the top-most peak THE FRONT ranks of the French political establishment are crowded with glittering high-fliers, but the curriculum vitae of 45-year-old Laurent Fabius, who will today be voted first secretary of the Socialist Party, is considerably more brilliant than most. Many of his rivals were groomed for their fast-track public careers at Sciences Po' or the Ecole Nationale d'Administration; Mr Fabius not only went to both these exclusive institutions, he also picked up an agregation (diploma) in modern letters at the ultra-intellectual Ecole Normale Superieure. His brilliance carried him with preternatural speed up the ladder of political promotion. At the age of 30 he was appointed chief private secretary to Mr Francois Mitterrand, then head of the Socialist party. Five years later, after Mr Mitterrand's presidential victory in the election of 1981, Mr Fabius was made budget minister. In 1984, he became the youngest French prime minister in more than 100 years; when his government fell in the Socialist defeat of 1986, he was still only 39. There is now only one peak left for Laurent Fabius to conquer, and that is the presidency. That is why he has been so determined to take control of the party apparatus, because it should give him bargaining power to secure the party nomination, and leverage over campaigning power thereafter. With the warm support of President Mitterrand, who has long treated him as his dearest dauphin, Mr Fabius formed his own party faction and in 1988 tried to capture the party leadership; but in their first open challenge to the president's will, the party barons chose Pierre Mauroy instead. He made another assault at the party congress two years later, but was again beaten back, by an alliance between the factions of Mr Michel Rocard, the former prime minister, and Mr Lionel Jospin, the education minister. This week Mr Fabius has been third time lucky, but only because Mr Rocard switched alliances. In the past the latter has regarded Mr Fabius as a key rival in the presidential stakes. But right now he is even more nervous of a challenge from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who belongs to the Jospin faction. The irony is that the price of Mr Fabius' long-delayed victory is a virtual acknowledgment that it will be Mr Rocard, not he, who will be the party's candidate in the next presidential elections. That was the quid pro quo for the deal, but in any case he trails far behind both Mr Delors and Mr Rocard in the opinion polls. His lack-lustre reputation may have something to do with his image as a rich bourgeois and a ruthless intellectual. His tenure as prime minister was certainly tarnished by his handling of the Greenpeace scandal, when he squirmed shamelessly to evade responsibility for the sinking by French secret agents of the Rainbow Warrior boat. His image may yet flourish again: he still has plenty of time, especially if the relevant horizon is not the next presidential election, due in 1995, but the one after that. But his immediate test is to rescue the party from its current doldrums. All the indications point to a serious defeat for the Socialists in next year's general election; if he can minimise that defeat, his standing in the party will rise sharply. Whether he has the political flair required must still be an open question. No-one ever claimed that he was an instinctive Socialist with a burning faith; it is hard to believe that this middle-class egg-head will ever acquire the common touch. But if intelligence is enough to revive the French Socialist party for the 21st century, Laurent Fabius may be the man.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on internview with ANC Natal/Kwazulu premier </F> candidate Jacon Zuma by Stephen Laufer in Natal on 17 April]    [Text] Rising to greet King Goodwill Zwelithini's wife  Buhle Mathe, Inkatha chief Mangosuthu Buthelezii and the  National Party's Natal leader George Bartlett at last Sunday's  Jesus Peace Rally in Durban, the ANC's Jacob Zuma already had  the aura of the regional premiership about him. Zuma was the  first of the dignitaries to arrive at the ecumenical event,  adopting the attitude of the man in the driving seat as the  others entered the presidential box at King's Park Stadium.    Still 11 days away from almost certain victory in the  regional election, he was a man on a mission. Zuma knows that  he will need to build a broad church if he is to govern South  Africa's second most populous province successfully. So  although shirtsleeves sufficed for Mathe, a friend of Zuma's  wife from schooldays, there was respect in the elaborate  gestures of greeting. For the pin-striped Buthelezi, Zuma donned  his elegant double-breasted suit jacket before an apparently  warm embrace and a quick one-on-one chat in the corner.  Arriving just a few minutes later, Bartlett was greeted no less  enthusiastically.    Of Buthelezi, Zuma said: "I have spoken to him many times.  We have very warm relations." It was Sunday, two days before  Buthelezi's decision to enter the election process, but Zuma  will not write off the Inkatha chief. The agenda of the Jesus  Rally was coalition building: no one would be excluded from  contributing to stability and growth in Natal/KwaZulu, no matter  their previous track records, no matter the legacy of enmity and  bloodshed.    Zuma has the confidence of a man who believes history is on  his side. His conviction that he is on a winning wicket flows  less from the Marxist theory he learnt from Harry Gwala on  Robben Islannd than the progression of his own life. It's been  a long road from his impoverished childhood as the son of a  domestic worker too poor to send him to school to a position of  influence as a leading ANC strategist. They were years of  struggle and hardship Zuma describes without a hint of pathos,  always with the soft smile of a man at east in his own ability.    Almost 40 years have passed since his political education  began in Cato Manor, more than 20 since his release from a  decade on Robben Island, four since his emergence from the  gruelling life of an underground operative.    "I have accomplished an ambition: to see South Africa free,"  he said, munching on a banana during the drive to an election  rally in Pietermaritzburg's Imbali township after the Durban  peace meeting. "The next task is to build the nation, to end  conflict. It will centre in Natal/KwaZulu. Things could go  wrong for the whole nation here -- or they could go right. That  is why I chose to leave politics at national level and work  here."    He appears to have weathered the storm raised by the inquiry  into abuse of prisoners in the ANC camps in Angola -- there is  no hint that he has been packed off to the provinces because he  is no longer viable on the national stage. Zuma is no stranger  to the art of politics, once described by the German sociologist  Max Weber as the patient drilling of holes in very thick boards.  He has been involved in endless discussions and strategy  sessions aimed at bringing Inkatha and the white ultra-rightwing  into the electoral process. The participation of Inkatha and  Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front in next week's elections is in  part his work. He has patiently built a relationship with King  Goodwill, who he says is a Christian who wants peace. "He is  troubled by the deaths," says Zuma, "he wants his people to live  in harmony."    But he is not uncritical of the monarch to whom he  professes allegiance. Referring to a rally in Durban's Umlazi  township last Saturday at which Nelson Mandela led an estimated  20,000 strong crowd in paying homage to the king, Zuma says he  asked himself: "If the king doesn't understand these are his  people, then what language does he speak?" The crowd's  enthusiasm for the monarchy was genuine, says Zuma: "It  electrified the rally. The king should realise some are made to  look like enemies, but they love him, they respect him."    The monarchy has been manipulated, believes Zuma, not just  by  Ulundi's current office-holders, but by the apartheid and  colonial authorities who went before. "People in general are  happy to see the lost dignity of the monarchy restored," he  says, referring to the ANC's constitutional proposals which  accord a status similar to that of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II  to the Zulu royal house.    For Zuma, a modern democracy needs to continue limiting the  monarch's influence, if with a new subtly. So he seeks to  temper constitutional generosity towards Zwelithini with subtle  pointers to the legitimate claims of others. His knowledge of  the royal houses of South Africa is an asset here, a reflection  both of his roots in traditional Zulu society as the son of a  member of the royal house of Zuma and his skill as a politician.    When talk with church leaders turned on Sunday to the royal  houses, Zuma was quick to respond to mention of the Hlubes in  the Estcourt area by saying "they contest (Zwelithini's  sovereignty over them), they claim never to have been defeated  by Shaka." He goes on to give many other examples of royal  houses with separate claims to recognition. With much of his  childhood spend roaming between Durban, Mapumulo and Nkandla in  the Zulu heartland, Zuma spans the spectrum of Zulu society from  the traditional to the modern, from the rural to the urban. He  clearly believes that loyalty to the king is the duty of every  Zulu, but that democracy demands that the king be shown the  limits of his power.    Democracy was learnt at the knee of his half-brother  Mntukabongwa, an ANC and South African Congress of Trade Unions  activist at the Joko tea factory in Durban. It was the  beginning of a road which saw Zuma joining Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] at its foundation,  arrested while leaving the country for military training, and  sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. Released in 1973, he  immediately returned to underground work to reconstruct the ANC  networks destroyed by the police. Skipping to Swaziland when  the net closed in, he illegally returned to South Africa several  times. "If they'd have caught me, they would have killed me,"  he says. "So I had to plan my trips in great detail; that way I  could be safe."    On a bus ride in northern Zululand, Zuma came close to  having  to shoot it out with the police. "I'd planned to seize their  weapons, but they weren't looking for me. It left me a little  shaken." The risks were worthwhile, says Zuma. "You weren't  running the struggle by remote control. You could shape the  structures on the ground." Shaping a new Natal/KwaZulu, and  through it South Africa, will be Zuma's task in the next five  years. A graduate of informal night schools and Robben Island  study circles, and the father of 10 children, he is determined  to give education spending very high priority. "I'd like to  retire from active politics at the next election," he insists.  "I'll be 57. A cottage by the sea, with the waves lapping,  would be wonderful. I love the sea."</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Japan to shelve Boeing airliner venture Japan is to suspend an 11-year-old joint airliner development project with Boeing, the US aerospace group - a setback to Japanese efforts to create a world-class aerospace industry. The spur is Boeing's decision, late last year, to modernise its best-selling 737 short-to-medium-range airliner before developing the new aircraft jointly with Japan - known as the YXX. The move is a reflection of the pressure on costs imposed by the weakness of demand from airlines. Tokyo has decided to shelve work on the 150-seat YXX and to reduce spending this year to the minimum needed to tie up the project, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The YXX, as originally planned, would be so close to the upgraded 737, known as the 737-X, that the joint project would no longer work in its present form, Miti officials said. However, Boeing has not formally cancelled the YXX. The discord over the YXX is reminiscent of the squabbles between Japan and the US over the development of a joint air fighter, the FSX, in the 1980s. Japan's trade partners, particularly the US, are ambiguous over its attempts to create a competitive aerospace industry. It is one of the few manufacturing sectors where the US can achieve a trade surplus. Both the YXX and the FSX were overshadowed by US fears that Japan was acquiring technology too cheaply. Boeing and Japan Aircraft Development Corporation, a consortium of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, signed a memorandum of understanding for a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.14bn) development plan for the YXX in 1984. Of that, the Japanese side was to pay 25 per cent, with the rest covered by Boeing and other partners. Instead, the Japanese aerospace consortium is now seeking to supply components for the 737-X, on which it might be offered contracts for wing parts. It is also pursuing a separate Y80bn (Pounds 479.04m) plan for a smaller passenger aircraft, with international partners. That project, known as the YSX, is for a 70-to-80-seat short-range aircraft, to be in service by the end of the decade. The consortium started a feasibility study with Miti in 1989 and has approached several potential partners, including Boeing, Saab-Scania of Sweden, Aviation de Transport Regional, a Franco-Italian joint venture, and Aviation Industries of China. But no final decision has been made, a Miti official said.</p>

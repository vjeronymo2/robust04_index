			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reconstruction for Govett Atlantic Govett Atlantic Investment Trust is considering a capital reconstruction. The move is aimed at narrowing the discount between the trust's net asset value and its market value. It is seen as a defence against a possible bid from Mr Andrew Shechtel, a US entrepreneur, who recently acquired a 5 per cent stake. Mr Kevin Pakenham, Govett's chief executive, would not give any details but said a further announcement would be made when the trust had identified what it considered to be the best course. Last November, Sequoia Investment Trust, Govett's largest shareholder, sold its 23.5 per cent stake - some 19m shares - at below the then market price. Mr Shechtel bought a little more than 4m shares and the rest were sold to more than 30 institutions.</p>

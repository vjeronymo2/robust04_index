			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Appeal by APF, Musavat Party, People's Liberation Party and </F> Azerbaijan Democratic Party: "Appeal to Opposition Parties by  Leaders of Information Structures of Political Organizations"]    [Text] For more than a month meetings of political  structures of political organizations have been held regularly.  In this period a communique reflecting the principles of  cooperation of these structures has been signed, regularized  exchanges of information have been set up, important steps have  been taken in the defense of freedom of speech and of the press  in Azerbaijan, and appeal has been passed to state organs about  unifying forces in the sector of eliminating problems created by  Armenian aggression, and a joint press conference by opposition  parties was organized for the first time.    These meetings helped to bring together the positions of  parties on a number of important issues and prepared the ground  for their broad cooperation.    But now the need to broaden the circle of joint activity of  the political structures of political organizations and to  develop and strengthen domestic and foreign ties demands that  the work of these meetings be built up to a qualitatively new  level. This is only possible under conditions that other  structures of the parties begin to cooperate.    At a period when the sociopolitical situation in Azerbaijan  is gradually worsening and social conditions are becoming more  serious, and in a period when problems created by the war have  reached dangerous limits, establishing such unity would be a  great step in the direction of finding the optimal way out of  the situation, maintaining stability in the country, and  creating civic solidarity.    Taking all of this into consideration, we appeal to the  parties we represent to make use of closer forms of cooperation  and expedite the work of establishing unity among the democratic  forces.    [Signed] APF [Azerbaijan People's Front], Musavat Party,  People's Liberation Party, Azerbaijan Democratic Party</p>

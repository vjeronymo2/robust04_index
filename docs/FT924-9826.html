			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Perot unconventional to the end TO THE end he was unconventional. While Bill Clinton and George Bush practised political correctness and waited until the last polls had closed on the west coast, Ross Perot threw in the towel half an hour early. But what a towel and what a concession: the man who had spent an estimated Dollars 35m (Pounds 21m) of his own money on television advertising in the last two and a half weeks did not really admit defeat at all. He said 'the battle was only beginning'. He did concede that 'the American people have spoken, they have chosen Governor Clinton, let's give him a round of applause'. Perhaps half a dozen people in a crowded Dallas hotel ballroom did as they were bid. But Mr Perot had taken his time getting there. 'You are the people who have done it all,' he proclaimed and ordered the band to play 'When the Saints go marching in'. 'You call the shots, you're the boss,' he then shouted, and ordered the band to play his new theme song, 'Crazy'. He danced with his wife then his daughter; the television networks, not exactly grateful for the largesse he had showered on them, did not know what to do and cut away to non-political commercials. They returned in time for the world to hear him say 'we're keeping going as long as you want us to keep on going'. He used one of his favourite aphorisms - 'I'm just the grain of sand in the oyster, and I irritate the oyster until the pearl comes out'. Finally he got round to saying Mr Clinton had won and he deserved all the support he could get.</p>

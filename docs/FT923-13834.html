			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics share buy-back to cost Dollars 957m GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor, announced yesterday it would be spending Dollars 957m to repurchase some 30 per cent of its stock from investors at a price of Dollars 72 1/4 a share under a buy-back plan it revealed last month. The company announced on June 8 it would buy back up to 13m of its shares, at a price of between Dollars 65 3/8 and Dollars 75 a share, under a so-called Dutch auction tender offer. This method, which became popular in the US in the 1980s and is now used for most share repurchases, involves investors specifying a price at which they would be willing to tender their shares. The company then works out the lowest price which allows it to buy all the shares it is seeking and offers that price for all validly-tendered shares. The Dollars 72 1/4 price is the same as Wednesday night's close and compares with the Dollars 65 3/8 at which the company's shares were trading before the tender offer was announced. General Dynamics said 13.2m shares were tendered at or below Dollars 72 1/4 . It would be exercising its right to increase the number of shares to be bought and would therefore accept all properly tendered stock. The share repurchase is part of a 'plan of contraction' announced by Mr William Anders, chairman of General Dynamics, who is slimming the company to four core defence businesses and returning excess cash to shareholders.</p>

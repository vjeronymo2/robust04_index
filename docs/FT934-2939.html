			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on Lasmo Storm clouds gathered over Lasmo, the troubled oil exploration group, as the market reacted to another front-line resignation from the group's board, the third in a year. Lord Rees said he is stepping down as chairman after the annual meeting next year. Lord Rees's move follows the resignation earlier this year of Mr Chris Greentree, the former chief executive and leading light in Lasmo's acquisition of Ultramar some 18 months ago, and the recent ousting of Mr Michael Pavia, former finance director. 'It is now virtually certain that the final dividend will be cut, and to make matters worse the stock is not worth Pounds 1 with oil at Dollars 13 a barrel,' said one oil sector specialist. Lasmo shares, already suffering the effects of the steep decline in crude oil prices, which were trading around the Dollars 13.50 a barrel mark yesterday, fell 6 to 109p, their lowest level since January 1987. The latest fall in oil prices followed bearish remarks made by Sheikh Yamani, the former Saudi Arabian oil minister and leading light in Opec, who said prices could well drop to Dollars 10 a barrel in the new year.</p>

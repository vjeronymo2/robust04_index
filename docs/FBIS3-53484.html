The opposition party leaders confirmed the country's dire need  for such a dialogue in order to discuss the various aspects of  political reform and the way to confront terrorism.    Kamal al-Shadhili, National Democratic Party [NDP] assistant  secretary general, said that during the first session of the  newly formed NDP Secretariat, President Mubarak defined the  NDP's policy vis-a-vis the opposition parties. President  Mubarak said that the NDP is committed to national dialogue and  its goals and to creating the right atmosphere for holding it.  Dialogue, Mubarak said, has to take place in a political  framework conducive to promoting the country's supreme interests.    Al-Shadhili added that dialogue represents one part of the  NDP's wide-ranging political bid to mobilize the country's  forces and consolidate the home front in the face of the  challenges facing Egypt, particularly that of terror.    Meanwhile, the secretary general of the National Progressive  Unionist Grouping Party described the call for national dialogue  as a civilized and positive step worthy of cooperation and every  effort to make it succeed.</p>

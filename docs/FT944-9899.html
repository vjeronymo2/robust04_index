			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Euro-fraud squad turns on the heat As cases of Eurofraud go, it is a classic. A Piedmontese farming family allegedly helped itself to Ecu62m (Pounds 48.8m) of illicit European Union agriculture subsidies by importing beef from Poland and then diverting the meat mixed up with bags of bones and skins to Malta, the Middle East and northern Africa while reserving the best cuts for local sale. The family of three now faces fraud charges in Italy, while police have also arrested 16 Customs officials in Naples thought to have played a part in the scam. Efforts to gain convictions are being assisted by Uclaf, a squad of about 60 investigators and officials who operate under the auspices of the European Commission. Uclaf, set up in 1988 and for years regarded as somewhat sleepy, has recently acquired a more dynamic image partly because of the extra attention EU officials and politicians are paying towards financial irregularities. It is thought that between 2 and 10 per cent of the EU's annual Ecu70bn budget is wasted either through fraud or lax financial checking procedures. In many cases, the complex nature of EU spending rules allows scope for fraud either by professional criminals or opportunist farmers or construction companies eligible for grants or subsidies. A long list of sloppy supervision of cash - and in some cases downright fraud in areas such as money spent on agriculture, transport and training - is likely to be highlighted tomorrow in the annual report of the Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main financial watchdog. Most of the reported frauds or 'irregularities' crop up in the EU's agriculture budget, which accounts for roughly half total spending. Many of the frauds relate to false claims by traders or food processing companies for export subsidies for transferring farm products (such as the beef in the case of the Piedmontese family) out of the union to reduce European food stocks. A second important category concerns cash channelled illicitly to farmers on the basis of false production returns covering crops such as olive oil, cotton or tobacco. According to the latest Uclaf figures, 856 suspected frauds totalling Ecu212m were reported across the EU in agriculture in the first half of 1994, compared with 1,298 cases involving Ecu248m in the whole of last year. . While the rate of increase in fraud appears to be alarming, much of it may be put down to better detection, according to Uclaf officials and thus may be seen as a positive rather than negative signal. This view underlines the point that no one really knows the extent of fraud. In an interview last week Mr Per Brix Knudsen, Uclaf's extrovert Danish director, said it was 'unfair' for onlookers automatically to assume that 10 per cent of all EU spending was wasted through fraud. Mr Knudsen took over his job in January as part of the effort to raise the unit's profile. The 10 per cent figure is based on a largely unscientific estimate made several years ago by Professor Klaus Tiedemann, a German criminologist. It has been accepted uncritically by many EU critics. Mr Knudsen, an ex-army officer turned customs official who is also an economics graduate, is admanant that the 10 per cent figure is too high. But he admits that the cash lost is undoubtedly more than the EU's own reported figures - which are based almost entirely on auditing of agriculture spending. One of the problems in obtaining an overall view about the level of EU fraud is that reported frauds in the EU's structural aid programme are virtually non-existent. The structural aid programme accounts for about a quarter of the EU budget but the detailed mechanisms to record fraud have never been put in place. Another problem is the stance of the Court of Auditors. This sees its role as inquiring into the details of specific areas of EU spending rather than looking at financial irregularities in a more generalised way. At Uclaf Mr Knudsen has identified as a priority the job of co-ordinating actions by several member states in fighting fraud - especially involving cross-border transfers or manufactured goods or agriculture products. These cases may cover not just EU spending but examples of where European countries are missing out on revenues by failing to collect taxes on goods such as imported contraband cigarettes. Many of the 90 cases Uclaf is investigating involve efforts to bring together police, prosecutors or customs investigators in a range of countries. However Mr Knudsen criticised the 'incredible slowness' of legal procedures across Europe which he said can sometimes lead to a delay of six months in getting a justice ministry in one country to release evidence to a second country with a view to aiding in a prosecution. With only a handful of cases involving EU fraud reaching trial each year, Mr Knudsen said the EU needed to show greater urgency over fraud. Mr Knudsen is keen to refute charges that Uclaf will concentrate on high-profile investigations. Just as important, he says, is work on preventing fraud by looking at possible loopholes in the EU's spending and administrative rules.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               FRAUD AND OTHER FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES IN                   EUROPEAN UNION AGRICULTURE SPENDING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                   Number of cases         Sums involved (Ecu m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990                         826                       125 1991                         600                       123 1992                        1028                       114 1993                        1298                       248 1994*                        856                       212  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *First six months.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: European Commission  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Swedish issue takes advantage of buoyant conditions THE FIRST sterling issue from Sweden since 1988 was by far the most glamorous of yesterday's stream of deals in the international bonds market. The speed with which the Pounds 600m five-year paper sold out underlined again the demand for quality Eurosterling assets and the lack of sovereign and supranational paper in the currency, said traders. Launched at Pounds 500m, it was quickly increased. The kingdom's bond is the largest single sterling Eurobond yet seen, and provides a much needed new benchmark in the absence of current coupon gilts. Traders agreed that with a launch spread of 45 basis points over comparable gilts it was correctly priced for a large issue, particularly in the light of the country's continuing heavy borrowing programme. Lead managers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and S. G. Warburg Securities said the issue was timed to take advantage of buoyant market conditions in the narrow window prior to the UK's Autumn Statement. Mr Staffan Crona, director general of the Swedish National Debt Office, said: 'We have big borrowing needs and not many issuing possibilities remain before Christmas.' The issue continues the second phase of the emergency borrowing programme drawn up by Sweden to raise a total of Ecu31bn after the late summer currency crises. Like the earlier DM2.5bn and FFr6bn bonds, proceeds will go directly into foreign currency reserves. Mr Thomas Kranzen, a deputy governor of the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, said the latest published figures showed the reserves standing at SKr176.9bn in the first week of November, compared with the low point of SKr95.2bn at the start of September. Sweden still needs to borrow a further Ecu10bn under the second phase, to meet its target of Ecu15bn, but Mr Crona says the timetable for meeting that target is more relaxed now that the reserves have been rebuilt and the programme can extend into next year. Commenting on market rumours that Sweden will make a large borrowing in US dollars before the end of the year, Mr Crona would not rule this out. 'We are discussing different alternatives with the banks,' he said. The dollar alternatives include floating rate notes, straight Eurobonds and global issues. Sweden's official forecast remains that it will not need to raise new foreign borrowings beyond the Ecu15bn, although it will refinance some maturing foreign debt. It plans to tap the domestic market to meet its other needs. There are conflicting views on where the sterling market is heading after the Autumn Statement. Some feel it could continue to perform well over the next few weeks. Others argue that it will be adversely affected by the UK's growing public sector borrowing requirement. Almost eclipsed by Sweden, KfW International Finance's DM1.5bn five-year bond duly emerged with a launch spread of 22 basis points over German government bonds. The European Investment Bank followed the success of its Pounds 200m issue with two other bonds, one for SFr200m over five years at 6 per cent through Swiss Volksbank, the other for Dollars 120m over four years at 5 3/4 per cent through Credit Suisse First Boston. Wood Gundy launched two coupon-driven retail-targetted CDollars 100m deals, for Communaute de Montreal and Caisse Centrale Desjardins du Quebec.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Japan It is a measure of the growing optimism about the Japanese economy that political turmoil left financial markets unmoved. The main danger is that the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa leaves this year's budget - and the economic stimulus measures which depend on it - in limbo. But that threat will only become real if the ruling coalition is unable to agree on the next prime minister and a general election follows. It seems more likely that a change of faces at the top will finally end the horse-trading which has delayed the budget so far. On that basis the small rise in equities yesterday makes perfect sense. While industrial output and capital spending are still in the doldrums, consumer spending is finally gathering momentum in line with a recovery in the housing market. If economic policy does not suffer serious disruption in the wake of Mr Hosokawa's resignation, and a rising yen does not undermine Japanese exporters as it did last year, a modest consumer-led recovery now looks assured. True, the impact of politics on the foreign exchange markets is difficult to judge. Hopes of early progress on trade with the US - which might have been achieved at next week's multilateral trade conference in Marrakesh - must have faded. The prospects for a settlement thereafter turn on the next prime minister. But an international figure such as Mr Tsutomu Hata might be better placed to secure a deal than his predecessor. If that gave the yen room to fall, the wider economy would benefit.</p>

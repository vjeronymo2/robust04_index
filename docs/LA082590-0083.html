			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LO-TEC OFFERING BLENDS NEW DANCE, MUSIC  </P> <P> Beth Mehocic may be a one-of-a-kind in the music and dance world.  </P> <P> "It's possible that I'm the only composer that ever founded a dance company,"  Mehocic said, "but I have always visualized images, shapes and dance designs  when I composed music, even as a child.  </P> <P> "When I was in college, they declared me a dance/music specialist. Everything I  hear, I see -- and I'm able to verbalize what I see in the designs. Most  composers don't see anything."  </P> <P> It was Mehocic's knack for fusing kinetic and aural images that led to the  creation of the Las Vegas Music and Dance Ensemble, an interdisciplinary troupe  that blends new dance and original music into a single aesthetic experience.  The troupe will make its San Diego debut in a Lo-Tec concert at Three's  Company's Hillcrest studio this weekend.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, we won't be able to bring any musicians with us for our San  Diego concert," Mehocic said. "Live musicians are a luxury when funding is  scarce. But I handle all the technical support for our concerts, and I make  sure the sound quality is very good."  </P> <P> Because Mehocic is artistic director of the Vegas-based ensemble as well as  composer-in-residence and music director for the Department of Dance Arts at  the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, her main contribution to the company is  musical. The composer created two of the three original scores on this  weekend's program.  </P> <P> "I did the score for 'Moving Through Blue' (inspired by the blues movie '  'Round Midnight') and 'A Lost Maiden' (a world premiere based on an American  Indian legend)," Mehocic said. "Allen Strange, a California composer, did the  other work."  </P> <P> All of the dances on the Las Vegas Music and Dance Ensemble's portion of the  program were choreographed by Carole Rae, but because Mehocic is fluent in both  music and dance language, the melding of the two art forms should be seamless.  If past experience is a reliable guide, this crossover concert should tap  audiences from two sides of the artistic fence.  </P> <P> "We usually have sold-out houses," Mehocic said, "because we draw from the  music community and the dance community. It's exciting to get both audiences  together."  </P> <P> Attracting music aficionados to a Lo-Tec dance concert would be a new  phenomenon in San Diego. But both halves of this weekend's double bill offer  sustenance to that portion of the arts community.  </P> <P> Lorna Dunn, a San Diego dancer who performed with Three's Company in the early  1980s, shares the Vegas-based ensemble's affinity for original music. And, with  support from a San Diego Area Dance Alliance grant, the local dance maker will  have new music for all four of her dances.  </P> <P> "I like working with original music, and I spend a lot of time going to new  music concerts," Dunn said. "I'm interested in collaborating -- not just, I  write the dance to your music, or you write the music to my dance. This is my  first solo concert. . . . Concerts are more alive with original music."  </P> <P> Dunn will have at least two string players (a violinist and a cellist)  accompany both performances, "and, with luck, we'll have one more," she said.  </P> <P> The Three's Company-trained modern dancer says it drives her "nuts to dance  with a beat. I like to move through music."  </P> <P> "That's why I use new music. I can keep my wits together if I don't have to  dance exactly on the beat."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, this solo appearance has Dunn on somewhat shaky footing.  </P> <P> "I'm very nervous," she whispered, "even though working with musicians gives me  confidence. I'm a beginning choreographer, and I'm just doing abstract dance,  no deep themes. I did that on purpose because I don't like beating the audience  over the head" with messages.  </P> <P> Dunn's program will include "Four of them," with music by Christian Hertzog,  "The Board of Examiners," the closest thing to a dramatic work from the  fledgling choreographer, "New Moon," set to a commissioned score by Christopher  Penny, and "Farandole," a dance inspired by an ancient folk form.  </P></p>

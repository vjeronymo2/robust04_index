			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Observer: Braced up Barclays Bank has bagged another brace of corporate status-symbols for its board. It now has a Japanese banker (Shijuro Ogata), and a high- flying Dutchman (Jan Peelen), to display beside its erstwhile chancellor of the exchequer and former civil-service head of the UK Treasury. A big bank needs big directors and Barclays now has same in abundance. Admittedly it's nowhere near as international as JP Morgan, with its well connected international council and a top executive where foreign-born bankers outnumber Americans 3-2. But it's streets ahead of the rest of the UK clearers. Barclays' choice of its new directors is interesting, given their Far Eastern bias. Ogata was deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, and Peelen is responsible for Unilever's East Asian and Pacific business. The explanation may be that, having failed to crack the North American market, Barclays is anxious to beef up its weak representation among the world's fastest growing economies. For a bank clearly intent on thinking big, perhaps the next step might be a Far Eastern acquisition. Standard Chartered?</p>

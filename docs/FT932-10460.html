			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Michelin uses emergency package as sales fall 14% MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre maker, has implemented an emergency rationalisation programme after suffering an unprecedented 14 per cent fall in tyre sales by volume in the first quarter of this year. The company, which is one of France's largest industrial groups, has put almost all its French factories on short-time working and has announced plans to cut 2,950 jobs in France over the next two years and to redeploy 1,900 employees. Michelin has completed a two-year programme of stringent cutbacks. It reduced its workforce by 16,000 people in 1991 and 1992 to reach the present level of just over 30,000. The group employed almost 53,000 people in 1980. The cost cutting played a critical part in Michelin's return to profit last year. The group, which had made losses in 1990 and 1991, returned to the black with a net profit of FFr79m (Dollars 14.6m) on worldwide turnover of FFr66.8bn. The 1992 profit was achieved in spite of a fall back into loss in the second half when the market declined and the group was hit by adverse exchange rates. Michelin recently warned it would be forced to make further cutbacks this year unless the tyre market improved. The group said yesterday that after the first-quarter fall in volume sales - which involved a 17 per cent fall in van tyres and 24 per cent for truck tyres - it had to take radical action to prevent stocks from rising. The company hoped to be able to reduce the number of lay-offs by encouraging employees to work part-time. However, it said it would resort to compulsory redundancy to achieve the necessary cuts. Michelin also plans a radical reorganisation of its production planning and management.</p>

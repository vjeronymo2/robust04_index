			<p>BFN     [Text] Kumamoto, March 31 KYODO -- The head of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) chapter in Kumamoto Prefecture has said  he received 1 million yen in 1982 from a campaigner for Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa when Hosokawa ran for the  governorship on the LDP ticket.    Kenshi Yonehara, head of the LDP's Kumamoto chapter, said in  an interview that he does not know whether the money was part of  the 100 million yen Hosokawa said he borrowed from the  scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin Co. around that time. Yonehara  said he received the money in December 1982 from a senior member  of the chapter who had worked to put Hosokawa on the LDP ticket  for the election in February the following year.    Yonehara said the 1 million yen was handed over after the  LDP  approved Hosokawa as its official candidate in the race,  reversing the initial decision to field then Gov. Issei Sawada  as the party's candidate. Hosokawa won the election and served  for two consecutive four-year terms until February 1991.    Hosokawa has said that he borrowed the money in September  1982 to buy a condominium in central Tokyo and repair his home  in the prefecture in western Japan, and repaid it by January 31,  1991. The premier has insisted there were no illegalities in  the loan.    The LDP, ousted from 38 years of unbroken rule last August  by  the coalition administration of Hosokawa, and the Japanese  Communist Party have been holding up debate on the budget in the  Diet by demanding Hosokawa submit detailed documents on the loan.    The opposition has also demanded Hosokawa's former secretary  testify before the Diet on the affair, which had stalled Diet  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget for three weeks.    Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a now-defunct member of the Sagawa  Kyubin group, was embroiled in a money scandal involving  gangsters and political figures, including fallen LDP kingpin  Shin Kanemaru, who was charged with tax evasion last March.</p>

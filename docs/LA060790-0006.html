			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> TINY CRACK SHOWS UP IN VOTERS' MOOD;  </P> <P> BUT THEY HAVE ENTRUSTED A MANDATE FOR NEW THINKING TO BULWARKS OF THE STATUS  QUO, WHO HAVE A 'VISION DEFICIT.'  </P> <P> Beneath the inevitable pattern of win ners and losers on Election Day there was  a changed voter mood that may shape the politics of the 1990s. The gender  barrier finally was broken in gubernatorial politics, and the electorate proved  increasingly liberal on social and economic issues, still distrustful of  government but willing to selectively earmark its own taxes toward meeting the  needs of the future.  </P> <P> The public expects an activist, rather than caretaker, approach from the next  Administration. But this was not a mandate for what the public perceives as  permissive or big-spending liberalism. The Republican rhetoric on those issues  still fits the public mood.  </P> <P> But the voters did approve spending billions on transportation programs, school  and university expansion, and new prison construction. They voted not only for  long-term bonds, but also took a regressive gas tax upon themselves, the first  such action since Proposition 13.  </P> <P> The environmental issue crested to a new power in helping defeat the  Republican-sponsored reapportionment initiatives, and in the passage of rail  transit measures and protection of wilderness for mountain lions. The  environment is sure to be the most powerful issue on the November ballot when  voters will decide on "Big Green," the initiative designed to phase out  dangerous toxics in the air, ocean and food supply. It will also be an asset to  Dianne Feinstein, who has endorsed the measure, and a probable headache for  Pete Wilson, who "supports its goals" but not its provisions.  </P> <P> There is now a crack, if not a window, of opportunity to confront problems that  are overwhelming the state. We have slipped from first to worst in the nation  in major ways. We spend the least per capita on roads and have the most  congested traffic. Only Waikiki has higher housing costs. We have the nation's  most polluted air, overcrowded classrooms, prison inmates and the highest  volume of cocaine traffic. The annual death rate from gang violence in Los  Angeles now exceeds that of Beirut's civil war. The electorate is mostly white  in a state that is mostly not. A few enjoy life in the fast lane while too many  face dead-end futures. Even the middle class, for the first time, believes that  the quality of life in California is declining.  </P> <P> Big problems demand big solutions, even bigger than a gender change in the  governor's office, and certainly bigger than passing bond measures to build  more off-ramps, prison cells and classrooms to absorb the state's swelling  population. The budget deficit does not compare to our vision deficit. We are  building infrastructure without knowing where we are going.  </P> <P> How do we make the transition to a multicultural California, with a  better-educated public, a healthy environment and a competitive economy while  growing faster than ever? There are no ready answers to a future without  precedent.  </P> <P> But we know that old answers will only keep us on the present treadmill.  Raising taxes will never keep up with the spiraling costs of administrative  bureaucracy. Cutting waste will never generate sufficient savings for new  priorities. Unprecedented incentives for long-term solutions will have to be  created in both the public and private sectors. A focus on social prevention --  of disease, of pollution, of illiteracy and drop-outs -- will be needed to  control future costs.  </P> <P> The paradox is that voters have entrusted a mandate for new thinking to  politicians who tend to be profiles in caution and bulwarks of the status quo,  who turn to commissions and polls for solutions. Both gubernatorial candidates  tend to be most comfortable as mediators in the middle of the spectrum. All the  incentives in politics are toward avoiding the bare truth where it is  complicated or controversial.  </P> <P> The challenge in the campaign and beyond will be whether new thinking can break  through cobwebbed categories, whether a California perestroika, if you will,  can take place in the traditional political order. Or are we already controlled  by the political Muzak of sound bites? If so, California will drift into its  future, increasingly ungovernable.  </P></p>

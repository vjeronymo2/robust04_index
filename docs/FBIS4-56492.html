			<p>BFN     [Text] Within the next few weeks, the government will  implement the accord by the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP], which entrusts the government with  implementation measures aimed at correcting national financial  imbalances.    Among the measures, there is the introduction of a general  tax system; reducing subsidies covering losses by enterprises;  and increasing the price of certain utilities such as  electricity, telephone, and public food services.    In the accord, the ANPP also highlighted that the government  should study the appropriateness of implementing a change in  currency and increasing the price of nonessential products such  as alcohol and cigarettes.</p>

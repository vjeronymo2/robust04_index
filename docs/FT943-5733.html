			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Locking out prying fingers Valuable packages are usually locked to ensure they are not tampered with. Encrypta Electronics, a UK security company, together with Harcor Security Seals of Australia, have developed a padlock that includes an electronic sealing system. The Nanolock generates a four-digit random number on a built-in liquid crystal display every time the lock is closed. It also displays the length of time since the padlock was closed, allowing the user to determine the precise time of an unauthorised entry.

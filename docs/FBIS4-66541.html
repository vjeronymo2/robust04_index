			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 10--For the first time, India has  given a firm schedule to the International Commission of the Red  Cross (ICRC) to go to Jammu and Kashmir. Its survey team could  visit the State, the ICRC has been told, anytime after March 20,  while any one from its side could go there for preliminary  purposes right now.    As a matter of fact, the Indian authorities offered to  arrange an immediate visit to Kashmir by the ICRC  representative, Mr. Jean Mich Elli Monod, who was here this week  for a workshop in Hyderabad. Mr. Monod, however, wanted to go  back to the headquarters in Geneva for consultations.    India also suggested that the Hyderabad workshop, in which  Mr. Monod and other representatives of the ICRC and the  commanders of the paramilitary forces took part, could be made  an on-going process. During the discussions the ICRC  representatives explained the norms that needed to be followed  in regard to the treatment of detenus and related matters while  the Indian side detailed the practices observed by the  paramilitary forces.    India's decision to give immediate access to the ICRC to  Jammu and Kashmir is the culmination of a process that began  more than a year ago, with its request for permission to send a  survey team to the State. However, a decision was delayed as the  exchange of views between the two sides got prolonged. During  this period, representatives of the Amnesty International  visited India.    The present relaxation is to be seen in the context of the  discussions that began early in 1993.    At another level, India of late stepped up its diplomatic  contacts to meet an immediate situation, created by Pakistan's  move for a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission at  Geneva. The diplomats from some 45 out of the 53  member-countries of the U.N. Commission were briefed last month  by the then Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. They also met the  Home Secretary, Mr. N.N. Vohra, in two batches. The detailed  accounts of the havoc wrought by the terrorists in Jammu and  Kashmir and their links with the outfits in the  Pakistan-occupied part of the State were supplemented with video  presentations. This was besides the visits of the Civil Aviation  Minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, and the Minister of State for  External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, to the Muslim countries to  put the record straight on Kashmir-related issues. The other  Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. Salman Khursheed, is  due to brief the Delhi-based envoys next week.    Significant move: In a significant move, India has  invited the member-nations of the U.N. Commission, including the  Muslim countries, to send their envoys to Jammu and Kashmir.    Mr. A.B. Vajpayee, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok  Sabha,  who, along with the Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, had  gone to Geneva earlier this month, will undertake another trip  there this weekend, while Mr. Khursheed will join him later.  They will be there at the time of the possible Pakistani action  to move a resolution on alleged human rights violations in Jammu  and Kashmir.    The text of the draft resolution, circulated by Pakistan, is  as follows: "The Commission on Human Rights: Recognising the  need for the universal promotion and protection of fundamental  human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights and other instruments, covenants and declarations on  human rights.    Noting the persistent and well-documented reports of massive  human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, (1) Reaffirms the  fundamental human rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir; (2)  Expresses grave concern at the gross and consistent violations  of the human rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir; (3)  Decides to send a fact-finding mission to Jammu and Kashmir to  investigate and report on the human rights situation there to  the 49th Session of the U.N. General Assembly; (4) Decides to  consider the situation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir at  its 51st Session."</p>

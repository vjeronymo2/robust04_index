			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party chairman Ingvar </F> Carlsson by Mats Hallgren and Rolf Gustavsson in Stockholm; date  not given]    [Text] [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Sweden now has a package that  is the result of the negotiations with the European Union [EU]  and soon the Social Democratic Party congress will make up its  mind about EU membership. Are you still as committed a  supporter of membership as you were?    [Carlsson] The answer is yes.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Was the package that emerged from the  membership negotiations largely as you expected?    [Carlsson] Yes. It was more or less what I had been  expecting. I think that the government handled the negotiations  well. On the decisive issues we were in close contact. But it  did end up a little expansive.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] It could be you who has to find the  money -- around 20 billion a year. How is this to be done?    [Carlsson] It is a lot of money, but put it in the  perspective of what unemployment costs. More than 40 billion a  year in cash support alone! Twice as much as the EU membership  fee. Since I view membership as a major opportunity to combat  unemployment, it is my assessment that if we pursue sensible  policies we will more than get our money back.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But the membership fee has to be  financed out of a budget that already has a deficit of 200  billion. Will you make savings or will you raise taxes?    [Carlsson] It is our view that production should chiefly  bear the cost since it is production that will chiefly benefit  from membership, but we have not discussed this fully.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] The money we get back goes to farmers  among others, and there seems to be a Social Democratic idea of  increasing real estate taxes for farmers.    [Carlsson] I do not want to say anything other than that  production must meet the cost.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If we were to summarize your approach it  is an unreserved yes to membership in the European Union?    [Carlsson] Yes. Now we know the terms, and my  recommendation to the congress will be that we should say yes to  the package that emerged from the negotiations.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] And it is you assessment that the  congress will say yes?    [Carlsson] That is my assessment and it is of course  important for me that that is the outcome.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have two major tasks as party  leader: regaining government power and getting a yes in the  referendum. Do you see any link between the two?    [Carlsson] I myself will push the yes line whether we win or  lose the election.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But surely it would be a position of  strength to be able to push that line in government?    [Carlsson] Yes, it is probable that people will listen more  to me as prime minister than as leader of the opposition and as  a loser.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you believe that a continuation of a  nonsocialist government will benefit the no side in the  referendum?    [Carlsson] If I may be allowed to engage in some polemic, I  would say that first Bildt frightened off the supporters of the  EU in the Social Democratic Party by linking the EU issue with  Moderate policies. Now he is frightening off his own people as  a result of the thoroughly foolish treatment of Bjorn von der  Esch [Moderate Riksdag deputy removed from party list for his  opposition to the EU], which I think is damaging the yes side.  If we were having the referendum in two weeks, as Bildt  suggested, I would be very worried.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] How should those Social Democrats who  want a no to the EU vote in the Riksdag elections? Can they vote  for you?    [Carlsson] Of course. I have committed myself to voting no  in the Riksdag if there is a no in the referendum.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have just said that your chances of  winning sympathy for a yes vote would increase if you became  prime minister. Then surely a Social Democratic opponent of the  EU should vote for Carl Bildt?    [Carlsson] As Social Democrats people must make up their  minds about whether or not Social Democratic policies are to be  pursued, either inside or outside the EU.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If you win the Riksdag election and  there is a yes in the referendum you will be the man who speaks  for Sweden when the EU considers reforms in 1996. There are two  approaches. One wants to deepen the EU with greater integration  and more majority decisions. The other approach wants to water  down the EU and strengthen the right of veto. Where do you  stand in this debate?    [Carlsson] I am not on the British side, which wants to  water down the EU. The British Conservatives want as little  politics as possible in the EU. This is a neoliberal position.  I want to join Europe because I want to be involved in shaping  European policy. Whether on unemployment, environmental policy,  or the social dimension. If you want to achieve anything,  political decisiveness is needed in Europe.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So you do not want to strengthen the  right of veto?    [Carlsson] No, I do not think so. On the contrary, we  should give consideration to extending majority decisions in the  fields of environmental policy and social issues, for example.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So a Sweden ruled by the Social  Democrats will not help to water down the EU?    [Carlsson] No, I do not think so.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] In 1996 the EU will reach a decision on  joint defenses. What position will you adopt then?    [Carlsson] We are in favor of joint security. As was Olof  Palme in his day. But we draw the line when it comes to  military nonalignment. That is something that we are not  prepared to give up. We cannot abandon one security policy  stance without knowing what the next one means. And we do not  intend to seek NATO membership.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] What is your position on the plans for  economic and monetary union (EMU) and the transition to a common  currency?    [Carlsson] I think that we have to strengthen currency  cooperation, which means that countries can support each other.  I cannot say today what form this should take, but a strong  counterbalance to the market's speculators is needed. A more  intense discussion of this question is needed.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you want Sweden to abandon the  floating exchange rate and enter into a currency community?    [Carlsson] We will have to do this sooner or later, whether  we join the EU or not.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] There is a concern that crime and drugs  will flood in across the borders if border controls are removed.  How are we to prevent this?    [Carlsson] The problem is that we are beginning to have  global crime, arising in part from the collapse of the old  Soviet Union and from the drug dealers. This is extremely  serious for the whole of Europe, but I think that we will never  be able to solve the problems of controls within Europe; the  important thing is how we organize customs and police  cooperation throughout Europe. We will never come to grips with  this problem on our own if we stay outside the EU.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do we not give away more power if we  join the EU?    [Carlsson] We also win more power. The no side wants more  power over what is a growing powerlessness. If you want power  over the issues that are normally decided by the Riksdag and  government, you have to meet the threats where they are to be  found. And today that is at a level above national boundaries.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If we are to believe the opinion polls  half of Social Democratic voters say no to the EU. What is the  explanation?    [Carlsson] There are four reasons. The Maastricht  procedure harmed the EU. The referendums in Denmark and France  created further uncertainty. Then the nonsocialist government  declared that the lower taxes and the razing of social welfare  benefits were adjustments to the EU. The fourth is the  recession and unemployment.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Have not you and the party leadership  failed to win a sympathetic hearing? Are you out of step with  the movement?    [Carlsson] That is something we cannot judge until we arrive  at the referendum.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] What will be your arguments for EU  membership?    [Carlsson] I will ask the fundamental question that every  Social Democrat must ask himself: Do you think that we can best  realize our ideas about the welfare society if we are members or  if we are not? This is the simple and the difficult question.  My response is that I am absolutely convinced that we have a  better chance if we are members. And this covers everything  from peace in Europe to how I am to be able to earn a living  from my own work.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Do you believe then that a no would  threaten social welfare ideals?    [Carlsson] I believe at least that it would be more  difficult to achieve those goals -- employment, for example. In  addition we believe that we have a contribution to make. Social  democracy is not just Sweden.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] You have made a rational calculation,  but the problem is that the debate is emotionally charged.    [Carlsson] Yes, but as a politician one has a duty to  present one's rational arguments. Over and above this I will  speak with feeling and involvement about Europe.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Could it not be the case that the  opposition to the EU has its roots in mistrust of you and other  politicians?    [Carlsson] It is possible that people incorporate me in the  mistrust of Maastricht that I mentioned. I believe that in the  final analysis it is a question of credibility. Who do you  trust? And I hope that those who trust me in other respects will  also do so on this issue.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] But if it is a question of credibility  it looks today as if [the Green Ecology Party's] Per Gahrton and  [Left Party leader] Gudrun Schyman have greater credibility than  Ingvar Carlsson and Carl Bildt.    [Carlsson] I would have been very nervous if we were to have  had the referendum in two weeks. We would then have to resort  to emergency measures to tackle this problem. Now people have  an opportunity to think over the issues and then we will see who  has most credibility.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] Are you willing to put all your  credibility on the line?    [Carlsson] Not in the sense that I am threatening to resign.  It is a bad strategy to threaten. Our approach is positive  faith.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] If the result in November is a no, will  there then be renegotiation and a new referendum?    [Carlsson] No, the referendum will decide the matter for a  long time to come. There is no chance of any renegotiation. A  new referendum in a year's time is completely out of the  question.    [SVENSKA DAGBLADET] So we would then have to make do with  the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement?    [Carlsson] It is lucky that we have it, but it does not give  us any political influence. If I was head of the Export Council  I might perhaps say that it was enough, but it is not enough for  me as Social Democratic Party chairman.</p>

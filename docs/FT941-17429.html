			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Wednesday: The German Federal Labour Office is expected to announce that unemployment continued to rise last month, both in western and eastern Germany. Economists fear that the recent spate of lay-offs announced by companies means unemployment will keep rising until mid-year, even though the economy may be stabilising. US data on factory orders in November is expected to show a slight quickening of growth compared with October. This would be consistent with data published earlier by the National Association of Purchasing Managers. Friday: The UK housing market comes under the spotlight with publication of the Halifax Building Society house price index for December. The Bank of England also publishes figures on mortgage lending in November. Last week, the eight biggest British banking groups announced a 2.6 per cent drop in their gross mortgage lending between October and November, caused by seasonal factors. Canadian unemployment is expected to have risen in December to 11.1 per cent, despite a steady economic growth performance in 1993.</p>

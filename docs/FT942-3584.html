			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Observer: Salad days are over There's no such thing as a free lunch in banking any more. Nowhere is this more true than at Merrill Lynch in New York where the firm has suddenly stopped paying for its traders to be fed at lunchtime. The giant securities firm used to pick up the Dollars 5.45 lunch tab in the hope that it would keep its traders working at their desks all day long. However, Merrill has told its traders that from now on they must pay for their own sandwiches and salads during the lunch-hour. Merrill refuses to disclose how much it will save, but analysts put the figure at no more than Dollars 500,000 a year - small change for a firm which made bumper profits of Dollars 1.4bn last year. So could the decision to stop underwriting the traders' lunch bills have more to do with physical  -rather than financial - belt-tightening?</p>

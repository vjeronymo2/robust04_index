			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Syndicated loan for Finmeccanica Finmeccanica, Italy's state-controlled engineering group, has returned to the international syndicated loan market after an absence of several years. A Dollars 200m loan for the group, arranged by NatWest Markets, was increased to Dollars 250m after being oversubscribed in syndication. The three-year loan was priced at 40 basis points over the London interbank offered rate, and will refinance a short-term domestic bilateral loan. It is extendible to five years at a price of 45 basis points over Libor. Underwriters were Banco di Napoli, NatWest Markets, Nomura International, and Societe Generale, with 18 other banks in the syndicate. The National Bank of Egypt took part in a DM130m syndication loan for the Israeli government, a Bank Leumi spokesman said, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The credit line was organised by Bank Leumi UK and Chemical Bank. This is the first time in five years that the Israeli government has raised money abroad through a consortium of banks.</p>

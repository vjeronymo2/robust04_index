			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: NYSE elects Grasso as new chairman The board of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday elected Mr Richard Grasso as its chairman to succeed Mr William Donaldson, who steps down next May when his four-year term expires. The election of the 48-year old Mr Grasso, president and chief operating officer of the NYSE, marks the first time that a member of the exchange's staff has ascended to the chairman's office. In its 202 years, the 'Big Board', as it is known on Wall Street, has always been run by a prominent figure from stockbroking, business or politics. Mr Grasso's elevation was confirmed unanimously by the board, which decided  -for only the second time in the NYSE's history - not to employ a search committee to find a new chairman. This decision reflected the belief among exchange insiders that Mr Grasso, who has worked at the Big Board for 26 years, was the right man for the job. Mr Grasso lacks the high profile in Washington and the New York financial community of his predecessors, including Mr Donaldson, who helped found the broking firm Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and later worked as an under-secretary of state for Mr Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. However, his supporters point out that his knowledge of the exchange's operations and technology, and his popularity with the Big Board's floor brokers and traders, make up for any shortage of influence outside the NYSE. Mr Grasso joined the exchange in 1968 as a listing representative. In the intervening years, he made steady progress up the ranks, becoming president and chief operating officer in 1988, and executive vice-chairman in 1991. Among his most pressing tasks when he assumes the chairmanship on June 1 will be to stem the flow of business away from the Big Board to screen-based, electronic trading systems and foreign exchanges, and to attract more listings of non-US companies. Mr Grasso last night made listing foreign securities on the exchange a priority once he took office. He said he hoped to list securities of 60 non-US based companies in 1995. The exchange is on target for 42 new foreign listings this year. 'The major source of growth for this institution will be in the non-US arena,' he said. The exchange could add a total market capitalisation of Dollars 3,450bn if it were to sign up every foreign company that qualified today. 'Americans are going to continue to diversify their holdings. We have to do all we can to try to bring non-US companies here,' he said.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Commercial sector helps raise building orders 9% THE PATCHINESS of the upturn in the construction industry was highlighted yesterday. Official figures made it clear that total orders were rising, but showed big differences in the performance of different sectors. According to provisional figures from the Department of the Environment, total orders rose 9 per cent to nearly Pounds 4bn in the three months from May to July, compared with the same period last year. But orders were still 5 per cent lower than for the previous three months of this year. The statistics are based on constant 1985 prices, seasonally adjusted. The best-performing sector in the latest three months was private commercial building. Orders in the sector were 27 per cent higher than in the previous three months and were 20 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. The private industrial sector remains depressed, with orders down 18 per cent on the previous three months and 1 per cent lower than in the same period last year. In housing, new orders in the private sector fell 10 per cent compared with the previous three months of this year - but were 3 per cent higher than in the same period last year. This confirms reports from housebuilders of a lull in activity in early summer. Public housing and housing association orders in the latest three months were 3 per cent lower than in February-to-April, but 65 per cent higher than the same period of last year. The worst-performing sector was in infrastructure, where orders were 28 per cent lower than in February-to-April and 13 per cent lower than in May-to-July last year. Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said declines in new orders in the private industrial and infrastructure sectors were 'extremely worrying'. Investment in both sectors was 'the essential ingredient for a sustained recovery', he said. 'We would expect to see signs of an upturn as the economy picks up and confidence returns to business and industry,' he added.  ---------------------------------------------------------             VALUE OF ORDERS WON BY CONTRACTORS  --------------------------------------------------------- 1988                pounds20.55bn 1989                pounds19.82bn 1990                 pounds17.1bn 1991                pounds15.86bn 1992                pounds15.17bn 1993 Q1              pounds4.36bn 1993 Q2              pounds3.87bn  --------------------------------------------------------- Calculated at constant 1985 prices, seasonally adjusted Excludes home improvements 1993 Q2: prov figures Source: DoE  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

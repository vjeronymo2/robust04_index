			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: US Air Force order goes to UK group THE US Air Force yesterday confirmed the award of a Dollars 50m (Pounds 28.2m) contract to Slingsby, the small Yorkshire aircraft maker, to supply in partnership with the US Northrop group up to 113 Slingsby T67 Firefly training aircraft. Slingsby, a subsidiary of ML Holdings, originally won the US Air Force contract last April. The deal was frozen by the US authorities after protests by unsuccessful bidders that the US Air Force had not followed its own criteria for selection of the new training aircraft. Slingsby was among six bidders for the contract to replace the US Air Force's fleet of Cessna T-41 aircraft. ML Holdings said yesterday that the General Accounting Office of the US Congress had rejected all the protests, clearing the way for the contract to supply 113 Firefly single-piston-engine training aircraft to the US Air Force. This year the Canadian armed forces also selected the Firefly as its primary training aircraft. Slingsby teamed with Northrop, the US defence contractor, to compete for the US Air Force order. It will be prime contractor, supplying Firefly airframes from its North Yorkshire plant, for assembly in the US by Northrop. EVA Airways, Taiwan's first private international carrier, yesterday confirmed a Dollars 345m (Pounds 194.9m) order to Boeing for two 747-400 passenger jets, writes Luisetta Mudie in Taipei. This follows previous firm orders for six of the widebody jets, and two extra options. The airline, an Evergreen Group subsidiary, began operations last year with a fleet of Boeing 767-300ERs, flying to destinations in the Asia-Pacific region, and to Vienna. EVA will take delivery of the first two 747-400s in November, and will use the aircraft on its first trans-Pacific service to Los Angeles in December.</p>

In a traditional agricultural country such as China, rural  people used to consider farmland as their lifeblood. Such a  concept has been gradually changing. Many rural families, whose  laborers are working in rural industrial enterprises, have  willingly transferred their farmland-use rights to their  fellow-villagers or even to people from other villages,  townships, counties or provinces.    Wang Jinbao, a 66-year-old peasant in Wuxi County, east  China's Jiangsu Province, said that he has tilled the land all  his life and loves the land very much. However, he added, he  has now transferred his land-use rights to others because all  his children have found jobs in cities or in rural industrial  enterprises and no longer make their living by farming.    The practice originated in the mid-1980s in the area of  Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou in southern Jiangsu Province, where  rural industrial enterprises are well developed. At present,  over 60 percent of the rural laborers in the area have turned  from farming to working in industrial or service-trade  enterprises. As a result, some of the rural families are  willing to transfer their farmland- use rights to skilled  farmers who want to expand their scale of production.    Such a practice was soon approved by the top leadership of  the country. A decision on some issues concerning the  establishment of a socialist market economic system adopted at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the  CPC on November 14, 1993 says that on the premise of adhering to  collective land ownership, the compensated transfer of land-use  right according to law will be allowed and that operations  adaptable to economies of scale may be developed in a few  economically developed areas through various forms such as the  transfer of contracts and the purchase of shares on a voluntary  basis.    In order to solve the problem of some farmers being  reluctant  to continue farming and to avoid leaving the land waste [as  received], the Chinese central government has selected the Pearl  River Delta, Chang Jiang Delta and the outskirts of Beijing as  the pilot areas to carry out the commercialization of land-use  right.    The official in charge of the experiment in the Chang Jiang  Delta, focussing on Jiangsu Province, said that the experiment  is aimed at gradually transferring the land-use right to those  farmers who are more skilled and willing to engage in farming  and finally realize economies of scale in farming.    In carrying out the experiment, it is important to separate  the land ownership from the land-contracting right and the  land-use right. All the farmland is owned by the village. But  the land- contracting right and the land-use right belong to  individual households. Every household is allowed to transfer  its contract and land-use right to others.    The experiment started in the three counties of Wuxi,  Changshu and Wuxian in the Chang Jiang Delta in 1987. So far,  the practice has spread to 26 counties in the prefectural cities  of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. The  per-capita farmland in the area was less than 0.07 ha  [hectares]. However, there are now 8,200 units engaging in  farming on a total of 31,600 ha of land, each of which has more  than one ha of farmland.    Located in Zhangjing town in Jiangsu Province's Wuxi County,  the richest county in China, the Xinhu farm has 13.3 ha of land.  The land-use rights belonged to the local residents in the  past, but have now been transferred. The farm is at present  contracted by Li Songfan, a farmer from Changxing County in  Zhejiang Province. Moreover, Li has transferred the contract to  Shi Ziliang, another farmer from Changxing County. So, the  actual persons who are cultivating the land of the farm are Shi  and his wife as well as four of their relatives.    There are 1,501 such farms operating economies of scale like  the Xinhu farm in Wuxi County, according to county magistrate Lu  Rongde. These farms have a total of 7,800 ha of farmland, which  accounts for 53.6 percent of the county's total contracted  farmland.    Farming based on economies of scale has helped raise  agricultural productivity and promoted the development of rural  industry and the service trades. Statistics from the Jiangsu  Provincial Office of Agricultural Modernization show that the  per-ha and per-laborer grain output of such farms is generally  200 kg more than and 20.3 times that of small plots cultivated  by farmers who have concurrent jobs in rural industrial  enterprises. Over 93 percent of the grain produced by such  farms is marketable grain. The percentage is 60 percentage  points more than that of small farms.    Many skilled farmers are willing to engage in farming of  this  type. Tang Hongquan, head of the Guangming farm in southern  Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, contracted to cultivate the farm,  which has 35 ha of land. His wife resigned from her post as  head of a workshop in a rural industrial enterprise to manage  the farm together with him. Last year the farm made a net  income of 185,000 yuan. The per-capita annual income of the 20  laborers on the farm surpassed 4,000 yuan, which was about 30  percent more than their fellow-villagers who worked concurrently  in rural industrial enterprises.    Experts noted that the rebudding of commercialization of  land-use rights in China indicates a new trend in the country's  reform of the land-use system under the new circumstances of the  nationwide efforts to build a socialist market economy.</p>

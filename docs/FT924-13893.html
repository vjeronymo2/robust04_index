			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Brierley close to Sealord deal A GROUP of 13 Maori tribes, has failed to stop the New Zealand government backing a deal that could see forestry group Carter Holt Harvey selling its Sealord fishing division to a joint venture of Maori people and Brierley Investments. The dissident group, including Maori from the distant Chatham Islands, opposed a deal that was previously agreed by most Maori tribes. This was supposed to be a 'final settlement' of all fishing claims dating back to the Treaty of Waitangi signed with the British in 1840. Mr Justice Heron, in the High Court in Wellington, yesterday rejected a bid to order the Crown not to settle the deal until there was a full court hearing about the rights of Maori who didn't agree with the settlement. His decision permits the government to lend the Maori people NZDollars 150m (USDollars 81m) to form a joint venture with Brierley Investments to buy Sealord, which is New Zealand's biggest deep-sea operator, and owns 26 per cent of all New Zealand fish quota. Mr Justice Heron refused to grant approval for the objectors to continue the case. He ruled that a substantive hearing, involving points raised by the objectors, could be heard before the year-end. Maori and the Crown have been negotiating for years to try to settle Maori fishing claims. Some Maori had already signed the deal, but others refused or said it was signed on their behalf without authority. The hearing removes the major obstacle for the Maori-Brierley Investments offer for Sealord to go ahead. A rival group, led by a Danish group Royal Greenland, has also said it is bidding for Sealord. Carter Holt Harvey is expected to make a decision on the rival bids shortly.</p>

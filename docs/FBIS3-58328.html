The statement follows a period of  irritation with the future course of that world power, the  United States. Is there an Asian temptation in Washington? If  that was the case, then the President has adjusted the course:  Washington wants to remain the leading political and military  power in Europe.    That is a load off the minds of the Europeans. Following the  euphoria that surrounded the changes in Europe and Russia's  return to its historical course of power politics, the American  presence is necessary to preserve balance. Having learned their  lesson from crises, wars, and Moscow conspiracies, the West  Europeans have paid their respects once again. NATO has also  benefited from the situation. Against a background that has  grown darker, the sense and purpose of the alliance seems  brighter. One is aware once again that without it, the old  continent will go astray.    For the United States, Russia is a priority. Influenced by  his State Department adviser Talbott, Clinton is counting on the  reformers around Yeltsin. There is a risk in that: The reform  may fail.    Partnership for peace can mean many things. Whether the  measures that have been announced are sufficient to offer  security to the peoples of "middle Europe" remains open. They  have conditional protection. Unconditional confidence cannot  develop out of that. America's reaffirmed commitment to Europe  is a ray of hope for them -- no more and no less.</p>

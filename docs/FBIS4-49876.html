			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that long-term exclusion of China from the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is beneficial  neither to China nor to the rest of the world.    Meeting with some of the participants of the '94 China  Summit  Meeting, which opened here today, Li Peng stressed that China is  willing to resume its contracting status in GATT at an early  date and become one of the founding members of the future World  Trade Organization (WTO), adding that China has made many  efforts to this end.    He said that the relations between China and GATT or even  the  future WTO are mutually beneficial. China needs multi-lateral  trade organizations like GATT while GATT and the future WTO also  need China.    If China, a country with over 1.1 billion people and a  rapidly growing economy and trade volume, is barred from entry  into GATT, it is hard to say that such a World Trade  Organization is an integral one, he said.    The Chinese premier also briefed the participants on the  characteristics and contents of China's socialist market  economic system, the situation of the state-owned major and  middle-sized enterprises, the efforts China has made to handle  the relations between reform, development and stability as well  as the measures adopted to deepen the reform and strengthen  macro-control.    He pointed out that for China development is the purpose,  reform is the motive force and stability is the condition.    Later on Li Peng hosted a banquet in honor of all the  participants at the '94 China Summit Meeting at the Great Hall  of the People.    Li said that China is a peace-loving country. The  establishment of economic construction as the central task and  the introduction of reform and opening policies advocated by  Deng Xiaoping at the end of the 1970s have brought tremendous  changes to China, he noted.    He continued that currently China is enjoying political  stability, economic development, unity among its nationalities  and social progress. "We have never been so confident in the  future of our country," Li stressed.    Owing to its large population and less-developed economy,  however, China has a long way to go in this respect, Li said.  To develop its economy rapidly, China needs the long-time  cooperation of the international community.    "We sincerely hope that our foreign friends all over the  world will cooperate and exchange with us in capital,  technology, management and other aspects," he said.    The country is a huge market and open to all countries that  are willing to develop friendly cooperation with it, he noted.    China is willing to learn about the rest of the world and  the  rest of the world needs to learn about China, he said. This end  is surely attainable, judging from all the speeches at today's  meeting.    The summit meeting has dealt not only with China's economy,  but with the world economy and its long-term development.  "Peace and development are the common task we are faced with,"  Li told the gathering.    Asia, East Asia in particular, boasts the most energetic  economic growth in the world and has a bright future, Li said.    He expressed the hope that the summit meeting would be held  annually or every other year in his country and pledged it full  support from the Chinese government.    In his speech, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad  praised new changes he had witnessed in Beijing since his visit  here last year. This has resulted from the hard work of the  Chinese leadership, the government and the people, he said.    Mahathir voiced his appreciation of China's achievements.    The prosperity of China is sure to bring about prosperity to  East Asia and the rest of the whole region, Mahathir said. He  wished the Chinese people more achievements in their national  construction.    Among those participating in today's meeting and banquet  were  Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of the Federal Republic of  Germany, the World Bank's Managing Director Ernest Stern, and  Richard McLean, publisher of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE.    Li Tieying, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge  of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, was also  present at the occasion.</p>

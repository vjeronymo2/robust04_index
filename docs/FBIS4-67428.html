			<p>CSO     [Text] It was a curious coincidence. Last Tuesday, the  Indian Express frontpaged a major PTI [Press Trust of  India] story from Washington reporting how CBS 60  Minutes (one of American TV's most viewed shows) had  alleged that India runs the world's most unsafe nuclear plants  without inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency  while The Independent frontpaged, on the same day, a  PTI report from Calcutta that Dr. P.K. Iyengar, Chairman of the  Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary, Department of Atomic  Energy in the Government of India had won this year's Jawaharlah  Nehru Birth Centenary Award for his contribution in the field of  atomic energy!    This is typical of India.    Even as one of the world's most respected news programmes on  television accuses us of the most shocking crime possible, of  running the world's most contaminated and dangerous nuclear  power plants, with radioactive leakages and inadequate  safeguards to protect those who work there, we are busy handing  over one of the country's most prestigious awards to the very  person who must be held responsible for the crime.    It is no use blaming CBS. The buyers for the `Foreign Hand'  theory are a vanishing breed today. We are welcoming foreigners  into India with open arms and we should know that this  eventually means a more open society in which wrongdoing can no  longer be brushed under the carpet. Not even when the Government  does the house-cleaning.    Dollars and the free information society come together and  you cannot have one without the other. You cannot earn millions  of dollars selling your carpets and, at the same time, hide the  fact that your carpet industry criminally deploys child labour.  You cannot welcome foreign tourists to your beach resorts and,  at the same time, expect them to be blind to the fact that you  are allowing hotel owners and rapacious commercial interests to  encroach upon your beaches and destroy them.    You cannot expect visitors to come to India and, at the same  time, hide from them the fact that you run the cruelest and most  filthy abattoirs in the world, which produce meat that only the  most insensitive and barbaric people would eat without protest.    More and more horror stories about our nuclear installations  and environmental savagery are bound to hit the headlines  worldwide and let us, instead of trying to brazenly lie our way  through, confess to our crimes and set things right. There is  enough time and opportunity. Let us change our attitudes towards  crimes committed against nature and people. Let us force our  government bodies to become more accountable.    Research by some of India's finest journalists have  revealed,  for instance, the simple and inescapable fact that India's  atomic energy programme has been a dismal failure. What is  worse, it has spawned serious and long-term environmental  problems and it is time to order an open audit of the money that  has vanished into the programme and the enormous damage it has  done to our environment and public health.    Last month, The Sunday Observer (which has pursued  the nuclear establishment over the past three years with  single-minded zeal) revealed how contamination of soil, water,  flora and marine organisms around our nuclear power plants have  crossed emergency levels since a decade. Findings based on  internal documents and public statements issued by the atomic  energy authorities themselves reveal that hundreds of curies of  the lethal, long-lived radio-active isotope Caesium-137 (along  with many other radio-active species) are lying in public areas,  just outside the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre [BARC].    This poisons underground water. It endangers the milk we get  from cattle grazing in there. It contaminates marine life in the  Thane creek and the fish and the crabs you eat have reached  emergency radio-active levels as defined by bodies like the  International Atomic Energy Agency and the International  Commission for Radiation Protection, among others. It is not  just the press that knows this. The officials know this. The  government know this. And yet everyone digs his head into the  sand, ostrich-like and pretends that the crimes will go away if  we ignore them long enough.    Meanwhile, workers in these unsafe nuclear plants, visitors  and people living in the contaminated zones around them are  risking fatal cancers and genetic disorders. All because a few  people at the top are unconcerned about international safety  standards and are busy wooing the political establishment to win  awards and accolades at the cost of the nation. CBS 60  Minutes, reportedly, showed workers with burn marks and  interviewed an American-trained Indian doctor who confirmed that  due largely to radio-active contamination children are born in  areas nearby without ears, with two thumbs and so on.    At an international meet some time back, a "responsible  scientist" from BARC had, in fact, revealed data to show that  our nuclear power plants were discharging about a hundred times  the expected safe levels of radio-activity in the environment.  International experts were aghast and the organisation concerned  wrote to the Government of India about the disastrous long-term  consequences of this steady poisoning of the environment by our  nuclear power stations.    But more strange than this are some of the other games that  BARC plays. Its senior most scientists, for instance, once  connived to irradiate cheap diamonds to dangerous levels of  radio-activity in the APSARA [expansion not given] reactor and  peddled them at home and abroad as costly, natural "black"  diamonds. While doing this, they were deliberately violating all  safety procedures for tagging and shielding of radio-active  sources leaving BARC. These irradiated stones were released for  uncontrolled transactions in the diamond trade and the public  would have never known, were it not for the vigilance of the  press.    When caught, senior BARC officials tried to pass the buck to  each other. Finally, S.D. Soman confessed to The Sunday  Observer correspondent that using radio-active materials  for cosmetic purposes was proscribed under international  standards.    When called to Delhi to explain, Soman checked into Sion  Hospital and did not emerge till the day of his retirement,  after which he vanished overseas.    Huge investments have been made in these power plants --  yielding puny returns. Our nukes, starting with the first two  indigenous reactors at Narora, cost the nation a staggering Rs  800 crore. That is, Rs 2 crore per installed megawatt. As  against this, a conventional thermal power station costs Rs 1  crore a megawatt!    The nukes at Karakpur are estimated to cost even more -- Rs  2.5 crore per installed megawatt, at the last estimate. Newer  nukes will cost around Rs 3 crore. This means, at a conservative  estimate, our nukes at Narora, Karakpur, Kaiga and Rawatbhata  will make us sink in over Rs 4000 crore into nuclear power,  whereas we could have achieved the same capacity at much less  than half the price (and, in fact, much faster) had we had gone  the thermal way.    The operating history of our plants is worse. The break even  point for viability is 62 per cent capacity factor. Our new  nukes do between 35 per cent to 40 per cent. So, by the Nuclear  Power Corporation's own yardstick, their power production is a  grossly losing venture. However, by sheer legerdemain, its  manifest losses are shown as profits by treating government  equity as an interest-free grant and by assigning subsidised  costs to fuel, heavy water and other components made in DAE's  [Department of Atomic Energy] establishments.    Despite such creative accounting, NPC [Nuclear Power  Corporation] manages to show a profit of only Rs 100 crore per  year on an investment running into so many thousand crore! Were  it not run on public money, it would have been forced to roll  down its shutters a long time back.    Even these creative profits come from the older reactors  obtained from the USA (the Tarapur units) and Canada (the  Rajasthan reactors) which, despite their vintage, continue to  deliver cheaper and more reliable power than our indigenous  white elephants. When these old units are phased out by the end  of this decade, the financial picture will become even gloomier  since we may have less effective capacity at that time than we  have -- and this faltering uncertain output will account for  less than 1 per cent of the national power generation!    Compare this to the enormous damage done to public health  and  the environment and you will get a correct picture of what our  nuclear power programme is all about!    The Government has woken up by limiting resources for  current  projects and deferring funds for future ones. So the NPC is  borrowing money from the market through bonds which have to be  repaid soon -- and for which no sources of money are apparent.  Even the debt burden of these bonds exceeds the yearly so-called  profit of the Corporation. This is the typical picture of a  bankrupt organisation, where liabilities exceed assets and the  cost of debt servicing exceeds income.    Isn't it time that someone called an end to this  preposterous  charade instead of allowing awards and accolades to be piled on  to people who are earning India a bad name all over the world  and running a dangerous and losing proposition under the  pretence of leading India into a brave new hi-tech century?    The only man who can dare to take on the mighty atomic  energy  establishment, which is a law unto itself, is Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao. The question is: Will he do it?</p>

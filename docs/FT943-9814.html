			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: British Airways The 3 per cent fall in British Airways' share price yesterday suggests the market had exaggerated expectations about the effect of economic recovery on its operations. Still, the actual outturn is not bad. BA has managed impressive growth in lucrative premium traffic business. Its more efficient use of aircraft promises enhanced gains as the recovery proceeds. There are more grounds for worry on strategic alliances. Yesterday's figures suggest disappointing progress in reducing losses at European associates. BA calculates USAir will contribute around Pounds 70m to profits this year whatever happens to its investment in balance sheet terms. The airline could easily afford to write down its stake. Whether it could afford the resulting loss of strategic direction is another matter.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> METS TAKE 3-0 LEAD BEFORE LOSING, FAIL TO GAIN GROUND  </P> <P> For the last month the New York Mets have been poised to take over first place  in the National League East.  </P> <P> However, the Pittsburgh Pirates, not playing exceptionally well, are still on  top.  </P> <P> When Bud Harrelson took over as manager May 29, the Mets were seven games out  of first. But with Darryl Strawberry on a home run spree, the Mets Moved to  within two games of the Pirates on June 23.  </P> <P> A month later, they are still 1 1/2 games behind Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> They missed a chance to move closer Monday night at Philadelphia when they  built a 3-0 lead for pitching ace Frank Viola (13-5).  </P> <P> Viola, who was battling his control but had a no-hitter through five innings,  fell apart in the sixth inning and the Phillies scored five times and outlasted  the Mets, 7-4.  </P> <P> Two walks, an error and a fielder's choice gave the Phillies a run. Another  walk filled the bases again. It was here that Dickie Thon got the first hit off  Viola -- his first grand slam -- on the first pitch.  </P> <P> "Maybe (Viola) was thinking of a no-hitter and got a little excited," Thon  said. "He usually pitches me away and that one was high and tight, the kind of  pitch I can handle.  </P> <P> "He was in a jam and I was relaxed. I think he was just trying to throw a  strike after so many walks. It was not his pitch."  </P> <P> Although he gave up only two hits in six innings, it was the third time in a  row Viola failed to become the league's first 14-game winner.  </P> <P> Former Met Roger McDowell, who has regained his touch out of the bullpen, saved  the win for reliever Darrel Akerfelds (4-0). McDowell retired the last four  Mets, two on strikes, for his 15th save.  </P> <P> Viola's mild slump and Darryl Strawberry's big slump have contributed to the  Mets' inability to take over first place.  </P> <P> Strawberry had a double, driving in a run and scoring one. But, he is only two  for 23 in the last six games and has only one home run in the last 12 games.  </P> <P> "I thought we were ready to move ahead a couple of weeks ago," Harrelson said.  "But, I don't see anyone jumping off bridges. We have been in position to make  a move and haven't done it. We just have to do our thing."  </P> <P> Chicago 3, St. Louis 1 -- It's too late for a pennant drive and probably too  early for a salary drive, but the Cubs are on a roll.  </P> <P> Greg Maddux (6-9), who has struggled all season, gave up just a run and seven  hits in 8 2/3 innings at St. Louis and the Cubs won their eighth in a row.  </P> <P> Maddux beat out a chopper in front of the plate in the fifth inning to drive in  Luis Salazar from third with the go-ahead run.  </P> <P> Willie McGee, extending his hitting streak to 16 games, singled in the Cardinal  run in the first inning.  </P> <P> Although they are in fifth place, 13 games behind the Pirates in the East, the  Cubs moved 2 1/2 games in front of the last place Cardinals.  </P> <P> Montreal 5, Pittsburgh 0 -- Dennis Martinez pitched a four-hitter and Tim  Wallach drove in four runs at Montreal as the Expos once again roughed up John  Smiley.  </P> <P> Smiley (4-5) lost his sixth consecutive decision to the Expos, going back two  years.  </P> <P> Wallach's two-run single highlighted a three-run first inning that gave  Martinez (7-7) more than just a working margin.  </P> <P> Wallach hit his 17th home run in the third inning. In the seventh inning he  singled in another run to give him 67 runs batted in, best on lead the club.  </P> <P> "I always enjoy pitching in a big game," Martinez said after the third-place  Expos moved to within five games of the Pirates. "I don't know. I guess I was  born that way."  </P> <P> Cincinnati 9, San Diego 2 -- A return home didn't do anything to help the  Padres. They lost their eighth in a row and are only one game ahead of the  Braves, the last-place team in the West.  </P> <P> Eric Davis hit a two-run home run and a run-scoring single to lead the Reds,  who increased their lead in the West to 11 games.  </P> <P> The Padres, who have won only three of 24 games, are 1-11 since Manager Greg  Riddoch took over.  </P> <P> Tom Browning (10-5) gave up both Padre runs and eight hits in seven innings.  </P> <P> Atlanta 3, Houston 1 -- John Smoltz pitched a five-hitter at Atlanta and the  Braves made a 10-game loser out of Mike Scott, a 20-game winner in 1989.  </P> <P> Scott, who shut out the Mets last week, extended his scoreless string to 14  innings before the Braves scored their runs in the sixth.  </P> <P> Andres Thomas hit a liner to left that umpire Fred Brocklander ruled left  fielder Javier Ortiz trapped. A TV replay showed Ortiz caught the ball.  </P> <P> Smoltz (7-7) singled and Lonnie Smith walked before Mark Lemke singled in two  runs. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Comments rather disturbing Sir, I was rather disturbed to read in the People column (July 21) the comments on Ishbel Macpherson's appointment at Hoare Govett to shake up its smaller company corporate finance activities. Your writer seemed to feel that women make a habit of 'swanning off on maternity leave at the drop of a hat', and that views on children expressed four years ago were worthy of comment, given her new role. I found these comments, however humorously meant, very offensive, particularly in a newspaper such as the Financial Times. They encapsulate an attitude which women encounter all too frequently in their working lives. Judith Benson, 13 Burford Road, Horsham, West Sussex RH13 5SP</p>

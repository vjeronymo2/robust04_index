			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 3, IRNA -- A morning daily here Sunday  welcomed the last week statement by the United Arab Emirates  (UAE) to solve the misunderstunding with Iran over Abu Musa  island through the World Court and said it was indicative of  peaceful coexistence with the Islamic Republic.    "Iran welcomes UAE's statement as a reflection of the  maturity of that country's political system, and believes that  any positive proposal will contribute to the final and mutually  acceptable agreement between the two neighboring Muslim  nations," wrote 'TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial.    The Islamic Republic, added the paper, [words  indistinct] and other regional countries believes that such  misunderstandings between neighbors should first be resolved  through bilateral discussion before involving international  organizations which would act only to protect big power  interests.    The article stressed that the Persian Gulf war was a result  of the inability of regional governments to solve their own  differences through dialogue and discussion and treat the  dispute as a local rather than an international issue.    Iran had extended a hand to the UAE and had repeatedly  stated  its willingness to resolve the current misunderstanding with its  neighbor through bilateral talks, said the paper adding that the  Islamic Republic was leaving the World Court option open, but  only as a last resort, and believed that at the moment there was  no need to involve such organizations in this regional  disagreement.    It noted that referring the disagreement to the World Court  at The Hague would be counterproductive to the [words  indistinct] a mutually acceptable solution and wrote that Iran  did not wish to fan the flames of discord.    The paper in conclusion epressed hope that the UAE would  further prove its political maturity and independence, and  create an abundance of good will by warmly shaking the friendly  hand extended by Iran, rather than brushing it aside.</p>

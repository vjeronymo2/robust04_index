Cardoso is followed by former Governor Orestes Quercia  (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Bahia Governor  Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) [Liberal Front Party], and Rio de  Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola. The Gallup poll, conducted at  O ESTADO's request in February -- and thus before the creation  of the URV [real value unit] was announced -- which interviewed  2,566 people in 21 states, reveals that Lula enjoys 30.9 percent  of the electoral preference, Maluf 12.6 percent, and Fernando  Henrique 10.3 percent.    Gallup interviewed electors from 220 municipal districts,  and  found out that Quercia is the fourth most favored candidate,  with 7.4 percent of the electoral preference, Magalhaes fifth  with 6.9 percent, while Brizola obtained 5.9 percent of the  votes, if the first round of elections were to be held between 1  and 18 February, which is when the poll was conducted. Gallup  Director Carlos Matheus commented that "the probe was carried  out before the economic plan was announced, and therefore before  Fernando Henrique Cardoso received repeated media exposure."    The figures reveal that Lula is the favorite candidate for  all social classes, all age groups, and for electors of various  educational levels. But Cardoso closely follows Lula in the  electoral preference of class A electors with 25.4 percent of  the electoral preference, while Lula has 28.3 percent. He also  follows his possible adversary closely in the choice of electors  with higher educational levels, who give Cardoso 25.3 percent of  the votes and Lula 30.2 percent. As is the case for the PT  candidate, Maluf supporters are also evenly divided between  social classes, age groups, and educational levels.    Out of the 21 polled states, the PT candidate enjoys most  support in the northwestern region, where he would obtain 36  percent of the votes, and less in the south and the  north-center-eastern region, with 28 percent. Maluf has more  support in the south (15 percent) and less in the northeastern  region (7 percent). Cardoso enjoys most support in the  southwestern region, with 14 percent, and less in the south with  5 percent, which is where Leonel Brizola -- who was born in  Porto Alegre 0nd was former governor of this state -- has his  best performance with 13 percent of the votes. Magalhaes enjoys  most support in the northwest (23 percent) and less support in  the south and the north-center-eastern region (2 percent).  Quercia enjoys 9 percent of the northeastern votes and 7 percent  of the southwestern and southern region votes.</p>

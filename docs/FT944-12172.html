			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (8): Railways have fascinating parallels - Dobbin's examples throw up many fascinating parallels with present-day thinking on the railways and industry in general / Industrial policies 'FORGING INDUSTRIAL POLICY:  THE US, BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN THE RAILWAY AGE' By Frank Dobbin Cambridge University Press, Pounds 30, 262 pages After decades of neglect the railways are once again at the centre of policy debate in many countries. The privatisation and dismantling of publicly-owned, centralised rail networks in Europe is leading to a shake-up of established patterns of operation. Frank Dobbin's choice of the 19th century railroad industry as the model for his study of how countries devise their industrial policies is therefore timely. His examples throw up many fascinating parallels with present-day thinking on the railways and industry in general although few are explicitly developed under the historical approach adopted by the author. Seen against the background of the British parliament's response to the railroad mania of the 1840s, the present government's much-criticised plans for a privatised railway network emerge with an impeccable pedigree. Parliament in the middle of the 19th century left it to private enterprise to define the public good. Towards the end of the last century though, as critics of the present privatisation mania will no doubt point out, these policies had to be modified. Government intervention became necessary when parliament perceived that individual property rights - of expropriated landowners  - were under threat; that passenger safety was at risk and that poorer customers required protection from the fare policies of greedy railway companies. But Dobbin, an assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University, has a far broader canvas. His purpose is to show that the industrial and economic policies of nations do not conform to a single economic imperative but reflect the cultures and early industrial experiences from which they spring. The railways suit because they were a leading industry which has left subsequent researchers with a mass of documentary evidence. They were also one of the earliest sectors which required governments to design a framework of industrial policies and set a pattern for the treatment of other industries. National policies reflect a country's political culture, Dobbin asserts. The US, Britain and France applied to industrial policy the principles which they had adopted for their political institutions. Distrustful of the powers of a strong centralised state, the newly-independent American colonists determined to vest power in the individual communities and states while restraining the powers of central government. But this approach had to be modified when local and state schemes to promote railroad construction led to frauds and scandals. The result was the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission to impose federal regulation and prevent anti-competitive practices. The federal government was still kept at a distance but an anti-trust framework was put in place to ensure fair play and maximum economic advantage. If the Americans turned the state into the referee of the free market, the French, in contrast, saw the state as the conductor of the industrial orchestra. They regarded a centralised, professional state bureaucracy as necessary for public order. So when it came to designing a railway network it was only natural for the state and its technical experts to decide routes and systems. To allow competing private entrepreneurs to have their way would have wasted resources and posed a threat to good political and economic order. The British approach, while superficially similar to that adopted by the Americans in its reliance on private enterprise, was different in important respects, Dobbin argues. After initially taking a completely laisser faire stance, parliament was forced to intervene to protect, not the market, on the American model, but the individual entrepreneur. By the end of the 19th century, policies were designed to shield the entrepreneurial small company from the vagaries of politics and the market. Ultimately this led to British industrial policies, including subsidies, production quotas and price fixing, which did much to contribute to the country's industrial decline. But whatever may have happened in more recent times, in the 19th century, at least, the three different national approaches to railways policy all had the effect of producing 'rapid, dependable and cost-effective transport systems in relatively short order. No strategy failed in any important sense.' Observers of the business scene might disagree with Dobbin's assertion that the British treat their small companies better than their continental European rivals, although this may be a more recent development. They might also take issue with the view that subsidy and protection are peculiarly British phenomena. Some readers might feel that the author's failure to take into account the radical changes in economic policies which have shaken up the UK and the other economies of Europe in the past 15 years represent the book's main weakness. But equally irritating is the turgid, jargon-packed style of the opening and closing sections where he elaborates his theories. Some readers may be deterred from turning to the country studies which make up the more easily accessible core of the book.</p>

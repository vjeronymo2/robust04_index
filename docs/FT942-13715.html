			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Low marks for college quality standard Sir, I read with interest your article 'Britain: an audit society in the making' (April 21). I am a lecturer in a college which recently acquired the wonderful BS 5750 certificate. I enjoy my work as a provider of education. I enjoy well-prepared lectures and, most of all, the response of my students. I like to think I am good at my job. Unfortunately, I hate paperwork (except for that connected with the real job). As a course manager, I am required to keep a course file. This contains in excess of 20 sections of information, used exclusively by the auditors. I failed my audit on a number of occasions: Failure to have the register in the file (I was actually taking the class and was complying with the rule to have it with me). Failure to have the course number on the appropriate sheet (it was on the next page, I failed to copy it over; it took a large form filled in by the auditor to tell me this). Minutes written on the 'old form' (the one I had been given, as we were using them up before starting on the new ones). Other failures were similarly trivial. The standardised design of forms does not allow for any course to be different and failure to include forms which are often not even applicable results in still more forms from the auditors. The consequence of this auditing is to produce unprecedented stress levels in a profession which demands dedication. Teaching quality must diminish if paperwork takes precedence. . .but so what? It seems that no-one is interested in the actual teaching. The solution seems to be to have a breakdown or take early retirement (if possible). It all makes room for more administrators, business managers and the like. Obviously more important than the lowly teaching staff, actually delivering the goods.

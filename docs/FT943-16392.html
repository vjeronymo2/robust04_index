			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Figures indicate slowing in growth rate M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent last month compared with May, Bank of England figures showed yesterday, Gillian Tett writes. But measured on a yearly basis, the figures indicated that the rate of growth slowed slightly last month. M0 was 6.8 per cent higher last month than in June 1993. That compares with an annual growth rate of 6.9 per cent in May and 5.9 per cent in April. The figures were slightly stronger than the City had expected - it had predicted no monthly growth. Although a strong figure for M0 has traditionally been interpreted as a sign of strong retail spending, analysts yesterday warned against interpreting too much from last month's data.</p>

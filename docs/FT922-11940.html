			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Duke ends campaign for US presidency MR David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, yesterday abandoned his quest for the Republican party's presidential nomination this year. Mr Duke's campaign has effectively been moribund since the Super Tuesday primaries early in March, when his appeal to white southerners produced only a minimal response. In the primaries he had won no delegates. He complained yesterday he had been kept off the ballot in many states, which he said was more worthy of the former Soviet Union than the US. Six months ago, after finishing a respectable second in the contest for the governorship of his home state, Louisiana, Mr Duke was seen as a potentially disruptive political force. In the event, having decided to run as a Republican, the party's right wing preferred Mr Pat Buchanan, the conservative polemicist, to Mr Duke's more explicit racist and anti-homosexual arguments. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Paul Tsongas, still second to Mr Bill Clinton in accumulating Democratic party delegates, suffered a previously unrevealed recurrence of cancer in 1987. Mr Tsongas had retired as senator from Massachusetts because of cancer and in his campaign had made much of his recovery from the disease. He said he did not recall the results of a biopsy taken in 1987 beyond that his doctors were divided over its outcome. Extra radiation treatments then given were preventative, he added. Doctors interviewed by the newspaper were divided over the dangers of a further recurrence over the next few years.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The revival in the German economy's status - it is once again, in the Bundesbank's words, an important motor of European growth - appears still to be proceeding free of inflationary pressures. September's preliminary cost of living data published on Friday was in line with modest expectations. Longer-term price prospects also seem favourable in the light of the moderate trade union statements in advance of the new year wages round. The chemicals union, for example, let it be known last week that its main aim will be to promote job creation rather than claw back losses in real incomes when it comes to negotiate. There was also good news on technical factors: above all, a further marked decline in money supply growth. All of this appears to consolidate the Bundesbank's relatively comfortable position, in which it has the scope but no immediate need to cut rates, least of all at this Thursday's routine central council meeting. Against this background, German bonds recovered quietly near the end of last week. Further improvement is expected, but the tendency among foreign investors to reduce their involvement in the run-up to federal elections, and nervousness about further monetary tightening in the US are still preventing any build-up of momentum in the local market.</p>

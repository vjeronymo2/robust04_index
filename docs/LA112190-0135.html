			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Teachers Honor Jones: Actor James Earl Jones received the Jean Renoir Award  from the Los Angeles Film Teachers Assn. Monday night. Upon receiving the  award, Jones said: "The interest of teachers in film as a means of education is  of particular interest to me because film can be so influential in the  education of the young. One of the things we hope to achieve with our  production of 'Gabriel's Fire' is to bring out many of the problems faced by  youth today. . . . Maybe if we can do a good job with this, we can help create  a better understanding of what goes on in young people's minds, how we can help  them and perhaps even show them how to help themselves."

			<p>Superconductor   <F P=102>   94FE0283F Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 9 Dec 93 p  4 --FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0283F </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The Electrotechnical Lab (ETL) of the Agency of  Industrial Science and Technology has succeeded in synthesizing  a new type of high-temperature superconducting material that  contains silver, and has confirmed that it becomes  superconductive (electrical resistance is zero) at absolute  temperature 117 (-156C). This is the highest critical  temperature (temperature at which superconductive state is  shown) achieved for a substance that does not use elements with  high toxicity such as mercury or thallium.    The synthesized substance is composed of silver, barium,  calcium, copper and oxygen in the ratio of 1:2:3:4:10.  Superconducting state was confirmed by full diamagnetism and  full conductivity. In addition to high critical temperature,  preliminary test results indicate that critical current density,  which shows size of current flow, will be high, 1 million  amperes per square centimeter.    Director Hideo Ihara of the superconductive materials  laboratory packed a gold capsule with silver and other materials  and synthesized a 4 millimeter square mass at high pressure  (50,000 atmospheres) and high temperature (1,100C). The  most popular method of fabricating superconducting material is  to deposit molecular layers one by one, but weaknesses of this  method include the fact that metal decomposes easily and the  fact that oxygen tends to escape from the crystal structure.    Hereafter, study to reveal crystal structure with great  precision will be advanced. Also, since the space between layers  of copper oxide, which demonstrate superconductivity, can be  reduced if silver is used, it is possible that material with  even better performance can be developed.    Until now, the best critical temperature recorded for  low-toxicity superconducting substances was absolute temperature  110 (-163C) for a substance using bismuth.</p>

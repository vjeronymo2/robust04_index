			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Dollars 15m deal expands access side SIMON Engineering, the world's largest access equipment company, is paying up to Dollars 15m (Pounds 7.8m) for Hi-Ranger line of truck-mounted hydraulic platforms from Utility Equipment Corporation, the private US group. The deal continues the process of consolidation in the Pounds 1.2bn world access equipment industry, in which Simon has played a key part with a string of acquisitions during the past 15 years. The consideration involves an initial Dollars 2.5m cash payment, an additional Dollars 2.5m over the next five years, and further sales-related payments up to a maximum of Dollars 10m. The complex deal has taken three years to negotiate, and excludes Hi-Ranger's US manufacturing plant. Its production of about 600 machines a year, for turnover of Dollars 20m, will be switched to existing Simon plants in the US.</p>

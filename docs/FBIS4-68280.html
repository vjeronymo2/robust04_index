			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Sergey Knyazkov </F> under the rubric "Events and Commentary": "Russian Troops Will  Leave Latvia by 31 August 1994"]    [Text] Agreement on  this matter was reached during the first official visit to the  Russian Federation by Guntis Ulmanis, president of the Republic  of Latvia.    I would remind you that initially the primarily working  visit  by Guntis Ulmanis was planned for 22 April. It was planned  during the visit for the presidents of the two states to ratify  a treaty and three agreements previously reached on the  withdrawal of the troops and social protection for military  pensioners. A 5 September order from the President of the  Russian Federation on the establishment of Russian military  bases within the CIS countries and the Republic of Latvia,  however, (for "technical" errors for which Latvia apologized),  provided the excuse for national radicals in the Latvian Sejm to  postpone the visit by Ulmanis to Moscow and to remove from the  package of accords the agreements on social protection for  military pensioners. And the visit by the leader of the Baltic  republic did not become a reality until 30 April, following  coordination of a protocol on a previously initialed agreement  on social protection for Russian military pensioners residing in  Latvia. The protocol defines the obligations of the sides to  establish social conditions which would promote the voluntary  resettlement of military pensioners and their families from  Latvia.    The main document signed by the presidents of the two  countries in the Kremlin is a treaty on the terms, the schedule  and the procedure for withdrawing the armed forces of the  Russian Federation from the territory of Latvia and their legal  status during the period of withdrawal, an inseparable part of  which are the Agreement on the Legal Status of the Skrunda Radar  Station During the Period of Its Temporary Operation and  Dismantling, an agreement between the governments on social  protection for military personnel of the armed forces of the  Russian Federation, the Border Troops and their families  temporarily residing within the territory of Latvia and their  complete withdrawal, as well as an Agreement on Protection for  Military Pensioners of the Russian Federation and Their Families  Residing on the territory of the Republic of Latvia.    The treaty setting the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Latvia for 31 August 1994, which includes 15 articles,  underscores the fact that "the complete withdrawal of the armed  forces of the Russian Federation embraces all persons belonging  to the armed forces of the Russian Federation, their families  and real property." The document states that "the withdrawal of  individual subunits of the armed forces of the Russian  Federation and the vacation and transfer of facilities are being  conducted on schedule."    The treaty is subject to ratification by the parliaments of  both states. Its interim application will begin the day the  ratification certifications are exchanged.    Boris Yeltsin has called the visit by Guntis Ulmanis,  president of the Republic of Latvia, "historic." He announced  following the signing ceremony for the Russian-Latvian documents  that "they were worked out with the complete agreement of the  two sides." In the talks the Russian head of state directed  special attention to the accord reached by the presidents of the  two countries and the fact that "Russian Federation Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will make a visit to Riga," during  which Russian-Latvian economic cooperation will be expanded  considerably.    Assessing the package of documents signed during the talks,  Guntis Ulmanis noted that he regards them "as an integral whole,  as a sad necessity bequeathed to us by history."</p>

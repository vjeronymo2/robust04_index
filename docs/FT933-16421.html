			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures selling drives equities lower LONDON'S equity market relinquished all and more of the hard-won gains realised earlier in the week as bad news on both the political and economic fronts combined to weaken all of the big international equity markets. London was one of the worst performers among the big markets, with the FT-SE 100 index closing 31.1, or 1.1 per cent, down on the session at 2,857.7, mirroring the retreat by Wall Street during early trading. Lingering market hopes that Thursday's Europe-wide interest rate cuts, might well be followed by a reduction in UK rates, came to nothing and helped to demoralise a UK equity market already suffering from end-account selling. Sentiment was further weakened when more bad economic news emerged from the US, where non-farm payrolls increased by only 13,000, well below the expected 175,000 and prompting increasing worries among market-watchers about the faltering US economy. The only real comfort for the market came from a gilts arena still performing well despite the outcome of the mid-week gilts auction, at which the Pounds 3.25bn-worth of stock was subscribed for only 1.1 times. Long-dated gilts, helped by a good showing by sterling, were never under pressure and closed about  1/8 higher, while index-linked were about  3/16 firmer, ahead of the Bank of England's announcement of another Pounds 300m of index-linked stock. The last trading session of the two-week account began with the market opening more than 8 points lower, reflecting an early decline in the FT-SE 100 future. The latter was on the retreat throughout a busy session, eventually closing at a hefty discount to the cash market, indicating that next week will see the market off to a poor start. Sentiment never recovered after the weak opening and the FT-SE 100 moved progressively lower to close only fractionally above the day's lowest point, 2,857.0, or down 31.8, reached when Wall Street was showing a 25-point decline. The FT-SE Mid 250 delivered a more robust showing, closing 6.9 off at 3,234.8, having hit peak levels on the previous four days. Turnover was 638.7m shares, down on Thursday's 650m, but above recent average levels. Customer business on Thursday was worth Pounds 1.4bn. Food retailing stocks were hit by Asda's claim of 'difficult trading', but electricity stocks celebrated the run of big dividend increases.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Japan's royal wedding fails to rekindle consumer confidence FOR THOSE who already hold Japanese stocks, the recent rise in the yen, coupled with uncertainty over an economic recovery and the political situation, may pose a strong reason to liquidate. The Nikkei average, which rose 9.8 per cent during the first quarter of the year, has stumbled around the 19,500 level since investors became increasingly wary of the sharp advance during March. Thanks to the strong performance in April, the leading index of 225 stocks managed to rise 5.4 per cent during the three months to the end of June; however, the 20,000 level has proved difficult to pass. Strong foreign buying, together with continued help from the government's public fund purchase operation, supported the index above the 20,000 level during April, pushing the p/e ratio close to 80. However, the corporate results season in May revealed that Japanese companies would post a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year ending next March, prompting some investors to ponder the high valuation figures. Consumer confidence failed to be spurred, in spite of hopes that the royal wedding in June between Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako, the former career diplomat, would trigger a recovery in retail demand as some economists had predicted. It only produced a slight uptick in sales of the princess's car, the Toyota Corolla, and pearls, which are favoured by the Japanese royal family. Even the yen, which has risen to record levels as US trade negotiators have tried to talk the currency up on the back of Japan's mounting trade surplus, threatened to undermine the fragile recovery in the manufacturing sector. The political upheaval, as reformist groups split away from the ruling Liberal Democratic party, forcing Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to dissolve parliament, and uncertainty over another bribery scandal have given investors an excuse to remain on the sidelines until the July 18 elections are over. While caution over the political situation caused a temporary sell-off of shares, most analysts reckon the end of the LDP's 38-year rule should not threaten investors. Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Barings Securities in Tokyo, says that, although a weak LDP may mean difficulty in making unpopular but necessary decisions, such as tax reform or liberalisation of markets under pressure from the US, prospects for economic recovery should be the dominant factor for stock investors. For the next three months, investors are unlikely to see much action on the Tokyo stock market, with the Nikkei index fluctuating amid thin volume, as institutional investment historically dries up. However, while summers have been unkind to share prices in recent years, the market is still receiving underlying help from the government's fund support, which may prevent the Nikkei from falling below 18,500. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Pacific region, the Hong Kong stock market, which gained 11.1 per cent on the quarter, lost steam towards the end of June, suffering from a gradual outflow of liquidity. Andrew Hunt, at Thornton Management, which specialises in Asian funds, says the market will not experience the performance seen over the past nine months. Capital inflow from China, which has supported asset prices during that period, is once again flowing back as China's liquidity is squeezed due to surging inflation. The rise in the Malaysian stock market, which advanced a marginal 0.2 per cent over the past quarter, has slowed as the country's government has tightened its grip on interest rates. However, there seems to be a case for remaining bullish over Indonesia, which gained 15.9 per cent and is still supported by competitive export prices and a steady inflow of capital. Seoul, which rose 12.3 per cent on the quarter, is also expected to continue its climb, as sluggish domestic demand suggests that there is still room for interest rates to fall.</p>

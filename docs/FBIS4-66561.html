			<p>Secret   Operation   <F P=102> 94AS0248E Karachi JASARAT in Urdu 9 Mar 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0248E </F> <F P=104>  Karachi JASARAT </F> <F P=105>  Urdu </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "American Commandos' Secretive Activities"] </F>   [Text] The activities of some U.S. soldiers participating  in the Pakistan-U.S. joint military exercises appear to be  secretive and suspicious. These include Jewish commandos who  disappear for hours during these exercises and conduct surveys  by going to Pakistan's nuclear center in Kahuta. It is  surprising how these Jewish commandos manage to enter Kahuta  where even a bird is not allowed to fly over. No one is there to  stop them. This makes us suspect that the government has decided  to roll back its nuclear program and is not worried about it  now. Mr. Nawaz Sharif as the opposition leader should also raise  his voice against these mysterious activities of the U.S.  commandos. However, he is silent. The nation would not have  learned about it if Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the newly elected leader  of Jamat-i Islami, had not revealed this information.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner, sued Friday by Dave Winfield over claims that he owes more  than $1 million to the David M. Winfield Foundation, said he has been making  payments, but to an escrow account rather than directly to the outfielder's  foundation.  </P> <P> Winfield's suit claims the New York Yankees' principal owner, and Winfield's  boss, failed to honor an agreement to pay $300,000 annually to the foundation  that fights drug abuse.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, who said the money was placed in an interest-bearing escrow  account until "an investigation of the foundation is complete and all  legitimate complaints against the foundation have been resolved," said that he  discovered "numerous questionable practices" that will be outlined in a  countersuit filed by him and the Yankees Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Police Department will make arrangements for  Iranian diplomats to visit three Iranians arrested in Hat Yai  last week in connection with an attempt to car-bomb the Israeli  Embassy in Bangkok in March.    The Police Department will also ensure that the three  suspects, now being detained at a police private training school  in Bang Khen, are in good condition.    The department's pledges followed reports by an  international  news agency that Teheran had staged a protest early this week  against the arrest of the suspects identified as Hossein  Shahriari Far, Babak Taheri and Basr Kazemi.    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, however, denied the  reports, saying Iran's Foreign Ministry had only asked the Thai  ambassador there to inform the Thai Government that it wanted  Iranian diplomats in Bangkok to have access to the suspects.    Deputy police chief Phong-ammat Amattayakun yesterday  insisted police had done their duty according to the law in  arresting the three Iranians.    He guaranteed fairness for the Iranians.    According to Pol Gen Phong-ammat, the US Embassy in Bangkok  has asked the Police Department for information about the  suspects.    Somchai Nilaphaichit, a representative of the Muslim Lawyer  Group, quoted the suspects as saying that they had no  involvement with the plot to attack the Israeli Embassy and that  they came to Thailand to do business.    Mr Somchai and Charan Malulin, a researcher at Chulalongkon  University, yesterday visited the three Iranians during which he  briefed them on Thai laws and the punishment they face if  convicted.    Mr Somchai said Babak had allegedly told him he was innocent  and that the police had no evidence against him.    He quoted Babak as saying that he would not have come back  to  Thailand if he really was involved in the foiled car-bomb plot.    Hossein, meanwhile, also denied involvement, reportedly  telling Mr Somchai that he entered Thailand to extend his visa  since he had a business concerning the trade of radio and  television sets here.    Hossein also denied reports that he had relations with a  Thai  woman, Mr Somchai said.    Hossein and the other suspects were arrested at a Hat Yai  hotel last week after immigration officers at Songkhla's Sadao  District informed local police that his photo looked similar to  a sketch produced by Lumphini police.    Hossein is wanted under an arrest warrant for allegedly  attempting to bomb the Israeli Embassy with C-4 plastic  explosives last March. The plan, however, failed after the  bomb-laden six-wheel truck allegedly driven by Hossein hit a  motorcycle-taxi a short distance from the embassy.    He later allegedly abandoned the truck and fled the scene.  The bomb hidden in a water tank in the bed of the truck, and the  body of a Thai man were accidentally found by the truck owner  about a week later.</p>

Germany's MAN Technologie AG considers it  high time that the mechanical engineering field, as a whole,  avails itself of the numerous applications of newly developed  fiber-reinforced heavy-duty ceramics. These materials are  currently being tested for use as pump and bearing parts, which,  for example, could be used in the aviation and space industry.    MAN Technologie AG, in cooperation with the Federal Ministry  of Research, has been involved in the applications-oriented  development of fiber-reinforced heavy-duty ceramics for some  time now. On the basis of a known, but radically modified  process, MAN Technologie has been producing semifinished  products in the form of plates, pipes, and profiles. The  automatic process-control system in its pilot plant has made it  possible to reduce the so-called matrix infiltration time of the  semifinished products by several hours. Using this system, a  component having a wall thickness of 10 mm now requires only 80  hours of matrix infiltration time. Other processes would require  four times this amount of time.    In technical ceramics the ceramic matrix is reinforced by  means of implanted ceramic fibers. Fracture toughness and  breaking strain are thereby substantially increased. The  material is made error- and damage-tolerant, and consequently  more reliable. In addition, the thermo-shock resistance of the  material reaches a level inaccessible to monolithic ceramics.  Various research institutes have been studying such composite  materials, also called ceramic matrix composites, for a long  time.</p>

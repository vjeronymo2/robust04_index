			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladislav Borodulin report: "Group of Presidential </F> Advisers Created. They Prefer Young Folks in the Kremlin"]    [Text] Aleksandr Lifshits, head of Boris Yeltsin's experts  group, has violated the traditions of forming consultative  councils (which used to include only academic glitterati) --  economists absolutely unknown to the public have become  presidential advisers. On 15 April, the president signed an  edict confirming the list of the group's members and rules  guiding its work.    The group of experts was created a month and a half ago as a  structural subdivision of the presidential aides service. It  was also then that its director -- Aleksandr Lifshits -- was  appointed. The edict that appeared last weekend set the cap on  the group: eight persons (six experts and two secretaries), and  defined the main areas of its work. Presidential experts in  particular are expected to prepare proposals on the  implementation of economic policy and to forecast consequences  of decisions made by parliament and the government in the  socioeconomic sphere. Mr. Lifshits stated that, in addition to  himself, five economists, "absolutely unknown to the broad  public," work in the group. He declined to identify them by  name, obviously fearful of provoking a "star complex" in his  charges.    At any rate, the group's personal composition is not all  that  important. Experts name the control function as among the  body's more obvious ones -- in regard to parliament's and the  government's economic creativity. Mr. Lifshits stated that he  "dislikes the commissar function," while the body of experts  would hardly avoid this sort of work owing to its status. In  this sense "stars on the group of experts would even prove  harmful -- each member would try to bring precisely his own  opinion to the president. Besides, members of the president's  staff do not rule out that the group was created at Sergey  Filatov's initiative.    The main purport of organizing the group in this case boils  down to creating a certain counterbalance to the State Legal  Administration [SLA], poorly controlled by Filatov and headed by  Ruslan Orekhov. The government, too, is interested in this --  its officials have long been seeing in the SLA, as Justice  Minister Yuriy Kalmykov put it, a successor to the Politburo  which "without permission" corrects (or even turns down) many  departmental plans. Should this version be correct, the  composition of the group generally loses sense -- it only  suffices to assess the ability of the group's leader to  influence decisions made by the president (especially in moments  of doubt). Judging by Mr. Lifshits' rapid rise, he enjoys  support from rather influential forces in the Kremlin. Hence he  is in a position to influence the president.</p>

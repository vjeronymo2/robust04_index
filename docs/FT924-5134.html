			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Serbs' human wall keeps UN aid from Moslems: Laura Silber reports from Bajina Basta, where angry villagers have halted a food convoy to a besieged town HOPE of emergency aid reaching Srebrenica, a besieged Moslem town in eastern Bosnia, receded yesterday after Bosnian Serb commanders sent a UN convoy on a wild goose chase. The UN, blocked for three days, suffered another setback in its third attempt to reach Srebrenica. Once again, this time in Bajina Basta, local Serbs formed a human wall on a bridge over the River Drina, linking Bosnia with Serbia, in order to block food from reaching tens of thousands of Moslems. The 20-lorry convoy was instead forced to take a new route down a winding road in the Drina river valley, 30 miles south of the previous, more direct route to the besieged Moslem stronghold. In every town where the convoy was blocked, similar events took place. Villagers screamed and jeered. Old women brandished sticks. One even waved an axe at journalists. Volleys of gunfire boomed in the surrounding hills as locals accused the Moslems of roasting their Serb victims on a spit. They said the convoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was smuggling weapons in the food packages. In other villages, weeping Serb women said the fresh graves were the reason why they would never let the convoy reach one of the last pockets of Moslem resistance. 'While we are alive, this convoy will never pass,' said Andriana, 17, a student. 'Most of my friends are buried in the cemetery. They were just a year older than me.' Officials of the UNHCR patiently reiterated that aid must be given out to all sides in the Bosnian war. But shabbily-clad Serb villagers defiantly insisted: 'We don't need your help.' The UNHCR since July has delivered 85 tonnes of aid to the town of 3,000 people. Last week, the UN severed aid to Serb-held territory in eastern Bosnia until access is given to Moslem towns. Bosnian Serb commanders told UN officials that the new route to Srebrenica in any case was an unusable dirt track. A UN reconnaissance team later confirmed that armoured personnel carriers and 10-tonne aid lorries would get stuck. Agreement for the convoy to take this new route was won after Serb commanders appeared to climb down in their war of nerves with the UN. But as the convoy commanders yesterday waited for the go-ahead, it appeared the Serbs had won again. An angry Bosnian Serb soldier asked why the world tells lies about Serbs. He gestured at the crowd of 200 people, saying 'everyone has lost a son or a husband'. The crowd waved placards in English saying: 'Don't feed our enemy' referring to the Moslems of Srebrenica, five miles away over the hillside. Across the river in Serbia, UN peacekeepers escorting the convoy set up camp in a cattle market as they awaited orders to head for Srebrenica, the only Bosnian town to have received no aid since the war erupted in April. British, Danish and Belgium peacekeepers sat eating French army rations and sipping French wine while UN officials and commanders in Sarajevo tried to pressure Serb commanders into letting the convoy through. While weeping Serb villagers seemed genuinely distressed, a UN soldier said the blockade of the convoy belonged to a military strategy. 'The Serb military obviously intends to starve the Moslems and then take the town.' Bosnian Serbs and leaders of Croatia's regular forces have agreed a ceasefire from midnight tomorrow, according to Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, agencies report from Sarajevo. He denied this amounted to a Serb-Croat 'carve-up' of Bosnia at the expense of Moslems.</p>

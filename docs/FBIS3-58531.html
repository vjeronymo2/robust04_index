Aided  by Kohl and Kinkel at the Bundestag, in Moscow Clinton assured  his Kremlin host loquaciously that the West would continue to  count on him and to place its trust in him. In the opinion of  Zhirinovskiy, that bizarre international rabble-rouser,  Washington and Bonn are banking on the wrong person, although  that is the very reason why in the current situation, from the  West and East European viewpoint, the Russian president can be  the only right person. Also it would have flattered Yeltsin to  learn from Clinton that it was above all up to the United States  and Russia to assist the old continent in developing a new  security structure. However, there must be serious reservations  about that as long as not only right-wing extremists, who did so  alarmingly well in the Duma elections, but also the old  Bolsheviks cannot come to terms with the collapse of the Eastern  empire.    Nevertheless, that will scarcely cast a shadow over the  satisfaction that Clinton as well as Yeltsin will have  particular reason for feeling this Friday. Both are being  offered the kind of foreign policy success that they badly need  at home in President Kravchuk's agreement to join them in Moscow  to conclude a treaty on destroying the nuclear arsenal that was  left in Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union. If  the parliament in Kiev, which will shortly face new elections,  does not behave awkwardly once again, Russia will remain the  only nuclear power among the republics that succeeded the Soviet  Union. In this respect, too, Clinton was given strong support  from the chancellor and foreign minister in Bonn on Thursday; on  the previous evening in Kiev, Clinton knew how to use  sensitivity and diplomatic skill to convince Kravchuk that  foreign assistance and international recognition were much more  important for an economically deprived Ukraine than nuclear  muscle-flexing.    The West should, of course, stop continually issuing  warnings  about isolating the core country of the former Soviet empire as  soon as Russia's neighbors talk about their security needs. It  is not for the United States or Europe, but solely for Russia,  to decide whether or not it wants to isolate itself.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following is a communique just in from the  General Staff of the FAA [Angolan Armed Forces]:    The FAA General Staff informs the public that National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces have stepped  up their military operations throughout the country since the  adjournment of the peace talks. UNITA operations include in  particular the attack on the Malongo oil camp in Cabinda at dawn  on 1 January, as well as an attack on an FAA logistics base in  Malange, resulting in the death of two soldiers and material  losses.    Also on 1 January, UNITA forces attacked Dange-ia-Manha  location of Cuanza Norte Province, and shelled Menongue, using  artillery.    On 2 January, UNITA attacked Quijenje location and shelled  the capital of Ukuma District in Huambo Province.    Those operations are designed to bring about changes to the  present correlation of military forces so as to gain advantages  at the negotiating table. Yet, FAA forces are thwarting every  UNITA plan by firmly defending their positions.    The FAA General Staff once again draws the attention of the  international community to the fact that UNITA is responsible  for the prevailing atmosphere of war in the country in that it  does not adhere to the so-called unilateral cease-fire it  declared on 20 September 1993, and is clearly committed to  poisoning the Lusaka talks and undermining the peace process.  Those designs ought to be condemned by public opinion as a  whole. The FAA will remain firm in the defense of the people  and democracy.    [Issued] The FAA General Staff in Luanda, 3 January</p>

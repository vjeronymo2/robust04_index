			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN GOVERNMENT WARNS 2 FIRMS ABOUT LOW BIDS  </P> <P> Japan's Fair Trade Commission today issued "stern warnings" to two Japanese  computer manufacturers that may have engaged in unfair trade practices by  bidding one yen on local government projects.  </P> <P> After several weeks of investigation, the commission decided the bids of one  yen, the equivalent of 0.7 cents, made by Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. required  "stern warnings," said Takashi Yamamoto of the FTC's Trade Practices Division.  </P> <P> The commission said the low bids, made on contracts to design computer software  for several city governments, were judged likely to be "unjust low-price sales"  and "customer inducement by unjust benefits" under the Unfair Trade Practices  chapter of the Anti-Monopoly Law.  </P> <P> The FTC's decision stopped short of saying the bids had violated the law but  warned if the two companies make excessively low bids again, there was a strong  possibility the "Anti-Monopoly Law would be applicable."  </P> <P> NEC said in a statement that it had "reflected deeply on the social outcry over  careless bidding" and had taken measures to ensure it would not occur again.  </P> <P> Fujitsu also issued a statement saying it had taken steps to prevent such  problems and repeated a request to Hiroshima and Nagano officials to cancel the  contracts won with low bids.  </P> <P> Shortly after Fujitsu won a contract to design computer software for the  Hiroshima city water supply system with a one-yen bid, several other such cases  surfaced.  </P> <P> Fujitsu and NEC were found to have submitted bids of one yen to design software  for libraries in Nagano in central Japan and for planning an information system  for Wakayama prefecture in western Japan. Fujitsu won both contracts.  </P> <P> The commission said Fujitsu also won a contract to develop a culture and  educational information system for Hiroshima with a $700 bid and with a $70 bid  won another contract to conduct a feasibility study on a library computer  system for Saitama prefecture near Tokyo.  </P> <P> "These cases are not common, but recently there has been a sudden increase that  seems to indicate a trend," the commission's statement said.  </P> <P> Yamamoto said it was uncertain whether the FTC ruling would affect the  contracts. "We cannot legally say whether the contracts should be carried out  or not. The local government officials and Fujitsu will have to discuss that  issue," he said.  </P> <P> The deals provoked criticism over what U.S. officials charged was weak  enforcement of Japan's antitrust laws. FTC officials say warnings are strict  enough to enforce compliance with fair trade rules.  </P></p>

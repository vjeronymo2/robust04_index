			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANK TO SHUT BRANCHES AT 170 K MART STORES;  </P> <P> 1ST NATIONWIDE FOCUSES ON ACQUISITION PROGRAM  </P> <P> In a major reversal of a much publicized move into K mart stores, First  Nationwide Bank said Friday that it will cease offering banking services at  convenience branches located in 170 outlets of the discount chain.  </P> <P> The San Francisco savings bank, owned by nation's second-largest thrift holding  company and a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., is the latest major financial  institution to withdraw banking services from a retail chain. Attempts by banks  and other major retailers, notably Sears Roebuck, to provide one-stop shopping  for financial services have been largely unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Sears Savings Bank closed all but one of its 41 branches located  within Sears stores in California. That same year, Security Pacific Bank and J.  C. Penney ended a pilot program offering loan and investment products at  financial centers in J. C. Penney stores in San Francisco, Sacramento and  Stockton.  </P> <P> First Nationwide, which has been owned by Ford since 1985, said its 170  branches in K mart stores -- 71 of them in California -- will be closed March  10. Account holders will be notified this week, and their accounts will be  transferred to nearby full-service offices of First Nationwide.  </P> <P> A spokesman for First Nationwide said Friday that the K mart branches accounted  for about $200 million in deposits of the thrift's total deposits of $71  billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Priorities Changed  </P> <P> "Although we learned much about offering financial services in a retail  environment, we have concluded that convenience branches in K marts don't fit  the company's new strategic focus on its target markets and profitable  operations," Robert E. Lackovic, First Nationwide chairman and chief executive,  said in a statement.  </P> <P> "K mart has given us strong support and we have an excellent relationship, but  the bank has found it necessary to change its priorities," he added.  </P> <P> The bank's holding company, First Nationwide Financial, has embarked on a  massive acquisition program over the last year that has dramatically cut into  its profit. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, it had a profit of $11.6  million and reported that it owned assets worth $23.5 billion. The year before,  profit for the nine-month period totaled $51.5 million, and assets were $16.1  billion.  </P> <P> The change in strategy reflects new management under Ford ownership and an  expansion program pegged to acquisitions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Acquisitions  </P> <P> First Nationwide's main priority will be to integrate into its existing  operations the 150 S&amp;L branch offices it has bought during the last year.  The result will be a network of about 330 conventional branches in 15 states.  </P> <P> Among the S&amp;Ls it has bought are Columbia Savings and Mile High Savings in  Denver; Pathway Financial and Uptown Savings, both in Chicago; Cardinal Federal  in Cleveland; Lincoln Federal in Westfield, N.J., and Bloomfield Savings and  First Dearborn Federal, both in Detroit.  </P> <P> "The new strategy is to go to full-service banking in brick and mortar branches  now that we have the resources of Ford and the new acquisitions," a First  Nationwide Bank spokesman explained.  </P> <P> First Nationwide, during the tenure of then-Chairman Anthony M. Frank, moved  into K mart in 1984. Frank, who left in February, 1988, to become U.S.  postmaster general, used the expansion into the retail outlets as an  inexpensive and quick way to open branches. Banking services were offered at  164-square-foot kiosks.  </P></p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Berlusconi faces new challenge on corruption Italian anti-corruption magistrates issued a new challenge at the weekend to the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, ordering a string of arrests of prominent businessmen and politicians including two executives at Fininvest, the prime minister's media empire. The move cast a further cloud over the stability of Mr Berlusconi's 10-week-old rightwing coalition. It also raised the prospect of a damaging battle between the executive branch of government and the judiciary at a time when many commentators believe the magistrates have adopted too political a role. Attention yesterday centred on the activities of the Milan magistrates. But in Catania, Sicily, magistrates also made a high-profile move when they arrested three of the best-known local politicians for alleged corruption - including Mr Salvo Ando, a former Socialist defence minister, and Mr Rino Nicolosi, the former Christian Democrat head of the Sicilian regional government. The arrest warrants came five days after the government backed down on issuing a decree that limited powers of investigating magistrates to use preventive detention. The Milan magistrates, the most prominent anti-corruption team in Italy, had threatened to resign unless the decree was withdrawn and its terms redrafted to be made less restrictive. When the decree was approved by the cabinet on July 13, the Milan magistrates were preparing a series of arrest warrants for prominent businessmen allegedly involved in paying bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, for favourable tax assessments and compliant inspections of company balance sheets. Last week 49 of these warrants were issued and another 23 late on Saturday. The warrants covered two men in Fininvest's tax department - Mr Marco Rizzi, former member of the Guardia di Finanza, and Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the department's head. Mr Sciascia's lawyer said he would hand himself over shortly but last night he had not been located. Other prominent names on the arrest list included Mr Felice Vitali, the chief executive of Gemina, the finance group that controls the Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera publishing empire controlled by Fiat. Milan magistrates have been investigating several aspects of Fininvest's operations, from the granting of television licences to illicit football transfer fee payments. The magistrates have hinted that the present line of inquiry is the most serious so far. Almost 20 members of the Guardia di Finanza are under arrest and co-operating with investigators. In less than a month, three of its members have committed suicide. Those co-operating with magistrates have reportedly said there was an organised system of payments that enabled companies to enjoy low tax assessments and square their public balance sheets with their 'real' accounts.</p>

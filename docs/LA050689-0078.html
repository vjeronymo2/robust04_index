			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> I would like to ask the protesters against using animals for medical research  two questions:  </P> <P> 1. Do they think it is more humane to use human beings for that purpose?  </P> <P> 2. How many of the protesters are vegetarians? I do not think there are many.  </P> <P> Do they know that meat eaters are killing animals by the thousands every day?  Therefore, such protests are not only ridiculous, but also hypocritical.  </P> <P> JAY CHEN  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Lloyd's chief outlines plans for shake-up DETAILS OF how Lloyd's of London plans to implement a series of far-reaching reforms of the insurance market's structure were disclosed yesterday by Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, who also confirmed his intention to resign in June. Uncertainty over the future governance of Lloyd's in the wake of the publication last month of the report outlining the reforms has delayed the appointment of a successor to Mr Lord, who is 62. His intention to resign was announced last year. When Mr Lord leaves, three senior executives, led by Mr John Gaynor, the finance chief, will take control of day-to-day management of the corporation with a new chief executive being introduced next year after all the working groups examining the recommendations of the reform task force have reported. The Lloyd's solvency committee chaired by Mr Richard Hazell, a leading underwriter, will work on details of the scheme to limit the potential losses of Lloyd's Names and will report to Lloyd's Council by the end of April. Work on the examination and implementation of the task force's 65 separate recommendations will be carried out by groups appointed by the council. Mr Hazell will chair a group examining members' agents pooling arrangements, a new unit-trust type system for Names, which expects to report in the next few months. Five other groups will examine other task force recommendations covering: the reduction of costs (chaired by Mr Brian Pomeroy); Names' rights (Sir Maurice Hodgson); corporate capital (Mr John Greig); accessibility of Names' capital (Mr Michael Cockell); and governance (Sir Jeremy Morse).</p>

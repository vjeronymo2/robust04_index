			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P.W.R.: "Small Chance of An Alliance Between </F> `Solidarity' and Walesa"]    [Excerpt] "Solidarity" ["S"] Head Marian Krzaklewski said  that the possibilities of a political maneuver that the union  can carry out are limited. "S" has nothing left to do but put  pressure on the authorities. According to him, the president  should try to achieve successes that would also be the successes  of the union; however, at the same time he did not say that the  union would support Walesa in the forthcoming presidential  elections.  <H5>  More Demonstrations </H5>   On 16 April Krzaklewski was a guest at the 9th General  Congress of the Mazowsze Region Delegates. He told the  delegates that he could see two possibilities of fighting for  "S" demands. The first consists of political possibilities. He  said that the openness of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] would  be a chance; however, "this party most clearly does not want to  take advantage of this chance." He added that in the PSL the  old nomenklatura is gaining an upper hand. According to  Krzaklewski, another political solution might be cooperation  with the president. However, according to the "S" chairman, the  president did not take advantage of the chance to "improve the  dialogue with the union" before signing the budget. He should  have held talks with "S" and, before signing the budget, he  should have submitted conditions to the coalition; the  conditions could have made it possible to satisfy at least some  demands. Later on, asked bluntly by one of the delegates  whether "S" might back Lech Walesa in the presidential  elections, Krzaklewski said that "as a result of such alliances,  the union may become dependent and it will depend first of all  on the president's activities whether the unionists will support  him."    "I personally cannot see the possibility of a political  alliance; however, this will be decided by the congress," added  Krzaklewski.    Thus, in the present situation the union should count first  of all on itself in the fight for its demands. The "S" leader  announced that there would be further pressure exerted on  authorities; however, there would be fewer strikes, more  demonstrations and information campaigns.  <H5>  Wrzodak Attacks Jankowski </H5>   Zygmunt Wrzodak, radical activist of the Mazovian "S,"  criticized at the congress the activities of the Region's  Chairman Maciej Jankowski. He said that the strikes,  manifestations, and pickets were not very successful in the  region. He asked Jankowski what he had done since the beginning  of his term and what he was going to do this year. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPEYE  </P> <P> EBB TIDE: Is Power 106 morning deejay Jay Thomas over the hill? Or maybe  running scared? We're starting to wonder -- especially after he made such a big  deal about soliciting names for his morning show -- and then picked "The Power  106 Morning Zoo," an embarrassingly lame name already in use at dozens of  stations around the country. Is it possible Thomas chose "Morning Zoo" because  it was the same moniker his new rival -- arriving KIQQ-FM deejay Scott Shannon  -- used for his morning program at New York's top-rated Z100 station?  </P></p>

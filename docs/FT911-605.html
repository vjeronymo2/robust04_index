			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Ford UK poised to show heavy loss FORD of Britain, the UK car market leader, is expected to report next week that it fell heavily into loss last year for the first time in almost two decades. Ford of Britain has not declared a pre-tax loss since 1971, although it did incur a small operating loss in 1984. In 1989, it achieved pre-tax profit of Pounds 483m (Dollars 830.8m) following a record Pounds 673m for 1988. The downturn is expected to lead to unusually tough wage negotiations in the autumn when the present two-year agreement ends. Despite deteriorating finances, Ford wages rose by 13.4 per cent last November as part of its earlier inflation-linked deal. Ford's setback contrasts with modest declines at other leading UK car makers. Vauxhall, subsidiary of General Motors of the US, increased pre-tax profit marginally to a record Pounds 239.1m. Operating profits slipped 13 per cent to Pounds 190.9m. Rover, formerly BL, saw trading profits fall 14.1 per cent to Pounds 55m, while pre-tax profits at Peugeot-Talbot, subsidiary of Peugeot of France, fell 11 per cent to Pounds 109m. The Ford of Britain group overall plunged into loss partly as a result of the 1989 takeover of Jaguar, the luxury car maker. The US parent made the Pounds 1.38bn acquisition through Ford of Britain. Jaguar is now consolidated into Ford of Britain accounts. Jaguar is believed to have incurred a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 70m last year, but Ford of Britain was also pushed into loss by carrying the financing costs for the expensive takeover. Ford of Britain's operating performance came under further pressure last year in the face of: Falling sales volumes and an erosion of market share; Lower production; Rising marketing costs; The troubled launch of its new-generation Escort/Orion range; Industrial action. Ford's new car sales in the UK fell by 16.7 per cent in 1990 to 507,260, against a drop in the overall market of 12.7 per cent. Its share of the market fell from 26.5 per cent to 25.3 per cent. Car output at the Dagenham and Halewood plants dropped 13.8 per cent, to 329,597. According to Ford in the US, labour disputes in the UK in the first quarter of last year, chiefly the seven-week closure of its Halewood, Merseyside, plant, cut pre-tax profits by Dollars 335m (Pounds 196m). The Halewood dispute was particularly damaging as it coincided with the build-up to the costly change-over of production systems to the new Escort/Orion.</p>

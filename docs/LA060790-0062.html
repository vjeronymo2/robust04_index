			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> STUDENTS SEE HOW IDEAS FLY IN CONTEST  </P> <P> The children chose bold names for their airplanes: Supersonic Spyplane, 391  Speedbird and Jetski III. Although these planes were made of flimsy white  paper, their young pilots took them as seriously as the shuttles they hope to  ride into outer space someday.  </P> <P> "I want to be an astronaut," said Jesus Sanchez, 8. "I want to explore."  </P> <P> Sanchez and about 14 other members of the Young Astronaut Program flew the  paper planes in a contest Wednesday in the yard of the E.P. Foster Elementary  School in Ventura.  </P> <P> The nationwide program for elementary and junior high school students promotes  science, mathematics and space-related subjects. The effort is intended to help  reverse the low proficiency levels of American students in these subjects,  compared with children in other industrialized countries.  </P> <P> The students' creations were judged by the school's principal and two reading  specialists on the planes' distance, speed and fancy acrobatics. Using scissors  and thin white paper, the students designed the planes, adding ridges and folds  that enabled the aircraft to dip and glide in strange patterns. Paper clips  mounted to the folds increased the planes' speed.  </P> <P> Sanchez's F-14 Tomcat, an intricately folded plane, earned him the title of  overall winner and first place in the distance category and second place in  acrobatics.  </P> <P> Sanchez's peers also expressed an avid interest in aviation. Mario Pena, who  placed third in distance, said he too wanted to go into space. "I'd like to see  the planets," he said.  </P> <P> Winning planes flew 20 to 30 feet, and some remained in the air for more than  two minutes.  </P> <P> Teacher Catharine Byl began a chapter of the Young Astronauts Program at the  school in February and has helped about 20 second- and third-grade students  build model space shuttles, understand gravity and weightlessness and  experiment with team-related projects.  </P> <P> "There's a real need for kids today to improve in those areas," she said,  adding that aerospace and aviation will be among the major fields in the future  as the technological revolution continues.  </P> <P> Byl has been active in the Eagle Flight Program, an organization that trains  classroom teachers to instruct other teachers on methods to teach aerospace in  the classroom.  </P> <P> Foster Principal Greg Kampf said he has never disciplined a student for flying  paper airplanes in the classroom.

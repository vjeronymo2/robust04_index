			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / US boosts contribution to Ulster capital fund The Northern Ireland peace process has been given another boost with the US administration announcing a package of new measures to help the economy of the province and Irish border counties. Under the deal, Washington's annual contribution to the International Fund for Ireland is to increase, subject to congressional approval, from Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.2m) in 1995-96 to Dollars 30m for each of the following two years. The increases will take the total commitment of the Clinton administration to the fund to Dollars 100m. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said: 'I am delighted that Northern Ireland is still at the top of the agenda of the American president.' Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'This is a very welcome announcement by Mr Clinton and confirms the undertakings which he previously gave to help build on the peace. I deeply appreciate the involvement which the president has shown and I am very aware of his willingness to assist us economically.' In addition President Clinton has said he will personally host an international trade and investment conference on Ireland next April in Philadelphia. It was also announced that Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, will be in Belfast for the investment conference organised by the UK government in December. Mr Brown will go on to Dublin for talks. Forty US companies are already operating in Northern Ireland providing 9,000 jobs. The International Fund for Ireland, set up in 1986 by the US and the European Union, last year stood at Pounds 225m. The body provides venture capital for small and medium sized businesses in the province's most depressed areas. Last year it helped create more than 2,600 jobs. There was a more guarded welcome for the package from the Ulster Unionist party. Mr James Wilson, the party's general secretary, said: 'Financial aid is always welcome provided it is fairly distributed in the province and provided it is directed to areas of real need and in support of real jobs.'</p>

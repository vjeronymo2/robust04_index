			<p>BFN     [Text] The third day of negotiations on the implementation  of the Washington agreement between the Croats and Bosniaks  ended at the U.S. Embassy with the exchange of maps. Tihomir  Vinkovic reports from Vienna:    [Vinkovic] The negotiations lasted a long time, and some  progress was made after all. The questions of external borders  with the Serbs, and of the leaderhip of the federation and the  government have been been resolved in principle. The question  that remains to be resolved is the number of the cantons in the  federation and their borders. The maps were drafted and  exchanged at the end of today's round of talks. The delegation  of the Bosnian Croats, led by Kresimir Zubak, exchanged the  delineation maps with the Bosniak delegation, led by Haris  Silajdzic.    The contentious areas are central Bosnia and the  municipalities of Mostar and Stolac. The positions on central  Bosnia have converged, Kresimir Zubak said. But is this enough  to reach an agreement?    The part of the negotiations dealing with the relations  between the Bosniak-Croat federation and the Republic of Croatia  passed without difficulties. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate  Granic took part in it.    The only certain thing is that the negotiations will  continue  tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood "on the </F> Jordanian-Jewish negotiations and their results"; date not given]    [Text] "Men said to them: A great army is gathering  against you, and frightened them. But it only increased their  faith. They said: For us God sufficeth, and He is the best  disposer of affairs. And they returned with grace and bounty  from God. No harm ever touched them. For they followed the  good pleasure of God, and God is the Lord of bounties unbounded.  It is only the evil one that suggests to you the fear of his  votaries. Be ye not afraid of them, but fear me, if ye have  faith." [Koranic verse]    The Jordanian Government has announced, in an unjustified  way, its intention to expedite the negotiations with the Zionist  enemy, as well as its concern to reach preliminary agreements  and detailed agendas in the fields of security, economy, and  environment. These agreements were reached in record time and  within a few days, as if things were prepared in advance.    The announcement of the agenda was accompanied by a new  Jordanian negotiating platform which is governed by a new spirit  and definitions which were expressed by some officials in a  language that is not in harmony with the constants and red lines  to which the state committed itself. This constituted real  changes in the Jordanian negotiating policy, which will have a  negative effect even on the extent of the Zionist "concessions!"  over the territories and potentials usurped from Jordan which  would be produced by these negotiations. These agreements,  agendas, or statements recognize the Jewish enemy in terms of  existence, state, legitimacy, and interests, and implicitly free  this enemy from usurpation, occupation, and historical  hostility. In addition, the enemy will be introduced to the  regional states as if it is an Arab state.    The cooperation and coordination in the field of economy,  water, security, and sovereignty in fact constitute  normalization of relations and cooperation with the enemy in  accordance with its demands and wishes. Such cooperation is  unmatched by any cooperation between Jordan and any other Hebrew  [as published] state, or even among the Arab countries  themselves.    The expeditious signing of these agendas and the statements  on separate solutions are an achievement of the enemy's  strategy, which is based on Zionist penetration and reaching  separate deals with each party, in order to make gains and  become the strongest party which can apply pressure and impose  whatever it wants on the Arab parties.    The Muslim Brotherhood, which announced its rejection of  negotiations with the usurper Zionist enemy and of relinquishing  any part of land and Arab and Islamic rights -- in view of its  understanding of history, the nature of conflict with the  Zionists, and the situation of the nation and the region --  reiterates its stand and announces its rejection of all steps,  agreements, and agendas, which were announced, and reiterates  the following:    -- The contents of the detailed agendas on security,  environment, and tourism are the inauguration of normalization  with the Zionist enemy and the laying down of foundations for  cooperation with the enemy before it even acknowledges Jordan's  rights and their dimensions, not to mention restoring them.  This is considered a consent to the Zionist view and an  achievement of its famous slogan: Peace for peace.    This leads to wasting the nation's rights to the  territories and holy places that the enemy has usurped to  establish its entity. This also leads to forcing cooperation  and normalization, which are impossible to rescind in case the  Zionists refuse to recognize all our rights. All this is a  departure from the basis of the negotiations and a risky gamble  involving national rights with an enemy well versed in treachery  and revoking charters and conventions.    --What is taking place reflects a state of anxiousness to  approach the Zionist entity first in order to achieve some gains  for fear that some may fall in the Zionist lap at the expense of  some of Jordan's rights.    --What we fear most is for the Jordanian-Israeli  negotiations  to turn into a Jordanian Oslo accord, which would serve Zionist  schemes and meet the Zionist objective of having separate deals,  exactly as the Palestinian Oslo accord did.    --The declared justifications for this negotiatory  acceleration do not give the government the right to take steps  for which Jordan will pay in terms of its Arab relations,  especially since Jordan is suffering from closed doors with most  Arab neighbors. Is it reasonable for the government to run  behind Zionist promises and deceptive plans and block its  relations with certain Arabs? This is unreasonable, regardless  of other's calculations and intentions, which are known by  nobody but God.    --We believe that what is going on will lead to a separate  solution. This is practically the opposite of the comprehensive  solution that the government is talking about, regardless of its  attempts to justify its acts.    We urge the regimes and peoples to face up to those  challenges and to maintain the nation's rights, sovereignty, and  wealth, which are not the property of a single generation, but  of all generations.    We realize that the nation's current weakness is a transient  state of affairs, which does not justify compliance and  relinquishing rights. This weakness can be overcome by resolve,  adequate management, patience, and further cohesion, freedom,  and justice. Above all, we should hold fast to God's approach  and be united under His laws and course.    In its long history, the nation has experienced times of  greater weakness. It did not surrender, however, but instead  maintained a high spirit of jihad and put up a valiant  resistance, thus overcoming its weaknesses and emerging  stronger, thanks to its faith in God and then to the efforts of  its faithful sons.    We urge the people to reject all past and subsequent  destructive political settlement agreements, not to comply with  the enemy's will, and to resist those agreement's subsequent  effects.    "Call to mind when ye were a small band, despised through  the  land, and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; but He  provided a safe asylum for you, strengthened you with His aid,  and gave you good things for sustenance: That ye might be  grateful. O ye that believe! Betray not the trust of God and  the Apostle, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to  you." [koranic verse]    God is great. God be praised.</p>

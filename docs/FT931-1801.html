			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (4): IBM strategy for 1993 FOLLOWING IBM's 1992 losses, chairman John Akers said: 'Our financial results are not acceptable to us or our shareholders. We are taking aggressive actions to improve our competitiveness and profitability.' The actions include: intensifying the focus on key growth areas: IBM will continue to invest in growth areas such as client-server computing, networking, RISC technology and multimedia. IBM's marketing and services units will dedicate extra resources to growth areas including consulting, systems integration and services. Revenue from sources other than hardware sales amounted to 48 per cent of total revenues in 1992, compared with 43 per cent in 1991. Further reducing costs: IBM cut its workforce by more than 40,000 employees in 1992. In 1993, another 25,000 jobs will go, primarily in businesses related to large systems.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: ERM strains highlighted WEAKNESS within the European exchange rate mechanism was highlighted yesterday. The Bundesbank was forced to intervene to support the franc, the Belgian and Dutch central banks helped to prop up the Danish krone and the Irish punt looked extremely vulnerable writes Peter John. The Bundesbank intervened three times to prop up the franc, once during European trading, once at the afternoon fixing and again in the aftermarket. The bank also publicly announced that it had been buying selling D-Marks to buy francs, thus lending additional moral support. This was compounded by a statement from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister that there was 'no need' to devalue the franc. The Bank of France was also intervening Nevertheless, the franc slid to finish FFr3.418 against the D-Mark, down from FFr3.413 on Thursday. Yesterday's close was the lowest since shortly after the European currency crisis of mid-September and within 1.2 centimes of its ERM floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.4305. Even analysts who believe there will be no devaluation because of the fundamental strength of the French economy were concerned. Mr Brian Hilliard, economist with the French-owned bank Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said: 'Trading is very thin at the moment so you get more banks for your franc. I am surprised that the central banks have not been more aggressive.' More bearish economists such as Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank are convinced that devaluation is on the cards. 'We are seeing a drying of liquidity in the market and there is an increasing feeling that the French will not be able to resist either devaluation, flotation of the currency or a temporary suspension from the ERM' Mr MacKinnon believes there is a risk of 'meltdown in the current structure of the ERM'. The view was taking hold that Ireland would be forced to devalue very shortly. Yesterday, Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, attempted to calm the fears by stating that he ruled out devaluation. Dealers added that Danish companies were heavy sellers of the Danish krone. They said corporate selling had been the signal for the recent devaluation of the Swiss franc. The problems in Europe overshadowed the performance of the dollar. Also, a severe blizzard in the US threatened to immobilise the New York financial market and ensured that once again positive economic news had little impact. The dollar was steady against the D-Mark at DM1.5765 but slightly firmer against the pound and Yen.</p>

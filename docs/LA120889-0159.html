			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO KEEP YOUR CHRISTMAS TREE FRESH  </P> <P> Even if you have just cut your own tree an hour ago, when you get it home make  another fresh cut on the butt to open the pores, which will have been clogged  by sap. Cut off at least one-half inch. If you do not make a fresh cut, the  tree will not be able to absorb water.  </P> <P> After the cut is made, put the tree immediately in water; the longer you wait  the less ability the tree has to absorb water.  </P> <P> If the tree is not going into the house soon after purchase, it should be  stored in a bucket of water on a cool porch or patio, away from wind and sun.  </P> <P> An average tree may consume between a quart and a gallon of water per day. If  the water level drops below the cut end of the trunk, a seal will form and no  more water will be absorbed. So don't forget to add water every day.  </P> <P> Place tree away from heat sources such as vents, fireplaces, wood stoves and  fireplace inserts, radiators, television sets or sunny windows.  </P> <P> After Christmas, before the tree dries, remove it from the house for pick up by  your disposal service or for a local chipping and compost program.  </P> <P> Source: California Christmas Tree Growers  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 16 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni  warplanes dodged southern anti-aircraft fire to bomb Aden  airport on Thursday, damaging hangers there, an AFP  correspondent reported.    A huge plume of smoke rose above the airport in the southern  stronghold as ambulances raced to the scene, following the air  raid late morning.    There were no immediate details of casualties or the extent  of the damage.    Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  besieging the key port city of Aden for three weeks, have  targeted the airport several times to stop southern jet planes  from taking off there.    Meanwhile, northern artillery units continued to fire shells  sporadically at Aden following a dawn attack on the northern  suburb of Shaykh 'Uthman which hospital officials said killed at  least 18 civilians and wounded several more.</p>

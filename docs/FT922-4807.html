			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Thames Water Judging by the careful choreography, yesterday's annual results from Thames Water were designed to avoid offending several constituencies. Hence, perhaps, the restrained 10 per cent dividend rise, after which cover is still a fat 2.9 times. Hence also the 10 per cent cut in the chairman's headline earnings and the emphasis on the scale of this year's capital spending. After all, Thames scarcely wants to be compared with the likes of BT. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the results was the group's championing of its non-regulated businesses, which made a net profit for the first time. The declared Pounds 3m figure may have been somewhat flattered by inter-group transactions, but Thames made its point. Though its sheer size makes it hard for unregulated profits to have a real impact, in the long term it will be easier to reward shareholders without alienating customers if the money is earned away from the basic business. On that front, Thames can boast impressive progress in reducing losses from leaking pipes, while its spending programme, including the London ring main, is comfortably on course. The shares are on a current year multiple of less than 8 and a yield of 5.8 per cent, which seems adequate protection against fresh interventions by the regulator.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- PLO Executive Committee member  Jamal al-Surani has said the Palestinian-Israeli Cairo talks on  implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement will not lead to an  honest implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP].    Al-Surani regretted that the Palestinian negotiator did not  ask what had become of the original Palestine that was divided  by Resolution 181.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, he added that the Palestinian  negotiator may get Gaza and the West Bank, a half or a quarter  of it, and he may get nothing. This is because the United  States and Israel have a special interpretation of Resolution  242. They consider that Jerusalem is not an occupied city, that  the occupied territories are not Palestinian but disputed  territories, and they view settlements as legitimate.    He added: What is going on is not negotiations or peace  because the crux of the Palestine question, which is the problem  of refugees was excluded from the Madrid conference.    On the Syrian criticism that the Palestinian leadership  separated the Palestinian-Israeli track from other tracks,  al-Surani said: Syria has the right to say this, but it has no  right to separate itself from the Palestine question. When  Syrian Foreign minister Faruq al-Shar' criticized the  Palestinian leadership he did so out of pain and bitterness, and  his objective is the restoration of coordination and not to say  goodbye to the Palestinians.    Al-Surani said: Regrettably, the Palestinian leadership is  committing the mistake of acting unilaterally, and it should  reconsider this situation.</p>

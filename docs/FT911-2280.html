			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: Plastics recycling attacks new sales The growth of plastics recycling will make a serious impact on sales of new plastics in western Europe, according to a study by Chem Systems, the London-based consultancy. This will exacerbate the overcapacity which already threatens the profitability of the petrochemicals industry. According to most estimates, about 7m tonnes of plastic are handled every year by Europe's municipal waste authorities. If 'long-term' wastes such as cars and televisions are included, the total amount of plastic discarded may be as much as 15m tonnes per year. Polyethylene forms the largest component of plastic waste. The proportion of Europe's plastic waste that is recycled is likely to increase from about 6 per cent today to 16 per cent in 1996, as governments promote recycling on environmental grounds through a mixture of compulsion and financial incentives. According to Chem Systems, the direct effect of recycling will be to reduce consumption of virgin polymer (freshly manufactured plastic) by more than 2m tonnes a year from the mid 1990s. Assuming an average price of Dollars 1,500/tonne, that would mean the loss of Dollars 3bn worth of sales, at a time when the industry will have increased its manufacturing capacity in anticipation of sustained growth in demand for new plastic. Eric Johnson, the consultant responsible for the study, says: 'The planners and business managers in the plastics and petrochemicals industry have not yet perceived the impact of recycling. They say they have but they really have not.' Since recycling is more suitable for some plastics and for some applications than for others, its impact will vary between companies. Producers of low-performance plastics are most vulnerable. Germany is taking the lead in promoting European plastics recycling. The German target is for 80 per cent of packaging to be recycled by 1995. This will require 40 recycling plants to be built, with an average capacity of 10,000 tonnes per year and a cost of DM1bn (Pounds 330m). Several other countries have ambitious recycling targets. Italy, for example, is aiming for 40 per cent recycling of plastic containers by December 1991. The UK is taking less action than most of its European partners and has no national recycling target. Although the plastics industry is adopting a co-operative attitude, its spokesmen maintain that the costs of collecting and sorting different types of plastic make recycling uneconomic. The industry is promoting instead the idea of using waste plastics as a fuel by controlled burning. For petrochemical manufacturers, incineration has the advantage that used plastics do not re-appear to compete with their new polymers. But according to the Chem Systems analysis, recycling may be a better economic proposition.</p>

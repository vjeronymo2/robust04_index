			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / BT plans 'smart' cards for callboxes British Telecommunications yesterday announced that it was going ahead with a system of phonecards and payphones based on 'smart card' integrated microchip technology. BT said the cards would improve the reliability of payphones and could lead to the introduction of multi-purpose cards designed for a range of functions, such as paying for goods in shops. BT plans to introduce the payphones from next year. Three companies, including GPT, the UK-based joint venture between GEC and Siemens, will provide payphones able to accept smart phonecards. Two companies, Gemplus and GPT, will produce the phonecards. The smart phonecard will be a prepaid card similar to existing phonecards and will be used in a similar way. BT said the new payphones would be conventional in appearance and offer a cash-and-card or card-only payment option.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Mediation fails in BA-Virgin 'dirty tricks' row THE acrimonious 'dirty tricks' dispute between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways looked set last night to be decided in court after the collapse of a mediation attempt by the Civil Aviation Authority. BA said the main obstacle to a settlement was Virgin's insistence on a payment of not less than Pounds 9m in compensation. It suggested that the matter should be settled by impartial arbitration. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, said it now seemed inevitable that the matter could be decided only in court: 'Once again, at the last moment, BA have decided to move the goalposts.' The collapse of talks ends three weeks of meetings held by Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the CAA, with both airlines to try to resolve the dispute. The CAA said it was disappointed that a deal had proved impossible in a dispute it considered to be 'potentially harmful to British aviation'. BA denied reports that it was ready to pay Pounds 9m to settle the claims by Virgin. It said it had made clear at the start of the discussions initiated by the CAA that the proposed settlement was worth nothing like that figure and that BA's board had reaffirmed its stance on Friday. BA suggested that all Virgin's claims should be submitted to an arbitrator, except for Pounds 5m involved in a long-running aircraft maintenance dispute which is already in arbitration. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, said the airline had always declared its willingness to pay any legitimate claims that Virgin might have. 'We hope Virgin will accept this simple, direct and obviously fair way of determining the legitimacy and worth, if any, of its claims.' In response, Mr Branson said Virgin had expressly entered negotiations on the basis that BA pay Pounds 9m compensation for the 'dirty tricks' campaign to lure passengers away by using Virgin's computer data. 'Much hard work and effort has been expended by the CAA and Virgin in attempting to agree the outstanding issues. Just at the point of agreeing those issues, BA, without any reason whatsoever, have once again withdrawn their offer of settlement.' Last night, Virgin said that it had originally asked for Pounds 13m, but had agreed on Pounds 9m as a basis for negotiations if BA dropped a 'gagging clause' that would have stopped Virgin from raising the matter again.

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold demand 'up 24%' in first quarter GOLD DEMAND in markets monitored by the World Gold Council rose by 24 per cent to 632 tonnes in the first quarter of this year compared with the same months of 1992. The council is a promotional organisation financed by gold producers and the markets monitored cover about 75 per cent of world demand. This jump in demand coincided with very weak gold prices and the price dropped to Dollars 326.15 a troy ounce on March 10, the lowest for seven years. Prices ranged between Dollars 326 and Dollars 331 an ounce in the quarter. According to the council, the developing markets continued to drive gold demand growth. In Asia first-quarter demand was up 22 per cent at 243 tonnes and in the Middle East and India it was up 56 per cent to 203.1 tonnes. Following liberalisation of the gold market in 1992, demand in India soared by 93 per cent in the first quarter to 114 tonnes. However, gold jewellery demand in the developed markets fell by 2 per cent to 131 tonnes with a 4 per cent increase in US consumption being offset by an 8 per cent fall in Europe while Japanese demand remained flat.</p>

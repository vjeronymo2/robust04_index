			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / European banana war looms as Fyffes rejects bid A RENEWED battle over market share in the European banana market loomed yesterday with the announcement by Fyffes, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable distributor, that it had rejected a IPounds 420m (Pounds 421.5m) bid for the company. News of the approach, widely believed to have come from the California-based Dole Foods, drove up Fyffes' share price to around 130p. It followed two days of heavy trading in the stock as rumours grew of an imminent takeover bid. Dole said it had no comment to make on the Fyffes' announcement 'at this stage'. The board of Fyffes said last night that, having considered the approach, 'which may or may not' have led to an offer of IPounds 1.15p per share, it decided 'that the proposals involved in the approach are not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders and, accordingly, the discussion has terminated'. Fyffes has become a tempting takeover target for the three world leaders in the banana business, namely Chiquita (United Brands), Dole (Castle and Cooke) and Del Monte, which face substantial cuts in their access to the fast-growing EC market under new Community quota arrangements due to be implemented in July. Under the arrangements, the cheap 'dollar' bananas sourced in Central and South America by the three majors, which supply around 63 per cent of the European market, will face a quota limit of 2m tons. Any excess triggers a tariff of Ecu850 (Pounds 677) per ton, around 170 per cent. About 2.3m tons of 'dollar' bananas were imported by the EC last year, two-thirds by Chiquita. Fyffes stands to benefit strongly from the new quota arrangements. Mr Neil McCann, group chairman, said the new quota regime was vital for the future of the company. A former UK subsidiary of United Brands, Fyffes was sold for IPounds 29.4m in 1986 to FII, an Irish fruit distribution company built up by the McCann family from Dundalk, during the 1960s and '70s. Fyffes received a full listing on the stock exchange in 1987. At 1.15p per share, yesterday's bid values Fyffes at around IPounds 420m, including some 60m convertible preference shares on top of the 278m ordinary shares. Cash-rich Fyffes is a debt-averse, but acquisitive company. In 1990 it began a strategy to develop its own sources of 'dollar' bananas in Central America, with a view to expansion in the post-1992 European Single Market. See Lex</p>

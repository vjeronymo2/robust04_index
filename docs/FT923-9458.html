			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Chase Manhattan cards offer lower variable rates CHASE Manhattan, the second-biggest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in the US, yesterday said it would offer lower variable interest rates to more than half of its credit card holders in a move which reflects the competitiveness of the plastic card industry, writes Karen Zagor. The announcement comes just months after Citibank, the biggest US issuer, offered lower rates to its better customers. The reduced variable rates will take effect when Classic Card balances exceed Dollars 2,000, and Gold Card balances exceed Dollars 3,500. Members in good standing will also have a choice between their current fixed rate or a variable rate.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Guaranteeing rises in the Footsie - At a Glance Save &amp; Prosper has launched a third issue of its Guaranteed Equity Bond, which offers the bulk of the rise of the FT-SE 100 Index over five years, or return of the original capital. Investors can choose between 98 per cent of the rise of the index, or 90 per cent of the rise, with lock-in facilities when the market rises 20 and 40 per cent. As with most products, the investor does not benefit from the yield on the market. Northern Rock's guaranteed product is open until April 8. This offers the rise in the FT-SE over five years, or 15 per cent gross (11.25 per cent net). If the market rises 50 per cent, that increase is locked in. However, after tax, the basic rate taxpayer will only receive 75 per cent of the index's rise, and will not benefit from the dividend yield.</p>

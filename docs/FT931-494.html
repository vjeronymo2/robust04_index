			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Alleged insider denies receiving profit warning AN investment analyst accused of insider dealing yesterday told the Court of Session in Edinburgh that when Mr Peter Runciman, chairman of the waste disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan, gave him a briefing he failed to say the company planned to issue a profits warning. Mr Thorold Mackie, an investment analyst with Bell Lawrie White, the Edinburgh stockbrokers, said Mr Runciman did not tell him that everything discussed at their meeting was confidential. Mr Mackie has pleaded not guilty to a charge of insider dealing under the 1985 Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. Mr Runciman said in evidence last week that on September 6 1991 he told Mr Mackie that Shanks &amp; McEwan was to issue a profits warning because its earnings per share for the half-year were likely to fall slightly instead of growing as indicated previously. He also said he told Mr Mackie that everything said at the meeting was confidential. The prosecution alleges that Mr Mackie 'counselled and procured' two salesmen at Bell Lawrie to deal in the shares of Shanks &amp; McEwan. They sold 1.9m of their clients' shares, realising Pounds 1.39m more than if they had sold the shares after the profits warning was issued. Mr Mackie told the jury that at the meeting, which had been arranged about a month earlier, Mr Runciman told him 'there would be little by way of growth in earnings per share' for Shanks &amp; McEwan that half-year. Mr Runciman gave him other information for a circular, and told him that four particular items of detailed information were confidential. Asked by Mr Donald Macfadyen, QC, defending, whether Mr Runciman had indicated that any other information was confidential, Mr Mackie replied: 'He did not.' Mr Mackie said Mr Runciman had not used the phrase 'profits warning', nor had he said anything to indicate that the company was planning to issue a profits warning. Mr Runciman had said nothing that conveyed the idea of issuing a profits warning, Mr Mackie said. After the meeting Mr Mackie had a meeting at Bell Lawrie with salesmen Mr Allan Gilmour Thom and Mr Colin McLeod Telfer. He gave a resume of Mr Runciman's briefing, telling them there would be 'little by way of growth in earnings per share or no growth in earnings per share, which is the same thing'. The three concluded that clients should be advised to 'take the top off their holdings in SME', Mr Mackie said. The shares were sold the following Monday, September 9. On September 11 Mr Runciman telephoned Mr Mackie and said: 'Thorold, you have broken your confidence. I gave you privileged information.' Mr Mackie told the court: 'I then said: 'You gave me certain things in confidence and I haven't passed those on'.' Mr Mackie said that if Mr Runciman had told him about the profits warning, 'I would have considered myself an insider. I would have gone back to the office and said nothing. For an analyst to have been made an insider and then ignored it would have been suicidal.' The jury will hear closing speeches today.</p>

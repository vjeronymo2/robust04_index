			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA) -- The upcoming high-level  meeting between the two intermediary organizations on both sides  of the Taiwan Strait aims to forge mutual trust and promote  bilateral cooperation, chairman Huang Kun-hui of the Mainland  Affairs Council said Thursday [20 January].    "We hope the meeting between the deputy heads of Taipei's  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) scheduled to start  late this month can find ways to resolve some practical issues  arising from increasing bilateral contacts in recent years,"  Huang told the press prior to his departure for Manila to  explain Taipei's policy toward Beijing to Philippine and  overseas Chinese business leaders.    Huang also urged mainland authorities to face the reality  that China is now divided and ruled by two different  governments. "The two sides should respect each other and work  together to pave the way for eventual national unification," he  stressed.    SEF vice chairman and secretary-general Chiao Jen-ho will  leave for Mainland China January 31 to meet with his ARATS  counterpart Tang Shubei on how to strengthen cooperation between  the two organizations and to resolve thorny cross-strait issues,  such as repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal  immigrants, fishing disputes and protection of Taiwan investors.    This will be Chiao's first trip to the mainland since he  assumed his current post late November. Chiao was previously a  vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and a close  aide to president Li Teng-hui.    The forthcoming Chiao-Tang meeting will be the first  high-level contact between the two intermediary bodies since the  ground- breaking talks between SEF chairman C.F. Ku and ARATS  president Wang Daohan in Singapore last April.    The cabinet-level MAC originally planned to postpone the  Chiao- Tang talks to protest Beijing's recent unfriendly moves,  including forcing France to stop arms sales and Lesotho to sever  diplomatic ties with Taiwan.    The council, however, announced late Wednesday that it  finally decided to allow Chiao to visit the mainland as  scheduled with a view to promoting constructive interaction  between the two sides.    Chiao will be accompanied by several other SEF officials,  including deputy secretaries-general Shih Chi-ping and Hsu  Hui-you, legal service department director Lin Kui-mei and  economic affairs department director Chang Chung-lin, on his  mainland visit.    SEF and ARATS officials held three rounds of working-level  talks in the second half of last year, including one in Taipei,  but failed to reach any agreements mainly because of Beijing's  reluctance to recognize Taipei's jurisdiction over territories  now under its control.    SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations founded by  their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in  the absence of official contacts.</p>

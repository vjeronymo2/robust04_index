Some time ago, the final damming of the tideland of Chongsu  island in South Hwanghae Province was completed to bring 1,000  hectares of tideland under cultivation. Last year saw the  reclamation of 3,300 hectares of Kumsong tideland.    The three farms which made their appearance in the Kwaksan  tideland in North Pyongan Province reaped a rich crop in their  first year's farming. These tideland-turned fields have a  favourable condition for comprehensive mechanisation of paddy  farming. Their irrigation networks are also flawless.    Korea, which has a limited arable land with mountains  occupying the greater part of its area, has directed big efforts  to tideland reclamation, steadily increasing the investment in  it.    Tideland reclamation has been pushed ahead in various areas  on the west coast. As a result, a hundred and scores of islets  have been linked with the land, the length of the coastline has  been drastically shortened and over 80 fishing ports have moved  to the skirts of the outstretched land.    A number of farms have appeared in the tideland-turned  fields. Modern socialist villages with fashionable residential  houses have cropped up in the former tideland of Yomju county  and Tasa island in North Pyongan Province. Tideland farms with  a thousand and several hundred hectares of arable land each have  come into being in Onchon, Chungsan, Pyongwon, Sukchon and other  areas of South Pyongan Province. South Hwanghae Province has  several tideland farms.    The fields of the Yangji and Namhae cooperative farms  situated in the vast tideland-turned field of Unchon county have  been arranged for mechanized farming.    Last year, the June 3 and Ansok cooperative farms in Onchon  county and many other farms in former tideland reaped more than  8 tons of grain from each hectare.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MEET THE PRESS  </P> <P> Thursday at noon at Culver City Studio, actress Diane Ladd of ABC's upcoming  movie about Rock Hudson will turn over a check for $25,000 to the American  Health Foundation to be used to treat persons with AIDS. Ladd and Hudson became  friends when they starred in "Embryo" in 1976, and since his death she has  worked to combat AIDS. The $25,000 represents half of her $50,000 one-week  salary for "Rock," in which she plays Kay Fitzgerald, Hudson's mother. Thomas  Ian Griffith plays Hudson in the film. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

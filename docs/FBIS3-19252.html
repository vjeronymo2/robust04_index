At the federal  party congress over the weekend the delegates adopted  corresponding programs for the European elections and the  Bundestag elections. Honorary PDS Chairman Hans Modrow was  nominated as top candidate for the European elections. A total  of 94 percent of the delegates voted for the former GDR premier,  who was indicted for perjury on Friday [11 March]. The fourth  place on the ticket is occupied by Heinrich Fink, former rector  of the Berlin Humboldt University -- another candidate who has  been laid open to suspicion because of his former contacts with  the Stasi. Before his election, Fink came out against locking  the Stasi files away. One just has to read them correctly, he  said, defending his former role in the GDR.    In its European program the PDS rejects the Maastricht  Treaties, but it comes out in favor of European unification and  the creation of a "European Germany." In the future European  Parliament the PDS wants to work for overcoming mass  unemployment, for equal rights for men and women, for more  democracy, and for an ecological restructuring.    If it gets into the Bundestag again, the PDS plans to work  for the same goals there. At the conclusion of the party  congress, Bundestag group chairman Gregor Gysi expressed  optimism that the PDS will have even more deputies than so far  in the new Bundestag. It will be a "consistent opposition  party" there, Gysi announced. He explained in detail how the  PDS wants to combat unemployment. In this connection, Gysi  called for flexible work time models, an industrial policy by  the state, the reduction of obstacles for investments and  employment, as well as alternative forms of production. The  social division of the society because of unemployment is  gaining the dimension of social destruction, Gysi said.    Gysi rejected the accusation from the ranks of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] that the PDS is preventing a  change in power in Bonn. The Bundestag deputy noted that it is  the declared goal of the SPD to block the PDS. The SPD and  Alliance 90/Greens are striving for participation in power at  almost any cost. However, they are not a real alternative. The  decision for the PDS does not endanger the political change in  Germany. It is not the Social Democrats that are the "main  enemy" of the PDS; the main enemy is on the Right, Gysi said.  However, the SPD remains a political opponent. On the fringes  of the congress, the former PDS chairman said that he is always  ready for cooperation with the SPD on specific, individual  issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Shining Path [SL] dissident faction on 24  January rejected the actions carried out by members of the  Shining Path leadership to reach "a peace agreement" with the  government and labeled them "capitulators, informers, and  cowards."    The manifesto is a reply to a letter released on 23 January  in which many Shining Path inmates expressed their "decided and  total support for the strategic decision" of Abimael Guzman to  negotiate peace with the government.    The dissident SL faction's manifesto was sent to several  Lima  newspapers and signed by a so-called SL Lima Regional Committee  and a "Committee of Relatives of Peruvian Political Prisoners,  Prisoners of War, and Missing People." This latter committee,  which presents itself as an SL military branch for the first  time, apparently has abandoned its semi-legal status and decided  to go underground.    The dissident faction is headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand,  alias "Comrade Feliciano," who allegedly is responsible for the  attacks that took place in Lima in December on the occasion of  Mao's 100th birthday.    The dissidents use violent language against those who  approve  of the peace initiative ("revisionist bitch's excrement") and  accuse them of being "servants of Yankee imperialism."    The threats are aimed against the members of the SL  leadership, including Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Martha Huatay,  Maria Pantoja, and Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, among others.    According to the manifesto, those SL leaders want to murder  Guzman, whom the dissidents continue to respect as their leader.  According to analysts consulted by this daily, this demonstrates  the desperate efforts this dissident faction is making to make  their decimated followers believe that their top leader is not  aware of the peace negotiations, when it is widely known to the  public that Guzman himself has sent several letters to the  government asking for a peace agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  puppets, at around 09:15 Tuesday, brought 90-mm recoilless guns  into the demilitarized zone [DMZ] near Komsa-ri, Chorwon County,  South Korean Kangwon Province, and installed them at their  position and took a firing posture at the North side, seriously  threatening the safety of soldiers of the Korean People's Army  who were on their routine duty at the post, according to  military sources.    On the same day, a crowd of puppet Army bandits armed with  automatic weapons, crawled into the demilitarized zone in front  of Mt. Taedok in Changpung County on the western sector of the  front and whipped up war hysterics, running about the area.    These were deliberate and premeditated acts of the South  Korean puppets to render the situation of the DMZ strained and  incite North-South confrontation.    The South Korean puppets must stop acting rashly, pondering  over the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless  military provocations.</p>

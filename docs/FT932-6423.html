			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: End of the line for phone call vexation - Worth Watching Every customer knows the frustration of calling a supplier only to be passed from person to person, repeating the inquiry or complaint, until the right person is reached. Envoy, of Richmond, Surrey, has developed software so that customer details can be transferred automatically with the telephone call. If a customer calls his or her insurance company with a policy inquiry the agent will call up details of the policy from the database on to the computer screen. If the call needs to be transferred, the operator will call the number and transfer the call and the data on the screen simultaneously. In addition to the specialist software, the company needs a single link to be installed between the main computer and the internal phone system. Envoy: UK, 081 948 6000.</p>

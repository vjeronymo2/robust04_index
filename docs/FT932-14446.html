			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Arts: Song-bird of more decibels - Concerts Song-birds in the world of opera sing out with more decibels than they used to. June Anderson, arguably the leading soprano in the bel canto repertoire at the moment, gave a recital at the Wigmore Hall on Saturday and the hall's fine acoustics showed us how big this voice really is - surely several sizes larger than singers would have been in the early 19th century. She began, predictably enough, with Bellini and Rossini, her known strength. The second Bellini song, 'La ricordanza', is a different working of the ideas from the main aria of I Puritani, in which June Anderson had such a success at Covent Garden last year. Her shining soprano, with its 100-watt brightness, is heard to its best effect in this sort of music and the phrasing was simpler, more effective, than she often makes it. The only drawback in hearing this singer in recital is that she finds it difficult to turn down the brilliance over the course of an evening. The ears start to tire of the constant gleam in the sound, as the eyes might looking into a strong light. Liszt's 'Die Lorelei' talks of the glow of the evening sunshine, Duparc's 'Au pays ou se fait la guerre' of the pale moonlight. But here the voice was always at the height of its midday radiance. From the items mentioned so far, it will be clear that this was not a conventional songbird's programme. In fact, the evening was very well planned - a Spanish group to close the first half with a flourish, French and American songs for contrasting moods after the interval. The accompanist, Charles Spencer, gave his singer the freedom that she needed. For all that, in every item it was the voice that mattered most. In Ned Rorem's 'Ferry me across the water' the last note hung suspended in the air for what seemed an eternity, a beautiful, pure stream of sound that flowed on and on without any change or degradation in quality to be detected. On Wednesday the Purcell Room continued with its Song Recital Series, a welcome enterprise which still has some way to go before it rivals the Wigmore Hall's long-established reputation for excellence in this area. The singer was the mezzo-soprano Fiona Kimm, unfortunately in the last stages of a cold, which put a dampener on the evening. Nevertheless, there was some life in it left, because Miss Kimm had put together an adventurous second half. Berio's Four Canzoni Populari opened with a mix of folk simplicity and Italianate virtuosity (accompaniments played by Andrew Ball). Anthony Payne's Adlestrop set Edward Thomas's poetry to a free vocal line underpinned by Janacek-like motifs. John Cage's 'The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs' replied with James Joyce sung to a chant-like theme, while the pianist taps out the accompaniment on the closed lid of the piano. Then Jerome Kern and Cole Porter to finish. Adventure rewarded.</p>

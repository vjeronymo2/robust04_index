			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise active on oil deal THE DEAL conjured up by Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil to acquire the North Sea assets of Occidental Petroleum for Dollars 1.35bn triggered a wholesale shake-up of the oil sector. The market's initial reaction was to mark Enterprise shares sharply higher, along with others in the sub-sector, on the view that the deal removed an overhang of Enterprise shares and revalued North Sea assets generally. There was a rethink later, with Enterprise retreating from an initial 570p to 548p before closing a net 6 off at 551p. Market analysts said the big institutions were attracted by the 8.75 per cent yield offered by the newly issued convertible bonds involved in the deal, and were switching out of Enterprise ordinary shares and into the bonds. Turnover in the ordinary reached 13m shares. The deal involves Elf and Enterprise setting up a joint venture - Elf Enterprise Petroleum, in which Elf will have two-thirds and Enterprise the rest - to acquire the Occidental assets. The bonds involved are convertible into Enterprise shares at 640p a share. Tate pleases Tate &amp; Lyle rose 9 to 374p following strong interim results and as the company reaffirmed that it would not be raising its ADollars 325m (Pounds 150m) bid for Bundaberg Sugar, of Australia. Food specialists noted that with the world sugar price close to a 3 1/2  year low, Tate was under little pressure to increase its offer. However, a note of caution was struck after it indicated that US regulatory approval for sucralose, the artificial sweetener, may not be imminent. Tate's half-year profits increased by Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 94.7m from the same period last year, which was at the upper end of brokers' forecasts. Analysts raised their full year estimates by Pounds 10m to between Pounds 233m to Pounds 236m. Next year Pounds 260m to Pounds 280m is anticipated. High yielder Longer term investors showed approval of Trafalgar House after the construction and property to shipping group maintained its interim dividend in spite of sharply lower first-half profits. The decision confirmed Trafalgar's status as one of the two highest yielding stocks in the Footsie list. The chairman anticipated no immediate recovery in Trafalgar's fortunes but remained optimistic for 1992 and beyond. Analysts concurred with the view, and also spoke of the unexpectedly good half-year performance by the construction/engineering division. On a two-year perspective they thought Tralagar shares had considerable upside potential. The stock closed 6 up at 268p on volume of 5.2m shares. SmithKline reacts SmithKline Beecham ran into profit-taking after publishing first-quarter figures largely in line with market expectations. The shares have been among the strongest in the Footsie in recent months and yesterday's results found traders flush with stock. Analysts made minor adjustments to their full year forecasts. They noted higher than expected currency losses but sales revenues were better than expected. BZW, for example, trimmed its full year prediction by Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 994.4m. SmithKline had been strong in early trading after company chairman Mr Henry Wendt said his long-term financial objective was for annual earnings to grow at a rate of at least 15 per cent. The shares were 13 ahead at mid-session before sliding to close at 809p for a net decline of 22. Turnover was a solid 2.7m shares. There was evidence that big funds had been switching from the oil majors into the Elf Enterprise Petroleum bonds to take advantage of the generous yield. BP, releasing first-quarter figures today, dropped 11 to 343p on good turnover of 7.2m shares, while Shell, reporting next week, fell a similar amount to 521p with some 5.5m changing hands. A number of analysts are cautious on BP. Mr Fergus MacLeod at County NatWest advocated taking profits in the stock, which he said had recorded 9 per cent outperformance since early April. 'The yield relative is back below 130 and speculation over the future of the Kuwait Investment Office's 9.9 per cent stake and the UK government's 2 per cent is bound to resurface,' said Mr MacLeod. County expects BP to report a first-quarter deficit of Pounds 25m after stock losses, against a profit of Pounds 344m during the same period in 1990. On a replacement cost basis, which excludes stock gains and losses, County is going for net income of Pounds 410m, compared with Pounds 361m. The Enterprise deal affected the rest of the exploration and production sector, where Lasmo raced up to 373p before sliding back to close only 2 firmer at 357p on 3m shares traded. British Gas came back into favour, helped by Smith New Court turning positive on the stock after its recent bout of underperformance. At the close Gas were 2 up at 239p, having touched 241p, with turnover reaching 7.7m. The two power generators came in for sustained support and outperformed the electricity issues, boosted by the forthcoming flotation of the Scottish generators. PowerGen, where turnover leapt to 10m, moved up 3 1/2 to 141p while National Power held at 133 1/2 p on 7.7m. Water shares were given a strong push by County NatWest, whose water sector analyst, Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, shifted his stance on the sector from hold to buy. Mr Miller-Bakewell said he expected further unbundling of the Water Package and said he favoured the 'more-focused risk-averse management strategies' of North West and Anglian. The latter performed well, adding 5 at 300p. Speculation about a convertible bond issue depressed Cadbury Schweppes, although in the event it was Enterprise Oil which tapped the market. Cadbury did not recover and closed 7 lower at 373p as talk of a convertible issue to fund a bid for Dr Pepper/7-Up, of the US, refused to go away. Unilever fell 10 to 733p after a cautious annual meeting statement. There was also apprehension ahead of the first-quarter results due on May 17. Analysts expect a small decline from the same period last year to between Pounds 345m to Pounds 350m. United Biscuits slipped 6 to 375p on talk that a brokerage house had lowered its estimate for the current year by Pounds 5m to Pounds 209m, making it one of the lowest forecasts so far. J. Sainsbury gained 3 to 387p and Tesco declined 5 to 288p as funds switched between the two stocks. Kingfisher put on 3 to 494p as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, one of the more bearish houses, raised its current year estimate by Pounds 10m to Pounds 235m. Several big leisure stocks had a good day, against the trend of the wider market, as Smith New Court released its regular review of the sector. Smith, taking a more positive view than previously, said: 'You may be a little early buying the leisure sector, but the downside is limited. Present trading conditions are fully discounted.' It identified Ladbroke, up 5 at 289p, and Queen's Moat Houses, unchanged at 95p, as good value. Trusthouse Forte, a penny firmer at 275p, was on a more demanding rating, said Smith. Reuters climbed 13 in early trading in the wake of a presentation by the company to the Society of Investment Analysts. There was some talk that SG Warburg had upgraded the stock, but the broker denied this. There were downgradings in evidence elsewhere, however. James Capel, for example, cut its full year forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 340m, saying there was continuing concern over revenues from the company's real-time information products. Reuters dropped to 774p at worst before ending at 782p for a decline of 3 on the day. Rolls-Royce met fresh selling after announcing further job losses. The latest cuts involve 3,000 jobs and will reduce the workforce to 28,000 at the end of 1991 from 34,000 at the beginning of the year. The chief executive said yesterday: 'The immediate situation is difficult and we have to reduce capacity and costs over the next two years.' Rolls-Royce has also declared a pay freeze for all employees for six months. The shares, downgraded by Goldman Sachs in New York on Tuesday, eased further to 163p. Another broking house downgrade aroused more uncertainty about dividend prospects for British Steel. Mr David Morgan of Lehman Brothers cut estimates for both this year and next, saying since the yield is the main prop to the share price he expects a further period of underperformance. The shares lost 1 1/2 to 130p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (87).

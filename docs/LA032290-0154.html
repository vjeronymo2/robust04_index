			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY ENTERS VIRGIN TERRITORY IN AIRLINE ADS  </P> <P> First there were automobile ads that didn't show cars. Now along comes an  airline with ads that show baby carriages and Christmas trees -- but few signs  of travel.  </P> <P> Virgin Atlantic Airways recently began to barrage the Los Angeles market with a  new print, billboard and television ad campaign, but don't look for any jets.  The closest thing that viewers will see in any of the ads is a paper glider  that comes flying out of a baby carriage in one TV spot.  </P> <P> The unusual campaign is an attempt by tiny Virgin Atlantic to gain attention in  one of the world's most competitive air travel markets -- Los Angeles. Starting  May 16, the airline will begin flying daily round-trip, nonstop flights from  Los Angeles to London for $499.  </P> <P> "We're a little guy in a business inhabited by mega-carriers," said David Tait,  executive vice president of Virgin. "This campaign is our 2-by-4-over-the-head  approach. Once we get the consumers' attention, we can start softening the  approach."  </P> <P> The airline -- which owns fewer than a dozen jets -- has a Southern California  advertising budget of just $2 million. So it is trying to gain attention in Los  Angeles with ads that look totally unlike those conventional airline  advertisements that feature smiling flight attendants.  </P> <P> Virgin, which flaunts the advertising slogan, "The entertainment capital of the  sky," prides itself on in-flight entertainment. This includes a wide-ranging  choice of meals and movies on all flights, not to mention 12 music channels on  its high-tech stereo headsets.  </P> <P> Virgin's mission to entertain has earned it enthusiastic support from younger  travelers who would rather see music videos on the in-flight movie screen then  yesterday's news summaries. But sometimes the airline's urge to entertain gets  a little wacky. On one Easter Day flight from New York to London several years  ago, passengers were handed crayons, scissors and cardboard so they could make  cardboard Easter eggs and bonnets.  </P> <P> Entertainment offerings like these will be highlighted in upcoming ads created  by the New York agency Korey, Kay &amp; Partners.  </P> <P> But Virgin's very first print ad in Los Angeles, which ran in several  newspapers last week, left many readers perplexed. That ad, which had no  headline, showed a metal foot-measuring device commonly used in shoe stores.  Although the ad never mentions Richard Branson -- the brash British founder of  Virgin Atlantic -- by name, it implies that he has made life so miserable for  the competition that one airline executive finally quit to become a shoe  salesman.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine that they'd get one call based on that ad," said Arlynn  Whittaker, senior vice president of marketing at Admarketing, the Los Angeles  agency that formerly created ads for AirCal and MGM Grand Air. But Virgin  claims that it is receiving up to 1,000 extra calls a day since its campaign  began in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Whittaker, however, said she is much more impressed with Virgin's upcoming ads.  So is Peter Stranger, president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina,  McNamee WCRS. "If the ads are arresting enough to suck people into the body  copy, that's all that is needed."  </P> <P> These ads will detail Virgin's veritable three-ring circus of in-flight  entertainment. First-class passengers, for example, can select from 50 movies  to personally view during the flight.  </P> <P> One new ad features a uniformed British schoolboy who has an iron ball and  chain strapped to his foot. "At age 15, his headmaster said he'd either wind up  rich or in prison," the ad states in reference to Branson, the airline's  38-year-old founder. "He founded Virgin Records. Virgin Music. Virgin Video.  And two of London's hottest dance clubs. From a man who knows a thing or two  about entertainment comes entertainment in its highest form."  </P> <P> "Our single mission is to build awareness," said Michael Glavin, vice president  of Korey Kay. "If people just look at the ads and ask, 'Who are these guys?'  that's all we want."  </P></p>

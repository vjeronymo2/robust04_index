			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE'S HOST BRINGS SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS TO THE JOB  </P> <P> Buck Johns said he figures he was selected as host for Vice President Dan  Quayle's Orange County reception tonight because Republican Party leaders think  "he'll tolerate it and he's nuts." He was only partly joking.  </P> <P> His tennis court is big enough to accommodate 500 people. "That narrows it  quite a bit," Johns said. "I imagine probably by default they picked me."  </P> <P> Johns and his wife, Colleen, have made their tennis court available for  numerous events featuring many prominent Republicans, including Gov. George  Deukmejian, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson of California and Senate Minority Leader Bob  Dole of Kansas during his bid for the nomination for President.  </P> <P> But both the Johnses said preparing for Quayle was a different matter. They  have planted their Santa Ana Heights yard with jasmine, geraniums and other  flowers, painted and wallpapered parts of their sprawling home, even  straightened their dresser drawers in preparation for the reception.  </P> <P> "We never had the vice president before so we're very pumped up about it," said  Johns, an Arkansas native who never lost the Southern twang. Said Colleen  Johns: "There's something so different about this. It's a real honor to be  hosting him in Orange County, much less in your own home."  </P> <P> The boyish-looking Johns, 47, is a well-known figure in Orange County political  circles. He is a longtime member of the Lincoln Club, the county's best-known  and most prestigious Republican support group, where he and businessmen John  Cronin and Doy Henley represent the more conservative wing of the party.  </P> <P> Frustrated by the lack of an organized statewide effort to gain Republican  seats in the Assembly, Cronin, Henley and Johns last year came up with Project  '90. The effort was aimed at raising money for Assembly races in an attempt to  get a GOP majority there before the redistricting that will follow the 1990  census. Among the fund-raising events was an auction, which was held on Johns'  tennis court.  </P> <P> But the project largely failed last fall when Democrats made gains in the  Assembly, virtually securing their majority in 1990.  </P> <P> Johns is owner of the Inland Group, a firm that acquires land and obtains  rights to build on property in Riverside and San Bernardino counties that is  then developed by others.  </P> <P> The four Johns children, ranging in age from 7 to 14, are joining in the  activities for tonight's reception. They have even cleaned up their rooms, just  in case Quayle should stop in to see them.  </P> <P> "They're in the thick of it," Johns said.  </P></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Central Vietnam wants to join high-flyers: Provincial officials are tired of being passed over by investors From the moment the communist government began liberalising the economy in 1987, the inhabitants of central Vietnam complained that almost the only signs they saw of foreign investors and tourists were the glinting wings of aircraft 30,000 feet up shuttling between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Of the Dollars 8bn in foreign investment projects approved throughout the country, only 25, valued at Dollars 163m (Pounds 104m), are located in Quangnam-Danang, the most important of the central provinces sandwiched between the South China Sea and the mountains on the Lao border. And of that Dollars 163m, only a quarter has actually been spent so far, according to local officials. Investments include a gold mine, a granite processing factory, seafood and furniture export businesses, and a German-Italian-Vietnamese venture making freight containers. 'We have a lot of investment in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi and not enough here,' says Mr Doan Ngoc Dau, a member of the communist provincial people's committee in Danang. After years of neglect, the national government is attempting to revitalise the stagnant economy of central Vietnam. Foreign investors facing stiff competition elsewhere are also looking at the region's opportunities for industry and tourism with renewed interest. Among the main obstacles to economic growth were the conservatism and corruption of the communist cadres and army officers who control the region, scene of the fiercest battles in the Vietnam war. In May, however, the Hanoi government cleared out some of the dead wood. According to Mr Dau, the chairman of the provincial people's committee was retired, the regional Communist party chief was replaced with someone more dynamic, and the chairman of Danang city people's committee and one of his deputies were fired for making 'mistakes in land distribution'. The reshuffle was welcomed by the emerging private sector in Danang where most businesses in the area are still controlled by the armed forces or the Communist party and where official discrimination against those whose relatives fought on the American side was only recently ended. 'Leaders here have been frightened of making decisions, because they are afraid they will be responsible for any problems,' says Ms Truong Thi Kim Anh, of the Danang branch of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 'But now the bureaucratic system is improving a lot.' Although state companies remain dominant - only 20 of the chamber's 200 member companies in the central region are from the private sector - entrepreneurs have gradually begun moving into import-export businesses, retailing and tourism services, including small hotels. Many such individuals are former government employees, including one of Ms Anh's colleagues, who recently decided to set up his own business exporting furniture. For potential foreign investors, tourism has been the main focus in central Vietnam. The area around Hue, the former imperial capital, has many tourist attractions, not least the Vietnam war battlefields now frequently visited by Americans. Danang is close to the picturesque old town of Hoi An and to many beaches, including the one known to Americans as China Beach. The annual number of foreign visitors to Danang trebled to 33,000 between 1991 and 1993, and some 28,000 have already arrived in the first half of this year, many on cruise ships. A Hong Kong company has begun work on a Dollars 24m beach hotel due to be completed at the end of next year, and an American consortium has plans to build a Dollars 250m resort with several hotels and a golf course; both projects are joint ventures with the local authorities. On the industrial front, a Malaysian-Vietnamese venture has started to build a Dollars 24m export processing zone near Danang. Quangnam-Danang province alone wants to attract Dollars 1bn in foreign investments by the end of the decade. Boasting of its mineral, agricultural and marine resources, the province has drawn up a list of more than 70 possible projects. Foreign investors, some frustrated by bureaucracy and corruption in the past, are likely to remain cautious, but there are signs of more activity. Shipping companies are opening offices in Danang and the number of cargo vessels calling at Danang port has risen to about six a week, says Ms Anh. An attempt to make Danang an international air gateway with flights to Taiwan failed but at least some of the domestic flights packed with tourists and investors are landing at Danang these days.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE;  </P> <P> REPAVING DELAYED TO LESSEN TRAFFIC FOR GRADUATION  </P> <P> A road contractor has agreed to suspend a Lassen Street repaving project to  avoid snarling traffic headed for this Friday's commencement exercises at Cal  State Northridge's North Campus Stadium.  </P> <P> CSUN commencement planner Heidi Levy said contractors agreed Monday to delay  the repaving of the north side of Lassen Street from Reseda Boulevard to  Lindley Avenue in order to avoid traffic delays for the 10 a.m. ceremony.  </P> <P> Lassen Street is a key access road to parking for the stadium.  </P> <P> "We had talked to the city last week, but they said it wasn't their policy to  ask contractors to postpone their work," Levy said. "When we talked to the  contractors, they understood our problems and agreed to postpone further  repairs until after May 25."  </P> <P> "It is an enormous relief and we are very grateful for their understanding,"  Levy said, referring to the Sully Miller Contracting Co.  </P> <P> Street repaving began about two weeks ago and is scheduled to be completed by  June or July.  </P> <P> She said she expects 5,000 students and 15,000 guests to attend this year's  graduation ceremonies.  </P> <P> Last year's ceremonies were held at the Hollywood Bowl and a number of CSUN  graduates and their families and CSUN President James W. Cleary arrived late  because of heavy traffic on the Hollywood and Ventura freeways.  </P> <P> A campus Commencement Committee recommended that university administrators hold  this year's ceremony on campus in the hopes of avoiding the traffic delays  experienced last year.  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Accord on BCCI attacked by senator in US THE proposed Dollars 1.7bn settlement for creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) came under fire in the US senate yesterday as Senator John Kerry, who has been investigating BCCI, described the proposal as 'unfair'. He made his remarks to Mr Brian Smouha, the BCCI liquidator, who gave his first Congressional testimony on the BCCI affair. The senator, at a foreign affairs sub-committee hearing, called into question the settlement - by which the government of Abu Dhabi would pay BCCI creditors between 30 and 40 cents in the dollar - because creditors would be forced to waive their rights to bring any legal action against Abu Dhabi. The government there is the BCCI majority shareholder. Mr Kerry also criticised Abu Dhabi for its failure thus far to supply US authorities with key BCCI documents and with former executives of the bank being held under house arrest. The senator said the BCCI creditors 'deserve to know that, if there are deep pockets that fleece them, they have the right to take action.' He added: 'You have to understand who is responsible for the BCCI affair before you strike some deal that wipes this all away. I would call this an unfair trade practice.' Mr Ahmed al Sayegh, a director of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and a member of the government's BCCI working group, said Abu Dhabi had no involvement in the frauds perpetrated by BCCI. He added that Abu Dhabi is in talks with the US Justice Department over the possibility of making available BCCI documents and witnesses now in Abu Dhabi. Mr al Sayegh also criticised former BCCI auditors Price Waterhouse as 'negligent', and said the accounting firm 'should accept responsibility for their failure to uncover the true position year after year.' Mr Smouha responded to Mr Kerry's criticism by saying that what he had sought was to 'negotiate a commercial solution.' The settlement, which will be reviewed at a UK high court hearing in June, will need to be approved by BCCI creditors and courts in the UK, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. A former top prosecutor claimed in earlier testimony to the sub-committee he had been impeded last year by the Justice Department in his efforts to obtain documents and bring indictments against BCCI. Mr Dexter Lehtinen, US attorney in Miami until four months ago, complained that, despite numerous written requests to Washington, the department declined to give him permission to enforce subpoenas demanding crucial BCCI documents about the bank's Luxembourg and other non-US operations.

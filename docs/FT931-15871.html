			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Round two for new owner of Daily News: The sale which may prompt a New York daily newspaper circulation war THE TAKEOVER on Thursday of the Daily News, the New York tabloid that was previously owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, has made the new proprietor  -Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the real estate investor and magazine publisher - the latest saviour to step forward in an effort to revive the fortunes of the 73-year-old daily. As a result the New York daily newspaper world, a frenetic place at the best of times, is girding itself for what could soon prove to be the hottest editorial, circulation and advertising battle in years. The twin challenges for the Canadian-born, 55-year-old Mr Zuckerman are to remake the Daily News and, while doing so, to beat back the expected competitive drive from the New York Post and Newsday, the other two tabloids in the market. Although some have questioned whether New York can support three tabloids in addition to the authoritative New York Times, no one doubts Mr Zuckerman's determination or drive. He has already overcome a set of staggering obstacles to win control of the Daily News - spending long hours in negotiations with the paper's feisty trade unions; pushing out of the picture Mr Conrad Black, the owner of Britain's Daily Telegraph, who also sought the News; trudging through bankruptcy court and other legal venues to eliminate lifetime job guarantees for typographers; and facing down the Newspaper Guild, the union which represents editorial staff and which became so isolated that it was unable to stop him from sacking 170 of its 540 employees at the paper. Mr Martin Maleska, the managing director of Veronis Suhler, an investment bank specialising in media deals, was a top adviser to Mr Black during his quest for the Daily News last year. Yesterday he spoke in glowing terms of the way Mr Zuckerman had handled the deal and predicted a return to profitability in 1993: 'I think Mr Zuckerman did what he said he was going to do, which was to buy the newspaper and reduce costs in those areas in which he needed to. I think he has done a very good job.' The Daily News, which was torn by a violent six-month strike that ended when Mr Maxwell bought it from the Tribune Group of Chicago in March 1991, went into bankruptcy following Mr Maxwell's death in November of that year. Last year it lost about Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) on revenues of more than Dollars 230m. Mr Zuckerman has not minced words in describing the last two owners of the paper. The Tribune 'milked' the paper, and Mr Maxwell 'raped' it. He, in turn, plans to make substantial investments, including a new printing plant, and to reshape the editorial staff in order to strengthen political, business and investigative coverage. While he began life as a real estate investor, and remains one of the more conservative and highly regarded property owners in the US, Mr Zuckerman has also had more than a decade to develop his management skills in the media world. In 1980 he bought The Atlantic, a prestigious monthly literary and political magazine, and in 1984 US News &amp; World Report, the weekly magazine that has been revitalised and last year overtook both Time and Newsweek in advertising pages. The New York newspaper world, however, presents unique challenges. Since 1985 the Long Island-based Newsday, a part of the Times Mirror group, has robbed both the News and the Post of readers and advertising. Newsday, while unprofitable in its New York City edition, has a total circulation of 760,000, which compares to 430,000 for the Post and about 800,000 for the Daily News. The New York Times, with daily circulation of 1.1m, has the high ground, and Mr Arthur Sulzberger Jr, the publisher, said this week he wanted the Daily News to exist. Mr Sulzberger's logic is believed to be that a healthy Daily News keeps Newsday and the Post at bay in the lower and middle-market. The coming battle will test Mr Zuckerman in many ways. His competitors say they are ready. As Mr Peter Kalikow, the owner of the Post, who will soon dilute his holding to less than 50 per cent in order to raise fresh capital, put it: 'We always battle. This is business. This is what life is all about.'</p>

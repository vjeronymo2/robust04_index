			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo May 31 SAPA -- South Africa is planning to  join the Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] at a time when the  organisation's role is unclear. But SA [South African] Foreign  Minister Alfred Nzo says membership is part of South Africa's  strategy to end its international isolation.    Speaking in Cairo on the eve of a four-day NAM conference,  Mr  Nzo said international networking was critical for the success  of his government's internal development policy: "The contact  we have trade-wise and economic-wise with various countries of  the world is bound to assist our process (of restructuring)."    According to Mr Nzo, South Africa is expecting to be  accepted  as an NAM member on Tuesday. He said that joining the  108-member organisation was also a "natural development", since  the movement had supported the anti-apartheid struggle and had  given SA "liberation movements" observer status.    Mr Nzo is attending the summit in Cairo at a critical moment  in the movement's history. The NAM was created in the 1960's to  help developing nations assert their independence from the  United states and Soviet superpowers. Now that the Cold War is  over it is trying to recast itself as a pressure group fighting  for third world interests.    The future of the movement is one of the items members are  scheduled to discuss this week. They are expected to advocate  focussing on "more of an economic role".    South Africa has also just been accepted into the  Organisation of African Unity and Mr Nzo said it hoped to join  the United Nations in the coming months.    The end of isolation means South Africa will be expected to  get involved in efforts to contain regional conflicts, like that  in Rwanda. Mr Nzo said that for now however his government  would stick to humanitarian aid while it got its own military  house in order. "We are engaged in the process of rebuilding a  new army in our country...and we can't therefore be expected  before that process is completed, to let our soldiers march (in  peacekeeping operations)."    The Cold War superpowers, particularly the US, have  traditionally barred NAM countries from developing nuclear  weapons. Mr Nzo said South Africa would not use its nuclear  capacity to equalise the imbalance in the nuclear equation but  would "certainly participate in the peaceful uses of nuclear  energy".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Guizhou Province, the  country's fifth-largest coal producer, will put extra efforts  into developing its coalfields, in an attempt to spur its  economic development.    The province produced 45 million tons of coal last year, one  third of the output was sold to other southern provinces.    During a recent tour of Guizhou, Minister of the Coal  Industry Wang Shenhao said coal is important for southern China,  which is witnessing a booming economy but suffers from an acute  shortage of raw materials and energy.    According to the official sources, China produced 1.14  billion tons of coal last year. The majority were produced in  northern China. The southern provinces, which turned out only  300 million tons of coal last year, have to transport coal from  the north or to import it, which worsens the transportation  shortage.    Guizhou plans to build a coking plant with a capacity of  400,000 tons, a plant with a capacity 80,000 tons of methyl  alcohol and a power station with an installed capacity of  800,000 kw to one million kw. In addition, a coal mine with a  capacity of producing four million tons of coal a year will be  developed.    Meanwhile, four railway lines extending from Guiyang, the  capital, to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Hunan provinces have  been electrified or renovated, and a railroad for transporting  coal from Guizhou to Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region, is under construction.</p>

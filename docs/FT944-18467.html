			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Shirtless and in shanties, Brazil votes in fair order Yesterday was just another day in Brazil, with a power cut in the capital Braslia, shoot-outs in Rio de Janeiro and fraud allegations in the country's impoverished north-east. It was also the day when Brazil held its biggest set of elections in 40 years and, despite these and other problems, electoral authorities agreed voting was fair and more orderly than expected. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso - the former finance minister who, exit polls suggested, will be Brazil's next president - said the elections had been more 'ethical' and the campaign less radical than previous ones. After voting in Sao Paulo, he managed to throw off a pack of journalists and was thought to be resting outside the city. Besides choosing a new president, Brazil's 95m voters were electing state governors, two thirds of the federal Senate, all the House of Representatives, and all state legislators. Despite the excitement, voting was reported to be orderly throughout the country, helped by new rules which banned late campaigning at polling centres. One less effective rule was meant to ban people from voting shirtless or in swimwear. This prompted complaints from people going to vote from the beach. In the north-eastern state of Alagoas, voting was delayed in four districts following allegations of electoral fraud. In the southern city of Curitiba, one man seemed to be taking politics too seriously when he shot another voter in the queue. Mr Cardoso said Brazil's priority was 'an end to social injustice'. Other presidential hopefuls have pledged to bridge the country's huge divide between rich and poor. But none of the 12,000 candidates running for various offices visited the shantytown near Vila Clara on the outskirts of Sao Paulo. It was built in the last five years alongside one of the city's busiest highways. Its wooden huts are home to more than 50 families who have no running water or sewers. Marinalva, a mother of two, said politicians had never helped the community. Instead, many families fear that local politicians have been waiting until after the elections before clearing the area. Cars returning to Sao Paulo from Vila Clara have to travel some distance before they suddenly encounter a snow-storm of election paper, which continues until the main Avenue Paulista, as though voters only matter in the city centre.</p>

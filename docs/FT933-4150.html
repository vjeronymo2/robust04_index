			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Healthcare revolution is nigh: Will Clinton's plan mean cheap care or a free lunch? THE trickle of leaks about the likely content of President Bill Clinton's healthcare plan has turned into a torrent as the White House begins to prepare for the most ambitious social reform since President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programmes of the 1960s. Although some of the details of the plan may change before it is formally unveiled later this month, the broad thrust of Mr Clinton's strategy is clear. His political gamble is that the public will accept some new controls on healthcare spending and some restriction on choice of physicians, in return for an unequivocal guarantee that everyone, at all times, will enjoy access to a standard package of healthcare benefits, regardless of age, income or employment status. The pledge of universal access to care would belatedly bring the US into line with social policy throughout the developed world (at present South Africa is the only other industrialised country which does not guarantee care for all). It is important not just for the estimated 37m Americans (15 per cent of the population) without insurance cover, but for tens of millions of families who fear losing insurance cover should a breadwinner become unemployed or contract a serious illness. To make good on this pledge Mr Clinton will propose controversial changes in the way healthcare is financed and delivered. He will recommend that employers be legally required to provide health insurance for employees and meet at least 80 per cent of the cost of a policy providing the standard package of benefits. To allay Republican fears that such a 'mandate' on employers will kill jobs by bankrupting small companies, the White House will propose public subsidies to ensure that the burden on small companies (those with fewer than 50 employees and average annual wages of under Dollars 24,000) is no more than 3.5 per cent of total payroll costs. This would compare with expected payments of 7-8 per cent of payroll for larger companies. As part of a long-term strategy to reduce costs, Mr Clinton will propose that the US adopts a form of 'managed competition'. He wants most individuals and businesses to enroll in large healthcare purchasing co-operatives to be known as regional health alliances. (Companies with more than 5,000 employees will be able to form their own 'corporate alliances'.) The idea is that the health alliances will collect contributions from employers, employees and federal government and then act as a bulk purchaser of care from competing groups of hospitals and doctors in the private sector. Individuals (and companies) will be able to choose from a list of 'health plans' certified by the alliances as meeting the minimal federal requirements. The range of options in every area should include managed care, such as that provided by Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs), which sell pre-paid plans, as well as more traditional fee-for-service medicine. But there would be strong financial incentives to shift people into HMOs, which levy a flat annual fee and thus have a strong incentive to control costs. Under present plans those opting for fee-for-service schemes would have to pay 20 per cent of the cost of each treatment, whereas those accepting restricted access to doctors under HMOs would pay only a flat Dollars 10 per visit. This would probably cause a rapid shrinkage of fee-for-service medicine. Mr Clinton has ruled out any direct controls on the price of medical services, including drugs. But the White House intends to place tight caps on the growth of federal programmes such as Medicare, the scheme for the elderly. Other more controversial cost-cutting proposals will include limits on the rate of increase in private healthcare premiums (the first time the federal government has interfered with spending in the private sector) and legislation to make corporate healthcare spending in excess of the standard benefits package taxable income for employees (at present there are no limits on tax deductibility). After the narrow passage of his deficit-cutting budget, Mr Clinton will not be careful to avoid antagonising Republicans. Claiming reforms can be financed mainly by limiting the growth of spending on existing federal healthcare programmes, the White House envisions only a modest increase in 'sin' taxes on cigarettes; it has ruled out a general increase in income or consumption taxes. Several measures, such as subsidies for small business and the pledge that fee-for-service medicine will remain an option for everyone (albeit an expensive one) seem tailored to defuse conservative opposition. Long phase-in periods for crucial elements of the plan will also increase its chance of success. States, for example, will be able to delay introducing the main reforms until December 1997, well after the next election. For the most controversial proposals, such as limits on tax deductibility, the phase-in period could be as long as 10 years. Mr Clinton's pledge to guarantee security of access to care for all Americans is likely to have a strong political appeal. But many specific proposals, such as the mandate on employers to provide insurance for employees, will be hotly opposed. Congress is certain to insist on many modifications to the plan and will probably defer a final vote until next spring. When the initial enthusiasm for reform dies away, people may wonder whether it is really possible to extend insurance cover to 37m people and improve nearly everybody's benefits (for example by including more generous cover for mental health problems and long-term nursing care) without raising taxes significantly. To veterans of previous bids to control healthcare costs, it sounds suspiciously like a free lunch.</p>

Name of Standard. M (also known as MUMPS [MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL UTILITY MULTI-PROGRAMMING SYSTEM]) (FIPS PUB 125&hyph;2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Programming Language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Explanation. This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard for M, ANSI/MDC X11.1&hyph;199X, as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The American National Standard for M, ANSI/MDC X11.1&hyph;199X, specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the M programming language. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of M programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters, or other forms of high level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules adopted by ANSI. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 125&hyph;1 and supersedes that document in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Approving Authority.

Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources. The primary objectives of Federal programming language standards are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _To encourage more effective utlilization and management of programmers by ensuring that programming skills acquired on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer retraining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in the use of high level programming languages; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs among different computer systems, including replacement systems; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by ensuring to the maximal feasible extent that Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with the installed base. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive and precise standard language specifications. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

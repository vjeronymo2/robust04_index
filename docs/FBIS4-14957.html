			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Former Soviet Union" rubric: </F> "Shevardnadze Complains about United Nations and South Ossetia"]    [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has criticized the way UN  observers are performing their mission in Abkhazia in connection  with events there. The observers' presence there, he remarked,  is futile because, when the new stage of confrontation began,  they not only failed to raise their voice over the escalation of  the conflict but did not even issue a statement in response to  it. According to Shevardnadze, no peace will be achieved in  Abkhazia unless there is real Russian support in securing a  peaceful settlement of the conflict.    This most acute headache suffered by the Georgian president  has been augmented by yet another: Elections to the  representative organ of South Ossetia -- the State Assembly --  have been held. According to provisional figures, there was a  70-percent turnout; 21 of the 36 seats have been taken, 17 of  them by Communist Party deputies. Fifteen candidates, including  current State Assembly Chairman Lyudvig Chibirov, will take part  in repeat elections on 10 April, as they failed to win the  requisite number of votes.    Official Tbilisi has reacted to the holding of these  elections in a sharly negative way, regarding them as unlawful.  The South Ossetian autonomous formation was abolished by the  Georgian Supreme Council back in December 1990, in the wake of  which ethnic conflict broke out in the region.    Commenting on the elections, Vazha Khachapuridze, chief  state  counsellor-coordinator for the leader of Georgia on questions of  defense and national security, stated that they are an unlawful  attempt to detach Shida Kartli -- as the Georgian side calls  this region -- from the Republic of Georgia.</p>

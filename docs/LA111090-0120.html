			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLDBERG WON'T SEEK REELECTION TO SCHOOL BOARD  </P> <P> Jackie Goldberg, the outspoken, liberal activist who has presided over the Los  Angeles Board of Education during a pivotal period, will not seek a third term  on the board this spring, deciding instead to resume her career as a high  school teacher.  </P> <P> Goldberg, 45, will announce her decision at a news conference Monday. She also  is expected to endorse her longtime friend and former staff member, teacher  Jeff Horton, to succeed her in the 3rd District, which includes Hollywood,  downtown Los Angeles and the mid-Wilshire area.  </P> <P> Although her announcement will come just days after the board was forced to  table its bid for a pay raise, Goldberg said she had decided not to run before  the board voted to seek the state's permission to increase its $24,000 annual  compensation. She had told a few people of her decision several weeks ago but  said she wanted to wait until after last week's elections to make it public.  </P> <P> Recently, Goldberg said she has been increasingly frustrated with many aspects  of the school board job -- the slow pace of progress, the loss of privacy that  comes with public office, the "overwhelming negativity" of public attitudes  toward the schools, the seven-day workweeks and the need to spend time and  energy on tangential -- though important -- issues.  </P> <P> "So much of it is about housing and buses and so little of it is about reading  and math and learning,"' Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, she said much has been achieved during her 7 1/2 years on the  board. She cited the development of an AIDS education program; the founding of  Project 10, a support group for gay students; establishment of health clinics  at some schools; formulation of a plan for teaching students not yet fluent in  English, and the raising of teachers' salaries.  </P> <P> Elected in 1983 with the backing of a coalition of teachers and community  activists, Goldberg headed the board for nearly 18 months during a watershed  period in the embattled school district.  </P> <P> In the midst of a record budget squeeze and explosive growth in the nation's  second-largest school district, the seven-member board changed superintendents  and adopted a highly controversial plan to relieve overcrowding by operating  all of its more than 600 schools year-round. It embarked on a potentially  far-reaching program of cutting its central bureaucracy and shifting more money  and authority to the schools, where decisions are to be shared among  principals, teachers, parents and other community members.  </P> <P> Before running for her school board seat, Goldberg taught high school history  in Compton and worked with the Integration Project, an organization pushing to  desegregate Los Angeles schools during the 1970s.  </P> <P> When first on the board, many of her proposals -- and sometimes-strident  methods of pushing them -- angered other board members. Some called her  "devious" and "manipulative." But most of her current colleagues -- who have  elected her president two years in a row -- say she has helped provide badly  needed leadership and cohesiveness.  </P> <P> While acknowledging that she may run for another office some day, Goldberg said  her primary reason for leaving the board is to get back to teaching --  something she has often said she would do. Her first choice is one of the  district's inner-city high schools.  </P> <P> Horton, 43, has taught high school in the district for about 15 years. After a  one-year leave of absence last year to work as Goldberg's district  representative, he began working in the district's special high school program  for young mothers. If elected, he would be required to resign from his district  teaching job and from the United Teachers-Los Angeles union, in which he is  active.  </P> <P> He said increasing parent and community involvement in the schools as a way to  improve student achievement would be a top priority for him.  </P> <P> "Because we have such a racially and ethnically diverse population and because  the teaching force is still mostly white and middle class, lots more attention  has to be paid to group relations," Horton said. "We need a multicultural  approach to everything, and we can break some of the barriers (to success in  school) only by doing a better job of involving all our parents and others in  the community."  </P></p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Blackstone drops offer for Canadian food distributor BLACKSTONE GROUP, the New York investment bankers, has dropped its CDollars 1.03bn (USDollars 828m) offer for all the shares of Univa, Canada's second biggest food distributor. The bid, set at CDollars 11 per Univa share, was structured so that a new company 80 per cent owned by Blackstone and 20 per cent by Montreal entrepreneur Mr Bertin Nadeau would have merged with Univa. Mr Nadeau, who owns 26 per cent of Univa and is its largest single shareholder, would then have had a 20 per cent stake, with the option of buying back control within seven years. The Caisse de Depot, the CDollars 41bn Quebec public pension fund which owns 17 per cent of Univa, objected saying the merger would have doubled Univa's debt to CDollars 1.25bn, endangering its future survival. All shareholders were not being treated in the same way and CDollars 11 a share was too low, it said.</p>

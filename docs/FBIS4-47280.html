Karpov,  Moscow; UDC 541.64:539.3:533.5]    [Abstract] Crazed substrates were produced by using  nonoriented polyethylene terephthalate [PETP] (meeting  specification TU 6-19-138-79) and polypropylene (meeting state  standard GOST 26996-86 and specification TU 01020) films with  thicknesses of about 100 m. The semifinished products were  stretched until a specified deformation was achieved and then  dried while held with clamps or left free. Alkyl siloxane-type  organosilicon compounds were then used as a filler for producing  quasi-liquid membranes. The filler was incorporated into the  substrate by replacing the crazing medium. This was done by  stretching amorphous PETP in n-propranol, releasing it from the  clamps, and transferring it into polymethylsiloxane [PMS] or  polyethylsiloxane [PES] fluid. After several minutes it  completely replaced the propranol in the crazes' micropores. Not  all the PMS fluids used proved to be suitable fillers. The  highly volatile ones (e.g., PMS-10) lost up to 50 percent of  their mass in the first 4 days of storage. As a result, PMS with  only very slight volatility (e.g., PMS-20 and PMS-100) were used  along with PES-5 and fractioned oligodimethylsiloxanes. Samples  of quasi-liquid membranes retained their dimensions after months  of storage. The permeability of the quasi-liquid membranes with  PMS or PES fillers was thousands of times greater than that of  films of amorphous PETP with a selectivity of  _a_[.sub]02/N2[/] = 2.2 to 2.4. Furthermore, the parameters  characterizing the newly synthesized quasi-liquid membranes were  on a par with those of Silar-type block copolymers, and their  mechanical properties even surpassed those of block copolymers.  As anticipated, the quasi-liquid membranes with the more viscous  filler (PMS-100) had lower permeabilities because of the  decrease in the coefficient of diffusion of gas in a liquid as  that liquid's viscosity increases. A mechanism of active gas  transfer was used to increase the quasi-liquid membranes'  selectivity. Through directed alteration of the crazing  mechanism, the researchers were able to obtain microporous  materials with improved permeability. Decreasing the thickness  of the working layer of quasi-liquid membrane and using polymers  with a high permeability were said to be the simplest ways of  further increasing the performance characteristics of crazed  quasi-liquid membranes.

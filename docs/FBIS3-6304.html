However, new party Sakigake, another member of the  seven-party coalition, criticized the move as a betrayal of an  agreement it reached with the JNP eight months earlier to form a  new party.    Hosokawa, who is JNP head, swiftly responded to Sakigake's  criticism and said he has never talked about such an alliance  plan with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is  regarded as the chief coalition strategist. "I have never  discussed (with Ozawa) a plan to form a large parliamentary  group," he said.    On Tuesday, coalition sources said the JNP and Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party) have agreed to form a single parliamentary  group in the House of Representatives in late April.    Kozo Watanabe, Shinseito's deputy secretary general, sought  to salvage the alliance plan, telling reporters, "We intend to  aim at forming such a group, although it may not be called an  agreement."    "It is desirable for coalition parties to form a unified new  party, so we want to strike a merger deal primarily with the  Japan New Party and Sakigake," he said.    Ozawa's close associate Keisuke Nakanishi, who was former  Defense Agency director general, agreed with the secretary  general of another coalition party, the Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP), to initiate talks among rank-and-file legislators  from the two parties with an eye to forming a large  parliamentary group inside the lower chamber, the officials said.    Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at  a  disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame  internal rivalry and agreed to file a joint candidate in each of  the 300 newly created single-seat constituencies in the lower  chamber.</p>

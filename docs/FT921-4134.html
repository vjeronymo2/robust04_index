			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MEPs warned on farm reform amendments EURO MPs' amendments to the proposed reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy risk undermining the aims of the plan, Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, warned last night. The European Parliament will vote on the amendments today and is expected to come down broadly in favour of the European Commission's proposals. But Mr MacSharry warned MEPs during yesterday's debate that Brussels 'could not accept amendments whose effect would be to profoundly change our approach, or to add significantly to the budgetary costs'. Mr MacSharry singled out the cereals sector, which is at the core of the commission's proposals. The parliament's agriculture committee wants to maintain higher prices than those proposed by Brussels and to spread price reductions over a longer period. Mr MacSharry said he had 'the gravest doubts whether the objective of attaining a stabilised world price level could be achieved at more than Ecu100 (Pounds 71 a tonne)', which would be one effect of the MEPs' amendments. 'This price is essential to keep community cereals competitive, and with the substantial compensation being made available to producers, there are no solid grounds for fixing a price that would stop short of our objective or for delaying the timetable for reaching that price,' he added. EC agriculture ministers met last week to discuss the reform package, but the meeting broke up inconclusively after a number of member states unearthed old objections to the principles of the reform.</p>

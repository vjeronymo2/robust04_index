			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Ceiling on fees recommended to curb garrulous barristers DEFENDANTS and their lawyers may face heavy fines unless they disclose more of their strategies in advance to judges, a consultation paper on ways to shorten criminal trials suggests. The paper, published yesterday, is by a working party set up by the Lord Chancellor to consider reforms after cases such as the year-long Blue Arrow trial. Other ideas canvassed are to increase the powers of judges, introduce time limits for trials and to pay lawyers fixed fees to discourage over-wordy barristers. A controversial measure suggested that judges should be given more powers to order greater defence disclosure. 'Inadequate defence disclosure is seen by many practitioners as a basic problem adding to the length of trials,' the report says. One option, it suggests, would be to order defendants to reveal a statement of their cases in as much detail as the prosecution with a line-by-line rebuttal of the case against them. Sanctions for failing to make such disclosures might include financial penalties on defendants and their lawyers and prevention of some cross-examination of witnesses. Other factors identified by the working group as responsible for over-long trials include: the failure to identify key issues; inadequate procedural rules; over-long indictments; verbose barristers; and the lack of a judge's powers to control proceedings. The report does not cover those issues relating to fraud trials being considered by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, such as replacing juries with tribunals, creating a general offence of fraud and introducing a formal plea-bargaining system. Some defence lawyers yesterday expressed concern that the report's suggestions, if implemented, might strengthen the hand of prosecutors at the expense of defendants. 'This is the thin end of the wedge again,' said one QC, comparing the suggestion for greater defence disclosure to the ending of the right to silence for people interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office. Another suggested that the failure of prosecutors to bring sharply focused cases remained the main cause of over-long trials. The report acknowledges the importance of prosecutors in ensuring trials remain manageable, saying they bear the primary responsibility for deciding the eventual shape and length of a case. It criticises the Serious Fraud Office and Crown Prosecution Service for past failures in not properly monitoring the effectiveness of barristers they employed, although it notes that more attention is now being paid to this. The report, questioning whether trial judges have enough powers to manage proceedings effectively, suggests that they should be allowed to set time limits for the whole or parts of trials. It acknowledges that that would be a 'radical departure from present practice' and admits strong arguments exist against such a move. Drawing on suggestions by Mr Justice Henry, the judge in charge of the first two Guinness trials, it suggests the power of judges to exclude evidence could be increased, as it is in the American federal legal system.

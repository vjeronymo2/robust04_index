			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Class I/II_$51.8 million <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Class III_$35.9 million <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Class IV_$22.6 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In that OSHA's training requirements parallel the requirements mandated in EPA's MAP regulation, OSHA attributes to the EPA regulation, training costs in this final revision to the OSHA asbestos construction standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To estimate compliance costs of the new notification requirements in revised Paragraph (k), OSHA identified seven unique types of notifications. OSHA assumed that notification among affected parties could involve memos, phone calls, notices or other lower-cost means of communication, ranging in labor time from three to five minutes per project. The types of notifications are given below, along with OSHA's estimated total annual compliance cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification by contractor to building owner prior to start of project_high-risk ACM_$305 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification by contractor to building owner prior to start of project_low-risk ACM_$5.0 million <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification by contractors to employees_$394 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification by contractor to building owner regarding asbestos remaining in building_$397 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification by building owner to building occupants_high-risk ACM_$612 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification by building owner to building occupants_low-risk ACM_$22.3 million <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notification by building owner to all contractors in building_$6.1 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to requirements for notification, Paragraph (k)(2)(iii) requires owners to maintain records of all information indicating the presence, location and quantity of ACM and PACM in the building. OSHA estimated recordkeeping costs of $9.7 million to comply with revised (k). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (l) Housekeeping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (l) is expanded in this final revision to the asbestos construction standard to include a section on care of asbestos-containing flooring material. Included in the new section are a prohibition on sanding of asbestos-containing material; work practices specifying wet methods for floor stripping and adequate floor finish for burnishing and dry buffing; and a requirement that dusting and dry sweeping be performed with HEPA vacuums. OSHA anticipates incremental compliance costs associated with using wet methods and HEPA vacuums during housekeeping duties. Costs for the use of wet methods during custodial work is included in the total costs for wet methods given under (g), above, and are expected to be $55.2 million. Costs for the use of HEPA vacuums during custodial work is included in the total costs for HEPA vacuums given under (g), above, and are expected to be $32.5 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (m) Medical surveillance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Revised Paragraph (m) provides that medical exams be given for all employees whose exposures exceed the PEL or excursion limit for 30 or more days per year, or who are required by the standard to wear negative pressure respirators. For this final RIA, OSHA recognized the extent to which medical exams are currently provided to employees. Therefore, incremental costs were estimated only for employees in those construction activities which previously did not qualify for medical exams but which now appear to meet the qualifications. Activities qualifying for medical exams under the revised standard include the following (along with estimated annual compliance costs): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A/C pipe installation_$59 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A/C sheet installation_$61 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Floor removal_$828 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Floor repair_$6.5 million <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Large-scale gasket removal in general industry_$702 thousand <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pipe repair in general industry_$1.9 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimated compliance costs for Paragraph (m) include costs for medical exams and for recordkeeping. In all, $10.1 million in annual costs for medical surveillance are expected for affected construction activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (n) Recordkeeping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Revised Paragraph (n) requires that employers establish and maintain records of objective data (in compliance with (f)), exposure measurements, medical surveillance, and training. Revised Paragraph (n) also provides for availability and transfer of records. Incremental recordkeeping costs for each of these areas were presented above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (o) Competent person. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (o) is a new section of the construction standard and provides for competent person training and supervision for Class I, II, and III activities. Consistent with the distinctions among activity classes in (o), OSHA identified two levels of competent person training: Class I/II and Class III. OSHA estimates that costs for annual Class I/II competent person supervision will be $13.5 million; OSHA estimates annual costs of $6.0 million for Class III competent person supervision. OSHA's estimates of competent person training costs are based on an analysis by EPA's contractor Abt Associates [Abt, 1993], of the costs and benefits of the EPA Model Accreditation Plan regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to competent person supervision, the revised standard requires that the person evaluating compliance methods that are alternatives to those in (g) Methods of compliance, be qualified as a project designer [(g)(6)(ii)]. OSHA estimated the costs for training project designers for Class I activities. At an annual cost of $171 thousand, the training burden implied by this requirement is attributed to the EPA MAP regulation, which provides for training of project designers and other competent persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Total construction costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Based on OSHA's preliminary regulatory impact analysis [OSHA, 1990], preliminary analysis by CONSAD [CONSAD, 1990], and cost analysis of the revised standard by OSHA and CONSAD [OSHA, 1994], OSHA estimated total costs of compliance with the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc and the ancillary requirements pertaining to regulated areas, methods of compliance, respiratory protection, hygiene facilities, communication of hazards and competent person training. The estimated compliance costs, by control requirement, are shown in Table 8 for each major construction sector. OSHA's estimate of total cost, $476.4 million, is the average cost for a range of construction workers potentially at risk in each of the activities affected by the standard (see [CONSAD, 1990, Appendix A] and [OSHA, 1994]). This estimate of incremental costs, however, includes the training costs_for workers, supervisors, project designers and competent persons_that would otherwise be incurred through compliance with the EPA Model Accreditation Plan regulation. Excluding EPA-related training costs, OSHA estimates that $346.5 million in incremental costs are attributed to the OSHA construction standard. Table 9 presents total annual compliance costs by construction activity, for requirements unique to the revised OSHA construction standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

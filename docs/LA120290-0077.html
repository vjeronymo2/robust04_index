			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: MOZART CELEBRATION HIGHLIGHTS AUSTRIA  </P> <P> Travelers heading for Austria in 1991 will have several money-saving  transportation options to consider as the country celebrates the 200th  anniversary of Mozart's death with numerous special performances and events.  </P> <P> In Vienna, you can save money on the public transport system, which includes  trams, buses and subway, by purchasing a 24-hour rover ticket for about $3.25.  A 72-hour rover ticket is about $8.50.  </P> <P> Also available is an eight-day "strip" ticket for about $18 that can be used by  more than one person . You just punch the same number of strips in the ticket  as there are users. There is also a four-day strip ticket for about $4.75, or a  package of five individual tickets for $5.75.  </P> <P> Tickets purchased singly cost $1.75 each.  </P> <P> Children under 7 years travel free on Vienna's public transport system.  </P> <P> The Austrian city transit passes take effect with the first use, not from the  time of purchase. The passes can only be purchased in each individual city.  </P> <P> Salzburg, birthplace of Mozart, has a 24-hour pass for about $4 that offers  unlimited travel on bus and trolley lines and to the funicular to Hohensalzburg  Fortress.  </P> <P> Innsbruck has a one-day pass good on street cars and bus lines that costs about  $4.50. If you stay in Innsbruck for three consecutive nights or longer, you  automatically are eligible to become a member of Club Innsbruck at no charge.  </P> <P> Membership covers free daily bus service to the city's five skiing/hiking  areas, admission to various events scheduled by the club and discounts on  admission to museums, golf courses, tennis courts and the zoo.  </P> <P> Your hotel should be able to provide the Club Innsbruck membership card, which  also offers discounts on panorama flights over the Alps.  </P> <P> If you plan to travel by rail, look into the "Rabbit Card" offered by the  Austrian Railway Network. You can choose any four days out of a 10-day period  for unlimited rail travel, with the card also good for boat trips on Lake St.  Wolfgang and travel on narrow-gauge trains throughout the country.  </P> <P> Half-price discounts are also available through the card on all scheduled boat  service on the Danube River within Austria, and on Lake Constance boat trips.  </P> <P> The card, which must be purchased in Europe, costs about $120 for first-class  travel, $83 for second-class.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the Austrian National Tourist Office, 11601  Wilshire Blvd., Suite 2480, Los Angeles 90025, (213) 477-3332.

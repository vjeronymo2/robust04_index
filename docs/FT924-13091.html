			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Pretoria's amnesty bill defies the ANC THE South African government yesterday tabled a controversial bill in parliament which would allow it to grant amnesty and indemnity from prosecution to political criminals, including members of the state security forces. The bill, which has been opposed by the African National Congress (ANC), could prove a further obstacle to progress in talks on a new constitution. The ANC opposes the bill because it will allow President FW de Klerk to indemnify from future prosecution state officials who committed crimes (including political assassinations) during the apartheid era without either trying them for their crimes or even disclosing the deeds publicly. ANC officials have said they support the granting of indemnity, or amnesty to state officials already serving sentences, but only if such actions are taken by a multi-racial interim government and not unilaterally by Pretoria, and only if there is full public disclosure of the crimes for which indemnity is granted. Under yesterday's bill, disclosure is at the discretion of the president. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee made clear yesterday that the government intended to proceed immediately with granting indemnity to all those who committed political crimes, from any party or from the state. He said the legislation was in line with an earlier law which allowed ANC members to receive indemnity from prosecution without disclosing their crimes publicly. The president will have the final word on such indemnities. He will be advised by a panel including at least one judge, but all the panel's members will be appointed by him. The ANC has said it would revoke any indemnities granted unilaterally by Pretoria, and repeal amnesty legislation, if it came to power in multi-racial elections. Mr Coetsee was at pains to stress that yesterday's move would not lead to a general amnesty, as had been feared by the ANC, because the draft law does not automatically absolve state agents of responsibility for apartheid crimes and requires them to apply for indemnity from prosecution for offences (although individuals can apply for indemnity for categories of offence rather than specific offences). But Mr Tony Leon, the justice spokesman for the official opposition, the liberal Democratic party, dismissed this argument, saying the bill was 'a general amnesty by another name'.</p>

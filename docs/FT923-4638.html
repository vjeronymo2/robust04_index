			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Economics confuses metal markets IN THE absence of significant fundamental supply/demand developments international economic factors continued to dominate the base metals markets this week. But such were the complications surrounding their interpretation that traders were unable to draw either bullish or bearish conclusions with any confidence. Metals are generally traded internationally in US dollar terms, so the extreme weakness of that currency for most of the week had the effect of making prices cheaper in terms of other currencies. What encouragement that gave to buyers was countered, however, by their understandable reluctance to commit funds to the market at a time of turmoil on the foreign exchanges. In addition the weakness of the dollar made yet more remote the prospect of a reduction in the high level of interest rates that has been acting as such a strong disincentive to the holding of physical metal. Neither did the traumatic condition of the dollar bode well for the world economy in general, or for a recovery in metal demand. 'People are now becoming very wary of the economic outlook,' Mr Angus MacMillan of Billiton Enthoven Metals told the Reuter news agency yesterday. Metals traders are particularly concerned about the slackness of demand for cars, a key sector for base metals consumption. This week saw the publication of statistics indicating that German car sales would fall by 11 per cent this year, and yesterday Britain's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders cut its 1992 sales forecast from 1.74m to 1.55m following a disappointing 1.67 per cent rise in August, which normally accounts for about 20 per cent of annual sales as buyers are attracted by the advent of the new registration prefix letter. For the London Metal Exchange copper market the net result of these considerations was a Pounds 5.50 fall in the cash price to Pounds 1,251.50 a tonne. But that worked out at a Dollars 5 rise in terms of the US currency. The copper market's underlying weakness was cushioned early in the week by bargain-hunting encouraged by the dollar's fall, traders said. But that dried up as the dollar rallied on Thursday and was not resumed when it turned downwards again yesterday. Other LME metals were generally lower, the biggest movement being cash nickel's Dollars 155 fall to Dollars 7,080 a tonne. The exception was the zinc market, which continued to react to the development of another options-related technical squeeze. Traders believe this is the work of a small group of producers and one trader who have control of 1m tonnes of annual zinc output, equivalent to between 15 and 20 per cent of the western world total. Concern about the situation - which the LME said it was 'closely monitoring' and the Economist Intelligence unit warned was 'damaging for the credibility of the LME as a representative reference price for the metal' - was reflected in the widening of the cash premium over zinc for delivery in three months from Dollars 38 at the end of last week to Dollars 44.25 at yesterday's close. Other factors boosting zinc prices included labour contract negotiations in North America this month and next; the fact that zinc consumption had outpaced production in the first six months of this year; a potential strike at Centromin in Peru; and, although LME zinc stocks were at record levels, a 10 per cent fall in producer stocks since the end of January, said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. LME cash zinc, which reached a 23-month high on Thursday, closed yesterday at Dollars 1,436.75 tonne, up Dollars 21.75 on the week, while the three months position was up Dollars 16 at Dollars 1,392.50 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) the coffee market continued the uptrend of the previous two weeks, helped by technically-driven investment fund and commission house buying in New York, where December arabica futures broke through a key resistance point at 55.70 cents an ounce. The London market remained cautious, however, and as the November position on the Fox, which trades the coarser robusta coffee variety, climbed to Dollars 795 a tonne, up Dollars 35 on the week, at Thursday's close analysts were warning that the overall downtrend was still intact. The November price edged up to Dollars 798 a tonne yesterday morning, but having stopped short of the psychologically significant Dollars 800 level, it eased to close Dollars 6 down on the day and Dollars 29 up on the week at Dollars 789 a tonne.  ---------------------------------------           LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS         (As at Monday's close)  --------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium   +5,625 to 1,356,225 Copper      +6,725 to   275,275 Lead          -175 to   154,650 Nickel        +780 to    44,082 Zinc        +4,525 to   353,750 Tin           +390 to    15,085  ---------------------------------------</p>

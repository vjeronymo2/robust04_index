			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy to the Supreme </F> Council in Kiev -- live]    [Text] Esteemed Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk], Ivan  Stepanovich [Plyushch], esteemed people's deputies: The degree  of confidence which you showed in me when you confirmed me in  the post of minister of defense of Ukraine, and those tasks  which you set me, oblige me to report to you in an honest and  dignified manner, not on the basis of instructions and requests,  attuned to someone's orders, but proceeding from the point of  view of military and technical reasons supported by our  scientists -- Ukraine is a state with rocket and space  capability [raketno-kosmichna derzhava]. We have virtually  everything for this. We only need to discard the nuclear  symbolism for the sake of the economy. I am quite certain of  this.    Analyzing our steps on the whole of the complex path to the  resolution of the nuclear problem in Ukraine, we consider that  this path has been consistent and on the whole right. This work  was conducted under the leadership of the Supreme Council. All  of the legislative acts which were adopted by the Supreme  Council regarding the nuclear problem show that Ukraine has  gradually been moving toward a non-nuclear status.    I have already reported in detail on all of these steps and  resolutions at a joint session of the relevant Supreme Council  commissions. Taking all of this into account, and also the fact  that strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not a  factor deterring an attack by an aggressor on our state nor a  guarantee of its security, we consider that the next step of the  Supreme Council of ratifying the START I Treaty on 19 November  1993 was entirely proper and logical.    Esteemed deputies, at the same time you know that the  relevant reservations in the ratification of the START I Treaty  by the Supreme Council of Ukraine unfortunately did not diminish  international tension, but on the contrary complicated the  problem of strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine even  more, and especially where Russia was concerned. In such a  situation it was necessary to act in a very considered way. We  believed that, to the extent that we could convincingly show the  world and our people the rightness of our legal and other  actions regarding nuclear weapons, both the international  prestige of Ukraine and the domestic situation in the state  would depend on this, and so would the strategic prospect of our  national security to a considerable extent.    Therefore we at the Ministry of Defense believed that of the  whole set of nuclear issues our main task was to define our  stance above all on the technical state of the nuclear weapons  deployed in Ukraine. In the implementation of the resolution on  ratification of the START I Treaty and the instruction of the  president of Ukraine by the Ministry of Defense and myself  personally, the state of nuclear weapons of the 43d missile army  and (?the) long-range air force was thoroughly analyzed.  Together with leading specialists and scientists of Ukraine, I  personally inspected the situation at all nuclear facilities.    The work which was carried out allows me to report to you,  esteemed deputies, the following conclusions, which from the  point of view of military and technical reasons determine the  necessity of a gradual withdrawal of nuclear warheads [yaderni  boyeprypasy], which in accordance with their technical state  have gone beyond the guarantee service period.    I consider that the main thing is that the nuclear warheads,  with which intercontinental ballistic missiles are equipped,  constitute very complex technical apparatus, for the creation of  which a lengthy and extremely expensive process of design,  testing, and production is needed. To date Ukraine has not had  the possibility of resolving these tasks. Nor will it have in  the near future. There is no scientific and production base for  creating nuclear weapons in our state. There are no ranges to  test them on, nor specialists in recycling nuclear warheads.    And the main thing, esteemed deputies, is the economic  condition of our state. To continue, one should also take  account of the fact that a tough and obligatory condition of the  safe maintenance of nuclear weapons is the uninterrupted  scientific and technical accompaniment to its operation, which  consists of constant supervision [kontrol] and regular  inspection of the state of nuclear warheads (?and of elaborated)  scientifically grounded technical decisions regarding the  possibility and conditions for further operation of nuclear  warheads [yaderni boyevi bloky]. From the practical aspect, the  design offices and plants, manufacturers of nuclear weapons  located in Russia, are obliged to carry out such scientific and  technical accompaniment. But today they are not carrying out  these measures, and on the contrary are blocking them.    It is also necessary to emphasize that the guaranteed  service  periods of a considerable number of nuclear warheads located in  Ukraine are expiring or have already expired. It could happen  that unsupervised [nekontrolyovanyy] physical processes which  are occurring in nuclear warheads will be unforeseen, and the  state of nuclear weapons will become critical.    The impossibility of replacing gas reactors, whose guarantee  service periods have already expired, in nuclear warheads causes  especial concern. The said reactors are produced in Russia and  are not arriving in Ukraine. To date more than 300 (?nuclear)  reactors have accumulated in our state, which need urgent  replacement.    In addition, the storage of nuclear weapons in repositories  remains a complex problem. Thus, when a large number of nuclear  warheads are located in nuclear technical units, the level of  their nuclear safety is lowered and leads to the loss of the  guarantee of the chief designer. That which is in the  repositories of the nuclear technical units of the 46th missile  division consists, together with SS-24 missiles, (?of) 60  nuclear warheads, the investigation of three of which showed,  which our president spoke about, that irreversible physical and  chemical processes are occurring. The extent of the (?danger of  explosion) of radioactive materials of the warheads is  increasing drastically.    The list of violations determining a critical state of  nuclear and ecological safety could be continued. Taken all  together, they could lead to an accident, the consequent scale  of which could potentially exceed the Chernobyl disaster.  Esteemed deputies, I pray to God not to let this happen.    One cannot not emphasize that the state of nuclear safety  is also affected by the condition of missiles, the servicing of  which is also not fully carried out and with violations of the  operational demands and normative documents, I (?do not) have in  mind specialists from Russia. The conclusion is that proceeding  from what has been set forth above, the further maintenance of  nuclear warheads [yaderni boyeprypasy] on the territory of  Ukraine presents a danger not just for Ukraine and Russia, but  also for our other neighboring states in Europe and the Near  East; in the event of an accident, they will find themselves in  the zone of radioactive contamination.    Thus because of the circumstances of the necessity of  implementing the demands in the resolution of the Supreme  Council of Ukraine on ratification of the START I Treaty  concerning conducting further talks, meetings, and accords -- as  a result of this the trilateral statement by the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, and the appendix to it,  are a necessary and logical step in the matter of Ukraine  acquiring a nonnuclear status, and on the whole resolve  positively all military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in  Ukraine.    We believe that with the aim of guaranteed implementation of  the demands of the trilateral statement and the appendix to it  it is necessary during further talks with the Russian Federation  to elaborate and sign a number of documents to determine the  time periods, procedure, and conditions for the transfer of  Russian nuclear warheads. The following should be included in  these documents: a schedule for dispatching the first group of  nuclear warheads over 10 months; an agreement regarding the  procedure and conditions for supervision on the part of Ukraine  over the dismantlement and recycling of nuclear warheads at  enterprises of the industry of the Russian Federation; an  agreement on compensation to Ukraine on the part of the Russian  Federation for the value of the transferred warheads; an  agreement on warranty inspection and servicing by the  manufacturer of the state of nuclear warheads over the whole  period of their being in Ukraine, including the process of  transportation to Ukrainian S facilities and to bases at plants  of Russia's industrial enterprises; a protocol on the mutual  obligations of Ukraine and the Russian Federation regarding the  grouping of strategic nuclear forces in Ukraine and conditions  of joint supervision over the state of nuclear missile weapons.    (?As regards) equal relations over the period of the  reduction of nuclear weapons with states of the nuclear club,  including with the United States, and after the START I Treaty  comes into force and Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty of 1 July 1968, they should be  equivalent to those measures which are taken concerning  supervision of the reduction of nuclear armaments by every  state, and incidentally under the supervision of our specialists.    I consider, esteemed deputies, that I should draw your  attention to another aspect of the nuclear problem. This is  about the fact that, notwithstanding the reduction of strategic  nuclear weapons, we will have a very careful attitude to keeping  the personnel and infrastructure of the 43d missile army. This  is in general of great value, I mean both the specialists and  the material base. All of this can in the very near future be  successfully used, not just in the interests of the state's  military security, but also for civilian needs.    I believe that the accords achieved by the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Moscow on 14 January  of this year on the whole resolve positively virtually all  military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which  satisfies the conditions of nuclear disarmament determined in  the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 July [as  heard] 1993. And I would ask you, esteemed deputies, to support  the proposals of our president. Thank you for your attention.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Timex workers rebuff leaders over deal EFFORTS by senior trade union officials to end the Timex dispute in Dundee suffered a severe setback yesterday when terms negotiated with the Timex management were angrily rejected by the dismissed workforce. A mass meeting addressed by Mr Jimmy Airlie, Scottish organiser of the AEEU engineering union, ended after only half an hour when the dismissed workers voted unanimously against accepting terms which Mr Airlie described as 'draconian' although considered to be the best on offer. The terms would have allowed all dismissed workers to return to work at the printed circuit board factory, subject to their capabilities being assessed. But they would have had to accept conditions amounting to a 27 per cent cut in pay and benefits. Those who wanted would receive statutory redundancy payments, something Mr Airlie said had never been achieved before after workers had already been sacked. The Timex dispute, now in its 18th week, worsened after Timex sacked its entire hourly paid workforce of 340 people, four in five of them women, after they rejected a peace plan. Timex then hired 290 hourly paid workers who are bused through the picket line to the plant. After yesterday's mass meeting the sacked workforce vowed to step up the dispute. They called the settlement terms 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous' and chanted: 'The workers, united, will never be defeated.' Mr Airlie said the settlement terms had been agreed with Timex officials in eight weeks of secret negotiations. Although he could not recommend them, he was duty bound to put the package to the sacked workforce. The company wanted a pay freeze this year with any pay increase in 1994 dependent on the plant's making a profit in the first three quarters of the year. The company would cut its pension contribution by 25 per cent and reduce the scope of its sick pay scheme. The subsidy on meals in the canteen would be withdrawn. Mr Airlie said it was an indication of the strength of feeling of the dismissed workforce that they were 'not enticed by redundancy money which would run into many thousands of pounds in many cases'.

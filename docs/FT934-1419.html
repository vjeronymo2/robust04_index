			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Travel: Taken for a ride in the Wild West - Hilary Rubinstein experiences the spectacular scenery of Wyoming, and the joys and hazards of life on a ranch God Spends His Vacation Here' is the claim inscribed on the ashtrays of the Rustic Pine, Dubois, Wyoming. It is a bar that might have been lifted out of any classic Hollywood western: a hugely long counter, wooden cubicles on the side, lots of elk and moose heads, a pool-table out back and square dancing on Tuesdays. On the street, with its many log buildings and wooden sidewalks, the Rustic Pine makes another resonant boast with its neon-lit board: 'The World's Most Unique.' With their long, straggling main streets, their depressing line of motels, supermarkets, gas stations, shops selling American-Indian tat, trailer homes and camper parking lots, there must be scores of places like this scattered all over the American West. Dubois offers all these eyesores, but it has some redeeming features - most notably, spectacular country in every direction, all of it strangely familiar from dozens of movies. To the north lie the Absaroka mountains, tree-covered and alpine on their lower slopes, rising to snow-covered peaks even in July. To the east and west are the vivid rose-red and yellow badlands. Passing close to the town is the lovely, sinuous Wind River, famous for its variety of trout. Take a dirt road for half a dozen miles and you will be on the threshold of the Wind River mountains, Wyoming's premier back-packing area, with its many lakes and peaks rising to almost 14,000 ft. And two hours' drive away you can reach Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. For most of the past century, Dubois has lived off its cattle rearing and logging, but now the riding, trekking and fishing communities have begun to wake to its tourist attractions. There are no decent hotels or restaurants yet; they will come in time. Meanwhile, if you are content to eat beef - especially prime rib - you will not lack for calorific intake. All along the Wind River valley, guest ranches are springing up, sometimes attached to a working cattle ranch. Accommodation tends to be in rustic log cabins with wood-burning stoves. Some have all the amenities of a good hotel: pools, saunas, hot tubs, decent cooking. My party comprised seven geriatric dudes - dude being a term of contempt for some, but in these parts a neutral description of city folk holidaying on a ranch. Six of us were in our mid-60s to mid-70s and only one of us had done any serious riding before. Were we nervous? You could say so. One so-called friend told us of an article by Clement Freud who had come out to do some riding - he's an experienced horseman - but had fallen off on his first day. The horse fell on him and he broke a limb and wrote a funny piece about his hospital experiences. We were advised before leaving to bathe in vinegar to minimise our saddle sores; to buy a stock of Arnica ointment for the abrasions we would surely get along our thighs; and to be prepared for ticks, leeches, snakes and mosquitoes. Our ranch had sent us in advance a list of recommended items: riding boots and lightweight walking boots (bought locally for a fraction of the price they would have cost in Britain); powerful sunblockers and chapstick; lots of warm clothing and sleepwear (the nights can be bitterly cold); and mosquito repellent (another must). We did not encounter the leeches or the snakes, but were given instructions for dealing with the ticks which, we were told, like to attach themselves to private parts and can give you a nasty disease if you don't quickly light a match, blow it out and apply the hot end to the little beast. As for the riding, it was for all of us wonderful. We trotted and cantered; we hacked through beautiful scenery; and on an all-day expedition rose effortlessly up precipitous slopes from 7,500 ft to a summit of over 11,000 ft. After eight hours in the saddle we were exhausted, but exultant to have stayed so long on our mounts without aches or sores. How do I account for our painless initiation? First, the high quality of our wranglers, those in charge of the corral, and their helpful instructions. Second, the sure-footed confidence of our horses and their tolerance of our inexperience. Finally there were those wonderful western saddles, with pommels in front as an extra security and a back moulded to the human buttock. The pleasures of our ranch holiday were not confined to the riding. We went for long treks; canoed up river creeks - magical at dusk when nocturnal birds and beasts came out to drink; swam in glacial lakes. We even took ourselves to Dubois one evening for the weekly square-dancing. It seemed absurd to have travelled so far and not seen anything of the two great national parks in the vicinity. So, at the end of our fortnight at the ranch, we decamped to Jackson, an up-and-coming mini-Vail of a resort, 100 miles to the west, where we spent a morning white-water rafting, and then drove to Yellowstone. We were told that nearly a third of the US population has visited Yellowstone, and each year another 2.5m tourists swell the total. Yellowstone has many marvels, but we were determined to see one of its best-known attractions, the Old Faithful geyser, which, every 75 minutes or so, spews up 11,000 gallons of scalding water to a height of 180 ft. It is a fine sight, even if you have to share it with hundreds of fellow-gawpers and endure the bumper-to-bumper chain of campers and trailers on the long, monotonous drive. For climbing, we preferred the Grand Tetons, a staggeringly impressive range of peaks that rears up from a flat plain and comes replete with canyons, waterfalls and lakes, and also, if you are lucky, bears and elks. Others were more fortunate in that respect than we were (though we did eat elk steaks, even more boring than venison), but in our brief visit we notched up plenty of wildlife sightings - moose, buffalo, coyotes, beavers, badgers, marmots and chipmunks, plus many blue herons, pelicans, bald-headed eagles, hawks and ospreys. For most of us it was one of the most energetic out-door holidays we had ever taken, and we were naturally chuffed that in advanced middle-age we could derive such unremitting pleasure from our exertions. Would we go again? Emphatically yes. Recommended ranches in the Dubois area: all four ranches are personally run by resident owners, with superior home cooking, and are flexible about guests' requirements.

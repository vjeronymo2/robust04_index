In the apartment police found a  kilogram of so-called smoke-heroin. [passage omitted] A Kenyan  married couple with three minor children received a shock when  people from the Copenhagen Police Vice Squad suddenly were  standing in their apartment in Stevnesgade in Norrebro Monday  [28 March] afternoon. In the apartment were found small bags  containing so-called smoke-heroin (``brown sugar'') which had  just been readied for street sale. A total of around 700 grams  were seized. In addition, police found 38,000 kroner and $22,000  thought to have come from drug trafficking. The heroin has a  street value of around 150,000 kroner.    But the police also searched a 33-year-old Tanzanian who was  visiting. An additional 300 grams was found by police in the  heel of his shoe.    Heroin is most popular in its smoked form. Social workers  and  narcotics police are currently concerned that many of the very  young have gone over to smoke-heroin in the belief that it is  not addictive.    The couple, aged 39 and 37, appeared yesterday with the  Tanzanian in court, where all three were charged with drug  trafficking. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Claire Trean: "The Temptation of Withdrawal"] </F>   [Text] Once again there is that nagging feeling that a  settlement of the Bosnian crisis further off than ever, that  phoney calm punctuated with violations of past agreements and  the rekindling of smoldering fires: troops gathering in Brcko,  tensions in Olovo, etc., i.e., clear signs that Bosnia's warring  communities are still determined to continue their fighting.    Once again, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] is being  humiliated both by Serb arrogance and the mistakes of its own  leaders, that is, for the last few weeks, those of [UN special  envoy] Akashi. Once again, diplomatic action is dwindling and  there is a feeling that what had been achieved is being whittled  away. And once again, also, there is the chronic temptation on  the part of Western leaders to give it all up: The temptation,  for those who have troops there, to leave Bosnia.    Thus in the past few days [French Foreign Minister] Alain  Juppe made several cautious mentions of an impending withdrawal  of [France's] "blue helmets," stating that there was a pressing  need to "acknowledge" the lack of progress towards a solution.  To be fair, Mr. Juppe will probably be the last one to call for  a withdrawal of French soldiers from Bosnia. However, he is not  alone: Like others, the French Government is divided on the  issue, and Mr. Juppe has already had to challenge those inclined  to such an abdication of responsibility, both at the Matignon  [office of the prime minister] and the Defense Ministry.    The more history repeats itself (the deadlock, the  UNPROFOR's  fetters, not to mention its current state of discredit), the  more weariness sets in the minds of those who will give up, both  in France and in other contributing countries. Of course, short  of a threat to the UNPROFOR as whole, no one wants to be the  first to opt for total withdrawal, a decision which public  opinion would view as forsaking an imperiled population. But  one can hear once again in Paris talk of a "disproportion"  between the cost of having soldiers in Bosnia and the precious  few results achieved there so far; in other words, Paris is  considering a lopsided and ultimately unjustifiable policy:  that of partial withdrawal.    If Alain Juppe mentions a possible withdrawal of French  "blue  helmets," it is not only as a response to such internal  tensions. His words are also intended for the belligerents as  well as France's partners in the "management" of the crisis,  that is, primarily for the United States, a few days before a  reportedly "important" meeting to be held in Geneva between  American, European, and Russian ministers.    The French foreign minister already used such arguments on  the eve of previous diplomatic encounters. His message to the  Americans, which Mr. Juppe will deliver in person on 11 and 12  May in Washington, boils down to this: Either you play the  negotiating game straight, or we precipitate the disbanding of  the UNPROFOR and you will soon be alone in answering Bosnian  Muslims' calls for help.    The latest initiative of Western countries in the Bosnian  crisis dates back to the aftermath of the Serb's attack on the  muslim enclave of Gorazde, over a month ago. Under the insult,  the West, i.e., the United States, Europe, Russia, and the  United Nations, had finally decided to act by issuing an  ultimatum to the aggressors and trying to broker new  negotiations between the belligerents.  <H5>  Taking Control </H5>   Unfortunately, both attempts have now proved utterly futile:  The threat of NATO air strikes does not seem to be a valid  deterrent any more; once again it highlights the divisions  between major powers, as shown by Russia's backtracking late  last week at the Security Council with respect to a resolution  proposed by the French and the Americans that threatened with  air strikes against troublemakers in Brcko.    As for joint efforts by "the four" to define a foundation  for  a settlement jointly with Bosnia's leaders, they achieved  nothing: The "contact group" (representatives of the major  powers as well as the United Nations) has been fruitlessly  shuttling back and forth between Sarajevo and Pale, between  Serbs and Bosnians, who remain unwilling to negotiate.    Hence the idea, which France has long been pushing and which  the U.S. secretary of state has finally agreed to, of taking  things one echelon higher, at the ministerial level: In Geneva  on 13 and 14 May, the United States, Russian, and European  foreign ministers are expected to try to "take control" and at  least to define a foundation for a peaceful settlement.    This presupposes that they first have to adopt joint  positions, which is far from being the case right now. The  notion of imposing a real cease-fire on the belligerents  stumbles on the problem of the UNPROFOR's limited capacity and  the restrictive U.S. policy on this point. As for the (French)  notion of developing guidelines for Bosnia's partition  (proportion of territory allocated to the various communities,  special status for enclaves, etc.), it is blocked by American  reluctance, but above all by realities: Those few square  kilometers which apparently seem so trivial to French  bureaucrats are at the very root of past and future fighting in  Bosnia; they give rise to feelings of unacceptable injustice.  What France is basically asking the United States to do in the  name of realpolitik is to convince the Bosnian Muslims to  capitulate.    Last, another French notion -- that the Serbs could be made  to come round through the promise of a gradual lifting of  sanctions against Belgrade -- is also foundering not only on  skepticism on the part of the United States, which until  recently has still been advocating stricter enforcement of the  economic embargo, but also on recent developments in Bosnia:  How could France call for an end to the sanctions while 11 of  its own nationals are being held hostage by Serb forces?</p>

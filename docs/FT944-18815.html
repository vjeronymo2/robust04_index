			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Investments that penalise the poor - Serious Money Even Autif, the unit trust trade association, sounded rather surprised at its own restraint this week: it is not lobbying the chancellor of the exchequer to raise the ceilings on personal equity plans in his November Budget. Like Sherlock Holmes' dog that failed to bark, Autif's silence speaks volumes. Anyone who can afford to take full advantage of the annual Pep allowance already has a remarkably good deal. The worry must be that some future chancellor will feel it is far too generous and reduce or remove the concessions. For, like most tax concessions, Peps are widening the gulf between rich and poor. This week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies produced a research paper pointing out that the savings of the poor tend to incur more tax than those of the rich. This is because the poorer half of the population holds 60 per cent of its assets in interest-bearing accounts at banks and building societies, which are taxed comparatively heavily. But the richest part of the population holds much of its wealth in specialised investments which enjoy generous tax treatment, such as Peps and direct holdings of shares and unit trusts. Where the poor have benefited, along with the rich, is through home ownership. But house price booms may be a thing of the past. If this year's Budget leaves Peps alone, most investors will rejoice. But, in the long term, would it not be better if chancellors gave up using tax to distort investment patterns? For a start, tax incentives hardly ever fulfil their creators' intentions. The business expansion scheme was intended to encourage individuals to invest in developing small businesses - and ended up sucking many people into illiquid property investment just as the market turned down. Peps were intended to encourage individuals to invest directly in the shares of quoted companies, but they became a success only when they weretransformed into vehicles for the packaged savings market. Second, tax incentives are - as the IFS shows - of the greatest use to those who can afford expert advice. And, finally, the search for tax-efficient investment leads to investment that is, too often, distorted and, at worst, just plain bad. *** This comment from a broker seemed either cryptic or cynical: 'It's easier to justify buying gilts on a personal finance basis than on a market basis.' But what he meant was clear enough. The actual and probable returns on gilt-edged stocks look attractive compared with those available elsewhere. But most people are expecting interest rates to rise further on both sides of the Atlantic, and gilt prices nearly always fall when interest rates rise. So, gilts are likely to get even cheaper over the next few months. Does this matter? Buying at the bottom and selling at the top is an unrealistic ambition. Our table, courtesy of BZW, suggests which gilts look most appealing at present to different types of taxpayer. The yields show what you can actually expect to receive net of whatever your relevant tax rate is - provided you hold them until maturity. The volatility rating reflects the market risk: the higher the rating, the greater the risk.</p>

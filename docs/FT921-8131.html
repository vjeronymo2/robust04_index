			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Blots on the cityscape - A series on urban air quality by examining the cost and cures of pollution Environmental debate about air pollution focuses increasingly on global issues, notably the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion. But for hundreds of millions of people living in the world's most densely populated cities, local air quality is a much more immediate problem. Although dirty urban air undoubtedly causes widespread ill health - with lung damage the most important consequence - there is remarkably little epidemiological evidence to show the medical effects of pollution. Few episodes are so obviously tragic as the great London fog of December 1952, which is estimated to have killed 4,000 people through lung and heart disease. But some experts believe that air pollution is partly responsible for the rising incidence of asthma in the industrialised world. North American studies have recently demonstrated a link between less severe air pollution and respiratory illness, says Stephen Holgate, professor of immunopharmacology at Southampton University, who is chairing a UK government committee investigating the medical consequences of air pollution. There has been almost no research in Britain. From the scanty evidence, the Holgate committee is trying to disentangle the effect of different pollutants and then discover how they interact. Besides causing death and disease, dirty air damages buildings. Acid pollutants eat away the stonework of historic monuments and soot lays down a layer of dust and grime. But 'attempts to quantify the economic damage are extremely difficult,' says Fiona Weir, air pollution specialist with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. A 'back of the envelope' calculation by the World Bank put the economic cost of pollution in Mexico City - widely regarded as the conurbation with the world's dirtiest air - at Dollars 1.1bn a year. The nature of urban pollution has changed radically during this century. In Europe and North America the main source until the 1950s was sulphurous fumes and soot spewed out by coal burning in homes, factories and power stations. Then clean air legislation, combined with the movement of smokestack industries away from big cities, led to a great improvement in air quality. Today's pollution is largely a consequence of increasing road traffic. Vehicle exhausts emit carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and hydrocarbons. In sunshine the NOx and hydrocarbons are involved in photochemical reactions which form secondary pollutants, notably ozone. In its proper place in the stratosphere, 20km above us, ozone is a vital shield against damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun. But at surface level ozone is a corrosive and unwanted pollutant, irritating the lungs of anyone who breathes it. Wintertime pollution in temperate regions has a different chemical composition from the dry photochemical smogs of summer. Instead of ozone there may be an acid fog such as London suffered last December, when droplets of dilute nitric and sulphuric acid filled the air. In Third World cities too, the cocktail of pollutants includes a large contribution from motor vehicles, many with ancient ill-tuned engines which would be banned in developed countries because of their filthy exhaust. At the same time urban factories - often with rudimentary emission controls - pour soot, sulphur dioxide, heavy metals and other substances into the air. The severity of local pollution depends not only on the dirt discharged into the atmosphere but also on local geography and climate. Quiet anticyclonic weather, with little wind to blow in clean air, can cause trouble. The worst conditions come when there is an atmospheric 'inversion' - a rise in temperature with altitude instead of the normal fall. This keeps a lid on ground-level pollution and can allow very high levels of pollutants to build up. Any long-term policy to tackle urban pollution has to focus on vehicle exhaust emissions. Possible measures fall into two categories: making each vehicle run more cleanly, and reducing the total volume of traffic. The US has put its faith in the autocatalyst or catalytic converter as the chief weapon for cleaning up cars. The current generation of 'three-way cats' can reduce emissions of three important pollutants - NOx, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide - by 90 per cent. The cat is a unit about the size of a small silencer fitted inside the exhaust system. It includes a honeycomb of ceramic or metal which is coated with small amounts of the precious metals platinum, palladium and rhodium. These convert the pollutants into less harmful forms: carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water. The catalyst is poisoned by lead and therefore can only be used in cars running on unleaded petrol. The European Community is introducing emission standards similar to those in force in the US; they will require all new cars sold in the EC from the end of 1992 to be fitted with a three-way cat. But already the US is moving to more stringent controls. California, home of the original Los Angeles smog, is leading the way with a schedule that calls for a progressive reduction in emissions over the next decade; and several states in the industrial north-east expect to follow suit. Catalyst manufacturers are developing more efficient cats to meet the forthcoming standards, says Tim Truex, who is in charge of autocatalyst research at Johnson Matthey Technology Centre in the UK. Two important developments are in prospect: electrically heated cats that start working as soon as the engine starts, unlike current models which allow pollutants to pass through almost unimpeded for half a minute or so after a cold start; and new catalysts to work with fuel-efficient 'lean burn' engines. However, critics say US policy is not a good model for other countries, because it has relied too much on the cat to reduce vehicle pollution and has done little to discourage driving. They point out that smog remains a serious problem in Los Angeles and several other American cities, after almost 20 years of increasingly stringent emission controls. 'The lesson from the US is that you need not only good technical standards to reduce emissions but also a transport policy to control the number of cars on the road,' says Fiona Weir of Friends of the Earth. The prospect for polluted European cities such as London is that air quality will improve temporarily during the 1990s as catalytic converters are introduced widely - and will then deteriorate again if the volume of traffic is allowed to go on increasing. In the end, therefore, urban air quality may depend most of all on measures to discourage driving. These could include improved public transport, financial penalties on cars through road pricing schemes, and bans on non-essential traffic in city centres. Everyone has a stake in improving urban air quality, even people in rural isolation hundreds of miles from the nearest city, because global pollution is an accumulation of local pollution. The air at the South Pole is never as polluted as Los Angeles on a clean day, but urban smog is beginning to leave smudges in the most pristine parts of the world. The series will continue next week by focusing on the particular problems of Santiago.</p>

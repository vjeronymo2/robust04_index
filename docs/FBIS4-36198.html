			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi 31 May -- Even as the heat and dust raised  by the campaigning for the seven Lok Sabha and 10 assembly seats  has subsided, the outcome has given rise to a new debate in the  political circles with the various parties discussing whether  the GATT treaty was an issue or not in Thursday's `trial of  strength'.    The provocation for this has come from the Congress(I) which  was quick to term its success in winning five of the seven Lok  Sabha seats that were at stake as popular endorsement of the  government's signing the multilateral trade pact. The party's  official spokesman, Mr V N Gadgil, fired the first salvo in this  regard when he asserted on Monday that the success of the  Congress(I) represented a definite rejection of the Opposition's  "propaganda" on GATT.    To buttress his point, Mr Gadgil stressed the fact that all  the constituencies which went the Congress(I) way happened to be  rural ones and that it clearly showed that the people in the  countryside have not bought the Opposition's charge of sell-out  by the government.    While the Opposition parties are not as elated as the  Congress(I), they nevertheless are not ready to let Mr Gadgil's  claim go uncontested. "Who said GATT was an electoral issue,"  snapped the Janata Dal leader, Mr Jaipal Reddy when asked to  react on Mr Gadgil's assertion.    He reeled off detailed statistics to substantiate his  contention. "The Congress(I) has not wrested any seat but  retained the 5 seats and that too with reduced margins. In UP  [Uttar Pradesh], Bihar and Tamil Nadu, which account for 178 Lok  Sabha seats, the Congress(I) has come third or fourth. In fact,  they have been losing in these states since 1989," the leader of  the Janata Dal said.    Mr Reddy further argued that "if anything, the results only  show a steady decline of Congress(I)'s influence and the premise  that their stand on Gatt stood vindicated was clearly wrong."    Mr Sitaram Yechury, member of the CPI(M) [Communist Party of  India -- Marxist] politburo, was equally dismissive of Mr  Gadgil's contention. "A bogus claim" was how Mr Yechury  described the Congress(I)'s statement. "The return of 5 sitting  MPs and that too with vastly reduced margins can hardly be  described as an index of Congress(I)'s popularity and in no case  a popular vindication of its stand on Gatt".    Significantly, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], which is  pulling in a different direction than the left parties and the  Janata Dal on a host of issues, seems to be for a change in  agreement with them at least on this one. Mr K N Govindacharya,  party's general secretary, hotly disputed the claim of Mr  Gadgil. According to him, the elections were not contested on  any specific issue like GATT. "The agenda this time was  scattered and varied from place to place with the local issues  dominating."    The BJP leader went to the extent of calling it an issueless  election. Questioning Mr Gadgil's interpretation of his party's  performance, Mr Govindacharya was of the opinion that the  victory of the ruling party in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal  Pradesh had more to do with the `honeymoon factor' than anything  else.    For his part, however, Mr Gadgil remains totally unfazed.  Asked to comment on the arguments put forward by the Opposition  parties the Congress(I)'s spokesman said that the "Opposition  did make the GATT an issue in the by-polls. In fact, if there  was one issue they chose to highlight all over, it was GATT and  nothing else."    He also remains unimpressed by the opinion in the political  circles that the Congress(I) did not perform too well in West  Bengal where the CPI(M) had really done its best to use the  Union government's stand on GATT as its principal weapon against  the Congress(I).    The debate is likely to intensify further, especially when  the government brings forward in Parliament the legislations it  needs to enact for complying with its obligations under the GATT  agreement. And if the Congress(I) is hoping that the outcome  would make the Opposition parties relent on their stand, it is  certain that its expectations may not quite materialise.</p>

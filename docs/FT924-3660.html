			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System Statements from Paris and Bonn defending the parity of the franc and D-Mark within the EMS helped ease tension in a fraught system by the end of last week. The statements were prompted by speculation that the franc would be devalued as it hovered near the floor of the ERM grid. Concerted efforts, including intervention, helped to bolster the franc. Many ERM currencies were also helped by the gloomy economic statistics out of Germany, which hit the D-Mark towards the end of the week. Currencies, Page 29 The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the narrow band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. The Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.</p>

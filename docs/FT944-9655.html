			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Labour warns on injuries scheme The Labour party warned yesterday that Treasury plans to scrap the Industrial Injuries Scheme would cause severe hardship for thousands of victims of workplace accidents. Amid growing signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will announce the end of the scheme in his Budget this month, Labour argued that vital health and safety legislation would be undermined and that many workers would be forced to take out private insurance. Scrapping the compensation scheme, which costs taxpayers Pounds 600m a year, would put the onus on employees to sue employers for negligence in order to gain compensation for injuries suffered in the workplace. 'We have already seen the government pass on the cost of sickness benefit and maternity benefit to the employer, and this is the next stage in that process,' said Mr Keith Bradley, a shadow social security minister. 'People injured at work may well find they are not employable, that whatever scheme is put in place does not cover their particular injury, or that the amount of compensation is so low that they will find themselves in severe hardship.' However, the move would appease rightwing Conservative MPs who are unhappy at the shelving of Post Office privatisation and who have accused the government of lacking credible and radical policies. They believe the Pounds 88bn-a-year social security budget is far too large, and are pressing for public spending cuts to create scope for income tax reductions next year.</p>

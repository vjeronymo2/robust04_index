In the meantime, it will levy tariffs at  provisional rates on nine categories of export commodities  including lead and zinc.    The major commodities and rate variations involved in the  implementation of the provisional tariff rates for imported  commodities are as follows:    1. Metal raw materials: The tariff rate for tinplate and its  base plates is to be reduced to 9 percent from the existing  statutory tariff rate of 15 percent; galvanized steel plate, to  9 percent from 15 percent; thickened steel plate, to 5 percent  from 12 percent; odd-shape steel material, to 6 percent from 12  percent; and, refined copper, to 3 percent from 5 percent;  respectively.    2. Chemical raw materials and products: The tariff rate for  furanophenol is to be reduced from 5 to 3 percent; methylester  of DV chrysanthemum acid and other agents for special farm  chemicals, from 6 to 3 percent; toluene, from 12 to 3 percent;  octyl alcohol, from 17 to 10 percent; acetone, from 15 to 7  percent; xylene, from 12 to 3 percent; polypropylene, from 12 to  5 percent; polystyrene, from 25 to 15 percent; polyhydroxy  polyether, from 25 to 10 percent; and, ABS resinate [shu zhi  2885 7927] and others, from 25 to 15 percent; respectively.    3. Agricultural goods and materials: The tariff rate for  farm chemicals is to be reduced from 6 to 4 percent; chemical  fertilizer, from 5 to 4 percent; forage, from 9 to 5 percent;  raw material for forage, from 5 to 3 percent; and, additives and  others, from 9 to 5 percent; respectively.    4. Parts and components for machinery and electric products:  including chip capacitors, to be lowered from 23 to 10 percent;  chip resistors, from 20 to 12 percent; chip diodes, from 20 to  10 percent; display tubes for monitors, from 25 to 12 percent;  electronic fuel injectors for car engines, from 20 to 10  percent; and CKD spare parts for hard discs (over 20 mega  bytes), from 9 to 6 percent.    Lower provisional tariffs will also be put on: for news  paper, from 20 to 7 percent; log, from 15 to 10 percent; and  timber and timber sheets for making plywood, from 9 to 6 percent.    Lower provisional tariffs will be put on mainly the  following  export products: for lead ores and concentrates, from 30 to zero  percent; zinc ores and concentrates, from 30 to zero percent;  tin ores and concentrates, from 50 to 20 percent; phosphorus,  from 20 to 10 percent; and benzine, from 40 to zero percent.    According to officials of the General Administration of  Customs, as 1994 will be a crucial year for China's economic  structural reform, lower provisional tariffs on major raw  materials for agricultural and industrial productions and parts  and components for key machinery and electric products will be  conducive to stabilizing commodity prices, facilitating the  smooth implementation of various reform measures, and promoting  a sustained, rapid, and steady growth [chi xu kuai su wen ding  2170 4958 1816 6643 4489 1353] of the national economy.</p>

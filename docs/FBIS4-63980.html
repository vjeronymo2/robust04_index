			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian newspapers on Friday  run reports by their own correspondents and news agencies about  the seizure of a bus near Mineralnye Vody by terrorists, the  situation concerning the Crimea, the forthcoming arrival of  world-famed writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in Vladivostok, and  the Russian president's meeting with the leaders of the Federal  Counter-Intelligence Service (FCS).    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries excerpts from the president's  report at the all-Russia meeting of the FCS.    "The country acutely needs reliable, intensively working  special- purpose agencies. It is essential to remove the burden  of totalitarian legacy and at the same time counter disruptive  sentiments that hindered the work of fcs personnel," the  newspaper quotes the president as saying.    NOVAYA YEZHIDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER) on the  all-  Russia FCS meeting:    "A wave of resignations and transformations in 1991-1994 has  demoralised the FCS which lost both skilled personnel and  monopoly on investigation operations".    ROSSIISKIYE VESTI interviewed Sergey Filatov, chief of the  presidential staff. "The circulation of rumours about personnel  changes in the top echelon of powers turns nearly into a system.  I would even say that leaks of information have become an  instrument of political struggle".    Asked what renders state personnel unstable, Filatov said:  "The frequency of personnel changes is influenced by the  socio-economic condition of society and by the outcome of  struggle between political forces".    Filatov views this as a transient phenomenon in present-day  conditions, "because sometimes compromises are achieved through  personnel reshuffles. A compromise in politics makes it  possible to ease tension in society and stabilise the situation".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA continues to publish a series of  interviews with Aleksandr Rutskoy. In this instalment, the  former vice- president describes the "Lefortovo period".    "I pondered a good deal, assessing in-depth the entire  spectrum of causes and circumstances that put Russia in the  hardest crisis situation. Simultaneously I was writing two  books The Collapse of a Power and The Finding  of Faith. The former analyses all events that took place  in the Soviet Union and Russia from 1990 to the October tragedy  of 1993.    "After The President's Journal was published, I  had to supplement my book with yet another chapter, taking a  look at the October events from the position of the democratic  press and the `Journal'. Mass media hyped stories about Supreme  Soviet snipers but none of them turned up either in Lefortovo,  Butyrki or Matrosskaya Tishina prisons. Hence the question --  which side the hired killers-snipers were from?".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the Crimean issue and  Ukrainian- Russian talks:    "Despite the optimism with which some participants in the  Moscow meeting spoke about the positions of the sides drawing  closer together, the talks ended in failure, since from the very  outset the Ukrainian side manifested a desire to resolve  domestic problems at the expense of neighbours, as was the case  during the talks on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine".    PRAVDA on the same subject: "One still feels that it is  beneficial for certain forces in Ukraine to maintain a  heightened interest in the Crimea".    The newspaper quotes the Ukrainian publication NEZAVISIMOST,  which shares the Rukh movement sentiments, as writing as  follows: `The outcome of presidential elections, just as the  future of Ukraine and the Crimea, is at stake. Leonid Kravchuk  would either be out of reach for competitors, or he would lose  the elections completely long before June 26'.    ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA analyses the recently issued six  presidential decrees:    "Unfortunately we must note that upon the cancellation of  quotas and licences which are taken stock of by means of  computers, we shall have to rely fully on the strict observance  of rules by customs personnel and on their integrity. Will that  work?"</p>

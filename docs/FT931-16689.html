			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Equity issues in Canada raised CDollars 13bn last year DESPITE the recession and a sluggish stock market, equity issues in Canada raised more than CDollars 13bn (USDollars 10bn) last year, compared with CDollars 8.9bn in 1991. The 1992 total included CDollars 11.8bn in common share issues, including both primary and secondary financings. The oil and gas sector was most active, because of increasing exploration and development, and other resource sectors were also busy. Privatisation accounted for one large financing, a CDollars 850m issue of Nova Scotia Power shares. For the first nine months, new issues totalled CDollars 5.1bn against CDollars 5.7bn a year earlier, the Investment Dealers Association of Canada said. Underwriting revenues ran higher for brokers and the large investment bankers. RBC Dominion Securities led the field in underwriting.</p>

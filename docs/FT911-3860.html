			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Observer: Hard tug One person who won't be at today's annual general meeting of National Westminster Bank - although he probably should be - is John Tugwell who has been handed the unhappy job of sorting out NatWest Bancorp. He is the one banker who knows how bad things really are at NatWest's problematic US subsidiary. Then again, since he arrived in New York less than a fortnight ago and only five days before NatWest Bancorp revealed it lost Dollars 191m in the first quarter, perhaps his absence can be excused. Even by US banking standards NatWest Bancorp has been doing pretty badly, and 50-year-old Tugwell says he has been working day and night since he first arrived. He has rented an apartment on Manhattan's East side and is intent on rallying his 7,500 troops by being NatWest's man in the trouble spot. Parachuting Tugwell into the top spot at NatWest Bancorp is a risk both for him and his employer. Having been involved in the 1977-78 acquisition of National Bank of North America, he is closely associated with NatWest's expensive acquisition strategy in the US. With interest rates falling there, the injection of yet more of the parent's capital means Tugwell may be able to stage-manage an impressive turnaround. If he can, then he's well placed to follow in the footsteps of Tom Frost, NatWest's chief executive, who made his name in the US. But if matters take a turn for the worse, Tugwell could face a similar fate to Midland Bank's John Harris. Once viewed as the next chief executive, Harris never recovered from being sent to keep an eye on Midland's disastrous Crocker acquisition in California. Unlike Harris, who had to work alongside a US chief executive, Tugwell has been given sole responsibility for NatWest's US operations. It is make or break time all round.</p>

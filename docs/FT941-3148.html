			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Schroders reveals Pounds 102m inner reserves Schroders, the merchant bank, yesterday revealed for the first time that it has been carrying Pounds 101.6m in inner reserves on its books and said pre-tax profits rose 85 per cent in 1993. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 195.8m, from Pounds 105.7m. The inclusion of the inner reserves forced Schroders to restate its 1992 earnings, raising them slightly. Of 1993 profits, the fund management arm contributed 29 per cent of the total, Pounds 56.8m, up from Pounds 30.2m in 1992. Meanwhile, merchant and investment banking earned Pounds 139m, up from Pounds 75.5m. Despite the sharp rise in revenues, administrative expenses rose 20 per cent to Pounds 272m, most of which reflected increases in salaries and bonuses. Mr Win Bischoff, group chief executive, said Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m had been set aside to cover bonuses for 1993. There was a 50 per cent increase in the 1993 dividend to 16.5p per share. Earnings per share were 109.2p against 54.6p. Schroders, like other European merchant banks, is being forced by an EU directive to detail hidden reserves, traditionally used to smooth profits over the years, and to break down the source of revenues into trading activities and that earned on fees and commissions. 'The hemline is lifted a little bit higher than has been the case in other years,' said Mr George Mallinckrodt, chairman. Analysts point to strong growth in Schroder Investment Management, the fund management division. Total assets under management rose 47 per cent to Pounds 53bn, about 40 per cent of which was outside Britain. Net new cash in 1993 totalled Pounds 6.5bn, a rise of about 15 per cent of 1992 total funds under management, with Pounds 2.7bn of that coming from UK pension funds. Schroders has had particular success in attracting US pension fund assets and is now the largest foreign manager of foreign equities for US institutions. Moreover, since the start of this year, SIM has attracted some Pounds 2bn in new cash. By comparison, Schroders' profits from trading were roughly 13 per cent of the total. This is far below its contribution to other merchant banks which, owing to strong market performance in 1993, earned 25 to 30 per cent of profits from trading. Mr Mallinckrodt said the mix of profits reflected the strategy of concentrating on fee-based businesses rather than capital-intensive activities. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Countries don't go broke The former chairman of Citibank, Walter Wriston, was much scoffed at for saying: 'Countries cannot go broke.' So far as he was defending the massive amounts of credit which the banks extended to Third World countries without proper examination, I have no wish to come to his aid. Governments can and do go broke. The view that they cannot is based on the false supposition that they can and do always raise in taxes what they need to service their debts. Governments are, however, not countries. If the former Citibank chairman's remark is taken literally to apply to countries, it is correct. An organisation is bankrupt, broke or bust - call it what you will - if it cannot meet its debts. Countries cannot go broke or have surpluses or declare profits simply because they are not that kind of entity. I would be astonished if any reader of this column - even if he works in the IMF - has ever lent to a country. He may have written a submission about the desperate plight of Ruritania and argued eloquently for concessionary lending. But to whom have the cheques been written? For the kind of loan of which Mr Wriston was talking it would almost certainly have been a government or state organisation. I have been led to these musings by reflecting on the mundane subject of the British balance of payments and trying to work out what the ultimate differences are between those who see it as a problem and those who do not. I want to go a little beyond the usual statistics and debating tricks on either side. Of course I noticed that those who gleefully wrung their hands in horror at the April UK trade deficit were engaging in the usual short-term trick of going by one-month figures. Of course I noticed that if you look at the right number - that is non-oil visible trade for the first four months of the year - then the deterioration is only some Pounds 1.6bn at an annual rate. The current account deficit so far this year is running at about 1 per cent of GDP, well within the margin of error - a margin skewed towards overestimate. Of course I have been following Clifford Pratten's work which shows that the value of overseas investments is rising sufficiently to offset quite a substantial trade gap. Nor has the famous black hole either in the British or the world balance of payments yet disappeared. The teenagers' guide has been suspended while I have been on a sabbatical. But never fear it is coming back. Nevertheless I look at these numbers mainly to keep my end up. There is no such thing as the 'British balance of payments deficit'. There are merely debts, large or small, wise or unwise, accumulated by individuals, companies, and other organisations, including central and local governments. The concept of a balance of payments problem is a hangover from collectivist economics. If a government is expected to run the whole economy then its debts are the debts of the nation. But once the government is expected mainly to look after its own debts the problem disappears. The only difference between an excessive debt which I owe to a citizen of Yorkshire and to a citizen of Texas is the additional element of exchange risk - which, however important is but one of the many risks involved in all borrowing and lending operations. Therefore, even if I am completely wrong and people like Wynne Godley of Cambridge are completely right in their view of the structural features of the 'British economy', there is still no problem for macroeconomic policy. The government still has several roles. It has some responsibility for the efficiency of the market mechanism. It has to look after its own solvency over several economic cycles. It is responsible for sustaining the value of the currency. At this level of argument it does got matter whether it does so by maintaining the exchange rate against a non-inflationary block, successfully following a domestic monetary target or using some other technique, so long as it looks after its own balance and tightens or loosens monetary policy to minimise inflationary and deflationary disturbances. Unfortunately many of those economists, who would naturally be making such points, are so consumed with hostility to fixed exchange rates, Europe, John Major or the ERM - in whichever form they see the devil - that they use balance of payments figures for debating purposes and make common cause with those who would like a Gosplan to take charge of all the nation's trade. If you believe that the state is a civil association which provides the framework for individuals and groups to carry out their own activities, then there is no room for a balance of payments, only a government budget and an inflation problem.</p>

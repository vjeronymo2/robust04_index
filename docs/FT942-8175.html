			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: The Fed tightens and sets the Dow loose - Wall Street Like the unseasonably wet and blustery weather which struck New York this week, Tuesday's aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve hit Wall Street like a spray of cool rain in the face, awakening the groggy markets with a jolt. Not that the Fed's move was unexpected. On Tuesday morning, when the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee began its meeting, almost everyone was convinced that the policy-making body would vote to approve another increase in interest rates. Yet, even though Wall Street saw it coming, the 50 basis point rise in the federal funds rate to 4.25 per cent and the 50 basis point increase in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent sent a surge of energy through the markets. Minutes after the Fed announced the tightening, a previously becalmed Dow Jones Industrial Average and 30-year government bond were roaring ahead on a wave of buying. By the end of the day, the Dow was up 49 points, and the long bond had climbed two full points, a gain that lowered the yield on the benchmark government issue from 7.44 per cent to 7.26 per cent. To anyone familiar with traditional market economics, this might have seemed a curious reaction. The Fed raised rates for the fourth time in as many months because it felt monetary policy had been overly accommodating for too long. It believed that excessively low interest rates were threatening to provide too much stimulation to the economy, and it was worried that unless rates were raised to slow the pace of economic activity, inflation would begin to revive later in the year. In these circumstances, the stock market might have been expected to react badly to another Fed tightening. Higher interest rates mean more costly borrowing for companies and consumers, slower economic growth and lower corporate profits, and they make other forms of investments more attractive than equities, so stocks usually fall when interest rates go up. As for the Treasury market, the Fed's evident concern about the outlook for inflation would normally alarm investors in instruments that pay a fixed rate of return such as government securities, so a decline in bond prices would have been expected. These, however, were not ordinary circumstances, for two main reasons. First, traders and investors had already priced a monetary tightening into stock and bond prices. This discounting meant that by Tuesday morning, when the FOMC began its meeting, the markets were primed for a rate increase. In particular, they were expecting an increase of half a percentage point in both the fed funds and discount rates. Anything different - a smaller rate increase or no increase at all - and uncertainty about Fed policy would have returned to the markets. In the end, they got exactly what they expected, so prices rallied. Second, the aggressive nature of the Fed's move - 50 basis points on two key interest rates instead of 25 basis points on just one - suggested to investors that it might be the last tightening of monetary policy for some time. This judgment was quickly proved accurate when the Fed, maintaining its new policy of explaining its actions, issued a statement asserting that the rate increases would 'substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993'. In other words, the Fed was saying it had finished tightening for now. This was good news for financial markets, which warmed to the prospect of a summer free from worries about another rate increase. Moreover, among more forward-looking investors, there was plenty of support for the Fed's actions. Inflation is low today because special factors in the US economy, such as rising productivity and excess labour resources, are helping to hold down prices. These disinflationary forces will not last forever, so it makes sense for the Fed to slow the economy down, before it becomes too late to douse the inflation fires. So, where does all of this leave the stock market? Its impressive performance this week - the Dow climbed almost 100 points in the first four days of trading to 3,760 - suggests that the corrective phase of the market cycle, which took the blue-chip average down 9.5 per cent from its February high, is over. A floor of 3,600 has been established, and equities are likely to enter a phase of consolidation, in which share prices rise gradually as investors turn their attention back to economic and earnings fundamentals. This assumes that the correction has also ended in the bond market. But with the 30-year bond yield declining from 7.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent in the past 10 days, it is a relatively safe assumption.  ---------------------------------------- Monday               3671.50  +  11.82 Tuesday              3720.61  +  49.11 Wednesday            3732.89  +  12.28 Thursday             3758.98  +  26.09 Friday               3766.35  +  7.37  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- Rallies have been  continuously held in different places of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea to denounce the Japanese reactionaries'  suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan.    Speakers said at the mass rallies held in Nampo and Wonsan  on  June 20 and 21 that the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves of the  Japanese reactionaries have become all the more heinous of late.  They expressed towering anger and resentment at the Japanese  reactionaries' unjustifiable criminal suppression of Chongnyon,  an authoritative organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK,  and Koreans in Japan.    Noting that there is neither reason nor ground for the  Japanese authorities to take Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as  an object of suppression, they stressed that the Japanese  authorities should protect and treat preferentially the Koreans  in Japan who were forcibly taken to Japan by the Japanese  imperialists and forced to hard toil in the past, and their  descendants, and Chongnyon, an organization of overseas citizens  of the DPRK which is conducting righteous activities to defend  the democratic national rights of the Koreans in Japan and to  promote friendship with the Japanese people.    Saying they could not remain an on-looker to the criminal  deeds of the Japanese reactionaries who have become all the more  undisguised in their suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in  Japan and hostile to the DPRK, working hand in glove with the  United States and the South Korean puppets, they strongly  demanded the Japanese authorities immediately stop the  anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and severely punish the chief  culprits in the recent cases.    They warned that the Japanese authorities should know  clearly  that it is foolish act of throttling themselves to antagonize  the DPRK with a clamor for "sanctions" against the DPRK and  suppress the Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.</p>

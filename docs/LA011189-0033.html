			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CRIME IS DOWN, BUT BLOCK NOT SATISFIED  </P> <P> Crime in Los Angeles County "leveled off at an unacceptable level" in 1988, Los  Angeles Sheriff Sherman Block said Tuesday.  </P> <P> While overall major crime was down about 4% for the year in the area under the  sheriff's jurisdiction, Block noted that aggravated assault increased 10%, auto  theft by 11% and robbery by 7%. There was virtually no change in the number of  murders committed in the area, he added.  </P> <P> The homicide total for 1988 was 284, compared to 286 in 1987.  </P> <P> "The big picture is that crime, particularly violent crime, has pretty much  remained at a high level," Block said. "The community seems to have developed  far too high a tolerance to violence. We seem to accept it as a condition of  life in the big city or whatever."  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Call for review of takeover rules Non-executive members of the Takeover Panel will press for a review of the rules on cash share purchases during hostile takeover bids following the controversial purchase of Lasmo shares during Enterprise Oil's failed bid for the company. 'The question is whether an offeror making an all-paper bid should be allowed to buy 10 per cent of the target's equity for cash in the market. It is not clear that this is in the public interest,' said a panel member. If the cash bid is more attractive than the paper bid, it should not be allowed unless all shareholders have equal opportunity to take advantage of it, he said. The call for the review has been triggered by S . G. Warburg, brokers for Enterprise, which offered some of Lasmo's largest shareholders the chance to sell their shares for cash in the last days of a hostile bid. It bought just under 10 per cent, as allowed by the Takeover Code in such circumstances, but the bid failed by a wide margin. However, the method of the share purchase was highly unusual in a takeover bid. Usually the bidding company's broker will make a general cash offer for shares to the market and purchase them from tenderers on a pro-rata basis. The London Stock Exchange has received a complaint about the deal and a committee will meet today to consider whether Warburg acted properly. Swiss Bank Corporation is said to have been the complainant although a spokesman for SBC would not comment. The complainant is arguing that under Stock Exchange rules pre-existing 'limit orders' lodged with Warburg's market-making arm to sell Lasmo shares to Enterprise should have been satisfied first. This is a 'grey area', according to one marketmaking source. Under Stock Exchange rule 354.8, a marketmaker with an order from a client to sell, say, Lasmo shares at the offer price would have 'the right to declare whether . . . it wishes to participate' in the business being conducted. But it is not clear it would have an obligation to do so. Merchant bankers said the Takeover Panel will eventually have to consider converging its rules with those of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Lex, Page 24</p>

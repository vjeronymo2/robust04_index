			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Pharmaceuticals The rise in Glaxo's share price since Monday is truly astonishing. The stock is up 7 per cent and its market capitalisation by Pounds 1.8bn. The rationale is supposed to be the impact of a provision in Gatt that could extend by 19 months the patent life of Zantac, Glaxo's biggest drug, in the US, its biggest market. The market's euphoria is premature. The Gatt provision allows generic equivalents to be sold during the period if the manufacturers make substantial investments before June 8 next year and if they pay the original manufacturer a licence fee. In any case, the shares' increase is out of proportion to any potential additional revenue, estimated at between Pounds 500m and Pounds 900m. The accompanying, though smaller, rise in other drugs stocks is equally bizarre. Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham are not affected by Gatt, and Zeneca only marginally. Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 3 per cent, may benefit from a limited extension to its largest product's patents. But for most other companies, the benefits, if any, will not be until the next century, well beyond the market's normal time horizon.</p>

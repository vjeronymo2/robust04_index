			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Tec defends payment to director's colliery project A training and enterprise council yesterday defended a payment of Pounds 300,000 to one of its non-executive directors, whose company is re-opening Clipstone Colliery, near Mansfield. Mr Paddy Tipping, MP for Sherwood, said yesterday it had taken him three months to persuade North Nottinghamshire Tec to disclose the details of the payment to RJB Mining to recruit and train about 200 local people who had been unemployed for 12 months or more. He said: 'This is public money. When I originally asked the Tec for details of the payment it refused.' Earlier this month Mr Richard Budge, the new owner of the colliery, became a director of the Tec - some months after he applied for the training grant. The payment comes at a time of public concern about the accountability of non-elected bodies - including Tecs, which administer about Pounds 2bn of public funds for training in England and Wales. Mrs Pat Richards, chief executive of North Nottinghamshire Tec, said yesterday: 'Help of this kind is available to any company seeking to establish an operation in our area - or companies already here - which create jobs for local people.' She said that the Tec had sought to persuade Mr Budge to recruit the long-term unemployed. Some of the recruits were former miners but the training would provide multi-skilled teams in a mine which had employed 800. She said: 'We encourage companies to come to the Tec first when offering new jobs because we want to help the unemployed. All the individuals at the colliery are having training, even those who are former miners.' Mrs Richards said the Tec operated an 'open book policy' for directors - the public could see when grants were received by companies in which the non-executive directors had a direct or indirect interest. She said a number of directors had received grants for in-company training, including the new Investors In People scheme. Mrs Richards said: 'We want to encourage our directors' companies to set a local example.'</p>

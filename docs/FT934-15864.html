			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / BBC ready to scrap Radio 5 THE GOVERNORS of the BBC are set on Monday to approve the creation of a combined news and sports service to replace Radio 5. The announcement will represent a victory for Radio 4 listeners who have campaigned for more than 18 months to stop the loss of Radio 4's long-wave signal to a 24-hour rolling news service. The original plan would have meant that Radio 4 would only have been carried on FM, depriving listeners in areas of poor FM reception. Those who listen to Radio 4 in continental Europe on long-wave would have lost their service. The planned service will be very different from the original rolling news plan. In particular there will be no news magazine programmes such as Today from Radio 4. Instead there will be a very flexible schedule aimed at a younger audience. On the days of major sports events, they will take precedence and when big news stories break they will get most emphasis. The times of news bulletins will be flexible to avoid interrupting the last minutes of a vital game. The service, which will not be called Radio 5, has already been agreed in principle by the BBC's board of management. It will consider a final version of the plan on Monday morning before a formal recommendation goes before the governors later in the day. It is believed that Ms Jenny Abramsky, head of BBC radio news and current affairs, will run the station. At the beginning of this year, senior BBC radio executives were still insisting that it would not be practical to put the news service on Radio 5. Childrens' and schools' programmes now carried on Radio 5 are expected to move to other channels. The compromise solution on Radio 5 fits in with the recent BBC realisation that it may have been over-serving the articulate middle classes and now plans to offer more to the general audience.</p>

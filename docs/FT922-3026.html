			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Keep that junk mail pouring in - Diary of a Private Investor / The postman slways knocks twice for Kevin Goldstein-Jackson 'DEAR Mr Goldstein-Jackson, You have been elected a nominee for a rare honour. I am delighted to be the one to congratulate you on your nomination election for the MOST ADMIRED MAN OF THE DECADE.' Thus began a letter I recently received from the American Biographical Institute, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, which pointed out that 'to be 'most admired' is one of the highest accolades given to an individual'. I had been nominated for the award 'following a vote by inter-continental representatives' of the Institute's Board of International Research who had selected a 'small number of men' for their 'influence, fame or ideas that have had visible impact on professions and communities'. Unfortunately, my nomination had an expiry date of June 12 and to 'certify' my election I would have pay Dollars 195 (Pounds 107) as a 'contribution fee towards all crafting processes' in producing a proclamation 'done in two striking ink colours' plus 'hand lettering' by a 'scribe'. For Dollars 250 I could have, instead, a proclamation 'custom laminated on to Finland birchwood'. I decided not to accept this 'rare' honour in the hope that someone might nominate me for a 'columnist of the year' award, or maybe even a knighthood or a CBE instead. The institute's letter was just one of the many unsolicited junk mail offerings which pour through my letter-box every week. As a private investor who has subscribed to Business Expansion Schemes, bought privatisation-issued shares, holds a number of credit cards and owns a number of insurance policies, as well as being a donor to charity, I appear to be on a considerable number of mailing lists. Somewhat surprisingly, I find much of the junk mail quite entertaining - even the numerous issues from Reader's Digest inviting me to participate in various prize draws. However, it is the financial junk mail that fascinates me the most. Companies still seem to be falling over themselves to lend money to my family. My wife has been offered 'up to Pounds 10,000 to spend as you wish' by RAC personal loans, which offered her a 'free Pounds 30 bonus' if she took out a loan. As an RAC member she 'automatically qualified' for 'competitive terms'. But why would she (or anyone else, for that matter) want to borrow from the RAC at an APR of 29.9 per cent for a loan of up to Pounds 2,500 and 27.9 per cent for loans over Pounds 2,500 when they can probably get, say, an unsecured loan of Pounds 10,000 from Barclays Bank for 23.4 per cent APR? Or  -better still, depending on individual circumstances - pay actual interest of 12.7 per cent by increasing their mortgage with a home-owner loan from Barclays? Why pay high interest rates to lenders which have to charge such rates partly because of their high number of defaulters? Other banks and institutions offer a wide variety of low-cost loans such as Lloyds Gold Service at 15.3 per cent APR. It obviously pays to shop around rather than respond immediately to 'competitive terms' through the mail. One of the benefits of all the financial regulatory organisations is the increased amount of information which approved organisations have to give potential clients. However, they differ widely on how they present certain information. For example, I recently received in the post details of the Norwich Union Supersaver with profits savings plan. This offered 'automatic acceptance for a big cash payout', without the need for a medical and offered a variety of free gifts - ranging from a matching three-piece luggage set to a radio alarm clock. Norwich Union provided a clearly set out table illustrating the effects of early surrender for a variety of age groups and monthly premiums. clear. My wife received a mailshot from Bristol and West about a 10-year endowment savings plan with Eagle Star. The surrender examples were only for males aged 35 and 45 and paying Pounds 15 per month or Pounds 50 a month. The cash amount of surrender value was given, but not the total paid in premiums. For example, it stated that a man aged 35 paying Pounds 50 per month would possibly receive Pounds 3,310 if he surrendered the policy at the end of year five. The reader had to calculate himself how much he would have paid in premiums by that time (Pounds 3,000). Friends Provident, in a recent mailing, offered a 10-year Maxima Savings Plan, and gave just three examples of ages (males aged 25, 40 and 65) and only one example of contributions (an initial Pounds 10 per month) but at least stated the total amount of contributions paid by surrender date. Far too many people are still taking out long-term policies and then finding they either cannot continue with the monthly payments or, perhaps, are persuaded by certain 'advisers' to cash in their policies in favour of another company's product. In some cases this may well be justified by the better financial performance of the new company, but in others it may just be the result of an 'adviser' wanting to gain lucrative commission. Perhaps the 'surrender value' statements for insurance companies should be prefaced by a statement, similar to that required for cigarette advertisements, stating: 'IF YOU STOP YOUR POLICY EARLY YOU COULD LOSE LOTS OF YOUR MONEY.' Personal Equity Plan managers are another source of large amounts of junk mail. Sometimes I wonder why people who only make capital gains from shares of a few thousand pounds a year - well within their tax-free capital gains allowances - bother to take out Peps when, if they had invested such modest sums directly in shares instead they would have achieved tax-free capital gains anyway. True, within a Pep, the dividends are not subject to tax, providing they remain for investment purposes within the plan, but much of this income will be eaten up by the plan's management fee. One area of financial mailshots that I feel ought to be encouraged is promotion of individual companies for investment. I have already received three separate letters from Wellcome concerning its forthcoming offer of shares. It would be nice to receive details of other individual companies which want to increase the numbers of their private shareholders. It ought to be possible for a company to write to me even when it is not having a share offer, pointing out its track record and financial prospects and encouraging me to contact my stockbroker or other suitable adviser to seek advice on buying its shares. If you want to increase the amount of junk mail you receive, you can request a form from the Mailing Preference Service, Freepost 22, London W1E 7EZ and indicate on that form their special interests: financial, sporting, home and leisure, and so on. The service has around 10,000 names on file of people who have asked to receive more junk mail. If you want to receive less junk mail, write to the same address to request its members to remove your name from their mailing lists. Last year, about 95,000 people made such a request but I shall continue to look forward to the post.</p>

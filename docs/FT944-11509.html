			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Fall in US jobless fuels expectations of rate rise The US unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 per cent in October, a four-year low, raising expectations in financial markets that the US Federal Reserve will push up short-term interest rates later this month. Although the monthly increase in jobs was below market expectations, indications of mounting wage pressures prompted a sell-off in US bonds. The 30-year benchmark bond fell by half a point, yielding 8.16 per cent at one stage, its highest level since August 1991. Stocks fell sharply in tandem, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 38.36 at 3,807.52. The dollar was steady, closing in New York at DM1.514 and at Y97.45. The debate over interest rates appears no longer to be about whether the Fed will move. Currency market analysts said it was a question of when rates would be raised, with most expecting an increase to be announced after the Federal open market committee meeting on November 15. The jobs report gave President Bill Clinton an opportunity to highlight the expanding economy as he campaigns ahead of mid-term elections next week. Mr Clinton claimed that more jobs have been created this year than in the previous five. He said the improvement was due to increased productivity, and to the partnership between his administration and business to boost exports. While non-farm job growth in October, as measured by a survey of employers, was 194,000 - less than expected - factory jobs soared by 40,000. The reasons for the continuing discontent among US voters were also reflected in the jobs report. Americans are working longer hours - the factory workweek is averaging 42.1 hours, a level not seen since the end of the second world war. About 7.6m people - 6.1 per cent of the labour force - are working more than one job. However, average hourly earnings soared 0.7 per cent to Dollars 11.24 an hour, twice the increase generally expected. Ms Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labour statistics, said the growth in manufacturing jobs - 200,000 in the past 13 months - reflected 'moderation in job declines' in defence-related industries.

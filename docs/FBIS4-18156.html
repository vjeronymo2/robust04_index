			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Paavo Lipponen: Agriculture Cannot </F> Get Subsidies for All Eternity"]    [Excerpts] That Finland got the right from the European  Union (EU) to pay extra support to agriculture does not also  mean that this is going to be paid for all eternity at the  maximum level. This was stated by Social Democratic Party (SDP)  Chairman Paavo Lipponen in Uusikaupunki and Pietasaari on  Saturday [12 March].    He was evasive as to whether the SDP should participate in  drafting new legislation and the appropriation bills that might  be needed. [passage omitted]    Lipponen repeated his proposal that the computations for  farm  subsidies should be determined in the same way as in the  national wage talks, namely, by a group representing all  interests, including the taxpayers and consumers.    According to Lipponen, the EU agreement's agricultural  policies correspond in central points to goals of the SDP. The  SDP saw that an immediate conversion to EU producer prices would  be more advantageous than a gradual price reduction (ACA  [expansion unknown]) that the government was seeking.    Lipponen asserted that the Center Party and Farmers  Association (MTK) wanted to have a gradual reduction so that it  would be possible to conceal the enormous price subsidies to the  farmers and to that part of the food-processing industry owned  by the farmers. "Now all this will be more transparent, and  therefore the calculations regarding budget costs have shocked  so many," he said.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reduced loss at Appld Holographics Improved control of overheads and other costs enabled Applied Holographics to cut interim losses from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 681,000 pre-tax. Within the results of this USM-quoted designer and producer of holograms, the UK holographic activities were profitable while the foil activities of TAPF suffered a loss as did the US operations. For the rest of the year the company said that holographic turnover and gross contributions would be significantly higher but added that it would be foolish to predict higher levels of trading across the group. Turnover for the six months to September 30 was static at Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 2.47m). The pre-tax figure was struck after net interest charges of Pounds 34,000, compared with income of Pounds 75,000. Losses per share came out at 4.5p (8.7p).</p>

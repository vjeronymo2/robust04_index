"To Ukraine's honour, it has no mounting debts concerning  payments for oil since September 1, last year. Only  pre-September debts remain to be settled," Shafranik said,  pointing out that a joint scheme is being worked out to enable  Ukraine to repay debts on time.    Touching upon Ukraine's default of payment for gas, the  Russian minister said "we have to take measures with regard to  Ukraine just as to any other user. It is a question of  responsibility between the user and supplier, not an  exacerbation of inter-state relations."</p>

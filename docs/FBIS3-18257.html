			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Speaking after meeting Cypriot Foreign Minister  Alekos Mikhailidhis in Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel said he cannot make promises on a solution to the Cyprus  problem because they would be empty. He said that as the German  foreign minister, he cannot resolve the problem alone. The only  thing he can do, he said, is support Cyprus in every way and try  to help.    The German foreign minister said that in every talk he has  with the Turkish friends, as he referred to them, he raises the  Cyprus issue. He added, however, that he is in no position to  dictate a solution to the Turkish side.    Referring to the effect that the promotion of Cyprus'  European Union membership application will have on a solution,  Kinkel said he understands the Cypriot position but said he is  reserved and careful. He added that he will raise the issue in  Brussels.    Mikhailidhis said he was satisfied with his meeting with  Kinkel, although no definite answers were given. Mikhailidhis  will meet former German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher  today.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BABY FOUND SAFE IN SEWER AFTER MOTHER STRUCK BY CAR  </P> <P> A 10-month-old girl apparently spent two nights in a sewer pipe near the  Mexican border after her mother was hit by a car while crossing Interstate 5  with a group of about 20 illegal aliens, police said Sunday.  </P> <P> The child, wrapped in a yellow blanket, was being carried by another member of  the group, but apparently was abandoned after her mother, Onecima Lopez, 30,  was struck Friday evening by a hit-and-run driver, police said.  </P> <P> "She thought they were going to deliver her daughter to a relative in Los  Angeles, but they didn't," said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego  Police Department. "We don't know why the child was abandoned."  </P> <P> Lopez's companions apparently continued north, leaving her near the highway and  placing the baby in the sewer pipe nearby, Robinson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Group Member Killed  </P> <P> Another member of the group, Antonio Mendez, 54, was struck and killed by the  same car that hit Lopez, Young said. The identity of the driver is not known  and the vehicle, which was southbound on the freeway, was described only as  red, Young said.  </P> <P> Lopez suffered two broken legs, but managed to crawl to a highway over-crossing  at Dairy Mart Road after she was struck and spent Friday night under the  structure, according to Officer Randy Young of the California Highway Patrol.  She was found Saturday morning by a passer-by.  </P> <P> But her daughter, Sandra, was not found until Sunday morning, by another group  of aliens making their way north. They took the child and some formula that had  been placed nearby and flagged down a passing cabdriver, who delivered the baby  to the police station on San Ysidro Boulevard, Robinson said. Police officers  fed the child some formula and rushed her to Scripps Hospital in Chula Vista,  where doctors found her dehydrated but in remarkably good condition.  </P> <P> Lopez was in fair condition in the hospital's intensive care unit Sunday and  was expected to undergo surgery today, according to Judy Casto, nursing  supervisor. Casto said Lopez had a joyous reunion Sunday with her daughter, who  was later transferred to Children's Hospital, where she was to be observed for  a day or two.  </P> <P> CHP officers had searched for the child Saturday after Lopez contacted her  relatives in Los Angeles and learned that the baby had not arrived, but were  unable to find her, police said.  </P> <P> After the baby was located Sunday morning, police showed Lopez a snapshot of  the child and she identified it as hers, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The case will be turned over to immigration authorities, who must decide  whether to deport Lopez and her child, who are from the state of Michoacan in  the interior of Mexico.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increasing Problem  </P> <P> The incident also points up the increasingly serious problem of illegal aliens  who are maimed or killed as they dash across border-area highways at night. The  traffic accidents have become a top priority with the CHP, which reports  several such deaths each month. A record 10 deaths of undocumented aliens  occurred in October.  </P> <P> While most border cities have similar problems, the situation in the San Diego  area is particularly serious.  </P> <P> The large number of pedestrians who cross the border near San Diego, and the  major California freeway systems that run to the Mexican border, combine to  cause an unusually high death and injury rate. Many of the cases are  hit-and-run incidents in which the drivers are never located, police say.  Sometimes the bodies are so badly mangled that the victims are never  identified.  </P></p>

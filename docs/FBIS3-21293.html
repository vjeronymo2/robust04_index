			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. M.: "1993: 20 Percent Inflation"] </F>   [Text] The 1993 inflation rate was estimated at 20 percent.  This figure was disclosed yesterday by the minister-delegate to  the budget at a meeting held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Note, however, that Mr. Brahiti stressed the provisional  nature of this figure. Thus, 1993 inflation was estimated on the  basis of incomplete data supplied by the National Statistics  Office and the National Plan Committee. This 20-percent  inflation rate should be compared with the 32 percent officially  reported in 1992.    As for the current year, Mr. Brahiti stated that inflation  is  expected to run to 25 percent. Thus, in current dinars[DA], a  strong increase of the gross domestic product [GDP] is expected  in 1994 (DA1,300 billion compared with DA1,089 billion in 1993),  whereas in constant dinars (taking inflation into account) we  have stagnation.    Still in 1994, public expenditures (DA535.3 billion) will  increase by 11.1 percent, "i.e., at a rate much slower than the  expected inflation." Public revenues, for their part, will  amount to DA410 billion. According to the minister-delegate to  the budget, the budget deficit of DA125.3 billion represents  "9.6 percent of the GDP, or 3.8 percent if we exclude the  business reorganization fund."    "This deficit, which is much lower than the 1993 deficit,"  Mr. Brahiti said, "must be assessed in relation to the State  efforts, in particular for price and income support and business  financial reorganization, as these efforts alone will continue  to account for close to DA118 billion, i.e., 94 percent of the  deficit."</p>

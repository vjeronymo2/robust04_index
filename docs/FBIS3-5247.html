Your life is priceless and your initiative is fine to build  the nation and country toward prosperity in all fields,  especially to achieve national reconciliation and reinforce  peace and political stability for the beloved Cambodian  motherland.    On behalf of the RGC, we pledge to pursue your advice and  are  determined to sacrifice all our physical and moral efforts to  following Your Majesty in building the Kingdom of Cambodia  toward prosperity.    Moreover, on behalf of the RGC and the Cambodian people of  all strata, we pray that the Triple Jewels and all sacred things  the world over, such as charisma of previous Cambodian kings and  goddesses protecting the royal parasol, protect Your Majesty.  May you enjoy the five blessings of Lord Buddha; that is,  longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and  enlightenment. Especially, may you recover quickly from your  illness and have a long life so you can return and stay as the  support for your beloved children and carry on your noble  mission of leading the Cambodian motherland toward security,  peace, and social progress.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 3 March 1994    [Signed] First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh; Second  Prime Minister Hun Sen</p>

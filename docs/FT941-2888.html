			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rentokil shares slip despite rise to Pounds 147m Shares in Rentokil slipped by 7 1/2 p to 248 1/2 p in spite of the environmental and property services company maintaining its 11-year record of compound growth in profits and earnings in excess of 20 per cent. Rentokil's pre-tax profits increased by 20.1 per cent to Pounds 147m in the year to December 31, while sales increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 600m. Currency movements depressed the profits figure by Pounds 1.2m. The group said good organic growth in North America, Asia and the UK had offset lower growth in Europe. Securiguard, the security group bought for Pounds 76m after a hostile bid battle last July, contributed sales of Pounds 86.3m and profit after interest of Pounds 3.3m. Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said: 'The business has proved at least as good as we thought at the time we bought it, in some cases better.' Mr Thompson said Rentokil's strategy, in the medium to long-term, was to move improve Securiguard's low profit margins by providing better levels of service. He said: 'Our view is that security in future will require higher levels of quality - and customers will be more concerned with quality than price, although price is always important.' Securiguard was making a profit margin of 5-6 per cent at the time of acquisition, a margin which Mr Thompson said should be capable of being lifted into the teens, although not above 20 per cent. He said the group's US tropical plants business was making margins of 5-8 per cent at the time of its acquisition in 1988, and was now making 20 per cent. Rentokil set up an acquisition provision of Pounds 6.8m to cover redundancy and reorganisation at Securiguard, of which it had utilised Pounds 1.3m by the year-end. Year-end net cash fell from Pounds 60.2m to Pounds 15.6m after Pounds 102.6m had been spent on acquisitions. Earnings per share grew by 21 per cent to 8.02p (9.71p). A final dividend of 2.01p gives a total for the year of 2.85p (2.31p), an increase of 23 per cent. COMMENT Analysts were pleasantly surprised by the size of Securiguard's contribution, but the fact that results were in line with forecasts meant the rest of the group had performed slightly below expectations. The size of the Securiguard provision also raised eyebrows, and there is scepticism over how much profits can be lifted in the security business. These specific grouses betray a deeper unease that Rentokil's wonder growth story will be harder to sustain as a FTSE-100 company. Doubters point out that Rentokil's 36 per cent premium rating is maintained solely by the earnings story - the yield is low and the group has net assets of only Pounds 109m, compared with its market capitalisation of Pounds 2.4bn. The shares have had a good run since the year-end, and could suffer further profit-taking.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IT'S NOT I. MAGNIN'S KIND OF TOWN  </P> <P> Retailer I. Magnin, announcing the closing of its Oakbrook Center store in  February, says it will end its 19-year stay in the Chicago area.  </P> <P> Brent McDaneld, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based chain, said the 134  employees at Oakbrook were told last Friday about the closing.  </P> <P> He said talks were also under way to move out of I. Magnin's locations at  Northbrook Court and on North Michigan Avenue.  </P> <P> All three locations are in upscale shopping areas. I. Magnin's market share has  declined during the last 10 years due to recent additions, such as  Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus and efforts by Marshall Field to attract more  upscale clientele.  </P> <P> McDaneld said I. Magnin, a unit of R. H. Macy Co., will stick to the West  Coast.  </P></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: IBM steps up battle for mid-range market International Business Machines yesterday fired the latest salvo in the battle for the important mid-range computer market. It launched the latest version of its AS/400 mid-range computer family with the claim that the machines have an important role in the increasingly popular client-server computing systems. The market for mid-range machines is important to IBM as it struggles to regain satisfactory profitability after three years of losses. The mainframe computer business is no longer growing as customers shift to smaller, cheaper computers of equivalent power. IBM has reversed its declining market share in personal computers, but margins there are narrow. However, the company has held a strong position in the mid-range through its System/34 and System/38 computer families. This is a potentially large market as customers trade up from PC systems or trade down from mainframes. A mid-range machine is frequently the first computer many medium-sized companies buy. IBM's mid-range success was maintained by the launch of the first version of the AS/400, three years ago, a computer derived from the System/38. It has sold more than 250,000 systems. However, the AS/400 retained a number of idiosyncratic features including a special operating system and a closed structure which raised question marks about its prospects. Yesterday's launch showed that IBM has rethought the hardware and the software of the AS/400. It will be able to run AS/400 programs, Unix (open system) programs or OS/2 (PC) programs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr -- Trends in the development of the  CIS clearly show that processes within the CIS member states are  geared to creating steadily greater supranational features in  the commonwealth and removing unjustified barriers to economic  and cultural ties. This was stated by Sergey Filatov, head of  the Russian Federation president's administration, at the  opening of an international conference on "Legal problems and  information aspects of creating a single economic space within  the CIS."    The main aim of the forum which opened today is to  standardize legislation in the independent states of the former  USSR to the greatest degree possible, in order to create a  single economic space within the CIS, but without harming their  individual sovereignty in any way. The conference is being  attended by delegations from all the commonwealth member states,  the Baltic states and representatives of the European Community.    Vladimir Shumeyko, Chairman of the Interparliamentary  Assembly of the CIS Member Countries, is taking part in its work.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin have sent greetings to the conference, which will  last two days.</p>

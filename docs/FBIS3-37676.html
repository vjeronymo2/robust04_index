Security Council consultations held at the  initiative of Russia on Sunday evening.    U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright said that the  United States has just received good news from Sarajevo.  Everything looks well for the time being. The U.S. will  continue to watch very attentively to get convinced in the next  few days that the NATO ultimatum is being fulfilled.    The United States is also very satisfied, Albright  continued,  that Russian troops intend to participate in the U.N. Protection  Force and believes that a role to be played by Russians will be  very useful.    Russian permanent representative to the U.N. Yuliy Vorontsov  said: "The Russian Federation called for this Security Council  meeting because it was worried during the day that snow would  prevent UNPROFOR from taking weapons left by Serbs under its  control.    "It looked at some moment that UNPROFOR cannot find these  weapons in snow. That was a technical problem which disturbed  us very much. Then, we received a report from Akashi that he  intends to take these weapons under UNPROFOR's control, and  there is no need for air strikes at this stage. This was good  news."</p>

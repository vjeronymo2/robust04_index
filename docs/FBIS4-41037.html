			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Election speech by presidential candidate Volodymyr </F> Lanovyy; from the "Ahead of the presidential election" program;  place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Esteemed compatriots, my dear Ukrainians: This is  an historic moment. We are choosing the way for us to move  forward. We are deciding the fate of our country in the very  near future and after.    Our country, whose independence was secured by scores of  generations of our compatriots in suffering, has not yet become  our homeland as we had hoped. The state is actually in debt to  our people and this debt is mounting up, rather than going down.  We know that we are owed in terms of our bank deposits, in  terms of payments for agricultural produce, and in terms of  (?our bonds). We are in fact being deprived of the right to  work worthily to produce goods, to be able to feed our children  and elderly, and after many years of work to keep our money in  savings. Citizens today, unfortunately, are being deprived of  the possibility to receive adequate medical treatment, to study,  and to be provided with the bare essentials. Our work is still  being paid for by monetary substitutes, rather than money. The  laws on paying wages, pensions and grants are de facto being  violated in our state. The state is not providing full and  timely financial support for our country's invalids, servicemen,  and orphans. Country people are not being paid in time. All  these are our country's and our state's debts to our people.    People are dreaming about their own enterprises. They are  waiting for what they were promised. Meanwhile, money, foreign  currency, and some of the most valuable assets are being taken  away from enterprises.    The state of the peasantry, this basis of our country, is  particularly poor. Today, they do not even have the right to  their own plot of land where their fathers and grandfathers  lived. The inactivity of state law enforcement agencies is  provoking among people mistrust in the authorities and  uncertainty in the morrow, which will lead to social instability.    Today we need strong power and a well-chartered course,  which  would lead us to normalizing the situation in the midst of our  country and putting an end to social, political, and regional  conflicts.    What I am planning to do is this: We need to bring in the  principle of social justice in society, which is the main thing,  and to make the economy effective for the sake of our people's  well-being. People must be able to work freely and earn what  they have earned, while the state must make adequate financial  provision for those unable to work. Our task, in fact, is to  restore our production, curb the crisis, and stabilize prices,  wages, and money. Everything should be done for enterprises to  work and be profitable.    To that end, we will above all expand enterprises' rights,  cut taxes, and provide broad opportunities for them to trade and  export their products, given the mandatory return of the foreign  currency earned to our Ukraine. We must also create conditions  that guarantee trade and settlements with Russia in order for us  to implement joint projects together, thus providing additional  contracts for our enterprises. By means of steps such as these,  it will be possible in as short a time as 10 months to stabilize  our prices, considerably increase budgetary revenues, cut credit  interest rates, and (?consolidate) our currency.    It is, however, impossible to pull out of the crisis without  improving the state of affairs in agriculture. We must by all  means turn our attention to the peasantry and create conditions  for them to work. With this aim, there should be stable prices,  payment for produce should be guaranteed, every service required  by the peasantry should be provided for them,and we should make  everybody the master of their land and the master of their  farms. Their right of ownership of their money incomes should  be protected and their bank deposits guaranteed so that the  peasantry can accumulate their wealth and their property and be  certain about their future.    Overcoming the crisis will make it possible, in my view, in  as short a time as one year to raise average wages and pensions  by four- to five-fold. It is only then that we will see some  return in work by the people and respect for our state.    In the first few weeks of my presidential rule, I will  return  to the people what the state owes them. We will compensate them  for their losses from the devaluation of their money in bank  savings. The people will be given real and equal rights in  privatizing enterprises and will then have additional incomes  from owning these enterprises.    We will enhance the value of morality in our society and  begin by changing our attitude toward children, invalids, women,  and elderly, i.e. those unable to protect themselves. To that  end, we will introduce new forms of social benefits by  increasing budgetary revenues. Primarily, it will be monthly  payments for every child until it reaches the age of 17.  Second, we will provide special medicines and ecologically safe  products for those who suffered as the result of Chernobyl or  who live in contaminated areas. Third, we will increase  pensions in real terms in order to compensate the people in full  for their health that has deteriorated, or the life that has  been lost. The state will also provide all invalids with social  (?security), which is our moral duty. We will create normal  conditions for invalids to live and communicate properly and  actively.    None of this can be achieved without reforming state power.  This primarily applies to the president of Ukraine. He will be  entirely responsible for the state of affairs in our country and  for actions by executive power. We have had enough of shifting  responsibility on to the premier.    We will also carry out a judicial reform and form a  judicial power (?which) would ensure that law is implemented in  society and would supervise both the president and the Supreme  Council and other establishments.    The division of power, awaited by all of us, must take place  at national, regional, and local levels. Regions must be given  the right to settle social and economic issues on their  territory independently; with this aim they must have a stable  budgetary basis and taxation, and regulate on their territory  both the production and investment types of activity.    We will resolve the issue of political and economic powers  with the Republic of Crimea in order to enable Crimea's  population to live a rich and free life in our country, at the  same time as ensuring the constancy of its borders and the  integrity of its territory. We believe that a system of local  self-government should allow people democratically to influence  their life, for the land that is being distributed regionally  and locally out there, and for the communal property and funds  to be used for the needs of the people that live there [sentence  as heard].    Russian, Tartar, Polish, and German people and other  nationalities will live in our country, being proud of their  Ukrainian citizenship.    I am certain that the only way for us is to become a rich  European state. I believe in the Ukrainian people's power and  strength. We know what we want. So let us take hold of this  and decide our future ourselves.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Bentsen fends off healthcare attack The Clinton administration counter-attacked yesterday as it sought to rebound from a setback to the credibility of its healthcare reform plan. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, dismissed worries that the Clinton plan had been dealt a fatal blow by Tuesday's report from the independent Congressional Budget Office. That suggested that, far from reducing the federal budget deficit by Dollars 59bn over the next six years, it would increase it by Dollars 74bn. Mr Bentsen pointed to the study's calculation that the Clinton proposals would lower the US's overall health spending by Dollars 30bn in the year 2000 and by Dollars 150bn in 2004, and its conclusion that the reform would reduce the budget deficit in the long term, though not until 2004. 'The report. . . . proves we can guarantee all Americans private health insurance coverage by the year 2000, and at the same time reduce what we spend on health care overall,' Mr Bentsen told the Senate budget committee yesterday. If Congress accepts the CBO's calculations of the effect on the deficit, however, it might compel the administration to introduce more controversial taxes as part of its reform package. At the moment, the only significant tax increase in the plan is a quadrupling of the cigarette tax to 99 cents a pack. Underlying the CBO's analysis is the conviction that the health care system urgently needs some kind of reform. 'The inherent uncertainties of change must be weighed against the detrimental consequences of the current system - increasing numbers of people who lack the security of insurance coverage for healthcare and the rapidly rising costs of that care,' the report says. The CBO also rebuts fears that the Clinton reform would severely disrupt the US economy, although it notes that the effects on individual businesses and people could be large. Although the CBO suggests the plan could reduce overall employment by between  1/4 and 1 per cent, this would not, however, result so much from small businesses shedding workers because they could not afford their mandatory health insurance, as from workers retiring early because they no longer needed a job in order to keep their health insurance. Overall, businesses would end up paying about Dollars 90bn (Pounds 60bn) less for health insurance in 2004 than they would if the current system continued, the CBO said, and the Clinton reform plan would have little appreciable effect on the US trade balance.</p>

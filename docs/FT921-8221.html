			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Hungary keeps tight rein on inflation HUNGARY'S rate of inflation fell 4 per cent last month to take the annual rate below the psychologically important 30 per cent level for the first time since July 1990, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The rise in the January consumer price index to a level 28.2 per cent above the year-earlier figure was partly technical as the effects of subsidy cuts, price liberalisation and the rise in Soviet energy prices to world levels fell out of the statistics. The last consumer subsidies, excluding public transport, were abolished in the 1992 budget. Downward pressure on inflation was also helped by appreciation of the forint, the national currency, which increased competition from imports in the domestic market at the expense of domestic production and employment. Inflation is now well below the peak of 38.6 per cent recorded last June and on target for the year-end official forecast of about 15 per cent. In a further confirmation of the downward trend, producer prices rose an annualised 6.1 per cent in the six months to November 1991. The National Bank of Hungary has made lower inflation its priority after concentrating on strengthening the balance of payments in 1991.</p>

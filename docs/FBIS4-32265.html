			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 22 (CTK) -- The World Bank, which  sharply opposed the Czech-invented method of coupon  privatisation four years ago, has now been pushing for the  scheme's export, and is ready to finance its implementation, the  independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES writes today. Coupon  privatisation was launched in the former Czechoslovakia in 1992  when the first wave was held. Currently the second wave is  under way in the Czech Republic, while Slovakia has been  preparing for it and may launch it in the autumn. It is  estimated that by the time the second wave ends property worth  350 billion crowns (about $11.7 billion) will have been in  private hands, the paper writes.    Recently Premier Vaclav Klaus said coupon privatisation  would  end by the year's end after which other privatisation methods  would be applied. Property worth a total of 950 billion crowns  is to be privatised in the Czech Republic.    Dusan Triska, one of the authors of coupon privatisation,  said yesterday that the owner of "the intangible side of the  project of coupon privatisation" was the Czech Government which  would have agree to the possible export of the scheme. (Two  other co-authors of the scheme are Premier Vaclav Klaus and the  former chairman of the National Property Fund, Tomas Jezek.)    Triska said that Czech experts had already played a role in  the creation of the privatisation law in Bulgaria, and therefore  it was very probable that the Czech model would be maximally  applied there.    The concrete deal would probably be concluded by Podnik  vypocetni techniky (Computer Technology Centre) and a partner  business company from Bulgaria, and it would be financed by the  World Bank, Triska said. He said that Czech experts have  already been advising the Governments of Kazakhstan, Slovenia,  and Latvia on how best to apply the Czech method in their  countries' conditions.    Interest in Czech coupon privatisation as it has been  implemented in the Czech Republic has also been shown by  Algeria. Czech experts will go to Algeria to assess along with  their Algerian colleagues possibilities of applying the scheme  there, Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik announced at a  recent international economic forum in Crans-Montana,  Switzerland.    But Triska is quoted by MLADA FRONTA DNES as saying that the  Czech model could be exported only partially because it was  closely connected with concrete personalities and because it was  being born in concrete political, economic and legal conditions  of Czechoslovakia.    That is also why Czech experts have recently recommended to  the Latvian Government to make certain changes in the  implementation of the Czech model.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dao Heng parent wins contest to buy OTB GUOCCO Group, which owns Dao Heng Bank, yesterday emerged as the victor in the contest to acquire Overseas Trust Bank (OTB), which has been under Hong Kong government administration since 1985. Analysts in Hong Kong expect the sale price to be in the vicinity of HKDollars 4bn (USDollars 516m). Mr Michael Cartland, the colony's secretary for financial services, said Guocco had agreed to pay HKDollars 420m in excess of the OTB's net assets, which are being assessed. In the year to June 1992 OTB made net profit of HKDollars 353m, up 70 per cent on the HKDollars 210m to the end of June 1991. Hong Kong's banking industry is among the most profitable in the world. Among the many barriers to entry, the high cost of land is the main one which makes expansion of a retail banking network extremely expensive. With the acquisition of OTB, Dao Heng's branch network in the colony will double. It will leave Guocco's enlarged banking group ranking third in terms of branches and capital base among locally-incorporated banks, and fifth in terms of total assets. Mr Werner Makowski, managing director of Guocco, described the acquisition as 'a wonderful deal'. The acquisition would substantially increase the banking group's capitalisation and give it a solid foundation for expansion, he said. Guocco will finance the acquisition from internal resources and external loan finance. Mr Makowski said Guocco's aimed to seek a separate listing for its banking interests, probably later this year. OTB was rescued by the HK government in 1985 after investigators discovered widespread fraud and false loans totalling USDollars 70m. During its administration, the government subscribed to about HKDollars 2bn in additional capital to keep the bank solvent. Since 1988, OTB has traded profitably at an operational level, but at the end of June last year its accumulated losses are thought to have been about HKDollars 2bn. Guocco has undertaken to maintain OTB as a separate bank for two years, after which it is free to merge it with Dao Heng.</p>

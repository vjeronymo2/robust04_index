			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / S Korea's industry giants pick their core businesses MOST OF South Korea's largest chaebol, the highly diversified conglomerates which dominate the country's economy, have selected the three subsidiaries which they will develop as core businesses under a government plan to increase industrial specialisation and international competitiveness. In submissions to the Office of Bank Supervision and Exchange - the government banking watchdog - which were released yesterday, all but six of the conglomerates nominated their three 'core' business groups. The selected subsidiaries will be freed from restrictions on bank lending which were imposed on the chaebol in 1984 and which were aimed at limiting economic concentration. The six which have not yet selected core businesses have had the deadline extended from last weekend until the end of this month. The selections have raised concerns about overlapping investments and fierce competition in several industrial sectors. Many of the chaebol have chosen subsidiaries from the same industries for specialisation. Twelve of the 30 conglomerates, for example, have selected petrochemicals. Cars and electronics were also common choices. The new policy, which will be implemented from June 1, is intended to increase specialisation among Korea's business giants by providing credit incentives to concentrate on a smaller number of activities. The government argues that more focused investment in technology and productivity is needed to increase Korean competitiveness in international markets. Chaebol subsidiary companies other than the three selected will see existing credit controls tightened. The Ministry of Finance said the government was deciding how to apply the squeeze. While the chaebol oppose the existing policy of credit constraints, they have strongly criticised the government's moves to make them specialise. A statement by the Federation of Korean Industry, which represents the large business groups, compared the new policy to a lottery. Most industry observers believe it will be difficult for the government to enforce the policy and, in particular,to prevent funds flowing from selected group companies to other subsidiaries. There were few surprises in the subsidiaries selected by the various companies. Samsung Group, the largest of the conglomerates, which last year recorded sales of Dollars 43.4bn (Pounds 24.2bn), selected Samsung Electronics, Samsung Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries and Samsung General Chemical as its core businesses. Hyundai Group, the second biggest conglomerate, and Lucky Goldstar, the third biggest, also selected petrochemicals as one of their choices. Daewoo Group, the fourth largest chaebol, did not select Daewoo Motors, its 50-50 joint venture with General Motors of the US. But it did select Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy machinery, which will soon start to manufacture mini-cars. As well as free access to bank credit, the companies chosen will have restrictions on real estate purchases lifted.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BIGGEST GROUPS AND THEIR SELECTED COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Group                  Selected subsidiaries  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

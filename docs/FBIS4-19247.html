			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belgian blue helmets in Rwanda are to be pulled  out. Foreign Minister Willy Claes announced the decision just  after the religious ceremony that took place this morning in  honor of the 10 blue helmets killed in Rwanda. Willy Claes:    [Begin recording] [Claes] We have decided once and for all  to  withdraw Belgian troops from the UN contingent. We have made  this decision for two reasons: The first is that, on the basis  of undeniable facts that are confirmed to us every hour by our  diplomats and our soldiers in Rwanda, this UN peacekeeping  mission, as defined in tempore non suspecto by the UN Security  Council, no longer has any sense; moreover, in spite of the  presence of the UN force, we did not manage to prevent the  murder of tens of thousands of people. The second reason is  that, considering the anti-Belgian climate, whatever his  excellency the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels might say, there  is such an anti-Belgian climate, that we cannot take the  responsibility for asking our soldiers to take extra risks.    [Correspondent Jean-Michel Moestart] Can one conclude from  the Belgian decision that if the UN Security Council were to  give the green light tonight, our blue helmets would leave  Rwanda at the same time as the Belgian para-commandos deployed  for the evacuation operation?    [Claes] No, we are not making any link between our Belgian  blue helmets and the Belgian paras. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Calderburn holds steady CALDERBURN, the office furniture manufacturer formed by the merger in July 1991 of Alan Cooper Holdings and Mayfield, yesterday announced pre-tax profits marginally higher at Pounds 2.83m compared with Pounds 2.77m, for 1992. Gross margins increased from 9 per cent to 10.6 per cent on turnover down from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 26m. Net interest receivable fell to Pounds 68,000 (Pounds 178,000). The figures were prepared under FRS 3 standards. The recommended final dividend is 4.9p maintaining the total at 7.7p, although this is not covered by earnings of 7.4p (8.1p). The group's Cooper Dauphin office furniture design, manufacturing and marketing subsidiary, saw a 10 per cent dip in sales from Pounds 21.7m in 1991 to Pounds 19.7m this time. Unit Press, the office furniture engineering components subsidiary, also saw a 12.4 per cent reduction in sales to Pounds 7.65m (Pounds 8.6m). The subsidiary had been successful in opening up new markets in Germany with its largest customer Dauphin, which is also an investor in the group. The results were in line with expectations as the group continued to benefit from its 1991 merger, analysts said. The company had done well considering the difficult market.</p>

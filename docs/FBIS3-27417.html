It quoted an unidentified "high-ranking Russian official" as  saying that "given the wish, it is possible to spotlight  American diplomats working for the CIA and Russians  collaborating with the secret service."    The U.S. Government has instituted judicial proceedings  against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the CIA's Soviet  Counter-Intelligence Branch, and his wife Maria, charging them  with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia.    Ames, 52, a CIA employee for more than 31 years, and his  wife, Maria Del Rosario Casa Ames, 41, a Colombian-born  naturalized U.S. citizen, were arrested on Monday by CIA and FBI  agents.    According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Ames couple  have been spying against the U.S. since 1985 and received more  than 1.5 million U.S. dollars in payoff money and deposited the  money on accounts in U.S. and foreign banks.    The investigation of the case started 10 months ago. U.S.  President Bill Clinton described it as "a very serious case" and  ordered the State Department to lodge an official protest to the  Russian Government.    Yuri Kobaladze, spokesman for the Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service, said on Wednesday that the spy scandal  over the Ames couple might has been revealed to discredit the  success of the Russian foreign policy in resolving the Sarajevo  crisis.    Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karashin stated,  meanwhile, that "much has to be cleared up."    In a statement delivered earlier Wednesday, Russian  Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said, "a return to  the psychology of the Cold War, mounting mistrust, and a new  wave of spy mania would contradict the ideas of international  partnership for peace."</p>

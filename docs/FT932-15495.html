			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Letter: Incredible Sir, I am delighted senior staff in leading accountancy firms should be expressing disbelief at results of psychological tests because the results were 'incredible' ('US female auditors more moral than men, says study', April 7). I remember an occasion when, after taking such a test with one of those firms, I failed to make the short-list for a vacancy I had applied for - an outcome I found equally incredible.

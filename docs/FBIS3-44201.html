Generals who were working in the FAA  General Staff have now been called to the Defense Ministry in a  bid to strengthen the effectiveness of the military [word  indistinct] and put an end to many acts of indiscipline that  have been affecting the combat morale of the Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] government's army. Gustavo  Costa reports from Luanda:    [Begin Costa recording] The recent transfer to the Defense  Ministry of some generals who were only connected with the FAA  General Staff appears to be the first indication that  administrative, organizational, and logistical control is being  restored over the structure that had until now been decoratively  [decorativamente] led by [Defense Minister] Pedro Maria Tonha  "Pedale", allowing the most complete freedom and autonomy to  General Joao de Matos, FAA chief of General Staff. According to  an authorized military source, this is ultimately an attempt to  restore power and authority to the Defense Ministry, which will  now also include generals who had previously served under the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. The  Defense Ministry could now play a more interventionist role in  the definition of the major policies to resolve Angola's  political and military problems, as well as to organize the  government forces.    Some observers believe that the powers of intervention the  Defense Ministry will now enjoy, strengthened by the approval of  its new organizational statutes, is the result of a process of  limiting the FAA General Staff's present powers. According to  independent military sources, the FAA General Staff's methods  have been questioned both by the military and by the very  leadership of the ruling MPLA Party. In view of that, it has  come as no surprise that influential generals have been moved.  They had until then been directly connected with the FAA  General Staff's higher logistical structures, today blamed for  the ostentatious behavior of some officers. In contrast, the  defense sector has always done poorly on the operational front.    UNITA President Jonas Savimbi views the FAA's logistics  sector, which consumes enormous slices of the budget and foreign  exchange cakes, as one of UNITA's principal allies. The alleged  favoring of commercial transactions with enterprises of doubtful  standing supposed to supply various merchandise to the FAA  forces, could also be at the root of the criticism that FAA  General Staff's Logistics Department has often come under. Some  of that department's members and officials are accused of  covering up what in Angola is called the vicious cycle of  planned losses. That cycle appears to have its rotations  numbered, though.    According to a senior Defense Ministry officer, uncontrolled  spending by the FAA General Staff must now be rigorously  accounted for. That source added that, for a start, money  mobility has been curtailed and, in future, FAA management will  be under the control of the Defense Ministry and will have to  abide by its budget restrictions.    Just as a decree could be approved to stem rampant disorder  and indiscipline in public enterprises and state organs, so the  FAA forces and the forces of internal order could henceforth  have to openly or privately acquire merchandise by means of  public bids. That will depend on whether the value of the  merchandise exceeds 100 or 500 million new kwanzas, which at the  current foreign exchange rates corresponds to $1,000 and 5,000,  respectively.

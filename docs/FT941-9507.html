			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Mexican hostage 'to be freed' The Mexican government's peace envoy said yesterday that armed rebels in the southern state of Chiapas would release a former governor of the state, who has been held hostage almost since the 45-day-old uprising began, Reuter reports from San Cristobal de las Casas. Mr Manuel Camacho Sols said that the Zapatista National Liberation Army had agreed to hand over Mr Absalon Castellanos Domnguez tomorrow, in a move that appeared to bring the government and rebels closer to long-awaited peace talks. Mr Castellanos was seized by the rebels on the second day of their new year uprising, in which they captured several Chiapas towns. The former governor and general in the Mexican army has been held by the rebels in one of their hide-outs in the vast Lancondon jungle. The Zapatistas said in a recent communique that he had been tried and convicted of repressing indigenous people and given a life sentence of manual labour. The release appeared linked to an announcement by Mr Camacho on Sunday that the rebels were making the long trek from the jungle to attend peace talks. He gave no indication yesterday when the long-delayed negotiations would begin, but Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal told reporters that the time and date of talks were likely to be learned tomorrow.</p>

Maksimychev: "A Bad Start: First Crisis in </F> Russian-German Relations Becomes Fact"]    [Text] Without a doubt, the end of the Russian troop  withdrawal from FRG territory will begin a fundamentally new  stage in relations between Russia and Germany. It will now,  perhaps, be justifiable to speak of the beginning of these  relations in pure form even, without the factors attendant upon  the presence of our soldiers in a country that never invited  them; factors not altogether insignificant, as is sometimes  perceived from afar. For instance, the presence of Russian  troops in and around Berlin served for a long time as grounds  for delaying the transfer of the government to the German  capital. The petty thievery concentrated around Russian  garrisons created a constant threat of provocation. Also,  throughout the duration of the withdrawal, the temptation  remained for certain political circles in both countries to use  the incomplete status of the withdrawal to serve their own  political goals.    From now on Russian-German relations will be built on the  bona fide national interests of each side, without gifts or  compensation being given for what must be done anyway. This  sound approach will be not only for Russian-German relations. An  approach of this kind will also be predominant in FRG's other  lines of foreign policy with regard to the departure of other  foreign troops from Germany. There is nothing reprehensible  about it. Taking realities into account is entirely normal in  the course of mutual relations between independent and sovereign  states. Reminiscences of the age of the victors and the  vanquished belong to the past. He who has tried to make policy  on the basis of the latter will invariably lose. Becoming  accustomed to the new style of conducting affairs will not be  altogether easy. There is, however, no alternative.    At the same time, it would be a mistake to think that  relations will be built in a vacuum between the new Germany and  the new Russia. No matter how hard one tries to erase from  history the writings of former generations, they will clearly  surface in the texts that replace them. One cannot view  Russian-German relations strictly from 1991 on, as many Russian  politicians would like, or from 1945, as official Bonn does now  with the support of the oppositional Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD]. Nor can a consideration of Russian-German  relations begin from 1941, as is dreamed by the many with a  phobia of Germany, or even from 1914, when an age of  Russian-German cooperation was ended by the catastrophe of the  First World War.    Unfortunately, personal, party, and pre-election interests  frequently overshadow needs common to all of mankind, even at  this critical juncture when the foundation for tomorrow's world  is largely being laid. One can only regret that Russian-German  relations are no exception in this regard. The main question,  and not only for them -whether Russia will be a participant with  equal rights in constructing a Greater Europe, or whether the  West will once again try to quarantine Russia as a second-rate  European power - is being determined on the basis of the past,  not the future. And this is namely how Russian society is  perceiving the now symbolic finale to the Russian troop  withdrawal from German soil at the end of August this year,  although the Russian side has formally assented. In the final  analysis it is not important whether there will be a parade of  departing troops, or whether it is held in Weimar or Berlin, or  even whom the departing soldiers will salute on the honorary  platform. What was and remains paramount is whether an element  of commonality is created at the final farewell ceremony; a  commonality that is, logically, five-fold; i.e., which includes  both the participation of the four powers which have, for almost  a half century, born overall responsibility for Germany, plus  Germany, which henceforth will assume sole responsibility for  itself. Or, will this element of commonality be absent? In other  words, are Europeans finally ready to draw the line on the  period of confrontation, or will they carry on the loathsome and  fruitless bloc mind set, the tyrannical division between the  pure and unpure, and the new, even more painful move to  dismantle a continent?    The way the final farewell in Berlin is being planned for  troops of the four powers would sooner indicate a negative  response. The September 8, 1994 official state act at the  Brandenburg Gates, which will finalize the withdrawal of foreign  troops from Berlin, remains an exclusive event that will involve  the three Western powers and Germany. In spite of all of Bonn's  assurances of the high priority of German-Russian relations,  Russia is being demonstrably excluded from the ranks of those  taking part in the summit meeting. "Friends remain friends;"  under this motto residents of the Berlin region of Shteglits  recently bid farewell to the American battalion under their  patronage. There is apparently a different logic regarding the  Russians.    This marks the onset of a crisis in Russian-German  relations,  virtually even before relations have had a chance to get started  on a new basis. The Russians' understandably wounded self-esteem  will hardly permit them to quickly forget the completely  undeserved disregard shown toward them. If they are being  incriminated for the actions of the Soviet Union during the Cold  War period, then it must not be forgotten that it was namely the  Soviet Union's policy of Perestroika that not only created the  necessary conditions for overcoming the division of Germany, to  which the entire world had long become accustomed, but also  ensured the peaceful and nonviolent reunification of Germany;  including within the framework of the "two plus four" process.  As far as Russia is concerned, the nation scrupulously fulfilled  ahead of time all of its inherited obligations regarding the  withdrawal of troops, although technically speaking, this  operation was, on a technical, organizational and ethical level,  one of the most complex in the history of armed forces.    One must point out the ineptitude demonstrated in the given  situation by diplomatic departments in both countries in their  failure to foresee society's reaction to the development of  events, to obtain timely solutions to the problems which arose,  and to avert the negative effects which could have been  altogether avoided. On the road to the historic reconciliation  between Russians and Germans, which Europe needs, yet another  obstacle has arisen. One can only hope that the corresponding  lessons will be learned from this essentially mirthless episode,  and that both sides will realize the importance of showing  consideration for one's partner and his sensitivities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.V.A.: "The Law on the Census Is Ready, but... </F> Fear of Politicized Count"]    [Text] By the end of the year, the Macedonian Assembly  should present the law on the census. It is a very desirable  deadline so that there will be time left over to be used for  finishing all the preparations for carrying out the census  planned for April 1994.    The text of the law has been prepared, and after its  approval  by the government, it will be submitted to the Assembly; two  phases for this procedure are anticipated.    As everyone knows, only two years after the last census--the  data from which are official--the government is introducing a  new census. The reason for this is that the previous census,  taken in 1991, does not reflect the entire statistical picture  of the country because it was boycotted by the Albanians and  also because of organizational weaknesses in the way the census  was carried out. Not much time had elapsed before a number of  Assembly representatives, mainly from the Albanian parties,  began to inflate their figures for the Albanian population in  Macedonia--their data differed considerably from the official  statistics--and their missionaries strolled through various  European associations. In a similar fashion, various parties of  the other ethnic groups in the country had reservations and  doubts about the data with respect to the breakdown by ethnic  groups. As a result of all this, the Republic Institute for  Statistics came up with the idea of introducing a new census  with international observers and international financing, and  this idea has been accepted.    At the Republic Institute for Statistics, the law has been  treated as an entirely new project, developed on the basis of a  number of scientific and expert consultations. When it was being  drafted, the recommendations of the United Nations for  population censuses, the suggestions of the expert group from  the Committee of Deputy Ministers from the Council of Europe, as  well as the experience of various countries were taken into  account.  <H5>  Taking the Census </H5>   In contrast to the earlier law in which citizens of the  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, foreign citizens, and  people without citizenship who resided in Yugoslavia were  included, in this census, it is proposed to register people who  have an official, legal residence in Macedonia regardless of  whether they are physically in the official place of residence  or somewhere else in the Republic at the time of the census.  Also to be included are those who have permission to be in  Macedonia and who have been temporarily in Macedonia for at  least one year, but who have a permanent place of residence  outside Macedonia, with the exception of the refugees who have  been staying here. On the list are also those individuals who  have an official-legal place of residence in Macedonia, and at  the time of the census, but for no more than one year before the  census is taken, are engaged in work outside the country. The  census will include those who have an official place of  residence in the country at the time of the census but work in  diplomatic or consular posts for Macedonia or for various United  Nations organizations and military personnel or business  representatives stationed abroad.... The census also takes into  account refugees who, at the time of the census, find themselves  on Macedonian territory and individuals who, at the time of the  census, find themselves on Macedonian territory, irrespective of  the reasons; citizens of the Republic who have been outside  Macedonia for more than a year at the time of the census will be  listed separately.    It is interesting to note that the expert group from the  Council of Europe has a different attitude, according to the  proposed resolution in the law with respect to which population  should be counted. This group thinks that the census should  include the entire population which habitually resides [here],  those people who stay in a habitual place of residence in  Macedonia, individuals who are residing anywhere in Macedonia at  the time of the census, those who have been abroad less than one  year, as well as those who have been staying here temporarily  for less than one year but who have a permanent place of  residence outside the country.    Despite such suggestions, the Republic Insitute for  Statistics opted for a different solution and countered the  other one from the expert group by citing the experience of  numerous European countries where the census was made of the  population which had legally lived in the country for one year.  They explained that the habitual population--as conceived by the  expert group--was only applicable to certain countries, and  those have had a means to document and legally regulate entry  and exit to and from their countries for many years.  <H5>  Bilingual </H5>   Before the census of 1991 was begun, the use of languages in  taking the census was an issue that broke many a lance. Two  variations were proposed to handle it for this census. The first  of these is for the census to be conducted in the official  Macedonian language with Cyrillic letters, but a person who  belongs to a different ethnic group can be enrolled using his  own language if he so chooses. In such a case, the form should  also be filled out in the language of the person being  questioned. The forms would be printed in the Macedonian  language and in the Cyrillic alphabet and in the languages and  alphabets of the ethnic groups. The alternative is for the  census to be taken in the official Macedonian language with  Cyrillic letters, but in the local administrative areas, where a  majority or a significant number of members of an ethnic group  live, the census would also be done in the language of the  ethnic groups. In this case, the forms would be printed in  Macedonian and in the language of the ethnic groups which are a  majority or a significant number. The expert group thought that  the alternative should be dropped, but the Republic Institute  for Statistics believed that both variations should be presented  to the government.    A new way of constituting the opstina [township] census  commission was also proposed. In the past they had from seven to  13 members, along with a chairman. A commission had to have  three experts and one member each from the Macedonian  nationality and from any ethnic group, whose members residing in  the opstina totaled more than 1 percent of the population  according to the 1991 census. The remaining members of the  commission were selected in accordance with the proportion of  the population belonging to an ethnic group compared to the  total population of the opstina. At the same time, for each 20  percent of a nationality or ethnic group, one member was  elected; but a definite limit is proposed: Where the  representation exceeds 80 percent, only two members could be  chosen.    In the draft text of the law, which has 58 articles, all  other aspects connected with the introduction of the census are  being elaborated. At the Republic Institute for Statistics, they  expect that it will not be necessary to have meetings to adapt  the laws as far as technical aspects are concerned. The  procedure could be complicated only to the extent that it is  politicized, or if we have to re-enact the debate over the one  in 1991. But, believing that the prevailing attitude of the  politicians is in favor of having a census following  international standards, the Institute hopes that such  complications can be avoided. However, how smooth the law will  find its way cannot be predicted by anyone, given the  legislature's structure and the influences within it.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>   According to the calculations of the Republic Institute for  Statistics, a total of $1,515,454.00 will be required to carry  out the census. These funds must be underwritten by  international organizations and associations. They are  irrevocable and will be channeled regularly to the bank account  for the census, but the law must first be passed.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>   In addition to verifying the exact data, the credentials of  the census taker, and the control over the people being counted,  the following documents are required: an entry from the birth  certificates of the parents, marriage certificates,  certification of residency, citizenship papers, certificates  providing the civil registration number or personal  identification card or travel document.... And, there is a  difference of opinion about the law, in the case of the expert  group. That is, the European experts think that a decision  should be made to the effect that a person being enumerated only  submits documents when it is necessary. The Republic Institute  for Statistics, however, has disagreed, retaining a proviso that  not all of these documents would be required, only the essential  ones.</p>

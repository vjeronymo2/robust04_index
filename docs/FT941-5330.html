			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / The Markets: Waiting for Mr Greenspan - Global Investor Global securities markets recovered a measure of poise by the weekend after an extremely volatile few days of trading, but the mood remains fragile and dependent in no small measure on the actions, or lack of them, of the US Federal Reserve. Much of Wall Street is expecting Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to follow up last month's 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate with another 25 point move during the next few weeks, possibly accompanied by a 50 point rise in the psychologically important discount rate, which acts as a floor for the US interest rate structure. The Fed's February tightening, which Mr Greenspan presumably hoped might stabilise the Treasury bond market, in the event sowed inflationary anxiety and sent US bond prices sharply lower. Against this background, and statistics showing buoyant US consumption the Fed is expected to reinforce its inflation fighting credentials. A move could come as soon as this week or about the time of its policy-making Open Market Committee meeting, towards the end of March. A Fed move is so widely expected that it is already largely factored into Treasury prices, but the market could still take fright again, particularly if a rise were linked to a specific piece of economic news with worrying inflationary implications, rather than presented as part of a planned strategy to prolong the current economic expansion. Take, for example, the market's behaviour last Friday morning, when the headline statistics for February employment were much stronger than expected, and bond prices fell sharply in anticipation of a mid-morning tightening by the Fed which never materialised. Closer examination of the data convinced economists that the figures pointed, if anything, to slower rather than stronger growth, and the benchmark 30-year issue ended the day up  1/16 for a yield of 6.829. With US inflationary pressures still modest, the market looks oversold on fundamentals, but it may take some very adroit presentation by Mr Greenspan to convince Wall Street of that, at least in the short-run. The manner of a Fed move also has important implications for European bond markets, which so far have been unable to decouple themselves from falling prices across the Atlantic. Last Wednesday Europe was given an excuse for market turmoil of its own with figures showing the most explosive growth in German money supply since unification in 1990, raising fears that the Bundesbank will move even more cautiously in cutting German rates. The figures were distorted by numerous special factors and tomorrow's German labour market report will underline the delicate state of the economy. Even so, further significant rate cuts by the Bundesbank - the key to a bond market rally across Europe - still seem some way off. Recovery stocks The volatility in global stock prices since the Fed's February move has analysts divided as to whether a short, sharp and much needed correction in equities is under way, or whether this is the start of a creeping bear market which could see a slow, relentless decline in valuations as small US investors who have plunged into mutual funds switch out again. What havens are there in such an uncertain climate? One possibility is sectors which have traditionally outperformed at this stage of the economic cycle, and in the US that means capital goods and basic industries. Another alternative is recovery stocks - poor performing companies whose fortunes are being transformed. In the US, investment in recovery stocks has become entwined with the corporate governance movement - the trend for certain public pension funds and private investment groups to put very direct pressure on companies to improve their performance. The main focus of these campaigns is the company annual meeting season, generally known as the proxy season, which is just about to begin. In the months preceding the meetings, investors and managements go through an elaborate game of carrot and stick, with the shareholders threatening to put embarrassing resolutions on ballot papers. Several leading fund managers have developed sophisticated screening processes to identify dogs, while the Council of Institutional Investors, an umbrella group, has produced a list of 50 poor performers for use by its members. A recent study by the pension consulting firm Wilshire Associates of investment results by The California Public Employees' Retirement System, Calpers, probably the most activist large investor in the US, gives powerful support to the idea that corporate governance activism can pay big dividends. Beating the S&amp;P Wilshire looked at the returns to shareholders of 42 companies targeted by Calpers between 1987 and 1992. This group significantly underperformed the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index of leading stocks in the five years before Calpers targetted the companies. However, in the five subsequent years they showed a 41 per cent excess return over the S&amp;P. Adjusting for special industry factors, the return was 36.6 per cent. Wilshire then broke the companies down into two groups (see chart above) - one targeted by Calpers between 1987 and 1989, when its shareholder activism was limited to general issues of corporate governance, such as the anti-takeover devices installed by companies. That group showed little improvement relative to the S&amp;P 500. The second group consists of those targeted by Calpers between 1990 and 1992, after it changed its policy to one of actively seeking to improve a company's financial performance by engaging in a dialogue with its management. The companies handsomely outperformed the S&amp;P. Similar evidence comes from Lens, a small fund management group set up by Mr Robert Monks, one of founders of the shareholder activist movement, to take stakes in poor performers and pressure their management into changes. Lens takes a more adversarial approach to management than the large pension funds. It initially targeted four companies - Sears Roebuck, Eastman Kodak, Westinghouse and American Express - all of which subsequently went through boardroom upheavals mainly because of shareholder pressure. In its first year to last July, Lens' investments in the four companies returned 26.1 per cent, compared with 7.2 per cent for the S&amp;P 500. Piggybacking Of course, few investors have Calpers ability to concentrate the minds of under-performing managers. But others can piggy back on their efforts by investing in the same stocks. Calpers has selected 10 companies on which it will focus attention in the 1994 proxy season. They include three it targeted last year but are still underperforming - paper company Boise Cascade, IBM and Westinghouse Electric. The other seven include two photographic companies, Eastman Kodak and CPI; chemicals group First Mississippi; Navistar International, the truck manufacturer; US Shoe, a footwear and clothing retailer; USX-Marathon, an energy company, and Zenith, the television manufacturer. Lens Fund, which claims to differ from large institutional funds in targeting not just under-performers, but companies where it feels strong activism can make an important difference, is invested in Westinghouse, engineering group Stone &amp; Webster, Scott Paper and Borden, the troubled food group which has just shaken up its top management. So far, the US funds have limited their lists of under-performers to the US market. But American institutional shareholders are beginning to raise awkward questions about corporate governance at annual meetings of foreign companies, and it is only a matter of time before they start demanding explanations for poor performance from European and Japanese boards.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 3/3/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                ---------------- % change over period ----------------                US     Japan     Germany     France     Italy       UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week         0.06      0.04        0.12       0.12      0.15     0.10 Month        0.27      0.19        0.51       0.54      0.70     0.45 Year         3.44      3.09        7.00       9.31     10.81     5.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week        -0.43     -1.17       -0.37      -0.82     -0.94     0.13 Month       -1.99     -1.82       -1.79      -2.27     -2.42    -1.78 Year         3.01      4.30        7.39      12.12     20.44     7.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week        -0.77     -1.86       -0.93      -1.49     -1.79    -0.22 Month       -3.65     -2.56       -3.88      -3.78     -5.23    -4.66 Year         3.12      4.03        6.88      13.63     27.46    10.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week        -0.3      -0.4        -2.4       -0.3      -0.9     -0.5 Month       -3.5      -0.7        -5.4       -4.8      -3.5     -6.4 Year         5.5      27.0        20.7       21.3      25.4     17.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 3/3/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            ------- % change --------                                Close       Week      Month      Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Tasman Prop.

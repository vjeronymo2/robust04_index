			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jun (PL) -- The 20th Council of the  Latin American Economic System (SELA) today approved a  resolution rejecting the U.S.-imposed economic, trade, and  financial blockade instituted against Cuba more than three  decades ago. The document, which was studied by  ministerial-level delegations, recognizes the importance of  reaffirming the sovereignty of the region's countries and says  in its text:    "The need to put an end to the U.S.-imposed economic, trade,  and financial blockade against Cuba. [sentence as received]    "In view of paragraphs A and B of articles 3 and 4 and  paragraphs 1 and 4 of article 5 of the Panama Agreement and  considering resolution No. 112 regarding the `imposition of  coercive economic measures' and resolutions 47/19 and 40/16 of  the UN General Assembly, entitled `The Need To End The  U.S.-Imposed Economic, Trade, and Financial Blockade Against  Cuba';    "Whereas, there is the need to reaffirm, among other  principles, the sovereign equality of states, nonintervention in  their internal affairs, and the freedom of international trade  and navigation recognized in numerous international legal  instruments;    "Whereas, free trade is an element that contributes to the  people's economic development and well-being; and    "Whereas, there is the need to boost trade relations in the  American hemisphere, in adherence to the principle of free trade  and navigation.    "The Latin American Council resolves to reject the  application of unilateral measures that affect free development  of international commerce and contravene principles of  international law. To this end, the Council urges the lifting  of the economic, trade, and financial blockade against Cuba and  expresses support for UN General Assembly resolution 48/16,  which demands the elimination of unilateral actions that are  incongruent with the international economic and political  context."</p>

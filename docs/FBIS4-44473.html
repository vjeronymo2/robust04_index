			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhou Shaoping (0419 1421 1627): "GATT Accession </F> Prospects Still Unclear"]    [Text] It has been eight years since China submitted its  application to GATT for the resumption of its membership in July  1986. During these eight years, GATT's China working group,  charged with reviewing and considering China's application, has  held 16 conferences and posed thousands of questions concerning  all aspects of China's trade system to the Chinese delegation.  This marathon-style review progress is rare in GATT history.  The working group held its 16th meeting in Geneva between 15  and 18 March but clear progress remains elusive.    Under the accord reached by the 110 nations participating in  the Uruguay Round, a World Trade Organization [WTO] will be set  up to replace GATT. In principle WTO is scheduled to be set up  before July 1995. However, most nations now want to advance the  date to January 1995. This development has given GATT accession  negotiations extra urgency. To be a founding member of WTO,  China must totally wrap up GATT accession talks by fall this  year. Otherwise it will have to apply anew on even more  stringent terms. Thus it can be said with certainty the next few  months will be a critical period in China's push for GATT  membership.    The GATT China working group is responsible for all work  relating to the resumption of China's status as a signatory to  GATT. Its responsibilities can be divided into three parts:  examining and reviewing China's foreign trade system; drafting  the GATT accession agreement, including provisions on China's  rights and obligations after it becomes a member; and tariff  reduction negotiations between China and other GATT signatories.  For a variety of reasons, the working group has always focused  its energies on scrutinizing China's trade system.    Both during the working group's 16th meeting and when he met  with Director-General Sutherland of GATT, Gu Yongjiang, vice  minister of foreign economic relations and trade who headed  China's delegation to the negotiations, emphasized that China  has met the conditions for admission and that the working group  should speed up the negotiation process by wrapping up its  consideration of China's trade system and starting to draft the  admission agreement. Sutherland expressed his support for  China's early accession, noting that without China, the future  WTO would lack broad representativeness.    To nudge the negotiation process along, the Chinese  Government has introduced a string of foreign trade reforms in a  concerted effort to create a new mechanism compatible with the  rules by which the international trade system operates. Since  the end of last year, in particular, it has unveiled several  major reforms such as abolishing the mandatory import plan,  reforming the import quota and import permit system, drastically  narrowing the scope of import management, simplifying import  procedures, and quickening the pace of tariff cuts. In 1992 it  eliminated the import regulating tax and lowered the import tax  twice. On top of that it lowered the tax rates on more than 280  commodities and did away with quota and permit management for  the 280 commodities last year. These steps have opened the  Chinese market even further. At the 16th meeting, the Chinese  delegate made additional commitments on the issue of tariff and  non-tariff reductions and concessions. This year, moreover,  China has taken steps to reform its foreign exchange system and  tax system. Under its original commitment to GATT, China was to  reform its foreign exchange system within five years. As it  turned out, it took China less than one year to do just that.    Delegates from all nations who attended the China working  group's 16th meeting welcomed China's reform measures. With the  exception of the United States, all developed nations said  unequivocally that the working group should speed up its  deliberations and begin formal negotiations on China's GATT  accession agreement as soon as possible so that China can rejoin  GATT before WTO is established. During a visit to China last  February, Bulitan, the EC delegate, presented China with a draft  agreement, which was viewed by Chinese trade officials as a  positive move that would prod the negotiation process forward.  At the 16th meeting, the Chinese delegate and his EC  counterpart exchanged ideas on the draft. The Japanese delegate  indicated that Japan would open negotiations with China on  tariff reductions. As of to date about 10 countries, including  Australia and New Zealand, have opened negotiations with China  on bilateral tariff reduction.    With all these nations working hard to accelerate GATT  accession negotiation, America's isolation becomes even more  pronounced. The negative attitude of the United States to the  resumption of China's GATT membership contrasted sharply with  the atmosphere at the meeting. The U.S. delegate said the  agreement should not be discussed before they figure out China's  trade system and objected to China's accession "timetable."  During bilateral Sino-U.S. contacts, the Americans invariably  voice strong support for Chinese GATT membership. It is hard to  tell what the Americans are up to. Within the United States  there are some people who argue that Clinton's foreign policy,  including of course his China policy, has yet to take shape.    Whether or not China can rejoin GATT on schedule depends to  a  large extent on America's attitude. Observers say there are  only two possible scenarios. In one scenario, the United States  drives a hard bargain only to relent at the last moment. The  other scenario depicts the United States as utterly determined  to prevent China from becoming a founding member of the future  WTO. Whichever scenario materializes, it is an irreversible  trend for the Chinese economy to flourish and for China to take  bold strides to join the world.</p>

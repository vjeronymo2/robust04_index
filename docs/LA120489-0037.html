			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A RETURN TO THE FORBIDDEN CITY'S GLORY DAYS  </P> <P> From 1938 through 1962, the Forbidden City nightclub was a San Francisco  landmark, featuring elaborate production numbers and specialty acts. It was  like many such successful clubs of the era, except for one crucial difference:  It featured Chinese-American entertainers.  </P> <P> Film maker Arthur Dong, whose impressive "Sewing Woman" and "Lotus" reveal his  concern for his Chinese heritage, had the inspired idea to do a documentary on  the club, composed of interviews with many of its alumni, and enriched with a  treasure trove of archival material -- rare footage shot inside the club,  vintage recordings of its singers and even clips from the Hollywood films in  which they appeared.  </P> <P> Dong's "Forbidden City, U.S.A." (at the Nuart Wednesday and Thursday, plus  additional screenings through Tuesday) is the kind of film that has yet to be  done on Manhattan's Cotton Club. It brims over with nostalgia for a more  glamorous and innocent show-business era, yet is a commentary on racial  stereotyping and on the insidiousness of discrimination. The handsome and  vigorous array of Forbidden City veterans, now in their 60s and 70s, first of  all had to persuade their often chagrined families that they were serious about  entering show business and then had to persuade potential employers that  Americans of Chinese descent could actually sing and dance. For most all of  them, the late Charlie Low, the Forbidden City's proprietor, was the man who  gave them their breaks.  </P> <P> Just as African-Americans had their Sepia Mae Wests and Black Valentinos, the  Forbidden City offered a Chinese Sophie Tucker (Toy Yat Mar), a Chinese Fred  Astaire (Paul Wing), a Chinese Frank Sinatra (Larry Ching) and even a Chinese  Sally Rand (Noel Toy). Clearly, these and other performers interviewed have  their own vibrant personalities and individual talents, but to varying degrees  submerged them for professional survival. As Toy Yat Mar observes, "I really  didn't care too much for the label, but it was commercial, so I stuck with it."  Old recordings reveal that both she and Ching were uncannily accurate as  sound-alikes of Tucker and Sinatra.  </P> <P> When Forbidden City performers toured, as they did during the club's World War  II heyday, they admit they were confounded by the rigid segregation they  encountered in the South and were perplexed as to where they fit in, being  neither black nor white. In any event, the Forbidden City, which became a  casualty of the North Beach topless clubs and other social changes, was one of  the few venues open to Chinese-American entertainers. Charlie Low's alumni see  themselves as Americans first and foremost, and Dong's delightful 57-minute  film preserves their place in our show-business heritage.  </P> <P> There will be additional showings of "Forbidden City, U.S.A." at 5:45 p.m. on  Friday, Monday and Tuesday, with Saturday and Sunday matinees at 12:45 p.m.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 478-6377, (213) 479-5269.  </P> <P> Oliver Huckenhill's 65-minute "Determinations," which screens tonight at 8 at  LACE, is one of the most demanding of Filmforum's presentations.  </P> <P> It is a kind of reverie in protest of the severe sentences accorded the five  members of the Vancouver Direct Action Anarchists, who set off a series of  bombings in the early '80s in a protest against nuclear weapons development  (and also pornographic images of women). The film seems totally random,  composed of reprocessed images, staged vignettes and nature footage, all of  which is occasionally punctuated by recitations of the five defendants'  ponderous court statements.  </P> <P> "Determinations" has been called nothing less than an attempt at "rejuvenating  the documentary form," but is likely to strike many viewers as relentlessly  tedious, self-indulgent and of no help whatsoever in the cause of the Vancouver  Five.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 276-7452 or (714) 923-2441.  </P> <P> "Enchanted Drawings: The Hollywood Animated Film" commences Friday at the  County Museum of Art and runs through Jan. 6 on Fridays and Saturdays. This  weekend's programs are "In the Beginning: The Silent Era" (Friday at 1 and 8  p.m.) and "Walt Disney: Part 1" (Saturday at 10:15 a.m. and 8 p.m.).  </P> <P> Information: (213) 857-6522.  </P></p>

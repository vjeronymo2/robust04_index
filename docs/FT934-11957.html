			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading FOOTSIE futures yesterday faced round two of the pounding from US sellers that left them on the ropes the previous day, writes Christine Buckley. The December contract had a promising start, along with the cash market, but this proved too weak to sustain the battering of selling. December opened at 3,183 and climbed to a high for the day of 3,198 by mid-morning, with independent traders seen as the keenest to tick up the level. UK institutions largely kept their distance. US selling, which came against a background of generally downbeat sentiment and a weak Wall Street, steadily wiped away the value gained in the morning. A poor gilts market added to the gloom. The contract fell to a day's low of 3,167, although 3,175 proved a reasonably strong support level. Some market watchers suggested that the contract had had a good run in recent sessions and would benefit from some consolidation. At its close December was at 3,172, which marked a 5-point lead over its fair value premium to the cash market that is taken at about 15 points. Volume was average at 8,560 contracts. Traded options saw healthy activity, with 49,589 lots dealt. Top of the stock options, which have suffered some sluggish dealing recently, was British Steel at 12,128 contracts. Much of that activity was done by one move from October to January.</p>

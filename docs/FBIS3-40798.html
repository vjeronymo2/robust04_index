			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. Goulmamine: "Telecommunications: Opening Up </F> to the World Through Fiber Optic"--first paragraph is LIBERTE  introduction]    [Text] The submarine fiber-optic cable section inaugurated  yesterday morning will connect our country to many other  continents. Algeria is opening up to the world.    The project in which Algeria is a shareholder consists in  fact in curing the telecommunication sector of the mediocrity  that characterized it. At the same time, Algeria's  communications with the world will be improved. To this end, a  link with South and East Asia, the Middle East, and West Europe  was established.    More precisely, this telecommunication network section will  connect Algeria to the five other Maghreb countries, through  20,000 telephone lines and 16 television channels.    This is the first section of the telecommunication  electronic  highway. Through a submarine section, Algeria will be connected  to Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt,  Italy and, finally, France.    According to a Channel-1 radio news broadcast, the first  section of the submarine cable will connect Algiers to  Marseille. The Algerian part consists of 900 km of optical  fiber, and the signal will be amplified by repeaters placed  every 100 km. The estimated cost of the project is 90 million  French francs [Fr] for 8,000 lines. The Algiers-Marseille link  was acquired by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and  will become operational soon.    It was announced that, from now on, nearly all governorates  will be connected to the national digital network. Over 100,000  subscribers are already connected. To relieve congestion at the  Algiers telephone center, the sections created in Oran,  Constantine, and Ghardaia were decentralized. The 1993  telecommunication plan also covered communication security. To  achieve this, Mr. Hassene Daffer explained, "the creation of  electronic highways will prove very useful to connect large  regional poles and large national transit centers. Several  sections are already in operation between Algiers, the South and  the West of the country."    Digital systems are increasingly used in Algeria. In the  very  heart of the capital, several computerized centers are already  in operation in some districts. According to Mr. Daffer, setting  up such centers nationwide will make it possible to meet 96  percent of pending applications very quickly and under favorable  conditions. Nevertheless, a few towns in the East will have to  wait until March 1994. Other projects are being considered, for  instance an Algeria-Palma link by 1996, via a fiber-optic  submarine cable.    As you will recall, optical fiber is a means of transport  that involves carrying laser beams through a 1.5-micron thick  fiber. It was introduced in Algeria during the eighties. Since  then, test sites have been set up and have enabled experts to  master the project and the technology.</p>

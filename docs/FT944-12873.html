			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Longuet case to be investigated The French justice ministry has given the go-ahead to two formal investigations in a corruption case which forced the resignation of Mr Gerard Longuet, then industry minister, earlier this month, writes John Ridding in Paris. The investigations, which are expected to be launched today, will focus on allegations of illicit financing relating to the construction of Mr Longuet's holiday villa in St Tropez and on the management of companies linked to the former industry minister which are suspected of concealing payments from business groups. Mr Longuet has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement released on Saturday, following the decision by the justice ministry to authorise the new probes, he described the allegations against him as 'baseless.' He said the new investigations would allow him to prove his innocence. The judicial authorities are investigating whether Mr Longuet received payments and preferential financial terms on his villa in return for granting public contracts. The new probes will examine Investel, a holding company created by Mr Longuet in 1989 and Avenir 55, a consultancy firm for which Mr Longuet worked.</p>

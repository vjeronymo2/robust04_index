			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Yen dispute gone but not forgotten: Tension over currency, soothed for now, is likely to resurface in the future BY condemning in forthright terms 'attempts to artificially influence or manipulate exchange rates' and by sanctioning intervention by the Federal Reserve to stem the dollar's slide against the yen, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, managed to reduce tension between the US and Japan just in time for yesterday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington. It was a typically adroit gesture from a politician with long experience of deal-making on Capitol Hill. Yet the dispute between Tokyo and Washington over the appropriate value of the yen cannot now be dismissed as ancient history. In coming years the Clinton administration is likely again to find itself unhappy with the existing structure of exchange rates. The question is whether its tactics will be any different in future disputes. Mr Bentsen came into office promising to revive the G7 consultative process. He said economic co-operation would become a two-way street, with the US listening and responding to the views of other countries rather than publicly bullying them, as had allegedly been the case in the past. He also promised to put an emphasis on discreet private communications. Recent US policy towards Japan hardly conforms to these ideals. 'I'd like to see a stronger yen,' Mr Bentsen said on February 19 at the National Press Club in Washington. The dollar immediately dived, falling to its then lowest level in four decades of Y118.20. On April 16, following a sticky session with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, President Bill Clinton was asked how the US Dollars 49bn (Pounds 31bn) trade deficit with Japan could be reduced. His answer was 'number one, the appreciation of the Japanese yen.' The dollar then plummeted to Y112.15, another low. The remarks on exchange rates were replies to reporters' questions, not formal policy declarations. Yet both Mr Bentsen and Mr Clinton are fully aware of the extreme sensitivity of foreign exchange markets to public remarks by senior politicians. Mr Larry Summers, the treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said this week that Mr Clinton's remark was 'descriptive not prescriptive.' Even if this were true, it is too fine a distinction for markets to appreciate. If the remarks by Mr Bentsen and Mr Clinton were genuine slips of the tongue they could easily have been corrected later by a categorical official statement to the effect that the US did not want to see any further appreciation of the yen. No such strong statement was forthcoming. Moreover, when Mr Bentsen was in Tokyo two weeks ago for a meeting of G7 finance ministers, he declined to issue a joint statement with Mr Hayashi, stating that rapid movements in exchange rates were unwelcome. Undeterred, Japanese finance ministry officials briefed reporters that, during the bilateral meeting, Mr Bentsen had agreed with the Japanese line that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. The US treasury was so irritated it called for a public retraction, even though this week Mr Bentsen echoed Mr Hayashi's line. It is hard not to conclude that, at the beginning of the year, Mr Bentsen believed the yen was too weak, that he decided to encourage a substantial appreciation and that he felt the appreciation had gone far enough only when the dollar dived below Y110 in recent days. Indeed, in a briefing with reporters this Wednesday an unrepentant Mr Bentsen came close to admitting that he had deliberately talked the yen up. Referring to his February remarks at the National Press Club, he smiled and said: 'It looks like those remarks turned out to be very timely.' The US treasury claims that the sharp appreciation of the yen is a market reaction to changing economic fundamentals. The argument is that the big fiscal stimulus package recently unveiled in Tokyo will boost the Japanese growth rate substantially, putting upward pressure on the currency. Some impact is likely although a fiscal stimulus usually influences exchange rates mainly through the expectation of higher interest rates, which are not presently expected. A stronger yen offers mixed blessings for the Japanese. In the short run it will hurt export industries such as electronics and cars which already face overcapacity. But that could be offset by the help it will give to Japanese banks. Their weakened balance sheets have raised doubts about their ability to finance recovery through higher lending. A stronger yen increases the value of their Japanese capital relative to their international borrowing and so should create more room for higher lending in Japan. In private Japanese officials concede that several factors justify a stronger yen: the gap between US and Japanese long-term interest rates; the size of the Japanese trade surplus, which has reached 3.3 per cent of gross national product; the need to encourage an outflow of long-term capital from Japan to offset the trade surplus; and the possibility that the US recovery may turn out to be weaker than initially thought. In the long run, a higher yen will hasten corporate restructuring amd make manufacturing companies yet more competitive. Does it matter, therefore, that the US treasury appears to have accelerated this process? From Japan's point of view, probably not. The US, after all, has never in the past achieved any long-run gains from dollar devaluation: look at the condition of its balance of payments compared with that of Japan. But the way the yen appreciation was brought about arguably does matter, given Mr Bentsen's commitment to economic co-operation. Tokyo did not agree to the scale and speed of the yen's climb; indeed officials were extremely annoyed. As so often in the past, the US imposed its view of desirable exchange rate patterns. In future currency disputes the US's partners will be looking for a genuine two-way street in talks with Washington.</p>

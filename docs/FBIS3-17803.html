			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Armenian Defense Ministry press service  informed us that they have no new information to add to the  report issued this morning. According to this morning's report,  the Azerbaijani Army fiercely bombarded Choratan, Artsvaberd,  Movses, and Aygepar in Tavushskiy Rayon and the defensive  positions around these villages with Grad rockets, tanks, and  howitzers between 1650-1720 yesterday. The shelling caused  destruction, deaths, and injuries.    The situation remained tense on the borders of Idzhevanskiy  and Noyemberyanskiy rayons between 1830-2315. The Azerbaijani  border troops fired towards Diran, Voskepar, and (?Sosi) using  tanks, artillery, and infantry fighting vehicles. The shelling  caused some injuries in Noyemberyanskiy.    This periodic aggression proves that, as a rule, Azerbaijan  uses the relative calm on the Armenian borders to prepare for  new border violations.    The Armenian Army's fighters had no choice but to retaliate  in kind in all directions yesterday evening to force the  Azerbaijanis stop the shelling.    The situation was calm on Armenia's borders during the night  and this morning. [passage omitted]    Situation in Karabakh: After having suffered a major defeat  in the direction of Agdam on eastern front yesterday, the  Azerbaijani Army carried out a massive rocket and artillery  bombardment of Karabakh positions in that sector this morning.  The artillery shelling was still continuing at 0900.  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters press  service reported that the Karabakh formations are taking  countermeasures.    The situation was relatively calm on the remainder of the  front.</p>

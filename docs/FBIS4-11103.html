			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo from </F> San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas]    [Text] [Announcer Jose Cardenas] Special correspondent  Santoyo will now report on the reactions in Chiapas to a  bulletin released this morning by the National Defense  Secretariat [Sedena] asserting that no member of the Mexican  Army is guilty of violating human rights in the Chiapas  conflict. Sedena says none of the 127 human rights violations  reports is valid. Come in, Juan Carlos.    [Santoyo] Although this bulletin is being treated with a  certain amount of reservation here in Chiapas, some communities  have reacted by saying these reports should be looked at more  closely. Some people are not happy about the bulletin,  particularly those who are being held at the Cerro Hueco Prison  who seriously question this statement by the Sedena. They say  it is the authorities who have the final word.    The problems in Chiapas are increasing. Six days ago, on 21  April, to be exact, 380 people from the group known as the Three  Knots returned to Ochuc. These people, who have been described  as rural teachers disguised as peasants, were expelled from  Ochuc because they were considered dangerous and destabilizing.    A very serious incident occurred today. Two minors, one an  eight year old and the other a 14 year old, were burned alive  when their wooden shack was drenched with gasoline and set on  fire. This is thought to be a revenge attack by some of those  who had been expelled from Ochuc. The incident, which occurred  in the village of Tobija some 14 km from Ochuc, is being  investigated. Four people have been detained. Ochuc municipal  President Emilio Gomez Santis traveled to Tuxtla Gutierrez to  meet with the governor, Javier Lopez Moreno, so the proper  actions could be taken.    We in the media are concerned because arriving at Ochuc is  very difficult. One man, who declined to identify himself and  just said he was a local authority, gave us a very serious  warning. After giving us some information, he said: The people  are very upset. You might as well leave. You are still alive.  If you came in a car, drive away because it could be destroyed.  We cannot be held responsible for your lives.    Of course, after this warning, we put some distance between  ourselves and this town. These people are very upset,  particularly because they are being forced to accept people they  had expelled for political reasons. Some of the teachers,  identified as members of the Democratic Revolution Party, have  caused some problems in the municipality because most of the  people here belong to or are followers of PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party]. The number of dead will increase if what  is happening there is not stopped.    The last that I will tell you is that Jorge Gonzalez Torres,  candidate for the Ecologist Party, is scheduled to arrive in San  Cristobal de las Casas tonight. He will make a working tour in  some local communities, and on Friday he will take water trucks  to local Indian communities. In addition, National Action Party  candidate Diego Fernandez Cevallos will make a tour from Friday  to Monday. His public relations committee has gotten in touch  with us in the media. It has been reported that we can use the  press room set up by the federal government.</p>

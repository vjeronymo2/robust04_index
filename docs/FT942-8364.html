			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sony falls 21% to Y99.7bn for year Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment group, suffered a sharp fall in operating profit due to appreciation of the yen, weak demand in key markets and a poor performance by its film company. The continuing difficult environment for Sony resulted in a 6.5 per cent fall in revenues to Y3,734bn (Dollars 36bn) in the year to the end of March, from Y3,993bn last year, and a 54 per cent decline in net income to Y15.3bn (36.3bn). Operating profit was down 21 per cent to Y99.7bn from Y126.5bn previously. However, pre-tax profits were lifted by foreign exchange gains and lower costs, including lower interest costs, to Y102.2bn, which rose 10 per cent. Sony said new products, such as car navigation systems and MiniDisc players, had fared well. Sales of video equipment, however, fell 19 per cent and audio goods by 9 per cent. The US market was buoyant as the economy there recovered, but Europe and Japan remained weak. Europe, in particular, saw sales fall 19 per cent both as a result of the slump in demand and a strong rise in the yen's value against leading European currencies. Parent operating profit, however, surged 94 per cent to Y3bn from Y1.55bn largely due to lower costs while parent net profit was boosted by an extraordinary profit of Y1.08bn due to the listing of a telecoms company in which Sony has a stake. The yen's appreciation against the dollar and European currencies continued to plague Sony. The company said that if it had not been for the yen's appreciation, consolidated total sales would have increased by Y501bn over the reported figure. The company does not expect a marked improvement in its trading environment in the current year, largely due to the uncertainty surrounding the foreign exchange market, heightening price competition and continuing weak demand in Japan and Europe.</p>

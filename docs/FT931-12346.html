			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities The window of opportunity for rights issues may not stay open for long. It is not so much that institutional coffers will run dry. Life companies and pension funds can always run down cash balances or borrow short-term if the opportunities are too good to miss. Moreover, institutions see no good reason to buy bonds at current yields and, even allowing both for a hefty government offering of BT shares this year and a large cash call from ICI when it does the splits, their enthusiasm for equities would be far from satisfied. Whether that will still be the case when the government's funding programme gets under way in earnest is another matter. Lower short-term interest rates and a devalued currency amount to a strong case for equities. But if the US experience is anything to go by, the 4 per cent fall in base rates since sterling left the ERM will take some months to feed into the real economy. That leaves plenty of time for disappointment before real recovery emerges. If long gilt yields are also soon on a rising trend, the equity market will be hard pressed to sustain its optimistic mood. The government may find a way - perhaps by regulatory requirement or by issuing index-linked stock - of attracting institutions into gilts without the need for higher yields. That would mean less cash for rights issues.</p>

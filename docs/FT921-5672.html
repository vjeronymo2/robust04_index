			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Argentina opens telecom float ARGENTINA began yet another foray into the world equities market yesterday when the government kicked-off an international marketing campaign to sell its 30 per cent stake in Telecom Argentina, one of the country's two privatised telephone companies. The sales offensive began in Paris and will end in San Francisco on March 14, a few days before the offer closes. The government has set a minimum price of Dollars 640m for the shares, but they are expected to fetch Dollars 800 to Dollars 900m. Telecom was created in November 1990 when the national telephone network was privatised and split in two. Telecom, which operates in northern Argentina, is managed by the French and Italian state telephone companies. The flotation is expected to repeat last December's successful sale of the government's 30 per cent stake in Telefonica de Argentina, which runs the phones in southern Argentina. It raised Dollars 850m for the government, due largely to strong demand in Argentina. Half of Telecom's shares will be set aside for leading local and international investors who will set a sale price in a bidding process. One-quarter of the remaining shares are ear-marked for large investors and another quarter for small local investors. Telecom reported net profit of Dollars 52.3m on sales of Dollars 862.4m in 1991. It forecast sales this year of Dollars 1.2bn and has begun a five-year, Dollars 3.3bn investment programme. The company expects to raise annual sales to Dollars 2bn by 1996.</p>

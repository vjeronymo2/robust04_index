			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The forthcoming visit  to China by Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak is  expected to be a complete success, Chinese officials here said.    Prior to Mubarak's arrival here tomorrow, senior Chinese  diplomats and trade officials expressed this conviction to  XINHUA, saying they are looking forward to the trip.    Reached by telephone, Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Yang  Fuchang, who returned here for the visit, said Mubarak's 6th  trip here will serve to enhance mutual understanding and be  beneficial to each country's development.    He described Egypt, a major country in the Arab world and  Africa, as playing a significant and unique role in the Middle  East peace process.    As chairman of the Organization of African Unity, the  Egyptian president also has an important role to play in African  affairs, said Yang, who was vice foreign minister before he was  appointed Chinese ambassador to Egypt.    China and Egypt, two ancient civilizations, have always been  very good friends. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties  38 years ago, the two countries have maintained cooperative ties  of friendship in fields of politics, economy, culture and  science and technology.    "Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi once said that Chinese  technologies suit Egypt and that the suitable ones are the  best," he said.    Therefore, there is enough room for the two countries to  further their cooperation in economic, and scientific and  technological fields, the ambassador said.    China and Egypt are both striving to reform their economies  and have achieved a lot, he said, adding that the two are faced  with similar problems in the course of development.    Mubarak's visit and the bilateral contacts at various levels  will enable the two sides to exchange in-depth views, deepen  mutual understanding and help to further the reforms and  economic growths in the two countries, Yang said.    An official from the Foreign Ministry's Asia and Africa  Department echoed Yang's view, saying that the visit will serve  to consolidate the friendly Sino-Egyptian cooperation and the  traditional friendship between the two countries.    Calling Mubarak a respected old friend of the Chinese  people,  the official noted that the Egyptian president has made  important contributions to the development of bilateral  cooperation.    During the visit, Mubarak is scheduled to exchange views  with  Chinese leaders on the furthering of Sino-Egyptian ties, and  regional and international issues of mutual concern.    Touching upon Sino-Egyptian trade links, an official from  the  ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation noted that  there had been relatively rapid development in this regard in  recent years.    The two-way trade volume reached over 200 million U.S.  dollars-worth last year, making Egypt China's second-largest  trade partner in Africa.    China exports to Egypt mainly food and cereals, chemical and  light-industrial products, and machinery and electrical  appliances, and imports iron, steel and aluminum.    The two huge markets provide many opportunities for the  expansion of bilateral trade, he said.    China and Egypt are discussing ways to enhance their  bilateral economic and trade cooperation, including the setting  up in egypt of joint ventures and Chinese-owned enterprises.    During Mubarak's visit the two countries' leaders will  explore cooperation in these and other fields, he said.    To facilitate investment and trade between China and Egypt,  an agreement on the protection of investment between the two  countries is expected to be signed during Mubarak's visit, he  revealed.</p>

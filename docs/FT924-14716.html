			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford to cut production at Cologne factory FORD OF Europe is cutting production at its car assembly plant in Cologne, Germany, in response to falling sales in western Europe and excessive stocks. It is stopping production of the top-of-the-range Scorpio/Granada for three weeks beginning October 19 and is stopping output of its Fiesta small car for one week from the same date. The production cuts in Germany, the first for many years, are in addition to similar moves already announced at other Ford plants in Europe. Ford's two British car plants at Dagenham and Halewood, as well those at Genk, Belgium and Valencia, Spain will all go over to short-time working this month. Ford warned last month that its European operations would suffer a loss for the full year after struggling back into profit in the first half of 1992 from last year's record loss. The German production cuts mean that Ford will lose output of around 6,000 Fiestas and slightly more than 3,000 Scorpios/Granadas. Around 5,500 hourly-paid German workers will be affected by the short-time working on the Fiesta and Scorpio assembly lines. Of those, some 1,500 will be affected by the three-week lay-off. The workers will receive around 90 per cent of their net pay when the production is stopped. Cut-backs elsewhere in Europe this month are stopping Fiesta production in Spain for five days - with the loss of around 7,000 cars - while the Sierra assembly line in Belgium has been reduced from two shifts to a single shift and only four-day working for two weeks. In the UK, Ford has told trade unions that it has 'half an assembly plant too much capacity'. It is shedding 1,550 jobs in the UK and is cutting around 20 per cent of its capacity at the Dagenham and Halewood plants.</p>

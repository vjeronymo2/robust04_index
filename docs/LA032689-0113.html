			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO HALT ALL AK-47S AT THE BORDER;  </P> <P> ACTS UPON LEARNING OF LICENSES FOR 400,000 IMPORTS  </P> <P> A Treasury Department agency, stunned when it discovered that it had given gun  dealers permission to import more than 400,000 AK-47s and other assault rifles,  has ordered the Customs Service to halt all shipments of the weapons at the  nation's borders, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> The action goes far beyond steps taken earlier this month, when the  Administration announced a temporary moratorium on issuing new permits for five  types of assault weapons, including the AK-47.  </P> <P> It essentially revokes licenses that already had been issued to gun importers,  a step almost certain to be challenged in court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controversial Move  </P> <P> William T. Drake, a top official at Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms, acknowledged in an interview that the move would be controversial.  But he said that an internal audit detailing the vast extent of imports already  authorized had persuaded the agency to take the emergency action.  </P> <P> The bureau refused to disclose how many weapons have been approved for  importation, but a knowledgeable Customs Service source said the number is  420,000.  </P> <P> These weapons were not affected by the moratorium two weeks ago, which only  blocked approval of new applications for weapons imports. When the action was  taken, new applications for importation of 110,000 assault weapons were  pending. The moratorium will be lifted only if importers can prove that the  weapons are used generally for sporting purposes.  </P> <P> About 70,000 assault rifles have been imported into the United States in the  last three years, according to bureau officials.  </P> <P> In announcing the moratorium on new permits, the officials indicated that they  had no power to restrict imports of weapons for which permits had already been  granted. But Drake said that the agency, which has been trying to persuade  importers to halt assault-gun shipments voluntarily, believes that it has the  authority to make that ban mandatory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'God Taketh Away'  </P> <P> The authority comes, he contended, from the Gun Control Act of 1968, which  empowered the bureau to grant licenses authorizing gun imports. "What God  giveth," Drake said of the permission to import weapons, "God can taketh away."  </P> <P> The bureau's order, transmitted orally Thursday and made formal in a directive  issued by Drake Friday afternoon, officially bars five types of assault weapons  from entering the United States.  </P> <P> They include a wide variety of AKS-type weapons, including the Chinese-made  AK-47 and Finnish M-76, the Israeli Uzi carbine, the Belgian FNC, Austrian and  Belgian FAL-type weapons and German Aug-type weapons.  </P> <P> Customs agents across the country were ordered Friday to begin enforcing the  order and were equipped with lists of assault-gun importers so that they might  more easily identify the weapons shipments. As of Friday evening, however, no  new shipments of assault weapons had arrived at U.S. ports, Administration  officials said.  </P> <P> Under arrangements worked out by Customs and the Treasury agency, any of the  banned weapons that do arrive in the United States will be barred from entry  until it is determined whether the weapons are generally used for sporting  purposes. Only such weapons may be imported under U.S. laws.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Will Be Required  </P> <P> Until that decision is reached, importers will be permitted to store the  weapons in their own warehouses. The weapons will remain under Customs Service  jurisdiction, however, and the importers will be required to leave a  substantial bond on deposit with Customs.  </P> <P> The effective confiscation of the rifles is almost certain to result in legal  action as furious gun importers attempt to overturn the directive,  Administration officials warned.  </P> <P> The importers, they noted, stand to profit enormously in what has become a  seller's market for assault weapons across much of the country.  </P> <P> In the wake of the Administration ban and the decision by Colt Industries to  take its AR-15 rifle off the market, gun enthusiasts -- fearful that the  weapons might be banned altogether -- have bought up most of the assault rifles  available. As demand has boomed, prices have skyrocketed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Painstaking Search  </P> <P> When the ban on new permits was imposed two weeks ago, bureau officials said  that they had no idea how many assault weapons might still be imported under  existing authorization. The discovery that the number exceeded 400,000 resulted  from a painstaking two-week search of the agency's files, which are not  computerized.  </P> <P> Although refusing to confirm that figure, Drake said the fact that permission  to import had already been granted for a large number of weapons did not  necessarily mean that the weapons would have been imported.  </P> <P> Often, he said, gun dealers who plan to import fewer than 100 weapons file  "Form 6" documents requesting permission to import 10,000 or even 20,000. The  agency has no authority to ask dealers to modify such requests.  </P> <P> Officials said they were worried, however, that the increased demand for  assault weapons might have prompted dealers to place orders for all the guns  they were authorized to import.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concerns Eased  </P> <P> Customs Service officials initially expressed qualms about the new import ban.  But their concerns were eased when the bureau, with its directive Friday, took  full responsibility for the order. That would make it likely that the bureau --  not Customs -- would face court challenges, sources said.  </P> <P> Drake said that the decision had been taken by the bureau under consultation  with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.  </P></p>

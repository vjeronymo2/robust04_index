			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Union Label: Crew members on "Twin Peaks" are working under a union  contract for the first time starting this week, as a newly negotiated agreement  with the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees begins to  take effect. The contract, which covers make-up artists, photographers, film  editors and stagehands, was negotiated just hours before the union was to have  struck the set of "Twin Peaks," as well as ABC television offices in Los  Angeles and New York. The union had been the only labor organization left out  when Lynch/Frost Productions initially negotiated contracts for "Twin Peaks."  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

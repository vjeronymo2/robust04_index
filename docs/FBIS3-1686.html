Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated,  and  other council members here this morning.    Shultz and other council members, including Singaporean  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former British Foreign  Secretary Geoffery Howe, have been here to attend the 40th  session of the Council held in Beijing on February 27 and 28.    Noting that many of the council members are familiar with  China, Rong urged his guests to offer suggestions on building a  socialist market economy in China.    Rong said China is carrying reforms on taxation, finance,  foreign trade and state-owned enterprises. "This is a year of  crucial importance. If we succeed, our people will be  guaranteed a relatively comfortable life by the end of the  century," he said.    China, while deepening its reforms and opening wider to the  outside world, is paying equal attention to the maintenance of  stability, Rong said.    Stability promotes economic development, said Rong, adding  that economic growth and the improvement of people's livelihood,  in turn, help to maintain a stable political environment.    China is constantly improving its economic legislation and  investment environment. "We welcome direct foreign investment,"  he said.    Recalling China's fruitful cooperation with the J.P. Morgan  Company, Rong voiced the hope that the company would continue to  play a role in China's economic development.    Shultz said all the members of the Council which is made up  of renowned political and business figures from around the  world, without exception, are interested in China.</p>

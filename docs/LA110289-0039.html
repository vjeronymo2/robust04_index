			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARE AND KEEPING OF BANANAS  </P> <P> When you bring home a bunch of bananas, you'll want to store them properly so  they will stay fresh for a long time.  </P> <P> Green-tip bananas will reach their peak of ripeness if you take them out of the  plastic produce bag and keep them at room temperature. This enables them to  continue the ripening process and in just a few days they will be tender enough  for eating.  </P> <P> To store bananas for a longer time, keep them in the refrigerator. The peel  will darken but the fruit inside will stay ripe and fresh.  </P> <P> Bananas will keep for the longest possible time in the freezer. Just mash the  fruit with a little lemon juice and freeze it in an airtight container.  Defrosted, it is perfect to use in a favorite baked goods.  </P></p>

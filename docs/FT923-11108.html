			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / UK Gilts: Cool response to new regime for public spending 'At the heart of the medium-term strategy is the need to return to a sensible level of public spending and to see taxes and government borrowing reduced . . . This review is crucial to the strategy, crucial to success in reducing the public sector borrowing requirement, lowering interest rates and bringing down inflation - and crucial if we are to find room for lightening the tax burden and so provide scope and encouragement for enterprise and initiative.' These were the phrases used by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the former UK chancellor, in his Budget speech in March 1980 - the event which led to a strategic rethink of UK public spending. With similarly ringing words, Mr Norman Lamont, the current chancellor, might last week have introduced his own reforms to the way Britain organises this part of the economy. In fact, Mr Lamont said nothing in public. The new regime for public spending - which seeks to impose tough disciplines with a view to reining back increases in the public sector borrowing requirement - was introduced not in parliament but in off-the-record briefings to journalists. The gilt market - to which the question of future rises in public spending is crucial - was not greatly excited by the changes. While gilts investors might have been expected to be impressed by the new approach - which is likely to lead to spending cuts of some Pounds 13bn in 1994-95 and 1995-96 - they focused last week mainly on other factors. Since many of these are negative for gilts, the market as a whole behaved nervously. Prices were little changed for most classes of gilts although yields in the five to 10-year area rose by around 10 basis points due to a mild sell-off in this part of the yield curve. Under the Treasury's new system for limiting public spending, in future years totals will be set using a 'top down' approach involving the whole cabinet. The regime is designed to reduce the pace at which total government spending has risen in recent years. But the gilt market last week was every bit as worried about how much tax revenues - the other side of the PSBR equation - are likely to be depressed as a result of the weak growth probable over the next few years. That concerns gilt investors on the basis that the more the PSBR goes up, the more gilts have to be issued and the greater the chances of a fall in prices due to a glut in supply. According to estimates by Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers, revenues over the next few years are likely to be much less than the Treasury's projections in March. He reckons the shortfall will be Pounds 9.4bn in 1993-94, Pounds 17.4bn in 1994-95, Pounds 20.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 27bn in 1996-97. As a result, he is pencilling in much bigger PSBR numbers than the Treasury is predicting. Over the weekend the Treasury came close to admitting that Mr Saunders' calculations are along the right lines by indicating that corporation tax revenues are likely to be lower than expected. With other worries for the market also dominating last week - including the weak pound and the concern over whether the Maastricht agreement on monetary union might unravel - many gilt investors were in no mood to respond enthusiastically to any words from Mr Lamont, even had he uttered any.</p>

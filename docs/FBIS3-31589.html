			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] It has been reported from parliament by  our colleague Michal Tvarozek that deputies from the Party of  the Democratic Left [SDL] have proposed the abolition of the  government decree on the conditions of the transfer of state  property to other persons, the authority of Julius Toth to  endorse excemptions, and a resolution that endorses the sale of  the Novofruct enterprise in Nove Zamky.    They have also asked the general prosecutor to investigate  the legality of these proceedings.    Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said at a news conference at  1130 [1030 GMT] today that the draft of the resolution had been  brought to him by Ivan Gasparovic, parliamentary speaker, this  morning.    Vladimir Meciar went on to say:    [Begin recording] [Meciar] I would like to point out the  following: The draft of the resolution of the Slovak parliament  (?although it is not signed by anyone) is a result of talks  between the SDL and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH].    It says in Point 1:    It abolishes, according to Paragraph 87, Section 3 of Law  No.  44 of 1989 first the Decree of the Government of the Slovak  Republic No. 273 of 1991 on the excemptions from Paragraph 45 of  Law No. 92 of 1991 on the conditions of the transfer of state  property to other persons; the Decree of the Slovak Government  No. 40 of 1992; the Decree of the Slovak Goverment No. 144 of  1993; and the decree of the Slovak Government No. 151 of 1993.    Second, the Decree of the Government of the Slovak Republic  of 15 February 1994, which authorizes Julius Toth, deputy prime  minister and minister of finance, to endorse the excemptions  from Paragraph 45, Section 1 of Law No. 92 of 1991.    Third, the Resolution of the Government of the Slovak  Republic of 15 February 1994, which endorses the transfer of the  property of the Novofruct state enterprise in Nove Zamky by  direct sale to the company (?CV Slovakia) Ltd Nove Zamky and the  (?Maktomat) Ltd Zvolen.    In Section 2: According to Paragraph 91 of Law No. 44 of  1989  and Article 4 of Law No. 17 of 1993 it asks the general  prosecutor to launch investigations against Vladimir Meciar,  Slovak prime minister, who is also in charge of the Ministry for  Administration and Privatization of the Slovak Republic, and  also against Julius Toth, deputy prime minister and minister of  finance of the Slovak Republic, in the matter of the legality of:    First, the transfer of the ownership and the property of  enterprises carried out according to Paragraph 45, Section 2 of  Law No. 92 of 1991 in the version of the decree of the Slovak  Government No. 151 of 1993 and according to the resolution of  the government of 15 February 1994, which authorizes the deputy  prime minister and minister of finance to endorse excemptions  according to Paragraph 45, Section 2.    Second, decisions of the government on the transfer of the  property of the Novofruct Nove Zamky state enterprise by direct  sale to the company (?CV Slovakia) Ltd Nove Zamky and  (?Matsomat) Ltd Zvolen.    Third, the decision of the government on the sale of the  shares [words indistinct] by direct sale to the company (?Monis)  Ltd in Levice.    In Section 3: It calls on Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar,  who is in charge of the Ministry for Administration and  Privatization of National Property, and Julius Toth, deputy  prime minister and minister of finance, to resign due to the  deliberate violation of the constitutional oath on observing the  law in cases of the transfer of state property.    Commenting on those facts I would like to say the following:    First, the National Council does not have the right to  cancel  cabinet resolutions. This is why some different bodies are  entitled to act if these resolutions contradict the law.    Second, I do not have anything against the request addressed  to the General Prosecutor's Office to assess whether any action  by the cabinet is in accordance with the law. On the contrary,  I am in favor of this course of action. In this context I am  sending a letter to the prosecutor general to ask him to  investigate whether the matter of the October early elections is  not linked to an attempt to politically blackmail the prime  minister and the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS].    Third, this appeal (?anticipates) the result. It was not put  together on the basis of any investigation. Nobody studied the  evidence and nobody studied the facts of the case. This is an  attempt to disgrace some people.    I would like to say that this is just putting the finishing  touches to the picture of the deep, above all moral, crisis of  Slovakia's political life, polititics of the SDL, and others who  participate in this. This also indicates the depth of the  crisis of political life in which the Slovak Republic has found  itself. This also indicates an attempt to solve the problem of  elections by disgracing the name of the government coalition  representatives even before the elections starts.    I have already experienced something similar. It was when I  was persecuted for being perceived as the main representative of  the future formation of the Slovak state. You have witnessed  many events, many scandals involving me--including when I was  accused of crimes--and attempts to discredit me. As  intelligence documents have gradually emerged from the archives  those involved have even attempted suicides.    This is the first time this has come from the midst of  Slovak  political parties, an attempt to discredit another party and its  leadership without any evidence and without proper study.    I refute such methods. I also reject those who are involved  in carrying them out.    Last night there were talks between the SDL and the KDH, and  talks were being prepared between the HZDS and the SDL. Today  at 1500 [1400 GMT] we were to meet each other. I think that  given the aforementioned information we do not have anything to  discuss. We need an honest partner. The use of blackmail and  pressure as the means of talks with HZDS officials is not  permissable for anybody under any circumstances.    Parliamentary mathematics gives them a majority. They can  express a vote of no confidence in the cabinet and the cabinet  can resign. This is democratic. I reject their methods and  will neither submit to them nor respect them.</p>

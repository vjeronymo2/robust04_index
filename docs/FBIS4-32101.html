			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J.K.K.: "CUP on Economy From January to May; </F> Increased Production, Lower Inflation"]    [Text] Over the first five months of this year,  developmental trends prevailed in the economy, say experts for  the Central Planning Administration [CUP].    Compared with the first five months of last year, industrial  output increased by 10.1 percent, including 11.5 percent over  May, while, when it comes to the housing industry, output  increased by 6.4 and 4.5 percent, respectively.    The financial situation of enterprises is better than a year  ago. Gross revenue has been increasing at a faster rate than the  cost of obtaining it, which in turn leads to high growth of the  gross financial result (by 75.3 percent over four months of this  year, compared with the same period last year). The total  profit at the disposal of economic units [podmioty gospodarcze]  has also been growing (by 13.1 trillion zlotys over the first  four months of this year). Nominal monetary reserves of  enterprises (zloty-denominated and in foreign currencies  calculated in zlotys) were 5.6 percent higher in May than in  December, whereas, a year ago, a drop of 2 percent was reported.    Despite the continuing negative foreign trade balance, the  situation in exchange with foreign countries has definitely  changed. Over the January-April period, the rate of growth of  revenue from exports was 16.5 percent, compared with the same  period last year, and it exceeded in a major way the growth rate  of payments for imports (9.3 percent). A year ago, an  over-10-percent drop in exports was reported in the same time  period, with an over-18-percent increase in imports.    The state of field crops approximates or even exceeds the  average level of recent years, and that is a sign of good crop  yields in the future. Price configurations for producers of  pigs and cattle have also been beneficial, which is a factor  facilitating a reconstruction of the herds of these animals.    Among other positive trends being observed in the economy,  CUP experts note the inflation rate, which is lower than last  year. Over the January-May period, retail prices rose by 9.9  percent, while, a year ago, they rose by as much as 14.5  percent. Prices increased by 1.7 percent over the month of May.    However, these positive trends in the economy are  accompanied  by some negative phenomena. A high growth rate in salaries in  enterprises operating within the old monopolist structures  constitutes a particularly major danger for maintaining the  growth trends. The burden on the state budget resulting from  the effects of some earlier valorizations of retirement and  other types of pensions, as well as pressure coming from the  budget sector to have salary differences alleviated compared  with the enterprise sector and a high level of debt among  budget-sector units, could also have an impact on the inflation  process.    As for foreign trade, decreasing trends in trade with  countries of Central and East Europe and very minor expansion  into markets in developing countries constitute a danger for  maintaining the high export dynamism and for improving the  foreign trade balance of payments.    A very significant and persistent drop (in the range of 24  to  26 percent) in the size of housing investments has been holding  from the beginning of the year. After the first five months,  the number of apartments delivered (22,200) is 35 percent lower  than a year ago (the drop in the cooperative housing industry is  47 percent).    Negative effects for economic growth also come from social  tensions and strikes, which are a result of a lack of sense of  social security and of frustrations present among many social  groups, the CUP experts say.</p>

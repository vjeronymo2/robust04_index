			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Costain shares rise on coal sale agreement with Hanson THE SHARE price of Costain, the heavily-borrowed construction and mining group, rose by more than a tenth yesterday following an out-of-court settlement with Peabody, a Hanson subsidiary, over the sale of Costain's Australian coal mining businesses. Costain originally accepted a bid from Peabody for the businesses last October. Shortly afterwards it accepted a higher offer from Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, for the Australian coal mines and its Australian property interests Peabody subsequently obtained an injunction in the US courts preventing the sale to Altus. The settlement with Peabody, announced late on Thursday night, is in line with the original deal reached last October. It involves the Hanson subsidiary paying Costain Dollars 200m (Pounds 135m) plus a net asset adjustment of Dollars 34m which is subject to a final audit. Peabody will also take on borrowings of ADollars 85m (Pounds 41m) owed by the Australian coal mining operations. Altus, which has agreed the terms of the out-of-court settlement, is expected to receive just under Dollars 2m in compensation from Costain and Peabody with the latter paying the higher share. All other claims for damages and legal costs will be dropped by the three companies. The French subsidiary had previously agreed to acquire the Australian coal mines and properties for Dollars 245m plus an additional figure to take account of any rise in the company's net asset value. Costain's share price yesterday rose 4p to 35p following the removal of uncertainty over the sale. See Lex</p>

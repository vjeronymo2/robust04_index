			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Allen expands as profits double Allen, the construction and property development group, yesterday announced the acquisition of DJ Ryan &amp; Sons, a cable laying, civil engineering and building contracting business, for about Pounds 6.9m, to be financed by the issue of 4.34m shares. The Wigan-based group also reported a doubling of pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 3.05m, on turnover up 23 per cent, from Pounds 51m to Pounds 62.7m, in the year to April 3. The group ended a two-year dividend freeze, recommending an increased final of 3.6p for a total of 5.25p (5p). Earnings per share rose from 5.05p to 8.67p. Gearing at the year-end was 16.7 per cent, against 38.8 per cent last time. Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman, said that house completions, which had risen from 208 to 305 over the period, were expected to rise by some 25 to 30 per cent in the current year. The acquisition issue will represent 14 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Some 2.55m shares are to be placed at 150p apiece. Of the balance of 1.79m shares, Ryan has agreed to retain 1.2m for one year. Ryan, based in Preston, Lancashire, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.02m on sales of Pounds 34.8m in the year to March 31. At that date its net asset value was Pounds 3.6m. Mr Greenhalgh said the acquisition would allow Allen to expand into a related market in the north-west. Ryan has fixed-term contracts with British Gas, with which it has a 26-year relationship, as well as North West Water and Severn Trent to lay, replace and repair gas and water pipes. The company recently won its first contract to lay cables in the UK for Nynex, the east coast US telecommunications group. After completion of the acquisition by Allen, Ryan's building contracting and housebuilding divisions will be sold.</p>

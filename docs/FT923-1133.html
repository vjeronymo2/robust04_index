			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Juken Nissho to build mills in New Zealand JUKEN NISSHO, a Japanese forestry group, is to close its timber mills in Japan, replacing them with new facilities in New Zealand. Over the past two years, the company has bought extensive areas of former government-owned exotic forest in the North Island. Yesterday, Juken Nissho said it was building two mills in the Aupouri Forest in Northland, in the far north. These will cost NZDollars 100m (USDollars 53.68m) and will produce sawn and laminated timber, veneer and plywood. It is also to build a mill at Masterton, in the lower North Island, and at Gisborne, on the East Cape, in two years' time. Corporate Investments, a New Zealand investment holding company, yesterday announced it was selling its Allied Finance financial subsidiary for NZDollars 8.8m. Corporate Investments, which owns forestry interests and Montana Wines, the country's biggest winemaker, is under intense pressure to relieve its debt. In recent weeks it has sold most of its substantial Australian and New Zealand tourism interests. Allied Finance is being sold to Christchurch-based farming group Pyne Gould. The sale brings to NZDollars 14.8m the value of assets divested since July.</p>

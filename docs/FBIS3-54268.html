Before leaving, Rabin held consultations with Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres in preparation for Peres' meeting with PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Davos, Switzerland.    The discussion was long and detailed, and was attended by  Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur, IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] generals, and Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, who will  accompany Peres in Davos. It was stressed that Israel would  retain control of the external crossing points; there would be  no PLO presence on the Jordan bridges. At the terminals, Israel  would retain the right to check any person or object that gave  grounds for suspicion; however, every effort would be made to  make Israeli control of the terminal less visible.</p>

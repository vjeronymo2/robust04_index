			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: FORGET SIGNS -- WHAT'S YOUR AREA CODE?  </P> <P> There is a building in Pasadena where they make new area codes for Southern  California. If you call directory assistance, the operator will not admit this  building exists. Its number is unlisted. But somewhere in the dungeons of this  Pac Bell office, right now, a new area code is being planned for L.A.  </P> <P> Not all of L.A., of course. Just certain parts. Once again, the city has  outgrown 213 and some neighborhoods must be marked for exile to a new number, a  new identity. Eventually, in the next three or four years, a visitation will  take place in the dark of night. Whole blocks, small cities, will be taken  away, never to see 213 again.  </P> <P> This is not happy news, I know, and thus far the phone company has kept it  secret. Those of you who survived the 818 split in 1984 probably thought you  were safe. Well, you are not. This thing could hit anyplace, snatch anyone's  213. It won't be pretty.  </P> <P> If you don't understand the repercussions, think of it this way: there are only  three area codes that mean anything in this country. They are 212 in Manhattan,  202 in Washington, D.C., and our own 213. Everyday, from dawn to midnight, 212  gets on the horn to 213 and vice versa. In turn, both 212 and 213 light up the  fiber-optics to 202. These three form the supreme troika of codes; they run the  country, and you're either in this troika or you're out. Soon, a big chunk of  L.A. is going to be out.  </P> <P> And who's to blame for this new split? Not Pac Bell, as tempting as that might  be. No, it's us. It's the auto phoners, the faxers, the modem users, the  multiliners. We are eating up phone numbers so fast that even the 818 break-off  did not suffice. So we must make a sacrifice to our phone greed, a sacrifice of  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> And the issue, of course, is which neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Take a look at a map of 213 and you will see how hard the choice will be.  Compared to this, the 818 thing was easy. With 818, Pac Bell simply ran the  boundary down the ridgeline of the Hollywood Hills. Everyone to the north was  out. There was such a logic to it that the whining of the 818'ers was  fruitless.  </P> <P> This time, there's no geography to use. That means the company has to make its  decision on cultural grounds. Should the Westside be lopped off? Just picture  the wailing. Or should downtown become the cultural amputee, cut off from its  telephonic roots?  </P> <P> In truth, Pac Bell could go after the smaller players, like East L.A. or  South-Central. There's one major problem with this strategy: it would leave the  company vulnerable to the charge that Latinos and blacks had been gerrymandered  out of the code, leaving 213 to the rich whites. As I say, this could get ugly.  </P> <P> And there's the matter of the new number itself. This country has been gobbling  area codes so fast that only a few remain available. The phone company won't  reveal these numbers, but that's OK. We've made our own calculations, based on  the arcane rules of area code formation. The list of possibilities looks pretty  much like this: 310, 410, 903, 909, 910.  </P> <P> In my mind, there's only one choice. The numbers ending in 10 are entirely too  friendly for L.A. They're codes for the suburbs. And 903 is nowhere, a nebbish.  That leaves 909, a great code. Nine-Oh-Nine has dark power, it's a sort of  Darth Vader number. Nine-Oh-Nine could carry on the struggle with New York.  </P> <P> All of which leads me to my modest proposal. As we know, show biz has always  existed as a separate community in L.A., a world that's hidden and unavailable  to the minions. Swell. Let's recognize that, draw a circle around the show biz  neighborhoods and give them this new power code, 909. Then the rest of the  city, with the old 213, could disengage and go its own way.  </P> <P> Think of it. Outside the perimeter of 909, real people would matter once again.  Historians, plumbers and algebra teachers could get reservations at  restaurants. When someone slapped a cop, they'd just go to court and take their  medicine with no fuss. Newspapers, spared the celebrity fever, would have more  space to print stories about lost dogs.  </P> <P> As for the new 909'ers, they would hate it at first but soon adjust. Here would  be a universe all their own, uncluttered by the rest of us. Only the trade  papers would be circulated, no need to read other news. Only white limos would  purr down the streets.  </P> <P> So consider carefully, Pac Bell. This plan has possibilities and, after all,  someone has to get the ax. Brood on it.  </P></p>

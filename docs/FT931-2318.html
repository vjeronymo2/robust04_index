			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc remains under pressure THE FRENCH FRANC remained under pressure against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday as dealers continued to express disappointment that the Bundesbank had not reduced its Lombard rate at its council meeting on Thursday, writes James Blitz. The French currency fell as low as FFr3.4160 against the D-Mark at around lunchtime in London. It later closed unchanged at FFr3.4100, but still around 2 centimes above its ERM floor against the German currency. Another reflection of the pressure on the franc was that 1-month interest rates rose as high as 12.5 per cent first thing in the morning and hovered around that level throughout the day. Dealers are clearly preparing to test the commitment of a new French government to the franc fort policy following tomorrow's first round of parliamentary elections. There is concern that a new administration may float the franc in order to bring French interest rates down, although leading right-wing politicians reasserted yesterday that they were committed to the current parity. A more important issue is whether the Bundesbank decides to reduce the rate at which it lends funds to commercial banks in its weekly intervention on Tuesday. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, believes that a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate, currently at 8.25 per cent, will allay the pressure on the franc. Another potential source of trouble for the French currency comes from the peseta, which weakened against the D-Mark despite the fact that Spain was on holiday. The peseta closed at Pta71.59 against the D-Mark from Pta71.48. According to one dealer, the Bank of Spain has spent Dollars 5bn on intervention in the last two weeks. The D-Mark's strength continued to take its toll on the dollar. After closing at DM1.6415 on Thursday night, the dollar dropped to a low of DM1.6260 in London trading before closing at DM1.6330. Underlying sentiment in the market remains bullish for the US currency. But Mr Jim O'Neill, head of currency research at Swiss Banking Corporation and a long-time dollar bear, believes the US currency will slip to DM1.52 within the next 3 months. Sterling rose a pfennig after poorer-than-expected inflation figures in the UK heightened speculation that the government may lean towards tightening monetary policy. The pound lost ground later, closing at DM2.4325 from a previous DM2.4400.</p>

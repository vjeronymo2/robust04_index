			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Yemen opposition hopes to banish rule by the gun: The poll may be dubious, but at least it's happening SO heavy are the odds against Yemen's opposition parties, according to Mr Abdul Rahman al-Jifri, outspoken president of the Sons of Yemen party, that one wonders why he is bothering to lead his party into the country's first multi-party elections at all. Plucking from sprigs of qat leaves, the mild stimulant munched universally by Yemen's chattering classes, Mr al-Jifri heaps accusations of electoral trickery against the ruling coalition of the General People's Congress and the Yemen Socialist party - respectively the former ruling parties of North and South Yemen. His own group, which he describes as liberal Moslem, is fielding 90 candidates in Tuesday's polls. It is among the biggest of the 40 or so parties seeking a place in Yemen's first elected parliament since unification in 1990. But Mr al-Jifri holds out scant hope for their collective chances in the face of some characteristically robust Yemeni politicking. To cook the results, Mr al-Jifri alleges, the ruling parties are filling in soldiers' ballot papers in advance. He says they are trying to contrive a strike at the state television centre to deprive other parties of publicity. But mostly, he says, they are buying votes with money, offers of jobs and, in some cases, Kalashnikov rifles, a prize Yemeni status symbol and worth up to Dollars 800 each. The litany is barely finished before an aide enters Mr al-Jifri's long, elegantly carpeted qat salon, replete with two giant water pipes and seating for about 40, to hand him a slip of paper, which he reads. 'Apparently someone in a government car has been seen tearing down our posters,' he says. 'A full colonel dressed in uniform. A black landcruiser, plate number 4272. A government car. Amazing.' But Mr al-Jifri, a veteran of violent campaigns against the British and the communists in former South Yemen, looks most unamazed. Just two weeks ago his son was interrupted from an evening bath by a loud bang and a shower of gypsum. Someone had tossed a hand grenade at Mr al-Jiffri's villa. As he sees it, the party's work, as with other smaller parties, is to establish the primacy of the ballot box as a means to political power in a country where for decades guns, armies and tribal might, corruption and subtle intrigue have held sway. 'We want to get one thing out of this,' Mr al-Jifri says. 'That the process is started.' The sentiment is echoed by Mr Mohammed Abdul Malek al-Mutawakil, a softly-spoken university professor running as an independent. 'I'm not standing in this election to win,' he says. 'For me what's important is that we have to establish the tradition.' But while international observers in Yemen say they are happy that the government has set up a voting procedure which should minimise fraud - complete with watermarked ballot papers and indelible ink to mark voters' fingers - opposition candidates say this misses the point. And they allege connivance between the ruling parties to stage manage the result from the outset. Constituencies were drawn up to favour ruling party candidates, they say. 'Independent' candidates, 1,200 of whom pulled out this week, were allegedly placed in all 301 electoral districts to wrong foot the opposition. Most important, they say, in a land of 80 per cent illiteracy, the state has severely limited vital media slots to just two 15-minute broadcasts per party. Senior government figures have so far proved reluctant to discuss such charges with foreign journalists, present in unaccustomed numbers to witness what Yemen touts as the first free multi-party elections in the Arabian peninsula. But, whatever the truth to opposition allegations, they are at least more free to air them than most politicians in neighbouring states. Yemen's more than 100 newspapers are probably the Gulf's freest. 'In terms of freedom of expression we've achieved a lot,' says Mr al-Mutawakil. 'But in terms of administration and good government we're falling behind. We hope this election can make at least a start.'</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Court threat to Brazil's inflation fight THE Brazilian government's battle against inflation is threatened by regional court decisions declaring unconstitutional its seizure of 80 per cent of the nation's assets and savings in March last year. In the first few months following the freeze many companies succeeded in liberating their funds, out of an estimated Dollars 80bn blocked. However, the government still holds 6.4 trillion (million million) new cruzados - about Dollars 28bn or the equivalent of 6 per cent of gross domestic product. It is committed to start paying this back in 12 monthly payments from September 16. However, in the last two weeks courts in Recife and Sao Paulo have ruled unanimously that the freezing was unconstitutional and that the money should be paid back immediately. Courts in Rio and Braslia are expected to follow suit. Polls show that the majority of the population is sceptical of the government's promise to start paying back the frozen funds in September. Thousands of people have already succeeded in gaining access to their money through individual court actions - according to the central bank's legal department there are 40,000 cases pending. The recent regional court decisions means the process is speeding up. The central bank, fearing the explosion in the monetary supply that would be caused by having to repay all the money at once, is to appeal to the Supreme Court. 'This money is equivalent to 50 per cent of total current money supply,' said Mr Luis Eduardo de Assis, the bank's head of monetary policy. 'Obviously if we have to pay it back instantaneously instead of the gradual programme we intend it would have an immense impact and lead to a big increase in inflation.' It is not clear the Supreme Court will rule in the government's favour but Braslia at least hopes to delay a decision. Mr Marcio Moraes, one of the Sao Paulo judges, said the blocking was an act of force not a legal act. 'If it had been done by an individual it would be robbery. As it was done by the government it is a crime against the constitution.'</p>

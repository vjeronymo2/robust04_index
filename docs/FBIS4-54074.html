			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan's Crime Must Be Counted"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- With no amount of  attempt can the Japanese reactionaries veil their dark color as  nuclear culprits and they must face a trial. Japan's crime in  concealing a large quantity of plutonium must be counted.    NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today.    Noting that the Japanese reactionaries are resorting to  despicable artifices to hush up the recently exposed concealment  of 70 kilograms of plutonium at the Tokaimura nuclear  fuel-making plant, the analyst says:    Japan is claiming that it was ignorant of a large quantity  of  plutonium sticking to the equipment of the fuel-making plant.  But this far-fetched argument is unbecoming to Japan boasting  itself of being advanced in nuclear technologies. No less  ridiculous is the excuse of Japan that the case resulted from  the negligence of cleaning of the equipment by the plant which  was too much engrossed in the production of nuclear fuel through  the operation of the fast breeder reactor.    Plutonium possessed by Japan now reportedly amounts to 26  tons. It was several dozen years ago that Japan put its first  nuclear facilities into operation. Now many reactors are  operating in Japan. So, not much penetration is required to  guess how much plutonium Japan is now concealing besides the  exposed amount.    The Japanese reactionaries' concealment of plutonium is  aimed  at manufacturing nuclear weapons. If not, why has it kept  dangeorus nuclear materials in secrecy?    The Japanese reactionaries, captive to the design of  reinvasion, are making haste with the conversion of Japan into a  nuclear power in a bid to realise their old dream of "the  greater East Asia coprosperity sphere."    Japan's nuclear armament has reached a very dangerous stage.    The Japanese reactionaries' noisy row to do harm to the DPRK  over its "nuclear development" is nothing but a petty trick to  cover up their nuclear armament.    They are now openly claiming that if "sanctions" were taken  against the DPRK by the United Nations, Japan would blockade the  seas and send troops of "the self-defence forces" to the Korean  War.    By going ahead with nuclear armament, the Japanese  reactionaries are digging their own grave.</p>

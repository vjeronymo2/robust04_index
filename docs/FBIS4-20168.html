			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Lieutenant General Arne Solli, </F> Norway's next defense chief, by Olav Trygge Storvik; place and  date not given]    [Text] Lieutenant General Arne Solli, Norway's next  defense chief, recommends Norwegian EU [European Union]  membership. "Becoming a member of the EU would without doubt be  advantageous to Norwegian security," Solli said in an interview  with AFTENPOSTEN.    "It is true that we are members of NATO, but if we look at  developments inside the alliance, I think it would be an  advantage from the point of view of security to have stronger  ties to the European pillar within NATO."    After a year as supreme commander in northern Norway  Lieutenant General Arne Solli was yesterday appointed the new  defense chief to succeed Admiral Torolf Rein. The timing of the  government appointment came as a surprise, even though it has  been clear for some time that Solli was a strong candidate.  Even though the government has made the appointment now, the  changeover will not take place until 31 October.    The future defense chief made it clear that he does not want  to be used by either side in any controversial domestic  political showdown on the EU issue. He was therefore unwilling  to touch on all the advantages and disadvantages of Norwegian EU  membership. On the other hand it would be remarkable if Norway's  top professional soldier did not have views about what he thinks  best serves Norway's security interests.    But if Norway does not become a member of the EU after the  referendum? "Yes, well, then we will just have to make the best  of the situation," Solli said. "We would still be a member of  NATO and relations with the United States will always be  important to us, whether or not we are a member of the EU. The  problem is that we could be left standing outside forums where  important decisions that will have a direct effect on us are  reached."    The next defense chief said that he has held talks with U.S.  military authorities which he described as "good" and in which  he met with "understanding" for Norway's defense problems. "I  think that the Americans have given us good signals recently  that they take defense cooperation with Norway seriously. I  take the outcome of the COB [Colocated Operating Base]  negotiations as support for my view on this point," he said.    But will the United States continue to have defense  interests  in the northern regions now that its former rival is no more?  "I agree that we do not need to conjure up the image of an  opponent who no longer exists. However, neither can we ignore  the fact that we are living in an unstable international  situation. Changes could take place, and they could take place  quickly. We must therefore have a potential to defend ourselves  and bring reinforcements into the country," the future defense  chief said.    He believes that EU membership will give even greater  security. And in addition membership will open up new  perspectives for the defense of the Nordic area. "I am thinking  here of the longer-term perspectives which open up here if  Sweden and Finland also join the EU," Solli said. He believes  that in such a situation it would be logical to coordinate  defense policy and defense plans on a Nordic basis. But here  realizes that there is some way to go before this happens.  "This is a nonissue today. For neither Sweden nor Finland have  given any signals in this direction, but it could become an  issue if all three countries become members of the EU," Solli  said.    He takes the view that the country's defense chief has a  duty  to an play active role in providing information about the state  of the country's defenses and about his view of current defense  problems. He thinks that the current defense chief, Torolf Rein,  has been good in this respect, but he expressed regrets that it  is not always easy to attract the attention of the media despite  the efforts made.    Solli believes that the defense leadership should not  abandon  the concept of "anti-invasion defenses" even though some people  have urged this. "No, I think that we should keep the concept,"  he said. "It describes our capacity to meet and attack with a  united force and with action by all three branches of the  defense forces. The concept will continue to have validity in  the future. We must use all the means at our disposal to try to  make anti-invasion defenses in northern Norway a reality. The  problem today is acquiring the money that is needed," he said.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Food for Thought: A former cook at a restaurant owned by rock 'n' roll legend  Chuck Berry has accused the guitarist of videotaping her while she used the  restroom at the Missouri establishment. Hosana Huck filed a lawsuit against  Berry, 63, in St. Charles County Circuit Court. She was a cook at the Southern  Air Restaurant in Wentzville, about 35 miles northwest of St. Louis. The suit  claims that the musician-restaurateur "intentionally and without just cause or  excuse intruded upon (Huck's) seclusion and privacy without her permission by  surreptitiously making or manufacturing videotapes" depicting her in  embarrassing states. Berry could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> * Hair o' the Pup: Weaver Kim Mikel, 28, of Walled Lake, Mich., says she plans  to make her next fashion item from the fur of her pet Afghan dog, Oliver.  Mikel's yarn is usually made from the fur of Angora rabbits that she and her  husband, Jim, raise in their barn. She also experiments with combinations of  sheep's wool, mohair, cotton and soon, the hair of the dog. Before long "It  will be chic" to wear something made from your own pet's fur, she says.  </P> <P> * Clothes Conscious: Former Billionaire Boys Club leader Joe Hunt, convicted in  one murder and acting as his own attorney against charges in another, says he  likes being in court. Hunt, who is charged with murder, kidnapping and  conspiracy in the death of Hedayat Eslaminia, a wealthy Belmont, Calif.,  resident who was once an adviser to the Shah of Iran, told the press in Redwood  City, Calif., that he almost believes he is a free man when he walks into court  dressed in an expensive tailored suit to argue pre-trial motions. "I'm in a  suit and wearing something other than a Jack La Lanne jumpsuit. I can forget  about spending most of my time in a cage," Hunt said. Outside of the time he  spends in court, Hunt is confined to a maximum-security jail cell. BETTIJANE  LEVINE  </P></p>

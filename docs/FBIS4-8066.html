			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 10 Apr (TANJUG) -- The NATO combat air  force carried out an attack in the area of Preljuc and Goli Vrh,  some 12 km southwest of Gorazde, at about 1820 this evening, the  command of the Herzegovina Corps said in a statement.    This was an act of open aggression against the people of  eastern Herzegovina, an action against civilian targets far from  the front line, it was stressed at the corps command.    The command did not confirm claims by western agencies that  NATO planes (reportedly U.S. F-16's) had hit two Serb tanks.</p>

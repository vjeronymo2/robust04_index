			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / China puts the brake on rapid economic growth CHINA yesterday gave the clearest indication yet of its worries about too-rapid growth and indicated the steps it is taking to slow down the economy. Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier who has additional duties during the absence due to ill health of premier Li Peng, told foreign ex-heads of government meeting in Shanghai that worry about overheating was 'understandable, and it is also a major concern to myself.' 'Over the past six months, industrial growth has been too fast, investment has heated up, inflationary pressures gradually accumulated, financial and monetary markets grown tight, and disparity between regions in terms of economic development widened,' Mr Zhu said. 'Indeed, there is a danger of macro-economic imbalance. Although these phenomena are not yet uncontrollable or unbearable, the Chinese government pays great attention to them.' 'Since the beginning of this year, we have adopted rather prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Meanwhile, we will adjust the intensity in the implementation of our macro-economic policies whenever required by the economic situation.' Mr Zhu said growth would be at least 10 per cent this year, compared with 12.8 per cent in 1992. Foreign economists said there was evidence that a squeeze on credit was already having an effect. Mr Hugh Peyman, regional strategist for Asian Capital Partners in Singapore, said foreign companies are being asked for capital by their Chinese joint venture partners. He forecast that growth would drop to a 5.5 per cent annual rate by the second quarter of 1994 - though it would quickly rebound - and that inflation would rise to 13 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared with 8.6 per cent in the first quarter.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anne Segall: "OECD Sees Healthy UK Economy"] </F>   [Text] Paris -- The outlook for the British economy is  favourable, according to an Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development [OECD] report prepared in Paris and  due to be published in the middle of next month.    The OECD, which has just completed its annual review of the  British economy, is confident that the April rise in taxes will  fail to dent the recovery.    It believes that consumers will dip into their savings to  maintain spending with higher exports and a revival in  investment helping to broaden the base of the recovery    The OECD report includes a marginal downward revision from  2.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent in the forecast for economic growth  this year, but an upward revision to 3.25 per cent in its  forecast for 1995.    Unlike the European Commission which recently warned that  the  British economy would lose momentum, the OECD believes that the  recovery will gather pace through this year and into 1995.    It is also sanguine about the outlook for inflation, which  is  expected to remain comfortably below the 4 per cent ceiling set  by the government for both this year and next.    However, senior officials are concerned about the recent  shakeout in the gilts market and believe a modest rise in bank  base rates should be delivered "quite soon" to prevent the  deterioration in inflation expectations from feeding through  into wage setting behaviour.    Draft copies of the OECD's assessment of British economic  prospects have been seen by the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, who  was in Paris on Tuesday for the organisation's annual  ministerial meeting. He returned to London early yesterday to  discuss interest rate policy with Eddie George, the governor of  the Bank of England.    The OECD dismisses fears that the brisker than expected  recovery will create capacity problems which could rekindle  inflationary pressures. To the delight of Treasury ministers,  the forthcoming report will argue that the performance of the  economy has been transformed by the reforms of the 1980's and  that Britain is now highly competitive and well placed to take  advantage of the recovery currently under way in Europe.    While talk of a miracle is seen as exaggerated, officials in  Paris note that "something positive has definitely taken place."    Next month's reports will include graphs showing that while  Britain used to be able to achieve higher levels of productivity  only during periods of cyclical expansion, efficiency gains were  made right through the 1990's recession.    Since leaving the European exchange rate mechanism in  September 1992, the British economy has achieved an unusual  combination of reasonably rapid growth low inflation and a net  improvement in its trade position, something that the OECD  describes as a "hat-trick."    The Treasury is also in the process of revising up its  forecasts of 2.5 per cent growth this year and next but is  likely to take a slightly more cautious view.    The OECD's upbeat assessment of the British economy will be  accompanied by a special section in which the government's  health service reforms will receive enthusiastic approval.</p>

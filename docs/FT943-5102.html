			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Calor workers ballot on action Workers at Calor Gas, the gas products company, are holding a strike ballot over the introduction of personal contracts and pay cuts for some staff of up to Pounds 100 a week. The TGWU general union is balloting 370 drivers, filling-plant operators and distribution workers at the company and an additional 50 drivers working for Calor Transport, the contract transport division. The dispute arose, the union said, when the management proposed earlier this year to cancel the collective agreement for manual employees and replace it with personal contracts. At about the same time, drivers in the transport division were asked to accept a new agreement that would in effect cost them between Pounds 90 and Pounds 100 a week in pay. Calor said yesterday that the contracts and drivers' pay situations were separate, but that the union had chosen to lump them together. Mr Danny Bryan, national secretary for the TGWU commercial transport group, said that the union had previously had good industrial relations with Calor. 'Many of the people here have long service records with the company and can't understand why it is seeking to change things now,' he said. Calor said that it wanted to put employees on a salaried footing. Mr David McKinlay, communications manager, said: 'We are not wanting to derecognise the union. All we want to do is talk about pay and conditions with the individuals concerned.' The union is opposing the new contracts because they will make pay rises subject to personal assessments and introduce a new method of calculating pay. Mr McKinlay said nearly half the manual employees who had been offered individual contracts had accepted them. The pay reduction for drivers, he said, reflected a downturn in the road haulage market. The result of the ballot is expected later this week.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / The Long View: A forecast too far FIRST, an apology. Plainly, I made a bad miscalculation last year when, in the wake of Black Wednesday, I forecast that inflation would jump into the range of 6 to 7 per cent over the next year. As this week's figures have hammered home, the outturn is not going to be anything like as bad as that. Like many other people, I have been surprised at how little difference the exit from the exchange rate mechanism has made to the profile of inflation. The headline rate of 1.2 per cent for June is, of course, misleading. Cuts in mortgage rates have been worth 1.6 percentage points over the past year, and this bonus is likely to fall out of the annual comparison by early next year. The underlying rate is nearly 3 per cent. Why did I get it so wrong? Partly because I assumed there would be a comprehensive post-ERM rebalancing of economic policy. Interest rates would be cut very sharply, perhaps in stages to 4 or 5 per cent, and taxes would be increased, almost certainly indirect taxes of the kind that push the retail prices index higher. Sterling would fall a long way. These drastic measures, I thought, would be necessary to address the structural problems which show up in the notorious twin deficits, Pounds 50bn this year on government finances and Pounds 20bn on trade. If these policies had indeed been followed, I believe underlying inflation would now be around 5-5 1/2 per cent. In fact, the Treasury brought interest rates down, grudgingly, to only 7 per cent before being ordered by the prime minister to cut to 6 per cent in January (which was the last change). The sterling exchange rate index, about 92 this time last year while the UK was still in the ERM, reached a low of 76.0 in February but has recovered by about 7 per cent since then. More than half of the fall against the D-Mark since Black Wednesday has been regained (although sterling is still down by a quarter against the dollar and by a third against the yen). Taxes have scarcely been raised so far, although VAT will go on household fuel next year and Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is pondering whether to bite the bullet on taxes in his November Budget. The prospect after Black Wednesday seemed to be one of a painful but rather short adjustment in which real incomes would go down and profit margins would be widened. I was not much concerned about the danger of a permanent increase in inflation (the monetary fuel for such an acceleration is absent) but, rather, about a one-off upwards shift in the domestic price level. The problem now is that the re-balancing process remains sadly incomplete. It is hard to see a return to balance between imports and exports at this level of sterling. Companies are finding it hard to raise prices - indeed, a price war broke out among national tabloid newspapers this week - while the big consumer brand names in food and detergents are under heavy margin pressure. People in work are still enjoying rises in real incomes, even though earnings growth has dipped below 4 per cent. This brings me to the other reason why I was too pessimistic about inflation. The labour market has reacted with amazing restraint to the floating of sterling. Earnings growth was very slow to decline during the two years that the UK spent within the ERM, and it certainly seemed unwise to expect that pay increases after last September would become any more moderate than during the mid-1980s, when unemployment levels were roughly similar and pay inflation usually fluctuated between 6 and 8 per cent. Yet, it is obvious that conditions in the labour market are, in fact, now quite different, perhaps because the fear of unemployment is much more widespread than it was a decade ago when manufacturing industry bore the brunt. Or perhaps it is that people are fooled by a headline inflation rate of 1.2 per cent - although I doubt it. In fact, some people are arguing that the UK, along with most of the economies of the western world, is being gripped by profound deflationary forces connected with banking industry contraction and the competitive power of developing economies in the production of traded goods. The OECD expects average inflation in the developed economies to fall to 2.8 per cent in 1994. Global bond yields are continuing to trend strongly downwards because of the weakness of inflation (the UK's own long gilt yield fell below 8 per cent this week). But the gilt market is still discounting inflation of about 4.5 per cent, judging by the real yield on the index-linkers, and the City of London consensus is that headline inflation will rise to about 4.3 per cent by the end of next year (some leading forecasters are expecting 5 per cent, partly because indirect tax rises will at last be coming through). These inflation forecasts, however, are tending to be revised downwards all the while. It could be that the more moderate behaviour of the labour market will rescue the government's half-hearted strategy. But the risk is that because headline inflation will be rising next year, it will impose a delayed shock while the economy is recovering, thus giving a push to pay inflation; it would have been better for there to have been an instant shock while labour market confidence was at rock bottom last autumn and winter. Meanwhile, the structural imbalances in the economy pose a background threat; while things are going well, they can be financed easily; but if there is a mishap of some kind, they could easily generate crises of confidence in the gilt-edged and foreign exchange markets. That is why it would be so much better to see the back of them sooner rather than later. To help cure them we need, you might say, a little bit more of the right kind of inflation. But I am not going to make any more forecasts.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Computer review ordered at Exchange THE STOCK Exchange has appointed Andersen Consulting to examine the operations and future role of its trading and settlement computer systems. The Stock Exchange said yesterday that the contract did not include work on Taurus, the new settlement system, and that there would be no redundancies during the three months of the contract. However, it is thought that contracting out the department's operations would be favoured after that point. The contract is believed to be worth several hundred thousand pounds, although the Exchange said the cost would be covered by savings identified during the work and would require no new expenditure.</p>

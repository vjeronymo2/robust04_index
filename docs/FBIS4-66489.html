			<p>CSO     [Text] The Science and Technology Agency' s National  Aerospace Laboratory has completed construction of a large  supersonic wind tunnel and has begun test runs. The wind tunnel  is to be used for thermal/aero-dynamic tests during development  of the Japanese `HOPE' space shuttle experimental plane.  Official tests will start in FY95.    The new wind tunnel is I27cm in diameter, twice as big as  that which the NAL currently owns. The new wind tunnel is  capable of creating a steady wind speed of Mach 10 only, while  the old wind tunnel can produce Mach 5 to 11, but the new system  can operate 5 times a day, enabling 2.5 time more experiments  than before.    This is one of the largest wind tunnels in the world,  measuring up to those in operation in the U.S., costing a total  of about 3.5 billion yen.    The wind tunnel has at one end an air pressure storage  facility capable of producing 200 atmospheres of pressure, and a  large vacuum vessel at the other end. A heater, nozzle, and  measurement chamber are located between the two ends. When high  pressure air flows into the vacuum measurement chamber through  the nozzle, the air in the nozzle expands under adiabatic  conditions and accelerates its speed to generate an air current  of Mach 10.    Thermal/aero-dynamic data for high velocity flight vehicles  is often calculated through numerical simulations using  computers nowadays. However, it is most effective to confirm  such calculations through wind tunnel tests using scale models.  The NAL believes that the new wind tunnel will be `useful for  the development of space shuttles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who is in  Budapest on an official visit, was briefed this morning about  the situation of the minorities in Hungary. He then met leaders  of the three largest opposition parties. Anna Gulyas reports:    [Gulyas] We told the prime minister that when judging the  situation in Hungary it is necessary to consider the fact that,  bearing in mind that these are the second free, democratic  elections, neither the politicians nor public opinion have  really learned the rules of the game, Ivan Petoe, chairman of  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], said in a statement  summing up the discussion. He added: The room for maneuver in  forming coalitions is influenced by the fact that not only  rational but very often emotional factors have an impact on the  parties' coalition plans in Hungary.    Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP],  called the attention of Jean-Luc Dehaene to the fact that the  European Union should take greater account of the  characteristics of the region's countries. It would be good if  Brussels acknowledges the achievements of the states concerned  -- including those of our country -- in the development of a  market economy, and if it desists from treating the issue of the  east-central European countries' accession as one package.    In connection with NATO, we accept that the region must be  treated as a unified whole, Gyula Horn said, adding that during  the discussion he emphasized the Socialist Party's opinion that  in Hungary a referendum should precede NATO accession.    The Hungarian political parties are committed to membership  in NATO and the European Union. This was also affirmed by  Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz], at the discussion.    In connection with full membership in the European Union,  the  Belgian prime minister again highlighted the importance of  preparation. The extent of this influences the time it takes to  gain membership.</p>

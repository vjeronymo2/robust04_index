This statement  was made by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at a  press conference in Davos, Switzerland, where he was  participating in the World Economic Forum. "We want," he added,  "to become members of the European Union and we want to become  members of the G-7, turn it into the G-8." The Russian Prime  Minister, who met in Davos on Sunday [30 January] with OPEC  Secretary General Dr. Subroto, also said that "we will not  object if they want to examine the possibility of Russia's  participation" in the organization of oil exporting countries.</p>

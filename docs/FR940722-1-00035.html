In determining whether an item is considered to be an item of personal property, as opposed to real property, normally, any movable item is considered personal property even if physically joined to the land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commercial property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Articles acquired or held for sale or disposition by other commercial transactions on more than an occasional basis, or for use in a private profession or business enterprise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Commercial storage.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Property stored at a commercial facility for the convenience of the claimant and at his or her expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum amount.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Loss or damage amounting to less than $25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;15.16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims involving carriers or insurers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the event the property which is the subject of the claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a commercial carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Whenever property is damaged, lost or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Whenever property is damaged, lost or destroyed incident to the claimant's service and is insured in whole or in part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the claim against the Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from the carrier or insurer had the claim been timely or diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution, or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit his claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final approval or denial of the claim is made by the carrier or insurer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Upon submitting his or her claim, the claimant shall certify in his claim that he or she has or has not gained any recovery from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If final action has not been taken by the carrier or insurer on the claim, the claimant shall immediately notify them to address all correspondence in regard to the claim to the appropriate Office of the Solicitor of Labor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The claimant shall advise the appropriate Office of the Solicitor of any action taken by the carrier or insurer on the claim and, upon request, shall furnish all correspondence, documents, and other evidence pertinent to the matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The claimant shall assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment on the claim accepted by him or her, all rights, title and interest in any claim he or she may have against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the incident on which the claim against the United States is based. After payment of the claim by the United States, the claimant shall, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent of the payment received by him or her from the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Where a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before his or her claim under this subpart is settled, the amount or recovery shall be applied to the claim as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

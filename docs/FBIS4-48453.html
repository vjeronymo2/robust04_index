			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Helen Grace] </F>   [Text] More arrests are in the pipeline as the  international team investigating the Goldstone Commission's  allegations of police complicity in Third Force activities  continues to probe criminal conduct in the police force.    The investigation -- which has already led to the arrest of  four men including former Vlakplaas training camp commander  Lieutenant- Colonel Eugene de Kock -- has expanded beyond the  Goldstone Commission's allegations of gun smuggling to the IFP  and is now embracing a diversity of other allegations.    The team is understood to be receiving information from a  "deep throat" in the SAP [South African] about a secret police  slush fund -- controlled by a division called Stratkom -- to  finance disinformation about the ANC.    Several senior policemen said to be in charge of the  operation, which was allegedly still operating late last year,  are now under scrutiny. Sources close to the investigation  team, led by Transvaal Attorney-General Jan D'Oliveira, declined  to furnish any details on the team's work yesterday. One  source said, however, that more arrests were likely in the near  future.    The first men arrested once the team began its work on the  Goldstone Commission report on arms smuggling were Captain de  Kock, Sergeant Jannie Hannekom and Ben van Zyl, believed to have  been a former detective at the Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad  and latterly a police informer.    Last week, a man called James Ntsibande was also arrested in  connection with evidence found by the investigation team. All  the men are charged with murder and are in police custody.    De Kock and Hannekom are scheduled to appear in the Pretoria  Regional Court again today, and Van Zyl and Ntsibande will  appear in court tomorrow.</p>

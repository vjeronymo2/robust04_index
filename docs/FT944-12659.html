			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Apec confident on free trade Mr Rusli Noor, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) secretariat, yesterday expressed confidence that the November 15 Apec summit in Indonesia would help accelerate plans to liberalise trade in the Asia-Pacific region, despite the reservations of some members. 'There are certainly some sorts of concerns (on the free-trade plan) among the members of Apec,' he said. Although it was not possible to assess the impact of such concerns on the summit, Apec's goals of trade liberalisation could eventually be realised. Apec groups Australia, the US, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. Chile will become a full member in November. At the summit, in Bogor, Indonesia, leaders of the 18 economies will discuss ways to remove rules that hamper trade. China and Malaysia have said they will not accept a binding timetable for free trade, while a Japanese trade official has said that, although Tokyo basically supports freer trade, it is not ready to accept blindly all proposed liberalisation measures.</p>

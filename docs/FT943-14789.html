			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Crackdown ordered on derivative risks A special team is to monitor the ability of the largest securities houses to assess the risks they take with complex derivative products. The team is being organised by the the Securities and Futures Authority, the regulator for securities and futures brokers in the UK. After a series of inspection visits by the SFA some of the firms, which are mainly subsidiaries of the world's largest commercial and investment banks, have been told to alter their risk models and their management structures. The SFA is insisting that firms whose senior directors do not have a reasonable grasp of work done by those who design complex products should appoint a team which does understand them and which should then report directly to the board. Derivatives are contracts, such as futures and options, which pledge to receive or deliver underlying financial instruments. In its annual report for the year ended March 31 the SFA said the switch in strategy followed a review of the way its surveillance division carried out its duties at firms 'whose operations cover a wide range of different products and especially over-the-counter and derivative products'. The special team will monitor the activities of 24 leading securities houses, and an annual 'risk management review' will be conducted. So far reviews have been conducted at 12 firms, the annual report said. The change in strategy reflects growing concern among securities regulators worldwide about whether firms which sell over-the-counter derivatives understand the risks they take on. In particular, the SFA is looking at the models which each firm uses for fixing the pricing of complex customised derivative products for which there are no screen-based prices. The prices of these products vary widely with market movements and the amount of capital required to be held for each will vary widely, depending on how the price is determined. Regulators fear that inadequate pricing models will leave firms holding too little capital to cover losses in highly volatile trading conditions such as those earlier this year. On other matters, the SFA expressed concern that the disciplinary process and its appeals procedures were increasingly lengthy, with long periods elapsing between the discovery of rule violations and public announcements of disciplinary actions. Mr Christopher Sharples, the chairman, said the SFA board was considering ways of speeding the process.</p>

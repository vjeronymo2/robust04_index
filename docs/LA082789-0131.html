			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TACOMA CLEAN-NEEDLE PROGRAM IS BACKED BY ADDICTS, OPPOSED BY OTHERS  </P> <P> Dave Purchase spends most afternoons trading gossip with a slow parade of drug  addicts on a gritty downtown sidewalk.  </P> <P> But Purchase, a cheerful, engaging man, has something else to trade with the  drug users he calls "just folks" and counts among his friends.  </P> <P> "How ya doin', Pumpkin?" he asked a woman with haunted eyes as he handed her a  clean hypodermic needle for the used one she dropped into a little red box  sitting on a folding table. "Not too bad," she said with a tired smile.  </P> <P> "That's great," Purchase boomed. "That's great."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brings in Pair of Needles  </P> <P> A woman with a headful of tiny black braids brought Purchase a pair of needles  she had used to feed a heroin habit. She lingered in the feeble sunshine with  fellow junkies to watch the action. Down the street, a squad car screeched to a  stop and a policeman alighted to drag a fallen-down drunk to the curb.  </P> <P> "I shoot heroin . . . I'm a dope fiend," the woman with braids said to a  visitor. "But I come down here most every day for clean needles. I like the  high, man, but I don't want to die for it. I don't want no AIDS."  </P> <P> The 31-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Stephanie, talked of enrolling  in a treatment program to kick her 10-year habit. She pointed at Purchase. "The  rig man there -- he cares what happens to us."  </P> <P> In this neighborhood of half-abandoned buildings, sagging fences and  weed-choked lots, Purchase and his crew of county health workers have built  what is hailed as the nation's first successful program to reduce the number of  dirty needles among drug addicts in an attempt to slow the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Cities Adopt Plan  </P> <P> The program, which swaps 1,500 clean needles for dirty ones a week, is being  studied or at least partly duplicated in places like Honolulu, Boulder, Colo.,  and San Francisco. Observers are impressed by an unexpected bonus: new access  to elusive inner-city addicts and a chance to help break their habits.  </P> <P> Critics include Bush Administration officials, who say backers of such programs  have yet to show that they slow the spread of AIDS. State lawmakers and some  treatment experts say Tacoma's program not only violates the state's drug  paraphernalia law but that it tacitly sanctions illegal drug use.  </P> <P> "To put up a little table to exchange needles like Mr. Purchase does is like  Alcoholics Anonymous' putting up a bar on the sidewalk and giving out free  drinks while passing out pamphlets against drunk driving," said the Rev. Joe  Ellis, whose Tacoma Rescue Mission is just up the street from where Purchase  hands out needles every afternoon but Sunday.  </P> <P> Purchase has little patience for critics like Ellis. "You know what these  people are really saying? They are saying, 'Let 'em die.' Either that or they  haven't seen the evidence that needle-sharing is spreading AIDS."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Began as Personal War  </P> <P> Purchase, 49, a former drug counselor, received local government funding and a  staff in January after starting the program with his own money a year ago as a  personal war on the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> The $45,000 program's purpose is simple, he said. "If you want to slow the  spread of AIDS, you have to slow the spread through dirty needles." Sharing of  needles has surpassed homosexual contact as a cause of AIDS' spread.  </P> <P> Intravenous drug users account for 27% of all AIDS cases nationally; as of  mid-July, 99,936 Americans had contracted the disease and 58,014 of those had  died. In Washington state, 1,383 AIDS cases have been reported and 753 of them  have died.  </P> <P> Purchase's war on dirty needles has drawn applause in the sad underground of  street addicts and among many health officials. But he is quick to note that he  would be out of business if authorities decided to enforce a misdemeanor state  law against delivering or possessing syringes without a prescription.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Permitted to Continue  </P> <P> Tacoma officials have permitted the program to continue because "these people  are not trying to commit criminal acts" but rather are waging a war on AIDS,  Tom Felnagle, chief criminal deputy prosecutor for Pierce County, said.  </P> <P> Purchase, a drug counselor for 20 years, said he owes addicts a great deal,  which is why he contracted with a medical supply house a year ago to distribute  needles himself, no questions asked.  </P> <P> "I worked in the business since 1969. These people paid my mortgage, put food  on my table; I mean I've been living off their misery for 20 years like any  decent social worker. I decided to do something for them."  </P> <P> Dr. Al Allen, the county health director, is excited by the new bridge to this  industrial port city's most elusive underclass -- longtime IV drug users. "You  do have to go to people you might not feel comfortable with, on their terms,  and be willing to wash their feet, so to speak, if you want to reach them."  </P> <P> Working out of a van, Purchase and his crew hand out condoms also, as well as  little bottles of bleach to clean needles -- and blueberry muffins. A health  worker is always with them, ready to offer counseling and other help.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Needle-Sharing Declines  </P> <P> County officials say they have found a "substantial decrease" in needle sharing  as a result of the program and have referred more than 150 addicts to treatment  programs after Purchase and his crew cultivated a relationship with them.  </P> <P> Opponents like Ellis and state lawmaker Charles Wolfe, a Spokane physician who  failed this year to obtain passage of legislation against needle exchanges,  note that backers have not demonstrated that the program slows the spread of  AIDS.  </P> <P> Worse, Ellis asserts, the program is unnecessary because AIDS among local IV  drug users is nowhere near as bad as in New York City and elsewhere. "They are  using East Coast statistics to justify the idea here," he said.  </P> <P> He bristled at the suggestion that he would just as soon let AIDS victims die.  "We spend over $2 million a year on drug and alcohol programs. Does that sound  like somebody who wants to let them die?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proof May Take Years  </P> <P> Another heath department spokesman, Terry Reid, said it is unfair to expect the  program to demonstrate in less than several years that it slows the spread of  AIDS. "How can you demonstrate success a year after the program starts when the  incubation period for the disease is about seven years?"  </P> <P> Purchase puts it another way: "If we're wrong, then we wasted a few cents a  needle. If we're right, we saved a lot of lives."  </P> <P> As a steady stream of addicts stopped at Purchase's table, Stephanie leaned  against a wall and explained addicts' willingness to use the program:  </P> <P> "We don't have to give our name. We don't have to do nothin' but bring the rig  man a dirty needle for a clean one, and the cops don't bother us. It's easy,  and I think it's workin'. Hey, dope fiends aren't sharin' their needles like  they used to, 'cause they can get clean ones without a lot of problems."  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Profits drop causes global ripple of fear: Hoist with its own petard - Southwest Airlines tumbles as fare war takes its toll Southwest Airlines is hardly among the biggest or best-known airlines: yet the extraordinary influence of this Texas-based US carrier was felt around the world at the end of last week. Global airline stocks took a battering after Southwest announced that fourth-quarter profits were going to be 'substantially below' its net income of Dollars 38.4m (Pounds 23.4m) a year earlier. In Europe, KLM's shares dropped nearly 4 per cent on Friday, and Lufthansa's fell by 2.2 per cent. On the face of it, the reaction was unjustified: Southwest's problems stem from conditions peculiar to the US domestic market. But investors were left wondering: 'If Southwest, of all airlines, is in trouble, what hope is there for the rest of them?' Southwest's fourth-quarter downturn ends a remarkable period of profits growth for the company - remarkable because it has contrasted so sharply with the heavy losses suffered by the rest of the US airline industry in recent years. Southwest has prospered because of its low costs. The airline specialises in short-haul shuttle services on high-density routes in the US. There are no in-flight meals or other frills; flights are frequent and turnarounds are fast; and employees are hard-working, flexible and enthusiastic. As a result, South-west's operating costs per available seat mile are just 7.1 cents - 19 per cent below the US industry average of 8.8 cents. Low costs have enabled Southwest to grow rapidly in the deregulated US market by charging rock-bottom fares. Expanding from its home territory of Texas, it has spread across the southern states and has become the biggest flight operator within California. Last year it began an assault on the north-east by offering flights on the Baltimore-Chicago and Baltimore-Cleveland routes at up to 85 per cent less than existing fares. Southwest's strategy has led to a revolution in US air travel, at least on short-haul routes. It has turned flying into a low-cost, high-volume commodity business. Taking a flight on many routes in the US today is like catching a bus: seats are unassigned and the service is rudimentary, but the fare is cheap. The trouble for Southwest is that other US carriers have responded to this transformation by trying to mimic its formula. In markets where Southwest operates, they have slashed fares in an attempt to keep market share. In California, United Airlines has set up an operation called United Shuttle to compete directly with Southwest. On the east coast, Southwest is slugging it out in a three-cornered contest with Continental Airlines and USAir. Until recently, the main victims of these fare wars had been Southwest's competitors. Forced to match Southwest's low fares but lacking Southwest's low costs, they had incurred heavy losses on routes where the competition was strong. The other US carriers, however, are working to get their costs down. A year ago, South-west's operating costs per available seat mile were 26 per cent below the industry average. Today, at 19 per cent, the gap is still wide, but it is narrowing. So does the fourth-quarter profits downturn indicate that the party is over for Southwest? Not according to the company. On Friday, it said the biggest factor behind the downturn had been the cost of integrating Morris Air, a regional carrier based in Salt Lake City which it bought a year ago but which has only recently been absorbed at an operational level. Still, Southwest acknowledged that fare competition had played a role. Other airlines were matching its fares on routes where they competed, the company said, so it had held a number of special offers during the quarter. 'This is as close as you can get to war in a peacetime environment,' a spokesman remarked. Southwest said some of its fare cuts had probably been too steep and it would not be repeating them; and with Morris Air now fully integrated, it expected profits to bounce back in next year's first quarter. 'We feel very confident that growth will be back in line with what shareholders are used to,' it said. In the longer term, Southwest insists that it will remain one jump ahead of other airlines by getting its own costs even lower. Next month, for example, its pilots will be asked to ratify a highly unusual 10-year labour contract under which they will get no wage increases for the next five years, instead receiving share options. Whether or not Southwest's optimism is justified, the outlook for the rest of the US industry remains poor. With too many aircraft chasing too few passengers, cut-throat fare competition looks set to continue and only the lowest-cost carriers have any hope of doing well. To the extent that the US air travel market today offers a glimpse of the rest of the world's tomorrow, the reaction of global airline stocks to last week's events was perhaps, after all, understandable.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW IRVINE SCHOOL  </P> <P> I thought that jails were the only institutions suffering from NIMBY (Not In My  Back Yard) until I read the article about Irvine's residents opposing an  educational institution (high school) in their residential tract.  </P> <P> Education should be a wanted institution. Students are being sent the message  that their institution of learning is detrimental to the neighborhood. Tustin  spent considerable time mapping out its future growth in newly annexed East  Tustin. With all the hoopla about Irvine being a planned city, they need to go  back to the drafting table and work within their physical boundaries.  </P> <P> SUSAN KNIGHT  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

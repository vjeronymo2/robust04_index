			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Muhammad </F> Kurayshan on 27 February, in Tunis -- recorded]    [Text] [Kurayshan] How do you react to the measures taken  by the Israeli Government against Jewish settlers in the  occupied territories?    ['Arafat] I regret to say that the decisions are hollow and  weak compared to the enormity and seriousness of the crime and  the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque. The Israeli Government  barely scratched the surface of the problem. It failed to get  to the bottom of the problem. It said nothing about the  collusion of units from the Israeli military. There is proof  that Israeli military units provided cover for the withdrawal of  the band that committed the crime. They even opened fire on  people and worshipers. Eight martyrs and more than 30 wounded  fell to military gunfire. I am here quoting Israel radio.    I regret to say that the decisions are far too weak in  comparison to the crime. We would have wished that the Israeli  Government had taken deterrent action against these criminals.  I am sorry to tell you that the Israeli Government is too  (?weak) to do that. If this tells us anything, it is that the  Israeli Government does not want to lay clear foundations for  peace. From the moment we began the negotiations, they have  been talking intermittently about security for the settlements  and settlers. What about security for the Palestinians, our  children, women, and masses? What about security for our  Islamic and Christian holy places? Let's not forget the al-  Aqsa Mosque massacre that was carried out by Israeli military  and security forces a few years ago. And now a massacre  committed by armed settlers in which Israeli military men were  also involved.    Yesterday, we saw television pictures of Israeli military  patrols [words indistinct] by patrols of armed settlers. I will  tell them this: Who do you think you are fooling with these  decisions? In any case, I never expected this government to  come up with more than that.    [Kurayshan] But don't you think that disarming so-called  extremists around Hebron and its vicinity may mark the first of  more stringent measures in the future?    ['Arafat] There are entire settlements run by these  extremists. I would like to remind Rabin of his reference to  political settlements run by political organizations. These are  his words and not mine. Let him dismantle these political  settlements if he is serious and does want peace. If the idea  behind the decisions is to mollify angry world opinion, then  they will not make a real difference. There is much more than  that at stake. They must know that our blood is not water and  that it will not be spilled in vain.    [Kurayshan] Mr. Chairman: Moreover, it was announced today  that the occupied territories will be closed.    ['Arafat, interrupting] Was it only today? What about  yesterday? In other words, the punishment is not directed  against the armed settlers but against the Palestinian people.  Yesterday and today, confrontations erupted in Rafah, Khan  Yunus, Gaza, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Jericho, Ramallah,  Nabulus, Tulkarm, Janin, Qalqilyah; namely, throughout the  country. The decision made by the Israeli army and government  was to escalate the situation against the Palestinian people.    The Israelis say that the four people whom they want to  arrest could not been arrested because they were holding a  conference. Who are they deceiving? However, everyone should  know that this will not undermine our people's determination,  will, and resolve. We are a people who offered many martyrs.  We are the guards of these holy lands and places.    As a saying by Prophet Muhammad goes: A group of my nation  is still preserving the religion, confronting their enemy, and  is not harmed by its enemies. This group will triumph with  God's help. Some people asked the prophet: Where is and what is  this group? The prophet answered: It is in Jerusalem and around  it, and it will be in a state of mobilization until the day of  judgment.    This is thus a divine message for this people, the guards of  these holy places.    [Kurayshan] Mr. Chairman: There is also hesitation on the  level of the UN Security Council about passing a resolution in  this regard. How do you view this hesitation?    ['Arafat] Regrettably, the U.S. Administration tried to  prevent the convening of a session. However, we, along with the  Arab, Islamic, and nonaligned groups as well as our friends in  Europe and the world, insisted that a session should be held.  We submitted a draft resolution which, first and foremost,  provides for international protection for our people, masses,  children, and women.    All should know that these settlements are illegal,  according  to several Security Council and UN resolutions. They are also  time bombs and constitute not only obstacles to peace but also  walls and mines against the peace process. I regret to say that  we do not agree on the U.S. draft resolution, and that we  insisted on the draft resolution submitted by the Arab group.  There is also a French draft resolution, which is not a bad  one. However, it is sad that the U.S. draft resolution did not  mention the Ibrahimi Mosque by name. Instead, it mentioned the  Ibrahimi Mosque by its Israeli name. This mosque was built  during the Umayyad times in the seventh century.    [Kurayshan] Originally, it was decided that the issue of  the settlements should be postponed until the final status of  the occupied territory is discussed. Do you believe what has  happened requires discussing this issue now before the final  status is reached?    ['Arafat] They say they want to take the weapons from the  extremists. But there are settlements in their names. From  Qiryat Arba' to Baruk [Goldstein] and so on, and so on. They  know them. More than once, Rabin said there are political  settlements which belong to political organizations. Let us see  what measures he will take.    [Kurayshan] You invited the negotiating Palestinian teams  and  you will meet in Tunis...    ['Arafat, interrupting] Here they are. Sa'ib ['Urayqat] has  just arrived; my brother Nabil [Sha'th] has just arrived; my  brother Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] arrived yesterday. Today the  Palestinian leadership will hold a session to evaluate the  situation.    [Kurayshan] What is expected in light of the Israeli  Government's decisions?    ['Arafat] I really do not like to give details before this  issue is thrashed out in details and in all its aspects with the  Palestinian leadership and in the presence of my brothers the  delegations heads.    [Kurayshan] What is the chance of responding to U.S.  President Bill Clinton's invitation to go to Washington, in  light of all that has happened.    ['Arafat] We thank President Clinton because of this  invitation, which shows his interest. However, before this, we  want to know which way we are heading. Are we going to take  pictures, as happened last September? Following this, Rabin  said there are no sacred dates. When we spoke of an  international presence, he said there are no sacred points?  This in effect means that there is no sacred agreement. Before  the Israeli Government answers us on all these things and before  we know the results of the Security Council meeting, we cannot  give answers. Let it be known, we will not allow the continued  killing of our people. Our blood will not be in vain. We are  all potential martyrs in defense of these sacred places. We are  potential martyrs and pioneers for our Arab and Islamic nations.    [Kurayshan] In conclusion, how do you view the remainder of  the march in the peace process, especially since you had been on  the verge of tackling all the existing differences, as has been  reported. Now after the massacre, and after it has become  clear...    ['Arafat, interrupting] It has become clear that in the  Israeli Army there are officers, forces, and commanders who  oppose the peace process. They are conniving with the settlers  and are forming a bloc [preceding word in English] to carry out  these massacres. Regrettably, this is what has transpired.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OIL'S SPREAD FRUSTRATES CLEANUP OF OCEAN SPILL  </P> <P> Although only a third of the nearly 400,000 gallons of oil spilled offshore  Wednesday remained at sea Sunday, the meandering crude was so dispersed that  cleanup crews held little hope of skimming much more of it from the water.  </P> <P> With a mild cold front expected in Southern California late today or Tuesday,  cleanup officials said resulting onshore winds could blow the estimated 131,000  gallons ashore to be collected by more than 400 workers who have been deployed  between Laguna Beach and Seal Beach with absorbent pompoms and foam pads.  </P> <P> Then again, officials said, waves associated with the weather front could break  up the oil altogether before the slick reaches land.  </P> <P> "I wish I knew where it would go," mused Roy McClymonds, general manager of  Clean Coastal Waters of Long Beach -- a nonprofit oil industry cooperative  assisting in the cleanup. "I wouldn't even want to guess."  </P> <P> On Sunday night, thick frothy oil, known as "mousse" to cleanup crews, began  coming ashore at the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier and along a 3.5-mile  stretch to the north. The Coast Guard said 200 workers were to be sent to the  soiled areas by midnight, and additional booms would be placed off the Anaheim  Bay jetty.  </P> <P> A small flotilla of 14 skimming vessels had been deployed Sunday, and another  four were to join in the cleanup today. However, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer  Dennis Hall said the skimmers were greatly handicapped in their oil collection  efforts because the oil had spread in many areas into a thin sheen, with  microscopic thickness in places. And the sheen -- already 14 miles long and  five to six miles wide Sunday afternoon -- was continuing to expand, Hall said.  </P> <P> The sheen was so thin that additional boats had to be called in Sunday to  corral the oil into heavy enough concentrations for the skimmers to function,  said McClymonds, whose cooperative is operating nine of the skimmers. This was  done, he said, by dragging long extensions of containment boom behind the  vessels.  </P> <P> "It takes longer," McClymonds said of the corralling process. "Obviously, we  have to go for a while until we get a concentration. The thinner the oil gets,  the less effective the skimmers are, until you concentrate the oil in a larger  pocket."  </P> <P> Coast Guard Capt. James Card, who is heading the cleanup, estimated that  roughly two-thirds of the oil has been accounted for -- about 23% through  skimming and other recovery methods and 43% through evaporation, leaving  131,087 gallons at sea.  </P> <P> Pointing to favorable winds since the spill, Card and other federal officials  said the Huntington Beach cleanup has proven more successful than in other  spills, which have seen an average recovery of only about 10% of the lost oil.  </P> <P> "We're very happy with the results so far, but we've still got a ways to go,"  Card said.  </P> <P> A critical spot now remains the mouth of the Santa River -- and the Huntington  Beach wetlands that sit just a half-mile behind it. The wetlands are a  vulnerable environment supporting rare animal species. Cleanup crews devoted  some of their efforts to the wetlands Sunday, working to shore up a temporary  dam in case of a storm.  </P> <P> "That is the one area we've seen so far that has had a real threat from the oil  and, of course, that's a very sensitive area," said Lt. Reed Smith of the state  Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> Despite a man-made sand dam and layers of booms at the mouth of the river, some  minimal amounts of oil may have seeped through during high tide Sunday and over  the last few days, officials said.  </P> <P> Gordon Smith, administrator for the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy,  said: "The probability is that if a storm comes Tuesday or Wednesday, the sand  (dam) just won't hold. The more saturated it gets, the more erosion there is."  </P> <P> Worried about that prospect, cleanup officials decided to add a layer of  sandbags to the Santa Ana River dam to try to protect it from a potential  storm. At the same time, they also planned to open a notch in the dam to allow  fresh water into the wetlands.  </P> <P> Should the oil reach the 2.5 acres of marshland behind the mouth of the river  -- an area that is now undergoing restoration, "it'll set us back years," Smith  said. The oil, tough if not impossible to clean from marshlands, would coat the  muddy bottom of the wetlands and threaten small animals at the base of its food  chain, he said.  </P> <P> Containment booms in place at entrances to a number of other environmentally  sensitive areas, including the Bolsa Chica wetlands, were reinforced Sunday  after a Coast Guard overflight showed that the oil sheen had extended farther  northwest, to an area off Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Floodgates connecting the Bolsa Chica wetlands to Anaheim Bay were closed as a  precaution. The mouth of Anaheim Bay, which is the entrance to the Bolsa Chica  sanctuary, was protected with a triple boom, a Coast Guard utility boat and a  skimmer. New booms were placed across the entrance to Alamitos Bay and the San  Gabriel River estuary late Saturday to protect marinas and wildlife habitat.  </P> <P> While only small amounts of oil washed ashore through most of Sunday, heavier  deposits appeared after dark, and cleanup crews stationed along the coast  braced for an onslaught of goop.  </P> <P> "It's not so bad right now, but we're expecting it to get much worse," said  cleanup worker Angela Bowen, 18, of Riverside as she took a lunch break from  her patrol duties near the Huntington Beach Pier.  </P> <P> In all, area beaches were patrolled by 415 workers for an assortment of cleanup  contractors retained by British Petroleum America Inc., which leases the  stricken tanker American Trader from American Trading Transportation Co. of New  York.  </P> <P> In the company's first hint at what the massive cleanup operation might cost,  British Petroleum spokesman Charles Webster said the company has already spent  "millions and millions" of dollars. The bulk of that expense has gone toward  hiring hundreds of cleanup workers and providing equipment, he said.  </P> <P> British Petroleum officials said their contractors managed to maintain a full  deployment Sunday, despite an edict from the federal Occupational Safety and  Health Administration on Saturday that some workers would have to be sidelined  temporarily because they had not undergone the required 24 hours of training in  oil cleanup.  </P> <P> All the workers remained on the job Sunday as contractors worked out a schedule  with OSHA for the training to be undertaken early this week, said Tony  Kozlowski, a British Petroleum spokesman.  </P> <P> Although cleanup crews on the beach had little to do except patrol and pick up  occasional oil-stained garbage, police and lifeguards kept beaches closed  between Newport Beach and Seal Beach to all but authorized visitors. In  Huntington Beach, however, that edict did not keep back the curious, who dashed  from an open bicycle path to the oily shore.  </P> <P> "One person will go, and then you get a whole flood of people," said Rick  Reisenhofer, a Huntington Beach state lifeguard. "We get a lot of looky-loos,  and you can't blame them really. A lot of people have been frustrated because  they don't know what they can do to help."  </P></p>

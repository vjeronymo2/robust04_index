			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DEAN OF POST-MODERN GAINS SCANT NOTICE IN SLEEK PREVIEW  </P> <P> Whoever heard of David Gordon?  </P> <P> Not many San Diego dance buffs, judging from the sparse audience on hand Friday  night for the local debut of Gordon's Pick Up Co.  </P> <P> More's the pity, since this doyen of post-modern dance and his sleek New  York-based ensemble offered a strikingly free-flowing sneak preview of "United  States," a huge patchwork quilt of a piece scheduled to be premiered at Kennedy  Center in September. And, unlike most imported dance works, this evening-long  mix of movement, words and music, had ties to San Diego.  </P> <P> Gordon's "United States" is geographically lopsided -- only a handful of  selected states provided the impetus for the segment showcased at Mandeville  Auditorium Friday and Saturday night. But this unique multimedia construction,  which will remain a work-in-progress for the next few months, has already found  its emotional balance and a crystal-clear sense of dance logic.  </P> <P> By virtue of local sponsorship (the San Diego Foundation for the Performing  Arts was one of 27 commissioning presenters nationwide), "United States" drew  some inspiration from the city of San Diego. Music by Harry Partch, for  example, was overlaid during a particularly poignant section on life in Los  Angeles. However, those fleeting allusions are likely to be enlarged after  Gordon soaks up the essence of San Diego.  </P> <P> Gordon, the most enduring trailblazer in post-modern dance, has an uncanny  sense of musicality, even when the "music" is the monotonous drone of a pedant  pontificating on the behavior of pigeons or the rambling storytelling technique  of a Colorado ranch hand.  </P> <P> Some of Gordon's fluid movement motifs are ironically juxtaposed against somber  textual material. Others take their cues from movie sound tracks or even the  repetitious rhythms of a weather report.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, this latest work reaffirms beliefs formulated by Gordon and  other rebel dance makers who turned dance on its ear back in the '60s, namely  the notion that random movement can indeed be labeled dance and that behavioral  expressions can constitute choreography.  </P> <P> Striking icons abound in "United States," but the dance never slows long enough  to dwell on them. It just unfurls in a seamless flow of fast-moving images,  like a piece of giant tumbleweed spilling across the stage.  </P> <P> In one playful segment, Gordon gets into the act, wrapping himself around a  huge banner while the University of Nebraska's marching band sets the frantic  pace. Later, the chunky but still wonderfully lithe dancer does a comic turn  with his partner, warding off a thunderstorm with an open umbrella.  </P> <P> Everything is grist for Gordon's mill, and he usually makes the most of his  found material.  </P> <P> In a section on Iowa, the voice-over reminds us that "saying a place is flat is  a way of making it simpler than it is." Naturally, the choreographer makes  merry with that concept in pure dance terms.  </P> <P> Though parody is never far from the surface of the dance, Gordon's lexicon is  highly lyrical and his phrasing cleverly devious. To the throaty strains of  "I'm Always Drunk in San Francisco," the dancers are loose-limbed and laid  back, but the dance is deliciously complex and affecting.  </P> <P> Valda Setterfield (Gordon's wife) is a striking presence in every appearance  with her shock of snow white hair. But she's positively irresistible in the  cheeky Judy Garland spoof that takes witty pot shots at the pretensions of  ballet as well.  </P> <P> Mozart goes post-modern in a wildly ebullient ensemble section danced at  breakneck speed. There is an easy amplitude of movement that becomes infectious  as the company breezes through this lively little romp. Another part of the  work propels the graceful dancers in slow motion, as if they were making their  way under water.  </P> <P> The finale on New England is brilliantly transposed against an excerpt from  Robert Frost. Near the end of the taped interview, the poet explains, "I'm  clarifying something for myself in verse." Change that to dance, and you know  what this inventive choreographer is all about.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Rumyantsev] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg June 11 TASS -- Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet paid an unexpected visit to St. Petersburg  on Saturday to wait for the Russian prime minister to return  from his vacation.    Originally, the talks between the 70-member Vietnamese  delegation and the Russian Government were scheduled for June 8-  10, but were postponed because of Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin's vacation until June 15-17.    The remaining four days the Vietnamese premier decided to  spend in St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city and the  twin city of Ho Chi Minh City.    At a meeting at the St. Petersburg mayor's office, Vo Van  Kiet regretted that there is still some mistrust left in  relations between Russia and Vietnam, but added that "Russia is  a special friend" for Vietnam. "The former Soviet Union always  helped us in the most difficult periods of Vietnam's life. We  will never forget that," the premier said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recent times, dams and diversions have increasingly prevented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upstream access to large rivers, and the species is now restricted to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small portion of its former range (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). Splittail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter the lower reaches of the Feather (Jones and Stokes 1993) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Rivers (Charles Hanson, State Water Contractors Association,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993) on occasion; however, the species now largely is confined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Delta, Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, and Napa Marsh.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Splittail are relatively long-lived, frequently reaching 5 to 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years of age. Females are highly fecund and produce over 100,000 eggs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each year. Populations fluctuate annually depending on spawning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> success, which is highly correlated with freshwater outflow and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of shallow-water habitat with submerged vegetation (Daniels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Moyle 1983). Fish usually reach sexual maturity by the end of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second year. Some variability in the period of reproduction exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because older individuals reproduce first, followed by younger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals (Caywood 1974). The onset of spawning is associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rising temperature, and peak spawning occurs from the months of March  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through May, although records of spawning exist for late January to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early July (Wang 1986). Spawning occurs over flooded vegetation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tidal freshwater and euryhaline habitats of estuarine marshes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sloughs and slow-moving reaches of large rivers. Larvae remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shallow, weedy areas close to spawning sites and move into deeper water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as they mature (Wang 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Splittail are benthic foragers that feed on opossum shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neomysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mercedis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), although detrital material makes up a large percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their stomach content (Daniels and Moyle 1983). Earthworms, clams,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insect larvae, and other invertebrates also are found in the diet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Predators include striped bass and other piscivores.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although primarily a freshwater species, the splittail can tolerate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salinities as high as 10 to 18 parts per thousand (ppt) (Moyle 1976,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). In recent years, this fish has been found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most often in slow-moving sections of rivers and sloughs and dead-end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sloughs (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1982, Daniels and Moyle 1983). Reports from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1950s, however, mention Sacramento River spawning migrations and catches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of splittail during fast tides in Suisun Bay (Caywood 1974). Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they require flooded vegetation for spawning and rearing, splittail are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently found in areas subject to flooding, such as the major flood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basins distributed throughout the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) survey data from the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 years indicate that the highest catches occurred in shallow areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Suisun and Grizzly Bays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The decline in splittail abundance has taken place during increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human-induced changes to seasonal estuary hydrology and freshwater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exports and the accompanying changes in the temporal, spatial, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative ratios of water diversions. These deleterious hydrological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects, coupled with severe drought years, introduced aquatic species,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and loss of shallow-water habitat to reclamation, seem to have reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species' capacity to recover from natural seasonal fluctuations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrology for which it was adapted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Analyses of survey data collected since 1967 (Meng 1993) by Service,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CDFG, and University of California, Davis, biologists from several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different studies indicate the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) On average, splittail have declined in abundance by 62 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since 1984. Percent decline varied among studies, dependent upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location of sampling effort. The greatest declines (over 80 percent)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were found from studies that sampled the shallow Suisun Bay area, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> center of the species' range. A study that began in 1980 at the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary, the outermost edge of splittail range, found the lowest percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline (34 percent). The number of splittail young taken at State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal pumping facilities (per acre-foot of water pumped) has declined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 64 percent since 1984;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Successful reproduction in splittail is highly correlated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wet years, but within these wet years, young-of-the-year taken per unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort has declined steadily from a high of 12.3 in 1978 to 0.3 in 1993;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) A strong relationship exists between young-of-the-year abundance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and outflow (i.e., river outflow into San Francisco Bay after water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exports are removed). As outflow increases, annual abundance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail young increases. Changes in outflow explain 73 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes seen in splittail young abundance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) When young-of-the-year abundance is predicted using unimpaired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outflow (i.e., river outflow without water exports removed), abundance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is higher than expected in dry years, indicating that water exports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect young-of-the-year abundance in dry years. In dry years when river  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outflow is reduced, high proportions of outflow are diverted, resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in lower than expected splittail young numbers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (5) Lower than expected numbers of splittail young persisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the recent 6-year drought in California. This prolonged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of poor reproductive success may affect the stock's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (6) Splittail are most abundant in shallow areas of Suisun and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grizzly Bays and are vulnerable to increased salinities. Salinities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase when, as a result of water exports and drought conditions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrapment zone (mixing zone at the freshwater-saltwater interface) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moved upstream. Concentration of splittail in shallow areas suggests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they are particularly vulnerable to reclamation activities, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredging and the diking and filling of wetlands; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (7) Splittail distribution has shifted upstream into the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento River and South Delta since 1983. Ninety-one percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail captured in San Pablo and lower Suisun Bays from 1967 to 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were taken before 1983, and 77 percent of the splittail captured in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower Sacramento River and South Delta were taken after 1983. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and Federal water project pumps are located near the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento River and South Delta, this upstream shift in splittail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution increases splittail mortality at the pumps. In 1993, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of splittail young taken at the Federal pumping facility was four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times higher than in previous years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A variety of factors affects the estuarine ecosystems and has led to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the decline of Sacramento splittail. Principal among these factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific to the Estuary are the altered hydraulics and reduced outflow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Delta caused by export of freshwater from the Sacramento and San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Joaquin Rivers through State and Federal water diversion projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional threats to this species include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) Loss at pumping plants and in-Delta diversion sites,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Loss of spawning and nursery habitat as a consequence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draining and diking for agriculture,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

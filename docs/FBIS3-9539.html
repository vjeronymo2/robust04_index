Thirty six percent  thought it was not very urgent, while 21 percent saw no problem  at all. 13 percent did not know.    Among inhabitants of Moravia and Silesia, the figure seeing  the issue as very urgent or urgent rose to 37 percent, while in  Bohemia it was 26 percent. When the results of previous polls  are compared, fewer and fewer people are seeing the problem of  local government as urgent.    In Bohemia, 24 percent want a system which includes a  division on the level of the "lands" of Bohemia and  Moravia-Silesia, while in Moravia 40 percent are for such a  solution.    Meanwhile, sixty-nine percent of the republic's inhabitants  think there are far more important tasks at present than that of  local government arrangements. 20 percent do not agree with  this statement, and 11 percent do not know.    Fifty-four percent said they still did not understand the  problem, and 51 percent said they were not very interested.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Another IVVM poll, conducted between January 7 and 13 also  among 885 respondents, asked people's opinions on other aspects  of local government, including taxation. 58 percent said that  if higher local administrative units were created that people  would pay more taxes, while 21 percent disagreed and a further  21 percent did not know.    If the higher local administrative units were formed, 58  percent thought that districts (the second tier in the present  system) should be preserved, 26 percent thought they should not  be, and 16 percent did not know.    According to 44 percent, the most important thing was that  Moravia did not pay for Bohemia, 39 percent did not agree and 17  did not know.    The opinion that the creation of higher local administrative  units would help central government to function better was  expressed by 42 percent. 30 percent did not agree with this,  and 28 percent did not know.    Seventy-eight percent agreed with the statement that local  government reform was only talked about and nothing was being  done. 68 percent said they believed that politicians were not so  much interested in the issue itself as in trying to reap  political benefits from the problem. 63 percent said they  believed politicians did not actually know which solution would  be best. Thirty five percent said they thought the ODS [Civic  Democratic Party] was holding up local government reform  unnecessarily.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Yolanda Garces from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The indefinite strike by court employees that began  Monday will not end until the representatives of the Judiciary  Council, labor groups, and the executive agree on a solution  that meets workers' demands. For more than one year now, these  employees have been awaiting the implementation of an  arbitration ruling signed as the result of a situation similar  to the one the judicial branch is now experiencing. According to  Judiciary Council President (Beli Estaba), the executive was  asked on Tuesday to review the situation and to approve the  necessary credit immediately to comply with the ruling which has  not yet been put into force because of a lack of funds.    [Begin recording] [Estaba] We cannot blame this situation on  this or that person. What we must do is resolve the problem. On  2 February, we requested the additional credit to comply with  the terms of the arbitration ruling issued by the Velasquez  administration. We have proof that Ocepre [Central Budget  Office] received the request on 3 February at 0213.    [Unidentified reporter] What happened? Have you received any  information from the executive?    [Estaba] We have not, although we have met with the minister  of the Secretariat of the Presidency and the deputy minister of  finance. We have not heard anything about this credit.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] say the Judiciary Council  magistrates have blocked granting other socioeconomic benefits  that were included in last year's arbitration ruling?    [Estaba] That is not true. We have complied with the ruling  to the extent that our resources permit. [end recording]    The representative of the court employees said the strike  will stop only if their demands are accepted, including the  exact date in which they will be paid the social benefits they  have not yet received.    [Begin recording of unidentified labor leader] The strike  will end when the minimal conditions are met, as we just  informed the Judiciary Council during the plenary meeting. Those  conditions include: the immediate approval of the salary we are  requesting, based on the proper implementation of the  arbitration ruling; the exact date we will be paid; a general  revision of the budget to request additional credit in line with  the true needs of the arbitration ruling; approval of the income  and overtime regulations; approval of the labor law privileges,  which they are ignoring; reinstatement of dismissed employees;  and acknowledgement of our rights to concessions. Clearly, these  are minimal conditions, and had such rights not existed, we  would not have had an arbitration ruling in our favor. We are  prepared to negotiate the other points of disagreement--points  which do exist--without a strike. [end recording]    Court activities are paralyzed nationwide. Only a few penal  courts are working in Caracas, such as the 26th Penal Court.  Although it has not held hearings or conducted secretarial work,  this court took the statements of those people indicted in the  case of financial assistance funds, including (Jose Luis  Rovenga) and (Luis Guanone), FIDEC [expansion unknown] president  and board member, respectively.</p>

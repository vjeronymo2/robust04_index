			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR BRADY CREATORS, THE FAMILY AFFAIR GOES ON  </P> <P> Sherwood Schwartz and Lloyd Schwartz, executive producers of "The Bradys," used  to look forward to meeting all the other father-and-son writer-producer teams  in Hollywood -- maybe hosting an occasional picnic.  </P> <P> Then they discovered that there weren't any.  </P> <P> "You're looking at the only father-and-son writing-and-producing team,"  Sherwood Schwartz, 73, said proudly during the pair's first father-and-son  interview at Paramount Studios, where they were hard at work several weeks ago  on "The Bradys," which reunited the characters from the popular 1969-74 "The  Brady Bunch."  </P> <P> "That happens to be truth," Lloyd Schwartz, 43, said with equal pride. "There  are other father-and-son teams who do different things, but we do the same  thing -- producing and writing a show together."  </P> <P> For the Schwartzes, 1990 is a special year: It marks Sherwood's 50th  anniversary in show business and Lloyd's 25th. Sherwood, who holds a master's  degree in medical sciences, changed his career to show biz when his brother, a  writer, drafted him to write jokes for Bob Hope's radio show in 1939. Lloyd  started working parttime in the industry while still in college.  </P> <P> 1990 also marks the third decade in the life of the Schwartzes' other family,  the Bradys -- created when Sherwood dreamed up the idyllic story of "a lovely  lady" with three daughters and "a man named Brady" with three sons who got  married. They became what Sherwood says was TV's first blended family.  </P> <P> The future of "The Bradys" in the '90s remains uncertain. CBS aired just six  episodes as a mid-season replacement; the series ended its run last Friday.  Although the first episode, a two-hour movie, got good ratings, the program  then dropped into the Bottom 20 and stayed there.  </P> <P> Sherwood blamed the show's disappointing ratings on the fact that the first  several hourlong episodes that ran at 8 p.m. were cut-down versions of two-hour  Brady movies that CBS initially planned to air in 9 p.m. time slots, with story  lines more appropriate for an older audience. The producers tried lighter  stories for the last two episodes, but to no avail. The Schwartzes hope the  series airs at 9 when it is re-run over the summer, and once again recaptures  the Brady audience.  </P> <P> But if it doesn't, the Schwartzes remain satisfied with the brief family  reunion. "We're following through on things we started 20 years ago," Lloyd  said. "There has been a sense of completion every step of the way."  </P> <P> In any case, an end to "The Bradys" would not mark the end of the Schwartz  partnership, he said. Although declining to give specifics, he said he and his  father are producing a feature film and a play together, along with pursuing  other film and theater projects on their own.  </P> <P> The Schwartzes say the key to their successful partnership -- which includes  teaching a television production course together in UCLA's extension program --  is the time they spend apart. "I think the way we are able to deal with it is  that we have our own lives, we do other things, so we enjoy coming together,"  Lloyd said.  </P> <P> But both Lloyd and Sherwood acknowledge that the arrangement has disadvantages,  particularly for Lloyd. Lloyd, a recent UCLA graduate when "The Brady Bunch"  was launched, struggled with concerns about nepotism before reluctantly  agreeing to become dialogue coach for the kids on the show. And he concedes  that he has felt the shadow of his father's accomplishments: Not only did  Sherwood create the Bradys, he also got a head start in TV comedy by creating  "Gilligan's Island" in 1964.  </P> <P> "There is some loss of identity for me when we come together," Lloyd said. "You  always read: 'Sherwood Schwartz's "The Bradys" ' -- well, it's the two of us.  We did it together. But I understand all that, and there's no problem about it  between us."  </P> <P> The Bradys have undergone several reincarnations on all three networks since  the happy family made its debut on ABC in 1969. There was the short-lived "The  Brady Bunch Hour" variety show on ABC in 1977 and "The Brady Brides" series on  NBC in 1981, also short-lived. CBS finally struck gold in 1988 with "A Very  Brady Christmas," which brought the Brady clan back together for the holidays  and won the network some of its highest ratings ever for a made-for-TV movie.  </P> <P> The success of that movie led to the recent series, a drama in which the Brady  parents, played by Robert Reed and Florence Henderson, had become grandparents;  the Brady kids were troubled and thirtysomething, with spouses, children and  pets.  </P> <P> About the only similarity between the old Bradys and the new Bradys was the  negative reaction of the TV critics. Sherwood recalled fondly that they hated  "Gilligan's Island," too. Like "The Cosby Show's" Huxtable family that  succeeded them, the Bradys have been attacked for two decades for presenting a  too-rosy view of family life.  </P> <P> After 20 years, however, the Schwartzes have learned to live with it.  </P> <P> "Now 'Gilligan' is a cult classic, and so is ('The Brady Bunch')," Sherwood  said. "I honestly think I could sit down and write a show tonight that the  critics would love, and I know it would be canceled within four weeks. I know  what the critics love. We write and produce for people, not for critics."  </P> <P> Nor do the Schwartzes believe the relentlessly cheerful Bradyness of the family  to be less realistic than life in more troubled families. In fact, life with  the Brady Bunch was a lot like life with the Schwartz Bunch; many of the show's  stories developed out of happenings in the Schwartz household.  </P> <P> "A lot of people say television holds up a mirror to life, and that's why you  see all the drug busts and the killings and the seamier side of life," Sherwood  said. "I personally take the view that as a responsible producer, it's not  sufficient to portray only negative role models. I think it's better to give an  alternative. It's not enough to say no to drugs. What do you say 'yes' to?"  </P> <P> The Schwartzes complain that today's situation comedies have lost the  "humanity" that "The Brady Bunch" and "Gilligan's Island" had.  </P> <P> "Now they're brittle -- it's joke, joke, joke," Sherwood said. "The truth is,  as hokey-pokey as 'Gilligan' was, with a lot of broad comedy, there were times  when whole pages of dialogue would go by that was serious.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone could sit down and watch either of those shows and not  get the feeling that that's the way they'd like life to be, the way they'd like  people to treat each other," he added. "In 'Gilligan's Island,' the sum is  greater than all the pieces, and the same is true of 'The Brady Bunch.' "  </P></p>

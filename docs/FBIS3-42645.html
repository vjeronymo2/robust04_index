			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Konovalov and Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, of </F> "Vybir": "The Nomenklatura's Yardstick Has Laid Foreign Policy  in a Procrustean Bed"]    [Text] The nomenklatura, for which independence has turned  out to be only an additional way to grow rich, has also lost  foreign policy. The reasons for this do not at all lie in the  area of "enemy encirclement" or "Russian policy," but only in  the fact that long term thinking is in general not  characteristic of the "party of the government"--the principle  of "the day before yesterday" is continuing is victorious  existence.    On the anniversary of independence, many democratic  politicians indicated only one unconditional achievement of  Kravchuk's foreign policy--Ukraine is recognized by 140 states.  In the most serious analysis even this service seems quite  dubious, in as much as we owe recognitions first of all to the  pressure of the diasporas which are influential in Canada and  Australia, to which were added pro-Ukrainian inclined circles in  other states.    The reason for the failure of the foreign policy of Ukraine  is the fact that it came after events, since the classic  position of the bureaucracy always won: do not do anything  without instructions from above, because any initiative could be  punished. The orientation of Ukraine toward cooperation with  Iran and Slovakia, which do not enjoy the reputations of  democracies in the world, and with China ("This state is a  priority economic partner for Ukraine"--Ivan Plyushch), where  dissidents are still suppressed, leads one to think about the  desire of the nomenklatura to unite with those similar to it. It  is hard to say whether the shooting of students in Tienanmen  Square is an example for anyone from the "party of the  government."    Those who are responsible for Ukrainian foreign policy can  be  understood when they say that there are quite a few objective  reasons for the failures. Ukrainian nuclear armament became a  thorn in the paw of Ukrainian diplomacy. The entire policy of  the West toward Ukraine focused on it. Russia, having survived  the brief shock after the separation of Ukraine from "forever  together," was able to triple its efforts on the diplomatic  front, and to reach the point that in the West the nuclear  Ukraine came to be seen as dangerous. The embassies of Russia,  which have in individual states staffs of up to 1,000, not  counting the employees of Aeroflot, naval representatives, and  the offices of trading organizations, easily won the struggle  for influence with the few Ukrainian ambassadors, many of whom,  moreover, did not have experience gained by years of diplomatic  work.    It is not necessary to accept the position of the West, but  it is worthwhile understanding it. Despite everything,  bipolarity made possible life in a relatively stable world,  where professionals opposed professionals, and intelligence  agencies, "hot lines," and reciprocal plans for military action,  functioned. In a world in which there are few nuclear countries,  the risk of nuclear conflict was lessened, and this means that  the likelihood of world war decreased. This simple and logical  thesis directs all movements of the West which to some seem  chaotic.    However, the objective reasons which cause the difficulties  of Ukrainian foreign policy, do not justify the serious mistakes  of the Ukrainian leadership. The answer to the question of what  could be an effective foreign policy for Ukraine, has to be  sought not in the sphere of any sorts of "geopolitical  interests," which sometimes take on a distorted form of  "Ukrainian messianism" and a "special path" for Ukraine, but in  the sphere of internal policy. The fact that the office of the  President on questions of foreign policy presents the positions  of western countries toward Ukraine as indifferentiatedly  hostile, comes from the same concept of the policy of the  nomenklatura as does the credit and financial regulation of  prices. The humanitarian aid of Germany and the USA is  "forgotten;" everything is forgotten which does not fit into the  nomenklatura's concept of "Ukraine and a hostile world." The  influence of Russia on the formulation of the policy of the West  is exaggerated to the maximum, up to the point that the myth has  been created about coordinated pressure of the USA and the  Russian Federation in the matter of Ukrainian nuclear arms. By  all this, together with other "arguments," the nomenklatura has  one goal: to prove that the Ukrainian people must tighten its  belt and... suffer.    The nomenklatura is also still playing the card of the  Ukrainian diaspora, which from idealistic considerations is  paying for embassies, very often without getting any financial  accountings about what its money is being spent on. These people  sincerely believe that they are helping the first popularly  elected President to build the state. However, in the diaspora  circles, which eagerly receive guests from Ukraine and before  which is chanted without logic, "Our President is our chief,"  they are also beginning to understand: help for the nomenklatura  is not the best use of the money which they have earned by their  labors. In the West, another type of sympathizers for Ukraine  has appeared; those who, when independence was won, got  positions in the Ministries of Defense, Trade, Foreign Affairs,  Intelligence, and in embassies. The question of the independence  of Ukraine is for them a question of protecting their jobs.    The problem of Ukraine's nuclear capacity would  automatically  be pushed to the back burner if the Ukrainian government began a  policy of economic reforms. The introduction of reforms would  permit us to attract the funds of western investors for  participation in the development of effective production; and  then immediately the corresponding lobbies would be formed in  western governments. It would require a change of state policy  toward Ukraine just from mercantile considerations, in order to  protect their own money.    The question of political stabilization in Ukraine could be  solved immediately by several paths. Among these are both the  election of new structures of government on democratic  principles, and the establishment of a dictatorship as a result  of a civil war or disorders. In the second case, the government,  most probably, would remain in the hands of the same leading  structures and persons, as can be found at the helm today. In  the eyes of the West, they have shown their bankruptcy as  leaders, having passed in the Supreme Council an undemocratic  law on elections, despite all the warnings of many western  experts and the proposal of the Council of Europe.    Carrying out democratic elections in Ukraine at least will  show the West who really expresses the will of the people, and  will open, as is shown there, the way to economic reform. As  they evaluate the process of election of a new parliament, much  will depend on the international position toward Ukraine and the  possibility of further integration into the world community.  Beyond this, as we choose our future in March, the whole world  will see that it has become much smaller since the fall of the  iron curtain.</p>

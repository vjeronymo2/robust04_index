			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Stable conditions Controlling market prices around the time of new issues has long been a thorny problem for investment banks. Any attempt to support the price of an issue is a form of market manipulation, though it is often justified on the grounds that it helps maintain an orderly market. Such stabilisation is now controlled by strict SIB rules which forbid, for example, the lead manager to buy in securities above their issue price. So in the Zeneca rights issue, the manager Warburg, which has been a notable bidder for shares above the 600p issue price, is presumably acting for clients, since buying for its own book would be difficult to distinguish from stabilisation. The rules on stabilisation are, however, quite specific and focus on the lead manager buying securities immediately after the issue. In the case of the BT3 offer, Warburg is encouraging institutions to buy shares ahead of the float by offering preferential allocations to those that buy, while penalising excessive sellers. This will tend to support the price and smooth the absorption of the issue. In that sense at least it is analogous to stabilisation, for while the lead manager is not directly supporting the price, it is encouraging others to do so. If the incentive proves popular, it could significantly influence the BT share price. With stabilisation, at least the members of the syndicate know the extent of intervention, whereas in this case not even the lead manager is fully aware of the market impact of the measure. Currently there is a grey area between acceptable smoothing and an unacceptable false market. Perhaps the SIB should consider including such incentives in wider stabilisation rules to ensure that the market is transparent, as well as orderly.</p>

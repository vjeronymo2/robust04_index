			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Observer: Stage exit 'Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful.' Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's words, from Waiting for Godot, don't apply at present to Dublin's Abbey Theatre - though its current box office of 60-65 per cent could be improved. But they may be apposite this winter when the theatre is threatening to lower the curtain until the spring - the first closure for 90 years. Though the Abbey is guaranteed state aid under Ireland's constitution, the arts council is reducing its support from 55 per cent of the theatre's income - IPounds 2m - to 50 per cent in 1995. The arts minister Michael Higgins, under whose benevolent tutelage Irish music and film are flourishing, insists that the Arts Council is an autonomous body and he cannot interfere. His wife, the actress Sabina Coyne, may have something to say about that . . .</p>

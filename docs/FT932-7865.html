			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / People: Sir Bernard Ashley's flowery farewell Sir Bernard Ashley yesterday stepped down as chairman of Laura Ashley, the international clothing and home furnishings group, 40 years after the business was founded by his wife. His departure marks an end of an era for the company, and the symbolic completion of its transition from family-owned business to public company. Sir Bernard was also reported to have sold about a quarter of the Ashley family's 49 per cent shareholding in the company yesterday. He had previously said he planned progressively to reduce the stake to about 25 per cent. Although some other members of the Ashley family are involved in PR activities, none of them has an active role in running the company, which will now be headed by Jim Maxmin, the American chief executive, and Hugh Blakeway Webb, who moves up from deputy chairman to chairman. Sir Bernard's departure was not unexpected, after the company admitted last month that he had not attended a board meeting since last May, and was devoting increasing amounts of time to his hotel interests in Wales and the US. Laura Ashley said yesterday Sir Bernard had intended to retire for some time, and decided the 40th anniversary year was an appropriate time to do so, especially now the company seemed to be staging a recovery after several years of losses. He will become honorary life president and remain a non-executive director, as well as being involved in 'conceptual design'. Hugh Blakeway Webb, a former barrister and partner of accountants Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells joined the company as deputy chairman in 1991 and has frequently represented Sir Bernard at board meetings. He has been an adviser to the family for some years and was involved in the 1985 floatation. He also helped negotiate the minority investment by the Aeon group, setting the company back on a firm financial footing, and was involved in assembling the present management team.</p>

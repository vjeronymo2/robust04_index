			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PRIDE INHABITS RUINS OF GREAT ZIMBABWE NATIONAL MONUMENT;  </P> <P> ARCHEOLOGY: EXPERTS DEBATED THE STRUCTURES' ORIGIN FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY --  OFTEN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT SUCH CONSTRUCTION EXCEEDED NATIVE AFRICANS'  ABILITIES. NOW THE RUINS ARE CONSIDERED PROOF THAT A POWERFUL BLACK  CIVILIZATION EXISTED THERE.  </P> <P> Of all the historians, anthropologists, archeologists, tourists, mystics and  assorted crackpots who have visited this centuries-old site in recent years,  none seemed to impress the park rangers more than a woman from New York named  Martha.  </P> <P> Martha was an energetic middle-age woman with bright silver hair who introduced  herself as a "research psychic" and asked to spend a night here under the  stars. Her mission, she told the rangers, was to contact the spirits of the  Great Zimbabwe, a mammoth collection of dry stone ruins whose man-made origins  have been debated by experts for more than a century.  </P> <P> She scaled the rocks that evening and set up shop in the old stone fortress on  a cliff 400 feet above the valley floor. When she descended the next morning,  bruised and breathless, she was disheveled, but her face was rosy with  excitement.  </P> <P> "The lady was very happy. She said the Queen of Sheba had come to visit. They  apparently talked together all night," said Bernard Naborth, a veteran officer  here who has seen his share of curious travelers. He paused. "We have so many  visitors. I think everyone finds something of interest."  </P> <P> Ever since this ancient site 200 miles south of Harare was discovered by a Boer  hunter named Adam Renders in 1868, it has stoked the imaginations of scholars,  scientists and visionaries, attracted gold and treasure hunters by the score  and fired the cultural pride of Zimbabwean nationalists and people of African  descent the world over.  </P> <P> The ruins are Africa's largest and most dramatic south of the pyramids of  Egypt, and as such, constitute proof that a rich and powerful black  civilization once flourished in a part of the world that Westerners have  traditionally characterized as barbaric, wild and primitive.  </P> <P> American civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois, a founder of the National Assn.  for the Advancement of Colored People, was one of many black leaders who have  been inspired by this site through the years. In his 1946 book, "The World and  Africa," Du Bois celebrated the Great Zimbabwe as emblematic of Africa's  "extraordinary cultural past" and a symbol of pride for black Americans  deprived of a sense of ancient heritage.  </P> <P> In the language of this nation's Shona people, Zimbabwe means "venerated place"  or "house of chiefs." Great Zimbabwe, from which the 10-year-old country  acquired its name, consists of the hilltop fortress, a conical watchtower and a  number of imposing walled enclosures all made from chiseled granite about 700  years ago.  </P> <P> Last year, 71,000 tourists visited the Great Zimbabwe, the largest of a number  of such sites that can be found in remote parts of Zambia and Mozambique as  well as this country. Amid a landscape of boulders and forests, the ruins,  scattered over 100 acres, project a stark beauty whose mystery has been  enhanced through the years by the inability of early experts to fully agree on  who built them or why.  </P> <P> The list of peoples put forward by Western archeologists and theorists as  possible builders of the site reads like a Who's Who in ancient history:  Chaldeans, Sabaeans, Persians, Mongolians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians,  Hindus and Sardinians. Several experts have attributed the site to 17th-Century  Portuguese traders and adventurers; others conjectured that these ruins were  none other than the site of King Solomon's mines and the true source of the  biblical gold of Ophir.  </P> <P> Priceless evidence that would have helped solve the mystery -- gold objects,  sculpted soapstone birds, jewelry, wall paintings and other artifacts -- was  hauled away by legions of treasure hunters and colonial profiteers who raided  and ransacked the site until 1928, when the British colonial government passed  laws protecting it.  </P> <P> The scholarly debates about the ruins in the first half of this century had one  thing in common: Because of racial and cultural biases, few of the Western  experts dared to consider that the Great Zimbabwe may have been designed and  built by the Shona people themselves.  </P> <P> "Of one thing I do feel satisfied," wrote an Englishman named H. Maclear Bate  in a 1940 study of the ruins titled "Report From the Rhodesias": "No African  built those walls except under expert foreign guidance."  </P> <P> Zimbabwean archeologist Peter Garlake, explaining the racial attitudes of many  researchers and explorers, wrote, "To them, the African simply had not the  energy, will, organization, foresight or skill to build those walls. Indeed, he  appeared so backward that it seemed that his entire race could never have  accomplished the task at any period."  </P> <P> It was Garlake who wrote a 1973 book titled "The Great Zimbabwe," which remains  the field's most respected and authoritative study. Using modern methods of  radiocarbon dating and other archeological evidence showing that the Great  Zimbabwe culture thrived between the 13th and 15th centuries, long before the  arrival of the first European explorers, Garlake presented a strong case that  the ruins were indeed built by the Shona people employing indigenous skills  under the rule of a monarchy that flourished from gold trade with Arabs on the  coast.  </P> <P> At the peak of their power, these Shona rulers, known as the Mwanamutapa,  extended their rule throughout most of what is now Zimbabwe. The empire  crumbled rapidly at the end of the 15th Century when its lifeline, the rich  maize-producing farmland surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, was oversown and  severely depleted.  </P> <P> This thesis is almost universally accepted by world scholars and archeologists  today. But before Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, such notions were considered  so heretical and politically volatile by the nation's white minority rulers  that some scholarly manuscripts were censored and their authors harassed. "They  see such expressions . . . as sedition against the present political  structure," Garlake wrote.  </P> <P> Indeed, the idea that the Great Zimbabwe had African origins played no small  role in galvanizing this country's nationalists in the independence struggle of  the 1970s. It was nothing less than a patriotic symbol and a call to arms. As  Benedict Mtshali, a leading Zimbabwean historian, once wrote, the ruins prove  that "the African had a civilization that was not the white man's gift. . . .  They are relics of an era of glory, splendor, power and achievement and give  the lie to those who dismiss the African past . . . such a sense of history  forges a people, gives them a sense of oneness and dignity."  </P> <P> Today the Great Zimbabwe is to this country what Chichen Itza is to Mexico and  the Acropolis is to Greece -- a cultural treasure whose value is measured not  so much in entry fees from foreign tourists as in the education it nurtures and  the national identity it sustains.  </P> <P> About 60% of the site's yearly visitors are Zimbabweans, many of them  schoolchildren. On a recent Sunday afternoon, the sun-splashed ruins were  filled with visitors who had paid about 10 cents each to get in, among them  students, families and a troop of white South African Boy Scouts, all strolling  amid the silent stones.  </P> <P> "It's a part of our history, but it's still very mysterious," said  Munyaradzinngowe, 28, a Zimbabwean agronomist who, with his wife and sister,  was enjoying a view of the valley. "I like it because it's a splendid place to  spend the day."  </P></p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Russia retreats from economic reforms THE Russian government yesterday retreated from its economic reform programme in the face of sustained criticism from parliament, industrial leaders, economists and the public. The presidium of the Russian parliament was last night reported to have cut the rate of value added tax on some foods from 28 to 15 per cent, which would reduce government revenue by an estimated Rbs20bn-Rbs30bn. Parliamentary leaders were also discussing rises in the level of social security and pensions to protect the rising number of people living below the poverty line. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, said yesterday that the changes were 'technical adjustments, but it is important that these adjustments should not be chaotic and dangerous'. He added that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, still stood firmly behind the reforms. The changes, details of which are still the subject of debate, are being mooted at a time when hostility to the reform programme is growing louder. Introduced on January 2, the programme has brought sharp rises in value added, profit and export taxes, together with deep cuts in food and other subsidies and an 85 per cent cut in defence procurement as a means of balancing the budget and freeing prices. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament and one of the chief critics of the reform, yesterday told a congress of Russian farmers that large parts of the economy, including the farming sector, should remain under state control. A meeting of prominent economists convened by Mr Khasbulatov over the weekend concluded that the reform programme was 'not realistic', according to Mr Pavel Bunich, who took part in the meeting. They called for a sharp drop in taxes, and for continuing subsidies to loss-making industries, farms and oil and gas production. Mr Bunich, writing in Pravda, the former mouthpiece of the Communist party leadership, said that 'a balanced budget is a good thing but not an end in itself'. It now seems likely that Mr Gaidar's efforts to bring in a balanced budget in the first quarter, already modified to a forecast deficit of about Rbs11bn, or 1 per cent of GNP, will be undercut.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 9 (AFP) -- French voters are almost  evenly divided on whether President Francois Mitterrand's  13-year reign should be seen in a positive or negative light, a  SOFRES [French Opinion Polling Company] poll published Monday [9  May] showed.    Of 1,000 people questioned, 46 percent were critical of the  president's performance since he took power in May 1981, but 43  percent were favourable, according to the poll, conducted for a  group of regional newspapers.    Eleven percent were undecided. The survey was carried out  between April 26 and 28.    A year ago, after parliamentary elections which saw  Mitterrand's Socialist Party turfed out of power, his approval  rate was a mere 37 percent, with 54 percent against him.    Those questioned give the president credit for his role in  areas such as the position of France in the world where he won  59 percent backing, promoting European Union (55 percent),  ensuring social peace (53 percent) and guaranteeing national  defence (52 percent).    But Mitterrand received poor ratings on unemployment with 88  percent critical of his policies, immigration (70 percent),  public security (62 percent) and reducing inequalities (61  percent).    The president's second term of office ends next May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata suggested Tuesday [5 April] Japan and the United States  could discuss resumption of their stalled trade "framework"  talks at two upcoming international gatherings.    Hata said the opportunity could come in Marrakech, Morocco,  later this month when ministers from 119 nations gather for the  signing of a global trade pact or at a meeting of Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in June.    At a press conference after a regular cabinet meeting, Hata  dismissed remarks by a high-ranking Japanese Government official  that nothing can be done about the trade talks until Japan  hammers out economic reform measures in June. Japan still has  to make macroeconomic efforts, including tax reform and  deregulation, and relevant ministries and agencies are currently  working on them, Hata said.    The government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  suggested earlier in the day that nothing can be done at the  moment and that it is important to show Japan's efforts in the  economic measures scheduled for June.    Hata said both Japan and the U.S. should make efforts to  resume the trade talks.    The two countries have opportunities to hold meetings in  Marrakech and at the OECD council meeting and Japan wants to  inform the U.S. of Japanese efforts at those meetings, Hata said.    Hata is expected to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor in Marrakech next week at the signing ceremony for the  global trade pact concluded in the Uruguay Round last December  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>

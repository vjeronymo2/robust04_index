			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GENDARMES WARNED TO HALT PROTEST  </P> <P> The government warned today that it will stamp out an unprecedented protest  movement among France's gendarmes, the paramilitary police renowned for their  stiff-backed devotion to duty.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the protests over poor conditions  in the 91,000-member force have gone too far and are politically orchestrated.  </P> <P> "Anonymous appeals are even inciting gendarmes, the guardians of legality, to  take illegal action," Chevenement said in an open letter to all ranks. "This is  not acceptable and will not be accepted."  </P> <P> After years of grumbling in vain about low pay, long hours and the martial  bleakness of barrack life, gendarmes spread the spirit of rebellion rapidly  this week. In a cascade of anonymous letters to newspapers, gendarmes  throughout France have risked dismissal by threatening to stage the first  industrial action in the gendarmerie's centuries of history.  </P></p>

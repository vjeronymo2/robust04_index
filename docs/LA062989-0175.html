			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN EMPHASIS ON CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> In the early 1960s, civil rights leader Robert Moses survived beatings and  rifle assaults while teaching backwoods Mississippi sharecroppers how to read  and write. But by 1965, he felt a different pressure -- a growing bitterness  over America.  </P> <P> In 1964, his efforts to help seat the black Mississippi Freedom Democratic  Party at the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City had failed. Soon, Moses  became convinced that Martin Luther King's advisers, particularly Bayard  Rustin, had persuaded Dr. King that morality and politics could no longer mix.  </P> <P> "That's when King, who had dominated with the tactic of moral force, lost the  issue; derailed it," Moses says.  </P> <P> "Stokely Carmichael (a prominent member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating  Committee) learned the lesson well, and the first chance he got, he yelled  'black power,' and that was it. We lost the ability to speak to the inner  city."  </P> <P> The helter-skelter politics of Vietnam completed the job on Moses, and he left  the United States to live in Tanzania with other expatriate blacks.  </P> <P> The experiment didn't work. The politically sophisticated American blacks were  a threat to the tribal culture and hierarchy of Tanzania. The Americans were  denied citizenship.  </P> <P> Eventually, Moses returned home and continued the doctoral studies in  philosophy at Harvard that he had left in the late '50s. He feels today that  civil rights is moving toward the need for greater help with "children's  development."  </P> <P> "What you are faced with," he says, "is a lack of a concept within our  community of the need to invest in personal development. . . . We've lost the  idea of one generation investing in the next."  </P> <P> The idea of the Algebra Project and math literacy is just the entering wedge to  the question of "the economic and political arrangements being made as we shift  from an industrial base to a high-tech base." Blacks have to pay attention to  this shift, he says.  </P> <P> "In the '60s, things began to center around the question of the right to vote.  It built over a number of years, and then finally mobilized enough of the  society to make a dent, do something. People began to see voting as a  fundamental issue, and that released a lot of energy. We may see a similar  thing soon with children, inner-city children, and their development." ROBERT  MARQUAND  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES DOWN STOP SIGNS PROPOSAL  </P> <P> After occasionally angry public testimony both for and against the idea of  putting six new stop signs along Balboa Boulevard, the City Council voted 5 to  2 against it Monday night.  </P> <P> Instead, the council voted to accept a motion by Councilman Donald A. Strauss  to install reflective plastic strips at all existing crosswalks and add six new  crosswalks.  </P> <P> Approximately 50 people turned out for the meeting, and audience members  appeared nearly split on the issue. Some residents argued that speeds on the  boulevard are too high, making it difficult and dangerous to cross the street.  Other homeowners said that more stop signs would exacerbate already serious  weekend traffic problems and called for stricter enforcement of existing speed  limits instead.  </P> <P> "Presently, I have eight stops to make; to add six more is just totally  ludicrous," peninsula resident Richard Voit told the council. "I'm sick of  having to spend my summers in traffic."  </P> <P> Monday's proposal for more stop signs came out of a series of meetings by a  committee of residents, council members and city traffic staff. Residents and  homeowners' associations along the peninsula have been asking the city to slow  traffic along the main street for years and have strongly opposed the  suggestions of a city consultant to eliminate crosswalks in favor of fewer,  lighted pedestrian crossings.  </P> <P> There are now seven traffic signals and one stop sign on Balboa Boulevard.  Monday's decision means that the city will not establish signs at the  intersections of Balboa and G Street, Island Avenue and 10th, 18th, 35th and  42nd streets.  </P> <P> But the council approved the installation of high-visibility crosswalks at all  current crosswalk locations on Balboa as well as at new walkways at 34th, 35th,  36th, 40th, 42nd and 44th streets at a total cost of $38,000.

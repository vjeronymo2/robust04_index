			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of government help lift Nikkei above 16,000 SHARE prices rebounded on news that the government would meet to discuss the stock market slump, and the Nikkei average, which had dropped to a six-year low on Wednesday, moved back above the 16,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average jumped 497.99 to 16,039.94. The weakness on overseas markets prompted arbitrage selling in the morning, pulling the index down to the day's low of 15,333.00. An announcement by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that the government will hold an emergency meeting today to discuss support measures for the market triggered buying in the futures markets, and the Nikkei advanced to the session's high of 16,084.30. In spite of the sharp rally in prices, volume dipped from 272m shares to 250m. Rises led declines by 614 to 339, with 150 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 22.07 to 1,227.82, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.42 to 965.80. The futures index surged as investors rushed to cover short positions, prompting arbitrage buying and bargain hunting in the cash market. Most participants were encouraged by Mr Miyazawa's announcement. However, some investors were sceptical about the outcome. 'There was some relief in the market, but if there is nothing new decided at the emergency meeting, the market may go down,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life. Analysts said measures to boost the economy were needed to lift sentiment. 'It is not up to the cabinet to decide on monetary policy, so the effects of the meeting on the market are questionable,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi, strategist at Daiwa Securities. Stocks heavily depressed on Wednesday recouped losses. High-technology issues, which were lower on earnings worries, advanced. NEC put on Y19 to Y804 and Fujitsu Y11 to Y580. Dealers once again sought speculative theme stocks for short-term trading purposes. Meiji Milk Products, the day's most active issue, climbed Y37 to Y932 and Taiyo Fishery gained Y25 to Y460. Banks were also firmer, with Industrial Bank of Japan appreciating Y10 to Y1,640 and Sakura Bank Y33 to Y949. In Osaka, the OSE average recovered 248.41 to 18,190.94, rising for the first time in six days. Volume remained flat at 23m shares. Roundup THE STEEPEST fall among the region's markets yesterday was registered by Taiwan, which ended at its lowest level since January last year. TAIWAN's weighted index lost 175.93, or 4.2 per cent, at 3,978.87, but after an intraday low of 3,954. Turnover expanded to TDollars 30.35bn from Wednesday's TDollars 18.57bn. Some analysts said the setback reflected the slowdown in economic growth and lack of confidence for company earnings in the second half of the year. HONG KONG declined by 1.5 per cent amid uncertainties over a dispute between China and Britain regarding the financing of a new airport. The Hang Seng index shed 93.28 to 5,917.16. Turnover increased to HKDollars 3.50bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 3.13bn. The market was closed on Wednesday because of a typhoon. Banks generally lost ground, with HSBC finishing 50 cents down at HKDollars 54 and Bank of East Asia HKDollars 1 off at HKDollars 37. SINGAPORE was broadly lower, with shipyard issues falling in late trading. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 12.25 to 1,424.65 in volume of 47.13m shares, against 45.83m. Declines outpaced gains by 153 to 53. SEOUL retreated after a two-day advance. The composite stock index closed 7.47 off at 518.53 in turnover of Won170.5bn, after Won162.9b. Sunkyong and Yukong, which are among companies bidding for South Korea's second mobile telecommunications contract, moved ahead by Won800 and Won1,000 respectively to Won20,400 and Won24,900. MANILA staged a further improvement, helped by gains in the oil sector. The composite index ended 16.97 higher at 1,470.76. Oil issues showed rises ranging from 6 per cent to 13 per cent, while the oil index advanced by 10 per cent. Combined turnover contracted to 275m pesos from 313.7m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR declined on profit-taking. The composite index lost 6.55 to 602.24 in turnover down to MDollars 121.8m from MDollars 166.1m. Falls overwhelmed rises by 227 to 50. AUSTRALIA recovered from a poor start to close modestly higher on balance after trading dominated by the debut of GIO, the former New South Wales government insurer. The All Ordinaries index ended 3.5 ahead at 1,610.7. GIO accounted for 15 per cent of the day's turnover of ADollars 239.5m. It opened at ADollars 2.68, a 28-cent premium to the issue price, but fell to close at ADollars 2.53 after volume of 17.8m shares. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index slid 16.31 to 1,552.20 as a result of weakness on Wall Street. BOMBAY fell sharply, the BSE index finishing 139.78, or 4.96 per cent, weaker at 2,678.34.</p>

Provide territorial mapping surveys for the warbler following International Bird Census Committee or other approved procedures within and 500 feet out from the southern and western boundaries of Phase A, Section 3 in 1995 (where adjacent landowners will allow). This area will be surveyed in 1996 and 1997 using the protocol established and in effect by the Service for presence/absence surveys. This survey format of one territorial survey and two presence/absence surveys will continue until the third breeding season after buildout of the project site, at which time a final territorial mapping survey will be completed. Buildout for the residential area is considered to be when 95 percent of the houses are constructed and occupied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: IFC hopes to set up Palestinian funds The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm, hopes this year to establish the first of a series of investment funds to promote business development in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza. 'If we can structure a fund in a proper fashion, we would be able to attract a fair amount of Palestinian money abroad,' said Mr Andre Hovaguimian, IFC's director for the region. 'We will start small - Dollars 25m to Dollars 50m. If you start big the money will be squandered. The fund will be 'superbly managed' by technical partners in the US or Europe. 'So when the money is used up there is no problem in getting another Dollars 50 or Dollars 100m.' IFC has set up over 30 funds around the world since its first fund in South Korea in 1982. areas in the Occupied Territories require immediate attention: house building, infrastructure development, and financial services. 'Employment generation is the key to peace,' he said. 'Unless we get people off the streets, we won't have much of a peace process.' IFC last week approved, as its first investment on the West Bank, participation in the Arab Palestine Investment Bank. This will be the first comprehensive commercial and investment banking institution in the territories which now gets by with one small bank in Gaza and branches of two Jordanian banks. The small institutions lack the capacity to mobilise and allocate funds for industrial development, said Mr Hovaguimian. There are now about 3,700 small and medium-sized enterprises and 40 large companies in the territories, which have mostly had to rely on advances by sponsors or informally raised short-term capital. As is typical, IFC will only take shares of the fund - in this case up to 25 per cent. It will also extend a credit line of Dollars 25m for lending to small and medium-sized businesses. The Arab Bank group, a diversified international commercial and investment banking group in Amman, will hold 51 per cent of the equity. The rest will be subscribed by European institutions and Palestinian investors. Various IFC projects are being studied, including the establishment of a bank to finance housing construction. Future projects could involve promotion of businesses making construction materials. Mr Khaleel Ahmed, IFC investment officer, said the region had a competitive advantage in tourism, which a real peace could promote, and in light industry. Thanks to Israel, which established at least seven universities in the area, the occupied territories now has a highly educated and skilled workforce.</p>

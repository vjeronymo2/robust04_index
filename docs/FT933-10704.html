			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Prescott calls for BR lease extension MR JOHN PRESCOTT, the shadow transport secretary, yesterday called on the government to extend British Rail's Pounds 150m leasing facility to enable early orders to be placed for new rolling stock for the West Coast mainline and Network SouthEast. In a meeting with Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, Mr Prescott pressed for a Pounds 300m leasing facility linked to a system of staged annual payments. Mr Prescott said arrangements could be devised which would not increase concern over the public sector borrowing requirement, estimated to total Pounds 50bn in the present financial year. Previous Labour attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of proposals for using the leasing procedure to secure new rolling stock have failed to convince Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary. He has said he expects BR to decide before the end of next month on the tenders submitted for the Pounds 150m leasing deal.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Estate agency recovery helps Hambros to Pounds 41m - Countrywide back in black as house sales pick up HAMBROS, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday disclosed a 53 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits, helped by a return to the black by its Hambro Countrywide estate agency chain. The group, which disclosed its balance sheet for the first time at this stage, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 26.9m) in the six months to September 30. Its undiluted earnings per share rose by 56 per cent to 12.6p (8.1p). The retail financial services division including Hambro Countrywide made a trading profit of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 4.9m loss restated). The group said Countrywide had returned to profitability in June as house sales picked up. Profits from banking activities rose to Pounds 40.3m (Pounds 37.3m), although the contribution from treasury and capital markets fell slightly. There was a 'marked increase' in corporate finance, and loan provisions fell by a third to Pounds 6m. Sir Chips Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank, said treasury and capital markets activity was slightly down on the levels of last year because currency markets were not so volatile. 'I would have said that was a windfall period,' he said. Sir Chips estimated that some 20 per cent of profits in derivatives were from proprietory trading. He said that over time treasury profits would face declining margins, but that it would continue to produce good returns this year. Direct investment activities traded at a profit of Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 100,000 loss restated following the listing of Hambro Insurance Services Group). A profit of Pounds 9m from the disposal of a holding in Telematics will be included in the second half. Mr Christopher Sporborg, chairman of Hambro Group Investments, said the housing recovery had been weaker than hoped, but Hambro Countrywide expected to sell up to 50,000 properties this year, compared with 39,000 last year. The balance sheet footings increased by Pounds 742m from the year end to Pounds 6.59bn. This was mainly due to a rise in acceptances, and increased activity in equity clearing on behalf of regional stockbrokers. The interim dividend on 20p ordinary shares was raised to 4.5p (4.2p). COMMENT Shares fell 24p to 344p amid disappointment at Hambros' failure to benefit as much as others from buoyant trading conditions. Full-year undiluted earnings per share of 30p would give a prospective multiple of about 12. Together with a gross dividend yield of 5.4 per cent, this hardly makes a risky investment. But with weak loan demand, a shaky housing market, and the best of trading profits past, it is hard to discern the source of strong earnings growth.</p>

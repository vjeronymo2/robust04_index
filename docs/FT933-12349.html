			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Metals group bundles waste service units METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German metals-based group, is to merge most of its environmental service businesses into a new subsidiary with an annual turnover of DM3.6bn (Dollars 2.09bn), based on 1991-92 sales, and around 12,000 employees. The new company, Metallgesellschaft Umwelt (MGU),will be run by board member Mr Karlheinz Arras and include six specialist operating units. These will be involved in waste processing; dumping; recycling and burning; transport; water and sewerage services; and site clearance and cleaning. The last unit covers a growing business in highly-polluted industrial areas of eastern Germany and the former communist bloc. The bundling process, which excludes the plant construction division and the Lurgi engineering services business, is part of group strategy which focuses on high-margin and growing businesses. Metallgesellschaft's environmental divisions occupy important niches. Two units to be merged into MGU's new metals recycling division, for example, will represent Europe's biggest processor of exhausted dry and wet-cell batteries.</p>

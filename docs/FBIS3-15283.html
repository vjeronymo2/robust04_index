			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Rumors which have  appeared lately in some media sources, to the effect that the  Federal Counterintelligence Service is going to be reorganized  again, have nothing to do with reality, an informant close to  the Russian president's administration told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent today.    He expressed his concern over the fact that, in conditions  when a campaign has been unleashed in the United States around  the Ames affair, the publishing of such reports serves in the  final analysis the unseemly purpose of misleading the public,  exerting a psychological pressure on the staff of  counterintelligence bodies, and paralyzing their activities.</p>

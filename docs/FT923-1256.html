			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Polys grow up by degrees / A look at a new generation of universities On August 1, the citizens of east London awoke to find their streets festooned with banners proclaiming the birth of a new university. How many realised Greenwich University was none other than Thames Polytechnic in new garb? Only, perhaps, early birds who witnessed the respraying of its vans, or the men abseiling down the side of the poly's main Woolwich building to remove the old signs. For South Bank Polytechnic, also reincarnated as a university in the summer, new logos were just the beginning. Posters proclaiming 'a university without ivory towers', 'poly gone' and 'universities challenged' have been bemusing commuters and would-be students alike. The opportunity given to Britain's 36 polytechnics to call themselves universities, under the government's policy of creating a unified higher education sector, has been seized by most to relaunch themselves. Poly directors, not renowned for inspirational marketing, now gossip about 'corporate identity' and 'Swot analysis' - analysing Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats to their market share. Image and PR consultants are doing a roaring trade. The name changes tell much of the story. Leicester Poly adopted the city's medieval earl to become De Montfort University; Liverpool took on the local tycoon - whose son, fortuitously, is chairman of its governors - and is now Liverpool John Moores University. Even the least pretentious name changes reflect careful positioning. Says Valerie Stead, Greenwich's deputy vice-chancellor: 'We found the name (Thames Poly) a liability, because nobody was quite sure where we were.' Six agencies were asked to tender for a name and logo: Greenwich and the compass, put forward by Primary Contact, a subsidiary of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, triumphed after market research showed Greenwich to be the second best-known place in London after the Tower. Leicester Polytechnic, on the other hand, selected De Montfort because it wanted to escape close identification with its parent city. A 'distributed university' with campuses in Milton Keynes and Leicester, to which colleges in Lincoln and Bedford are likely soon to be added by mergers, it was keen to project a regional image. According to Jan Hall, an executive with Coley, Porter, Bell (CPB), the corporate identity consultants employed by the new university: 'De Montfort conjures up all the right feelings of status and quality - and the name is well known in the Leicester area. In our surveys, it went down particularly well with the overseas students and employers: it's clearly British and prestigious-sounding.' CPB's Swot analysis for De Montfort and North London University - its other former poly client - showed the main 'threat' to be the very change of formal status for which polys had been campaigning. Says Hall: 'Most of the polys had strong local links with sections of the community not used to higher education. Many of the mature students we canvassed - particularly those on part-time courses - told us they'd never have thought they were up to a university, or variations on that.' Hence the emphasis on 'no ivory towers at the Elephant and Castle'. Greenwich's promotional literature stresses that as a university it will 'continue to encourage applications from older students who don't necessarily have traditional qualifications'. It has no intention of changing its course portfolio, or of seeking to reduce from 47 per cent the proportion of its students aged 25 or over. With most of the new titles barely a few months old, it is too soon to say what the new names, logos and marketing have done for recruitment. In London, where the concentration of institutions generates fierce competition, efforts at differentiation are intense. According to John Callen, head of marketing at North London, 'It's not just new logos and names. We are trying to destroy the segmentation in consumers' eyes about the polys, while retaining loyalty as a student-focused, community institution.'</p>

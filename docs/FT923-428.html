			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf acquires 50 pubs from Bass Maple Leaf Inns, the joint venture company launched three months ago by Pubmaster, the independent pub retailer, and Labatt, the Canadian brewer, has bought 50 pubs in the Midlands and Wales from Bass. Terms of the sale have not been disclosed. Maple Leaf, which now operates 68 pubs, intends to expand further, said Mr John Brackenbury, chairman. Labatt signed a distribution deal with Pubmaster in June, increasing the number of UK pubs in which its brands are sold from 7,000 to 9,000, and securing a place in the UK's ten top-selling lagers fours years after its introduction. Bass has now sold about 2,650 pubs in the past three years, leaving it with less than 100 for disposal to meet the requirements of the government's beer orders during the next month.</p>

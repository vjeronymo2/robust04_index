			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Banacci earnings slide 67% in second quarter Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial group, reported an equivalent of net earnings of 216m new pesos (Dollars 63.5m) in the second quarter, a reduction of 67 per cent on the same period in 1993. Banacci's earnings were hit by a reduction of 380m pesos in the value of the assets of the company subsidiaries, partly a result of fall in the stock market over the second quarter, and weakness of the peso. Operating profits, which exclude the asset devaluation, reached 596m new pesos, a 6 per cent reduction over the second quarter last year. The 'C' shares of Banacci were down 4.4 per cent yesterday to close at 21.5 pesos as the results were worse than the market had expected. Earnings at Banamex, the group's bank, fell by 9.7 per cent to 475m pesos in the second quarter, reflecting the spike in interest rates which cut the company's net interest income substantially. Low economic growth over the period also led to a deterioration in asset quality, forcing the bank to increase loan loss provisions. The proportion of non-performing to total loans rose to 5.6 per cent at the end of June, from 3.9 per cent in the same period last year. The bank said that loans to small and medium sized companies posed particular problems. Banacci said that it was making 'good progress' in the implementation of its joint venture in long-distance telephony with MCI, the US carrier. The group said that it expected the government to invite applications for licences to compete in Mexico's long-distance market from 1997 within the next few weeks.</p>

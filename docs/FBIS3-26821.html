There is a need to do a better job in reform and  opening up.    On this year's development in the financial situation, Zhu  Rongji pointed out the following three tasks: 1) Under all  circumstances, we must control the scale of fixed-asset  investment, and the scale of capital construction should  correspond with national economic development; 2) Professional  banks should be turned into commercial banks; 3) People's banks  should make earnest efforts to transform their functions and to  supervise the work of nonprofessional banks.    Among those present at the meeting were Xie Shijie  [provincial party secretary], Xiao Yang [governor], Song Baorui,  Gu Haiqing, and Yao Jinxiang, as well as people in charge of  banks, financial and taxation departments, and insurance  companies at the provincial and Chengdu city levels. As has  been reported, Comrade Zhu Rongji left Chengdu for Beijing  yesterday afternoon.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" from an interview with Prime Minister Robert </F> Malval by Clarens Renois; from the "Meeting" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Malval] [words indistinct] always absolute  equality. The alleged provisional government has de facto power,  but no authority. This power has no legality, no legitimacy. It  is a power resting upon bayonets, bayonets that are increasingly  rusted. For our part, we have not pretended to hold the  government machinery in our hands. We therefore have not been  relieved of what we did not have, but we have kept moral  authority in the face of the usurpers and legitimate authority  in the eyes of the international community. What the people,  those responsible for the coup d'etat, do not yet understand is  that for President Clinton, the Haitian problem is no longer a  Haitian problem, but rather a problem of U.S. domestic policy.  On that score, President Clinton is going to show the same  determination he showed with other problems falling within the  scope of U.S domestic policy.    [Renois] [Words indistinct] Haiti in all that? Meanwhile,  there is the embargo that was adopted by the UN Security  Council. Mr. Prime Minister, there are also threats of  international intervention. In September of 1993, you did not  want a total embargo for Haiti, but today, we have reached that  point. What is your government's report, today, on the economic  situation in the country, the problems of the poor, the deprived  strata of this country?    [Malval] In September 1993, I had the same opinion as the --  let us say -- international community. It was after the  Governors Island agreement. We all believed in the good faith of  General Cedras. The development of events proved that Gen.  Cedras is not a man of his word. Negotiations with someone who  does not respect what he signs are senseless. Today, my firmness  remains the only language possible in view of such demonstration  of bad faith.    (?Cedras had) in his hands all the cards possible to get the  country and himself out of the crisis. He preferred to try to  outsmart everyone. He thought his fantasies were realities.  Well, today, unfortunately, all of us are paying the full price  for ambitions which -- all things considered -- are  disproportionate because.... [pauses] here again, I like to use  psychological profiles. I know what I am going to say is very  strong, but it is my way of perceiving and relating things: Gen.  Cedras represents what I would call the debris of the sensual,  decadent Jean-Claudism without vision.    Today, Gen. Cedras has run out of ideas. He has no  alternative to offer the country but a succession of puppet  governments that have no foundation among the people, no legal  foundations, no constitutional foundations, and no international  recognition. This is very little to offer a country that is  experiencing the most intense crisis of its history since 1804.</p>

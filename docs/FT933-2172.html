			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Major insists he has no intention of quitting post: PM in Tokyo scorns reports of isolation as attacks on his leadership continue MR JOHN MAJOR shrugged off continuing attacks on his leadership yesterday and insisted that he had no intention of resigning. As senior Tories redoubled their efforts to rally round him in the face of persistent sniping from rightwing critics, the prime minister declared in Tokyo that there was 'no vacancy' - neither was there going to be one. Clearly irritated by media questions about his leadership, he poured scorn on reports that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was one of three cabinet ministers being drafted to stand against him. Remarks by Mr Clarke at the weekend, in which he appeared to confirm that he had been approached to stand, were said to have been misinterpreted. Aides said the remarks had been 'supportive', and relations between the chancellor and the prime minister remained good. Asked about reports that he felt lonely and isolated, Mr Major said: 'Heaven alone knows where this nonsense comes from. It is not for me to speculate where everything that appears in public comes from. If I did that I would be lonely and isolated. I do not, and I am not.' The prime minister also won the unanimous support of British businessmen travelling with his party. Mr Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever, said it was 'impossible to conceive of greater support and leadership than we have had in the last two days'. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said the leadership speculation had not been raised by Japanese businessmen or officials. However, the continued sniping from the right suggests that Mr Major's attempt to bring the rebels to heel by calling for an end to 'stupid internecine squabbling' has failed. He was said to be frustrated by his inability to get his message across, but looking forward to a showdown with the rebels at the Tory party conference next month. In London, backbench criticism continued, with Mr Tony Marlow, Tory MP for Northampton North, arguing that a change of leader was now inevitable. Mr John Biffen, a former Tory cabinet minister, said Mr Major must 'add to' his acknowledged strengths of amiability and decency. But senior Tories lined up to pledge their support for the prime minister as speculation about a possible leadership challenge this autumn continued. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said it was 'ridiculous' that prominence was being given to 'totally unfounded rumours of cabinet splits, soundbites from the same handful of backbenchers and hype about minor incidents'. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, said the party backed Mr Major and wanted him to 'remain our leader'. After meetings with constituency party chairmen around the country, Sir Norman said the 'overwhelming view' of the party was 'strongly in favour of the prime minister'.

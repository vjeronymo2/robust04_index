The president's press service has circulated the text of the  greetings, which say:    To the personnel and veterans of the Armed Forces of the  Russian Federation: With all my heart, I congratulate  servicemen and members of their families, veterans of war and  the Armed Forces, and the civilian staff of the Army and Navy on  the Day of Defenders of the Fatherland.    The Day of Defenders of the Fatherland holds a special place  in the calendar of festivals. All the people celebrate it,  paying a tribute of respect and gratitude to Russian servicemen.    It is they who were the first to stand up against those who  tried to destroy our state with fire and sword and to enslave  our people. During the most difficult, mortally dangerous  moments of the war, they bore the salvation of Russia without  sparing their lives.    Today it is you, servicemen of the Army and Navy, who are  the  worthy heirs and successors of martial traditions. Under  difficult conditions, you are displaying steadfastness and  endurance and are honorably carrying out your professional and  civic duty.    Like the whole of the country, the Armed Forces are  currently  going through a period of deep transformation. The Army is one  of the main foundations of Russian statehood, the guarantor of  peace, the guarantor of stability in the country and of the  people's democratic gains. It is for this reason that it must  be mighty and mobile, equipped with the most effective weapons  systems. The state will do everything so that servicemen and  members of their families will feel protected in social terms,  in order that the prestige of the military profession is  enhanced.    I have no doubt that the personnel of the Russian Armed  Forces will continue to be faithful to the Constitution, to  their oath and duty, and will cherish the military vocation and  military comradeship.    I wish you, dear servicemen, your families and friends,  veterans and civilian staff of the Army and Navy, robust health,  happiness and prosperity. Honor, glory, and immense gratitude  to you for your difficult military labor. I wish you success in  your service and lives!    [Signed] B. Yeltsin</p>

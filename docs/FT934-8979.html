			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments improves 19% to Pounds 5.1m as orders show recovery OXFORD INSTRUMENTS, the advanced instrumentation group, reported a 19 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits yesterday and said the rate of new orders was showing 'strong signs of recovery'. Pre-tax profits grew from Pounds 4.26m to Pounds 5.07m in the six months to September 26. Earnings per share increased by 12 per cent to 6.6p (5.9p) and the interim dividend is being increased by 7 per cent to 1.5p (1.4p). The shares closed up 8p at 296p. The profit improvement was underpinned by an 8 per cent increase in turnover. This grew to Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 45.1m) buoyed by new orders, which Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, said were up 10 per cent from the start of the year. With 85 per cent of sales outside the UK, Mr Martin Lamaison, finance director, said the group mainly used sterling's devaluation to improve its competitiveness and boost sales volumes rather than to enhance margins. Operating profits jumped to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 797,000) more than offsetting a decline in interest income to Pounds 359,000 (Pounds 500,000), mainly reflecting the group's lower mid-year cash balances of Pounds 2.6m, down from Pounds 6.7m at the start of the year. The Pounds 4.1m decline in cash balances represented an increase in working capital, reflecting the stronger order book and progress with long-term contracts and the group's second Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.5m) synchrotron machine. Despite earlier concerns over the impact of uncertainties in the US healthcare market, Mr Williams said sales and profits from its magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) joint venture with Siemens held up well. Oxford's share of income from the joint venture slipped slightly to Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 2.96m).</p>

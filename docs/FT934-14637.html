			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BNB advances to Pounds 344,000 BNB Resources, the executive search and selection, training and consumer advertising group, lifted pre-tax profits from a depressed Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 344,000 in the six months to June 30. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 31.8m. Mr David Norman, chairman, described the results as 'an encouraging recovery' and pointed out that all three operating divisions improved their performances. Specifically, the human resources recruitment side, which accounts for about two thirds of group turnover, increased profits - on improved margins - by 30 per cent to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.37m). Mr Norman said there had been a 'modest overall advance' in the senior management and professional recruitment market. He said that this was a sign of 'a growing economy' - management are usually hired and put in place prior to, and in preparation for, the coming upturn, whereas activity in the volume recruitment sector lags behind the recovery. This remained depressed and the outlook flat. Revenues at Norman Broadbent, the headhunter, rose 51 per cent, while they were up 29 per cent at NB Selection, which advertises for candidates only in the UK. Income at NBI in the US grew 50 per cent and a third US office was opened in Chicago. The US represented 'a substantial opportunity', said Mr Norman, and the Far East, where NBI Hong Kong opened an office in Beijing, was 'very important to us'. Cost cutting measures in the training division helped reduce its seasonal losses to Pounds 460,000 (Pounds 582,000) in spite of depressed volumes and margin pressure, and Mr Norman said there had been a 10 per cent increase in first-year chartered courses - the first rise for three years. Losses were also cut in regional communications, the consumer advertising business, which had been 'tough, very tough'. Earnings expanded to 1.1p (0.1p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 1.6p. Mr Norman expected that, unlike last year, the full-year pay-out would be covered.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Ships searched the Gulf of Mexico around two badly burned oil platforms but  found no trace of seven men missing after explosions and fires swept through  the platforms Sunday night. Thirty-five men escaped the blazing platforms,  according to the Coast Guard. Ten of those were injured, two critically. The  side-by-side oil production platforms just off the southeast tip of Louisiana  were about 50 to 100 feet apart, with living quarters on one. The Coast Guard  said men were working on natural gas lines at the time fire erupted, but a  spokesman for owner Atlantic Richfield Co. said the cause of the blaze was  unknown. The spokesman had no assessment of damage.  </P></p>

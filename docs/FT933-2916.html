			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / BAe disappoints with Pounds 20m move into the black: Market surprised by high debt charges and turboprop losses - Analysts lower full-year estimates BRITISH Aerospace yesterday returned to profit after one of the most turbulent periods in its history. The company, Britain's biggest exporter of manufactured goods, reported a Pounds 20m pre-tax profit for the first half of this year compared with a Pounds 129m loss in the same period last year. But the turnround disappointed the stock market which was surprised by the company's high interest costs and continuing heavy losses in BAe's turbopropeller regional and commuter aircraft activities. BAe's shares closed 26p lower at 394p as analysts lowered estimates for the company's full-year profits from a range of Pounds 100m-Pounds 150m to a range of Pounds 60m-Pounds 90m. 'The process of recovery appears to be taking longer than we expected,' one analyst said. Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman, said the company was continuing to put the emphasis on cash generation and cost reduction to boost longer term profit-ability. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, also confirmed the company's efforts to pursue a series of strategic partnerships at the same time as disposing of non-core businesses. After negotiating a partnership with Taiwan Aerospace for its regional jet operations, BAe is now seeking partners for its turbopropeller commuter aircraft business which lost Pounds 60m in the first half. Mr Evans said talks to merge BAe's guided missiles business with those of the French Matra group were making good progress. The company is also engaged in co-operation and possible sale talks, with the Dutch Boskalis group, for its Dutch construction subsidiary, Ballast Nedam. It is also considering selling some property assets to generate additional cash. BAe's core defence activities continued to show a strong performance with interim operating profits of Pounds 230m, down from Pounds 264m a year earlier on sales of Pounds 1.93bn, down from Pounds 2.02bn. Defence activities have been underpinned by the confirmation this year of an additional order for Tornado aircraft from Saudi Arabia. Commercial aircraft activities reduced their losses to Pounds 81m from Pounds 286m in the same period last year, but the company warned that the turbopropeller sector was continuing to incur losses. BAe's Rover car subsidiary reduced its first-half losses to Pounds 19m from Pounds 31m in a recovery fuelled by good sales performance in both the UK market and in continental Europe against the general trend. Rover is expected to be in profit for the full year. Overall, BAe first-half sales rose to Pounds 5.07bn from Pounds 4.63bn. The dividend was increased to 3.3p from 3p. Earnings per share were 4.2p, compared with a loss of 35p. BAe said a much reduced seasonal first-half operating cash outflow meant that net debt increased by Pounds 464m during the first half to Pounds 721m. An increase to Pounds 91m in first-half interest charges from Pounds 62m the year before reflected in large part the lower interest earned on the company's cash deposits compared with the interest paid on its fixed debt.

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT;  </P> <P> SATURDAY'S GAMES AT A GLANCE;  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY  </P> <P> Quarterback David Klingler passed for 457 yards and a career-high seven  touchdowns in Houston's 62-28 victory over Arkansas, extending the Cougars'  winning streak to 11 and Razorbacks' losing streak to four. Arkansas (2-5) is  off to its worst start since 1958, when it opened with six losses. The 62  points were the most scored against Arkansas in a Southwest Conference game,  topping the 60 by Baylor in 1922. Klingler tied the school record of seven  touchdown passes set last year Andre Ware. The junior has passed for more than  400 yards in six of seven games this season. Roman Anderson's 19-yard field  goal with 6:18 left gave him 314 points, breaking the SWC scoring record of 312  by running back James Gray of Texas Tech from 1986-89. It was the 57th field  goal of Anderson's career, one shy of the SWC mark by Texas' Jeff Ward.  </P> <P> No. 19 Clemson sacked Wake Forest quarterback Phil Barnhill eight times in a  24-6 victory. It was the 500th victory in Clemson history and the 14th in a row  over Wake Forest.  </P> <P> Penn State's 9-0 victory over Alabama was the Crimson Tide's first shutout loss  at home in 35 years.  </P> <P> No. 8 Miami bounced back from last Saturday's loss to Notre Dame with a 45-10  victory over Texas Tech. The Hurricane defense, ranked eighth nationally,  allowed Texas Tech only 93 yards and held the Red Raiders to 41 yards in 44  plays through three quarters. Defensive end Rusty Medearis had five sacks, and  Shane Curry and Darrin Smith each had two. Three of Craig Erickson's four  touchdown passes went to Lamar Thomas, who set a school record for most  touchdown receptions in a game.  </P> <P> Darren Lewis became the Southwest Conference's rushing leader for a career with  176 yards in 25 carries in Texas A&amp;M's 41-15 victory over Rice. Lewis has  4,453 yards, breaking the mark of 4,450 set by Eric Dickerson of Southern  Methodist from 1979-82.  </P> <P> Behind quarterback Greg Frey, Ohio State scored on its first four possessions  and five of its first six to take a 38-17 lead over Minnesota at the half. The  Buckeyes' 52-23 victory gave Minnesota its first Big Ten loss of the season.  </P> <P> Chip Hilleary passed for a personal best 221 yards and ran for 102 more in  Kansas' 27-24 victory over Kansas State.  </P> <P> Mark Brus of Tulsa broke Howard Waugh's record of 250 rushing yards set in 1952  with 312 yards against New Mexico State.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IN QUOTES  </P> <P> Iowa State Coach Jim Walden, after the Cyclones, playing without injured  running back Blaise Bryant, lost to Nebraska, 45-13: "This week, I had to  create an offense against one of the best defenses in the country. They are  good, and don't let anyone tell you that they haven't played anybody. They will  be just as good when someone finally decides that they are playing somebody,  and I think that will probably happen next week." The No. 4 Cornhuskers play  No. 10 Colorado Saturday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HE'S EVERYWHERE  </P> <P> Washington quarterback Mark Brunell did a little bit of everything in a 46-7  victory over California. He caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Beno Bryant  and completed a 56-yard pass play for a touchdown to Greg Lewis in the third  quarter. After the 56-yarder, the point-after kick was blocked, and Brunell  picked up the ball and passed to Darius Turner for the two-point conversion.  Brunell also scored on a 32-yard run in the second quarter. Lewis had another  big day. He ran for 205 yards, his ninth game in a row of at least 100 yards.  With 1,126 yards this season, he became the first Washington runner to have  consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. Lewis' 13 100-yard games over two seasons are a  school record.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THIS ONE'S FOR YOU  </P> <P> Kevin Tisdel's 85-yard kickoff return for a touchdown helped No. 16 Georgia  Tech hold off Duke for a 48-31 victory. The Blue Devils had come back to trail  by 24-21 with 2:23 left in the third quarter before Tisdel broke four tackles  on his kickoff return, eluding three defenders who had him surrounded at the  Tech 45. It not only helped assure the victory, it got Tisdel, a sophomore  walk-on, a free education. "Tisdel now has a scholarship as of January."  Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "I told him after the game that I'm not  holding it any longer. That son of a gun just gets it going for us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BIG PLAYS  </P> <P> Shaun Smith's interception in the end zone with 36 seconds left preserved  Rutgers' 20-17 victory over Akron.  </P> <P> Darrel Crawford blocked Joel Logan's conversion kick with 2 1/2 minutes to play  to ensure No. 2 Auburn's 17-16 win over Mississippi State.  </P> <P> Chip Eichloff's 58-yard field goal in the fourth quarter broke the Kansas  record of 57 yards, set by Bruce Kallmeyer against Iowa State in 1983, and was  the difference in a 27-24 victory over Kansas State.  </P> <P> Raghib (Rocket) Ismail had 116 rushing yards in Notre Dame's 31-22 victory over  Pittsburgh. His 49-yard reception set up a field goal that gave the Irish a  17-7 lead, and his 76-yard touchdown run pushed the lead to 24-7. He had 214  all-purpose yards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STREAKS  </P> <P> Georgia Tech's 48-31 victory over Duke was the 11th consecutive home-field  victory for the Yellow Jackets and extended their unbeaten streak to 11 games.  </P> <P> Columbia's 17-15 upset of Princeton ended a seven-game losing streak for the  Lions.  </P> <P> Mississippi's 14-13 victory over Vanderbilt was the Rebels' sixth in a row.  Vanderbilt lost its fifth in a row.  </P> <P> Nebraska's 45-13 victory over Iowa State was its 13th in a row over the  Cyclones.  </P> <P> No. 10 Colorado's 32-23 victory over Oklahoma was the Buffaloes' sixth in a  row. Oklahoma lost its third game in a row for the first time in 25 years.  </P> <P> Leodis Flowers ran for 208 yards in Nebraska's 45-13 victory over Iowa State,  his sixth consecutive game of at least 100 yards. . . . Baylor ended No. 24  Texas Christian's five-game winning streak, 27-21. . . . Tulsa ended its  six-game losing streak and extended New Mexico State's to 25, the nation's  longest, with a 35-10 victory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INJURIES  </P> <P> Minnesota quarterback Marquel Fleetwood sustained a sprained shoulder. . . .  Wisconsin quarterback Tony Lowery suffered a sprained back.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE 200 CLUB  </P> <P> There was nothing easy about Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden's efforts for his  200th victory. After failing in two previous games, No. 12 FSU defeated  Louisiana State, 42-3. But Bowden's victory celebration was marred by a  bench-clearing, free-for-all after Florida State was penalized for a late hit  on the game's final play. Coaches and stadium authorities moved in to separate  the players. Last Saturday against Auburn, a similar penalty helped the Tigers  beat Florida State, 20-17. The week before that, Florida State had lost to  Miami.  </P> <P> A list of the 11 major college coaches with at least 200 victories:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.45IN:1.45IN:1.34IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS"

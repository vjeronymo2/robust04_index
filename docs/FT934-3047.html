			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Observer: Uphill task Who says the Brits revile the notion of a common European currency? A small group from north London has even commenced lobbying the Bank of England, EU embassies, and the European Commission with a design for the Ecu coin. The 'Campaign for Benny Hill's head on the Ecu' advances the dead British comic as 'the perfect popular non-political continental personality to grace the face of the Ecu'. His having sent up a number of his fellow Europeans by dressing up in lederhosen and so forth somehow makes him a 'poignant and intelligent choice' for the Ecu. Founder campaigner John Hulme admits the idea was born at a 'slightly tipsy moment'. But the Danish embassy, at least, seems to like it. Those convinced that Benny Hill is their man should contact the campaign at 42 Hawthorn Avenue, London N13 4JT, telephone or fax 081-886 8951.</p>

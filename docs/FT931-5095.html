			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: Two sides to stories of oppressed Russians Sir, The Financial Times is to be applauded for its editorial ('Russia's backyard', March 2). President Yeltsin's call for the United Nations to grant Russia 'special powers' is simply a request for justification of Russian imperialism. Russia is not the solution but the problem in many of the conflicts in the former Soviet Union. In Moldova, for example, it is the Russian 14th army which induced the conflict among the various ethnic groups. It is the Russian 14th army which is now illegally dismembering this sovereign nation. While the FT expresses concern about treatment of the 25m ethnic Russians living outside Russia, it expresses no such concern about Russian treatment of a similar number of non-Russians living in Russia. While there are about 11m Russians in Ukraine (22 per cent of the population), almost 50 per cent of the schools are taught in the Russian language. But there are no Ukrainian-language schools for the 9m Ukrainians living in Russia (almost 1m in Moscow alone). Yet Russia claims Russians in Ukraine need protection] The reaction of some of the newly independent nations toward Russians, if not defensible, is at least understandable. Many of the Russians came to these nations as conquerors and now expect to retain their privileged positions while refusing even to learn the local language. Did the world expect France to continue the special privileges of German occupiers at the end of the second world war? The only differences are that the Russians occupied these nations longer and were more vicious toward the native populations. Let us keep these issues in perspective and not be swayed by a new wave of propaganda emanating from Moscow.

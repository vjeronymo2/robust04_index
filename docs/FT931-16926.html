			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Economics Notebook: Time to discuss a Europe-wide monetary policy IT has been done more by accident than design. But the European Community today is more to the taste of the UK government than at any time since June 1988 when EC leaders in Hanover launched the community down the road to economic and monetary union. The single market, although incomplete and imperfect, has been brought closer than many sceptics thought possible when it was launched in 1985. The recent upheavals in the European exchange rate mechanism have dimmed the prospects of Emu by the end of the century. Indeed, if the ERM falls prey to continuing strains, resulting in the break of the D-Mark-French franc link, the outlook for Emu would be so bleak that the EC might turn with greater vigour to completing the single market. But there is another scenario, which could threaten the position of the City of London as an international financial centre and demands serious thinking about the future of the Bank of England. Suppose that the ERM, against the expectations of many commentators and operators in the foreign exchange markets, survives the coming months with the D-Mark-French franc relationship intact, or even strengthened. Then the French government and other EC countries such as Belgium would want to push ahead as quickly as possible with Emu. The German Bundesbank, although doubtful about Emu, would be keen to finalise details of a future European monetary policy, just as in the months before the December 1991 Maastricht summit, it pushed for - and secured - agreement on statutes for the proposed European central bank that are largely modelled on its own Bundesbank law. The possible shape of a future Europe-wide monetary policy is hardly discussed in Britain. This may be understandable given the likelihood that the UK will be outside the ERM for a lengthy period. But it is being discussed in the remaining ERM countries as well as among EC central bankers. Already the Bundesbank is staking out positions that, if eventually accepted, would put the City in a far less favourable monetary policy environment than today. On December 17 last year, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, gave a lecture at Frankfurt university in which he outlined his vision of a European monetary policy. It would include: money supply targets for Europe as part of a stringent counter-inflationary policy. These targets would be similar to those used by the Bundesbank to guide and justify its high interest rates during the past three years. minimum reserve requirements - the absence of which has been one of London's attractions as an international financial centre. Germany's minimum reserve requirements help give the Bundesbank tight control over the provision of liquidity to the banking system and have helped slow down the process of financial innovation in Germany. The Bundesbank wants minimum reserves in a Europe-wide monetary policy because it fears that the lack of such an instrument would cause too much emphasis to be placed on fine-tuning monetary policy: a criticism its officials make privately of UK monetary policy. One of Mr Schlesinger's goals is to safeguard any future European central bank from having to worry about interest rates on a daily basis instead of focusing on medium-term objectives such as money supply growth and the ultimate goal of defeating inflation. The Bundesbank also disapproves of the prominence given to lender-of-last-resort responsibilities in Anglo-Saxon central bank policies. If Mr Schlesinger and his successors have their way, any future European central bank will be biased strongly against bailing out financial institutions. The interests of individual financial centres would be subordinated to the European bank's paramount policy goal of price stability. If the German vision of a European monetary policy is realised, a future financial crisis could see banks or financial institutions in the City being allowed to go under rather than being rescued to safeguard London's position as an international financial centre. These ramifications of a future EC monetary policy should be a matter of debate in Britain. Also important is how much influence the Bank of England can bring to bear in the discussions with Britain's EC partners on such matters. The Bank would hope to muster some allies - including perhaps France - to help limit the Bundesbank's ambitions. But the UK is outside the ERM, a factor that reduces the Bank's influence in EC affairs. The Bank also lacks the clout that the Bundesbank has from independence. Unlike other EC central banks, it has no grounds to believe that the government wants to give it more freedom. The Bank's court meets later this month for a preliminary, internal discussion over the future of the Bank. The question of independence, or at least greater operational freedom from the Treasury, is certain to be on the agenda. Last week, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, fired a shot across the court's bows by again rejecting the idea that UK monetary policy should be transferred to an independent Bank of England. But the government is committed to ratifying the Maastricht treaty. If (and they are admittedly big ifs) the ERM survives, Emu stays on the EC's agenda and the UK parliament eventually accepts stage three of Emu, Britain will have to accept an independent central bank at some time - and one which will most likely be in Bonn rather than in London. As the future of the City may be influenced by the Bank of England's status, the debate about its future should be brought more into the open. This should be possible now that the Treasury has a new policy of openness and greater accountability. In the circumstances, the least Mr Lamont could do would be to explain why he is so strongly opposed to an independent central bank for Britain and detail the benefits that Britons gain from keeping the Bank of England under his thumb.</p>

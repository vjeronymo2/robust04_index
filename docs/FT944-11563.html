			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Starmin deeper in the red Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson which is in survival talks with its bankers, yesterday announced increased losses for the first half of 1994 after a series of provisions and exceptional charges. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 1.24m) was published after the market closed. Sales were 19 per cent lower at Pounds 6.96m. The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis, a status which accountants Ernst &amp; Young described as fundamentally uncertain given the negotiations with bankers. However, Mr Michael Gurner, the chief executive appointed in July at the behest of Starmin's bankers, said the refinancing talks were going well. Starmin was considering various ways of raising funds to eliminate its Pounds 6m debt, such as a placing and open offer. Toal exceptional charges and provisions came to Pounds 1.5m. Excluding exceptionals, operating profits from continuing businesses improved from Pounds 173,000 to Pounds 304,000. Losses per share deepened to 0.5p (0.4p). Last year Starmin breached banking covenants when doubled losses of Pounds 23.2m left it with shareholders' funds of just Pounds 3.42m.</p>

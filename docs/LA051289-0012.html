			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRM FINED $1,000 IN DRIVER'S DEATH  </P> <P> Matson Terminals Inc. has been fined $1,000 for violating federal job safety  laws after a truck driver was crushed to death last month by a shipping  container at its Terminal Island facility.  </P> <P> Leslie W. Michael, director of the federal Occupational Safety and Health  Administration office in Long Beach, said Matson was cited for the failure of a  crane operator to properly engage so-called "J" hooks used to lift containers.  </P> <P> Michael said the failure allowed the 40-foot shipping container to drop onto  the truck cab, killing Michael Gomez, 27, of Montebello.  </P> <P> Sloan White, senior counsel for Matson Navigation Co., parent company of Matson  Terminals, said no decision has been made on whether to contest OSHA's citation  and fine. "We are still in the process of investigating exactly what the cause  of the accident was," White said.  </P></p>

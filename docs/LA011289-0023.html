			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> AN EASIER WAY TO POLISH METAL PRODUCTS  </P> <P> There's a new product on the market that cleans tarnished silver, silverplate,  gold, copper, bronze, most brass and most jewelry in about five seconds,  without messy creams, rags and rubber gloves. Called Qwicksilver and just  introduced by Silver Cleaners USA in Culver City, it works by an electrolytic  process -- in your sink.  </P> <P> Qwicksilver comes in a kit with a reusable 6x8-inch metal alloy plate and 16  packets of an "activator powder." To clean precious metals and jewelry --  except for pearls and enameled items -- you place the plate in the bottom of  the kitchen sink, fill with hot water and mix in a packet of the powder. Then  place your jewelry and metal items in the water for a few seconds.  </P> <P> A company spokeswoman explained that a low-density magnetic field is created by  the plate and powder, which safely draws the soft sulfur ions of tarnish off  the metal pieces. She said that the powder is nontoxic. It won't do any damage  to your sink, or hurt your hands, so you don't need rubber gloves. It's also  odorless.  </P> <P> "The tarnish comes off in about five seconds, unless something is really  heavily tarnished, then you'll probably have to immerse it several times," she  said. "Then you just rinse it and wipe it off with a clean towel."  </P> <P> The starter kit of Qwicksilver, with plate and 16 packets, costs $30, with  powder refills available at $12 for 20 packets. Reorder forms come with each  kit. In Southern California, you can buy Qwicksilver at the Broadway, Bullocks,  J. C. Penney and Robinsons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Getting the Message  </P> <P> Take Note is a handy new paperless message board that is magnetized to stick to  your refrigerator or can be converted to an adhesive-backed board to put on the  wall next to the phone.  </P> <P> The 8 1/2x11-inch board comes with a marker pen so you can write the message  directly on the face of the board, then erase the ink by wiping it with a dry  tissue. Manufactured by Westar of Los Angeles, Take Note comes in seven colors  -- white, pink, turquoise, pastel or royal blue, yellow and red -- and sells  for $9.99. It's available at the Time Machine in Montrose, or Omni Office  Supplies outlets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protecting Car Radios  </P> <P> Lasso Lock is the latest in products to deter car burglars. This one, from  Redondo Beach inventor Jay Derman, helps prevent the theft of your car stereo  cassette deck/radio.  </P> <P> Lasso Lock features a plastic-coated braided steel aircraft cable with a loop  at one end and a locking device that fits into your cassette deck opening.  </P> <P> After wrapping the cable around the spoke of the steering wheel or the steering  column, you pass the lock through the loop to form a "lasso" around the wheel,  then insert the lock into the cassette deck opening -- making sure it fits  snugly against the outside radio face plate. You then insert the key and turn  it counterclockwise, which adjusts the locking mechanism so it fits the  cassette deck's internal configuration and locks.  </P> <P> Derman said that his Lasso Lock is designed to fit car cassette decks that have  narrow insertions for tapes, not the wide ones. "It also offers an alternative  to removing a cassette radio and having to hide it under a seat or tote it  around in a radio bag," he explained. "You can't cut the cable with pliers or  files or saws. You need heavy duty bolt cutters, and that would deter car radio  thieves. (And) if they want to steal the car, with Lasso Lock they'll have to  break the radio to turn the steering wheel."  </P> <P> Lasso Lock, which comes with two keys, costs $29.95, including shipping and  handling and California sales tax, and is available from Z-Lock Manufacturing  Co., 1201 N. Catalina Ave., P.O. Box 949, Redondo Beach, Calif. 90277 or by  calling (213) 372-4842. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

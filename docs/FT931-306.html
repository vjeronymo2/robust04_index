			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Problems of the generation gap - Tim Dickson visits a Swiss school specialising in family business issues What is the right time for a family business to hand on to the next generation? How do you deal with family members who are not active in the firm? How do you go about selling up when you want to retire? Alden Lank is preoccupied with such issues not because he is actually facing any of the challenges himself. As Professor of Family Enterprises at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland, though, he runs twice-yearly courses aimed at resolving them for others. There are plenty of European academic chairs in small and medium-sized enterprises or entrepreneurship these days - but IMD claims to be one of just two business schools on this side of the Atlantic to specialise in the problems of family firms. The other is at Barcelona. Lank accepts that there is an overlap with SMEs and entrepreneurship - but the family business field, he stresses, has its own literature and is by no means exclusively concerned with the small business. Family controlled enterprises account for one third of all companies in the Fortune 500, anything between 75 per cent and 99 per cent of all companies in the EC, and 65 per cent of GDP and employment in Europe. 'The very small business - the Mom and Pop shop - is certainly not our cup of tea,' emphasises Lank. The macro-economic rationale for his 3 1/2 -day course is that a mere 17 per cent of start-ups survive into the third generation. It all started because of the conviction of a second-generation Canadian businessman that management training was sadly lacking on the European family business scene. His message initially fell on deaf ears at IMI-Geneva, one of two Swiss schools that merged to form IMD in 1989. In the end the chair was endowed by Stefan Schmidheiny, owner and chief executive of the Swiss family group which developed and marketed the 'Swatch' watch. An important feature of the IMD course is that family members from two generations of the same firm often attend, and indeed are encouraged to do so. 'We've had five members of the same family', says Lank. 'We love it when the spouse and the children attend. 'They often use the classroom to pass messages which they couldn't articulate back home. In one case we had a mother and son effectively blaming each other's generation for what was going wrong. It was very dramatic. No one was interrupting.' Adds Joachim Schwass, executive-in-residence at IMD: 'The family influence can and should be positive. There needs to be a common vision. Disagreements can sink companies.' Schwass should know, since this is what happened in one part of his family business. Rather than the general management skills taught on most business courses, IMD concentrates on problems of succession, conflict management, the impact of the family on corporate culture, strategy, remuneration, and governance. Not surprisingly governance provokes some of the hottest debate, especially when the subject of non-family directors is raised. 'Individuals have the chance to meet in small groups to discuss problems of common concern with others of similar background, as well as with the faculty,' says Lank. To date the courses have ranged from as few as nine participants ('too few') to 30 ('the upper limit'). 'Students' have come from as far afield as Chile, Australia, Singapore, the Philippines and Egypt, although the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland and the UK tend to be the best markets. The course is restricted to owner-managers, family owners, and family managers, though 'outside' chief executive officers are eligible if accompanied. The next one will run from June 27-30 and costs SFr8,500 (Pounds 5,666) for the first participant, and SFr5,000 for each additional family member.

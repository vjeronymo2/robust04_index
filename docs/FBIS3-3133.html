			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Feature by XINHUA reporters Li Anding (2621 1344 1353) and </F> Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524): "State-Owned Enterprises Have a  Gold Mountain Under Their Feet"]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- When will large and  medium- sized state-owned enterprises break through the  "besieged castle"?    This has become one of the hottest topics at the Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC].    It is an historical topic. Thanks to the devotion of several  generations, socialist China has large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises -- a huge "family fortune" worth 1.8  trillion yuan in total fixed assets. Despite accounting for  only one third of the total number of enterprises in the  country, they contribute half of the state's financial revenue  and make up an all-embracing industrial structure. Joining the  Shanghai delegation's discussion, General Secretary Jiang Zemin  said: "Large and medium-sized state- owned enterprises are the  pillar of the national economy as well as a unique advantage of  the Chinese economy. Thanks to this advantage, China has been  spared from many inevitable problems in the economic development  of many developing nations." Enterprise reform aimed at tapping  state-owned enterprises' potential has been carried out for 15  years, beginning with the launching of the "pilot project for  expanding enterprise powers" in 1978. With the state  introducing various measures and enterprises bringing all their  resources into play, the delegation of power, the cut in  enterprise profits levied by the state, the levy of taxes in  lieu of profits, and the contract system of managerial  responsibility were implemented one after another during this 15  year period to help a number of vitalized enterprises emerge as  stars in their sectors, and to bring about profound changes in  the overall outlook of state- owned enterprises.    This is also a practical issue. In contrast to the fast  rising new force of village and town enterprises, it is hard for  state- owned enterprises to takeoff because of their heavy  burdens. The deputies summarized the present situation of  state-owned enterprises as: Low economic returns, slow  development, being heavily burdened, and wanting in sustaining  power. Among the problems, various loans to be repaid by  industrial enterprises covered by the budget already come to 800  billion yuan, 18 years would be needed to clear the debts even  if all their profits were used for debt repayment. Jilin deputy  Quan Zhezhu said: At present the enterprises have several heavy  burdens: 1. Too many debts; 2. too many retired workers and  staff members; and 3. intense pressure from social undertakings.  Whether or not large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  can extricate themselves from this predicament has a direct  bearing on the success or failure of our reform. We may say,  invigorating large and medium-sized enterprises is a problem  that is not only difficult to solve but must be solved.    This is also a topic concerning the future. A Henan deputy  working for the State Council said: The Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee made a decision on several  issues pertaining to the establishment of a socialist market  economic system, which is distinguished from the capitalist  market system by the leading position occupied by large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises symbolizing socialist  state-owned property. Improving and invigorating large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the central and  long-term issues in establishing a socialist market economy.  The deputies said: The "Regulations for Transforming the  Operating Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the  Whole People" and the pilot project of "changing operating  mechanisms and establishing a modern enterprise system"  promulgated and implemented by the state in the past two years  have advanced China's enterprise reform to the third step of  clarifying property rights, following the redistribution of  powers and profits. From now on, state-owned enterprises will  have a chance to really shake off administrative trammels, lay  down the heavy historical burden, recuperate and build up their  strength, and gradually form a capital fleet to sail into the  vast ocean of markets.    The deputies call 1994 a year for "storming fortifications"  and "smashing the barriers" in China's shift to a socialist  market economic system. More than 1,500 Chinese and foreign  reporters are gathering in Beijing to try to seize information  at the NPC session and report to the nation or the international  community on whether or not China can successfully make a major  leap in this crucial year. While we could at least refer to  some experience from outside our boundaries in shifting toward a  market system and in reforming our financial, banking, and  foreign trade systems, we have no precedence to follow in  invigorating socialist state-owned enterprises and have to relay  on our own exploration and creation.    In his "Government Work Report," Premier Li Peng put  forward a new measure to vitalize large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises in 1994: "Change the operating  mechanism of state-owned enterprises and explore ways to  establish a modern enterprise system." Premier Li Peng said:  The reform of state-owned enterprises is the focal as well as  difficult point in reforming the economic structure.  Establishing a modern enterprise system with clearly defined  property rights, unequivocal enterprise rights and  responsibilities, enterprise functions that are divorced from  administrative functions, and scientific management is an  inevitable need of developing socialized macro-production and  the market economy, as well as an arduous and complicated job.  This year the state will organize a number of large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises to, in accordance with the  "Company Law," carry out a pilot project for establishing a  modern enterprise system, to accumulate experience and gradually  push on our drive. The continued, vigorous advance of the  social security system reform and lessening of the burden of  social undertakings on enterprises have created conditions for  enterprises to participate in fair market competition.    A deputy working for a macroeconomic department said: In  addition to a macro-environment favorable for state-owned  enterprises to take big strides toward the market, the  enterprises have now been handed most of the powers that are  supposed to be granted under the "Regulations for Transforming  the Operating Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the  Whole People." The enterprises must seize this opportunity to  make good and full use of the various policies introduced by the  state, accelerate the transformation of operating mechanisms,  and move to the starting line for fair competition. The state  has selected 16 cities -- including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang,  and Wuhan -- as the first to carry out a pilot project for  making a spurt toward such highly difficult enterprise reforms  as "bankruptcy," "replenishment" [bu chong 5943 0339], and  "peeling off" [bo li 0475 4418]. It is necessary to strengthen  the enforcement of the "Bankruptcy Law," rely on cities to  establish trading markets for property rights, and accelerate  the readjustment of the enterprises' organizational structure.  We should replenish the enterprises' capital in cash through  various channels to solve their serious fund shortages. At the  same time, efforts should be made to peel the burden of social  undertakings off state-owned enterprises to make it possible for  them to compete with fewer burdens.    Deputy Ruan Chongwu, governor of Hainan Province, said:  Government departments should separate government administration  from enterprise management, "however reluctantly they may go  about it," letting enterprises handle matters that fall within  the scope of their authority; allowing the market to deal with  things that should be solved by market forces; and shifting the  government's work toward coordinating, integrating, and  balancing the interests of various social sectors so that they  will become a single force driving overall social interests  forward.    How did entrepreneurs feel about the deputies going all-out  to help state-owned enterprises? Liu Benren, a deputy from  Hubei, said: This year, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company will focus  on establishing a modern enterprise system and on improving  economic returns in accelerating the pace of transformation  through the shareholding system. Deputy Geng Zhaojie, chairman  of the First Automotive Group, said: In establishing a modern  enterprise system, the government should turn over the reins to  enterprises, which should also reform themselves; otherwise,  nobody can save us. Geng Zhaojie said: There is a gold  mountain beneath every state-owned enterprise. With the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure, each  enterprise will have a magic shovel with which to excavate the  mountain. Whether it will strike gold will depend on its  capability.</p>

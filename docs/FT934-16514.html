			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / BP sells orimulsion stake to Venezuela BRITISH Petroleum is to sell its 50 per cent stake in the company which markets orimulsion, a bitumen-based substance which has been labelled by environmentalists as the world's dirtiest fuel. The disposal of its share in BP Bitor will be welcomed by the UK coal lobby which sees orimulsion as a growing threat in the power market and a factor in the contraction of the mining industry. The lobby will argue that BP Bitor, to be renamed Bitor Europe, is likely to have less influence in Europe once BP's stake goes to Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned company which owns the other 50 per cent. Earlier this year the government rejected calls for a ban on orimulsion. The coal lobby suffered another blow in August when the Pollution Inspectorate issued authorisations to PowerGen, the power generator, to burn orimulsion at Ince on Merseyside and Richborough, Kent. BP said the sale, effective from January 31, was aimed at helping it concentrate on its core activities. It was this, rather than orimulsion's image, which had influenced the disposal decision, it said. The sale of the stake for about Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) will have a minimal impact on BP's financial performance. BP Bitor said it expected UK sales to remain at about 1.3m tonnes annually in the next two to three years.</p>

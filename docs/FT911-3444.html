			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (9): Weather has the last say - Farmers prepare for a year of lower harvests 'CHINA'S harvest last year was the best in history, but it won't be so good this year', says Mr Zhang Shaogong, of Peking's agriculture ministry. A serious drought gripped north China through last winter, and though snow fell in March the year's total may fall short of last year's. Drought has affected areas in the south, too, and these will need heavy spring rains to replenish water supplies. As a result, the summer-harvested crops - which make up a third of the annual total - will definitely not reach last year's peak, and the autumn harvest is unlikely to fill the gap. This can only aggravate China's other economic difficulties. Unpredictable weather explains why Peking's leadership is permanently concerned over agriculture. 'Last year, the rains came when the crops needed it. We dare not count on such weather again', comments Mr Zhang. 'Experience shows we only get two good years in five.' All agricultural sectors shone in 1990. Cotton output rose by more than 18 per cent to 4.47m tonnes, and oilseeds, which in the form of cooking oil provide an indispensable part of Chinese cuisine, by nearly 25 per cent to 16.2 m tonnes. Meat, milk, fruit and sugar crops, increasingly adding protein and diversity to the diet, were up substantially. But all this plenty, especially of grain (435m tonnes), brought serious headaches. At the end of last year, tens of millions of tonnes were being kept in the open air, twice the amount lying outdoors at the end of 1989, said Bai Meiqing, vice-minister of commerce, last month. Damp and pest-ridden grains were up by a quarter and a third respectively, he noted. Because of cash shortages last year (the consequence of China's nationwide financial difficulties), Peking's commercial departments could not afford to buy more than the set quotas for storage, and the peasants were left with grain they could not sell. This surplus is a strong disincentive to growing more this year. Currently the state makes contracts with the peasants to buy 50m tonnes of grain yearly at a fixed price and in return supplies subsidised farm chemicals and fuel. But since 1988 official policy has put pressure on peasants to grow as much as they can, though without providing the cheap inputs to facilitate it. Disappointed, many are now out of pocket. As a result, said vice-premier Tian Jiyun at a conference in March, the peasants last year won no extra income and some even sustained a loss. 'Our farmers are getting poorer', says Ma Lin, vice-governor of Sichuan province. Peking is right to be concerned over feeding its huge population. The question is whether this concern is being demonstrated in the right way. The return to individual farming (the so-called 'household responsibility system') brought the enormous surge in farm production in the early 1980s, but, in tune with the post-Tiananmen stress on control and ideology, the collective is now back in vogue. In any case, some western diplomats argue, China is worrying about the wrong things. There is no need to stress higher grain output since enough other foods are now produced to keep the country reasonably nourished. Allowing market forces to operate more instead of less would bring better returns. At least the central government is taking one sensible new approach. There is a fresh emphasis on purchase and marketing which may enable China to distribute grain more effectively. Peking has set a production target of 450m tonnes of grain by 1995 and 500m tonnes by the year 2000. This will be achieved by 'improving' (how is unspecified) the household responsibility system, upgrading services to farmers, stepping up the collective element in rural management, streamlining food distribution and increasing agricultural investment. The quality of the land itself is under scrutiny. China has many hectares of marginal land which will be the target of investment over the current five year plan. 'Production bases' in which Peking will invest yuan 10 bn are being set up for grain and cotton, and more grain markets will be established. Some scepticism is in order here since, from the 1950s onward, in its more apocalyptic moods Peking has urged the development of marsh and mountainside. Similarly, grain markets have been on the agenda ever since the mid-1980s, but without so far performing. Today, however, there is hope since China is more aware of the environmental damage which may result from unwise cultivation. But optimism is not reinforced by the statement of Song Ping, one of China's top six leaders on the Politbureau Standing Committee and its chief Marxist-Leninist guru, at a recent agricultural conference, that 'Using socialist ideology to arm the cadres and people of rural areas and guiding the 800m peasants to firmly take the socialist road are the basic assurance for doing a good job in rural work.' This old-fashioned hard-line policy is reflected in the Central Committee's recent order that the grassroots bureaucracy be improved, first and foremost the party branches. Socialist ideology and spiritual construction should take the lead. This is a far cry from Deng Xiaoping's slogan 'it is glorious to get rich]' promulgated just a few years ago. China would do better to forego attempts to organise its vast rural territories and simply free the prices paid for farm products, argue some western diplomats. The market principle would soon beget a higher output and a better distribution system. But this seems unlikely to happen in the present political climate. Minor experiments in freeing the price of grain are in progress, for instance in Guanghan county in Sichuan province, but transfer to wider arenas does not seem likely yet. The big success of rural China is the town and village enterprise sector. This grew up in the heady days of the economic freedoms of the early 1980s, when farmers were encouraged to set up small businesses. The total value of rural output last year reached yuan 1.625 bn, of which nearly 55 per cent was generated by local enterprise. This is recognised nationally as the single most important factor in raising the standard of living and even the hardest-liner has so far shown no sign of trying to roll it back. It is a pity Peking cannot apply the same successful principles to food production and sales, which would obviate the need for the new stress on village control.</p>

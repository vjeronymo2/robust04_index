			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Japan buys into the west's shop windows NOW THAT the Japanese have gained control of Aquascutum and Daks Simpson, they have decided they need the right kind of shop window dummies to display their newly acquired robes and reinforce the British image in their shops. Yoshichu Mannequins, one of Japan's leading manufacturers of mannequins and display products, is acquiring the Rootstein Hopkins Group, a leading UK mannequin designer and manufacturer. The acquisition will take Yoshichu into virtually every high street in Britain. Rootstein Hopkins models are on show in department stores and clothes shops throughout the UK and the rest of Europe, as well in Japan. Indeed, Rootstein Hopkins was responsible for one of the most significant recent innovations in the mannequin market. Traditionally Japanese mannequins had western features and it was only after Rootstein Hopkins produced a dummy modelled on a famous Japanese fashion model 10 years ago that mannequins with oriental features became acceptable in Japan. The privately owned Rootstein Hopkins, based in London, is known for its high quality mannequins, 95 per cent of which are modelled on real people including figures such as actress Joan Collins. The decision to sell by Mr Richard Hopkins and Mrs Adel Rootstein, the husband and wife founders, was made after they had difficulty finding a successor. The Japanese company, which produces Rootstein Hopkins mannequins under licence, emphasised the cultural as well as the commercial benefits of the acquisition. 'You might say that the east and west are joining hands in an artistic collaboration,' said a Yoshichu spokesman. The deal, the value of which was not disclosed, underlines the Japanese taste for quality products and well known brand names. It also reflects a growing interest among Japanese companies in establishing a toe-hold in the European retailing market. Yoshichu hopes ownership of Rootstein Hopkins, which has manufacturing facilities in the UK and the US, will help it develop an international operation. Rootstein Hopkins exports about 90 per cent of its products manufactured in the UK, which contributed about Pounds 6m to sales last year of about Pounds 8m.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese telecoms group posts small rise DDI, one of Japan's new long-distance telecommunications companies which are competing for market share against Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, saw a sharp rise in interim sales due to an jump in subscribers during the first six months to September. Non-consolidated sales rose 19.5 per cent to Y132.6bn (Dollars 1.22bn) while operating profits increased 7 per cent to Y18.7bn. However, the company, which went public in September, posted a marginal rise of 1.6 per cent in pre-tax profits to Y13.4bn due to listing costs. Revenues from telephone calls rose 13.7 per cent to Y100.2bn, while revenue from specialised services rose 15.4 per cent to Y2.4bn. Income from other related businesses rose 44.4 per cent to Y29.9bn. New subscription contracts totalled 2.2m during the first half, pushing outstanding contracts up 25 per cent to 11m. Costs in issuing new shares ahead of its listing totalled Y1.9bn. For the full year to March, DDI expects the price war against NTT to take its toll on earnings. The company cut its rates earlier this month following a similar move by NTT in October. DDI forecasts its first fall in annual pre-tax profits since the company was established in 1984, due to an 18 per cent fall in revenue from telephone calls.</p>

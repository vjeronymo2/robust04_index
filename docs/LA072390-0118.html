			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WEST COAST CITIES, CHEVRON CITED FOR 'DIRTY' GASOLINE  </P> <P> West Coast cities have the "dirtiest" gasoline in the country and Chevron  nationwide sells the gasoline with the highest average levels of cancer-causing  benzene, an environmental group said today.  </P> <P> The group, Citizen Action, released a study saying Seattle, Los Angeles and San  Francisco consistently were among the cities where unleaded gasoline had the  greatest average concentrations of benzene as well as highly toxic chemicals  called aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylene.  </P> <P> Boston and Atlanta were also rated poorly in the study, which was based on a  survey of gasoline in 18 cities conducted by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers  Assn. in the summer of 1989.  </P> <P> Among the 12 oil companies covered by the study, Chevron was singled out for  selling gasoline with the highest average benzene content nationwide.  </P> <P> Citizen Action officials said they hoped that their study will be used by  consumers to avoid the most contaminated brands and fuel blends, both for  environmental and health reasons.  </P> <P> Neither the oil industry nor Chevron officials had any immediate comment on the  study.  </P> <P> The study comes as Congress is acting on clean air legislation that would set  limits on benzene levels in the new cleaner-burning "reformulated" gasolines  now being developed by several oil companies.  </P> <P> Benzene is emitted in auto exhaust, but the main threat to motorists comes in  the form of gasoline vapors released during refueling. The Environmental  Protection Agency estimates that motorists face an eight in 100,000 chance of  getting cancer from lifetime exposure to benzene emissions at the pump.  </P> <P> Aromatic hydrocarbons cause a wide variety of toxic effects, ranging from liver  and kidney damage to birth defects, and also promote urban smog. Clean air  legislation would regulate levels of those chemicals in gasoline as well.  </P> <P> Citizen Action officials said they believed that West Coast cities fared the  worst because refineries in that region cannot find other markets for benzene  and aromatic hydrocarbons and, thus, simply dumped them into their fuel blends.  </P> <P> In contrast, they said, Gulf Coast refiners can sell benzene and aromatic  hydrocarbons to local chemical plants that need those substances to manufacture  petrochemical products.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Seoul correspondent Toshihiro Ishihara; third in </F> a series entitled "Structure of North Korea's Suspected  Development of Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the  International Community": "Irritated South Korea Concerned by  the Possibility of Sanctions Provoking Military Clashes"]    [Text] ROK President Kim Yong-sam called a meeting of the  National Security Council to discuss North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear weapons. During the meeting, the South  Korean president stated with a grim expression on his face,  "North Korea's nuclear program is targeting us, and we have to  keep the DPRK from developing nuclear weapons by all means."  This was the first such meeting that the president had called  since taking office.    Commenting on the North Korean nuclear issue, South Koreans  have said: "The DPRK's nuclear program is putting 70 million  Koreans both in the North and South at risk. The DPRK's nuclear  program is a fragrant violation of the joint declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." South Koreans  consider the North's nuclear program to be a major obstacle to  maintaining peace and stability in Asia. Many South Koreans  believe that "if North Korea has nuclear arms, Japan will arm  itself with nuclear arms."    North Korean President Kim Il-song has repeatedly stated:  "We  have neither the capability to develop nuclear weapons nor the  intention of doing so. We do not need nuclear weapons." The  DPRK declared last March that it would leave the nuclear Non-  Proliferation Treaty (NPT) after rejecting special inspections  of facilities that were suspected of being used to develop  nuclear weapons. On 13 June, North Korea announced its  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  further deepening suspicions about its development of nuclear  weapons.    The ROK has called on North Korea to settle the nuclear  issue  based on the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula on which the two Koreas agreed in December  1991. In line with the joint declaration, the two Koreas set up  the North-South Joint Committee on Nuclear Management to conduct  mutual nuclear inspections in addition to nuclear inspections by  the IAEA, but the joint committee has remained stalled since  January 1993, when meetings broke off after the two Koreas  failed to find areas of agreement to carry out the mutual  nuclear inspections.    Inter-Korea prime ministerial talks were scheduled to be  held  in Seoul in December 1992, but North Korea unilaterally called  them off. Working-level talks have been held since last October  to discuss an exchange of envoys to make arrangements for  North-South summit talks. At one point, there existed the mood  at a meeting to reach an agreement on an exchange of envoys. At  the eighth round of the working-level meetings in March, South  Korea asserted that the North Korean nuclear issue should be  resolved as a matter of priority. In reacting against the ROK's  assertion, the DPRK broke off the meeting after saying, "Seoul  will be turned into a sea of fire." Since then, North and South  Korea have had no channel for dialogue.    The DPRK has made it clear that the United States is its  sole  counterpart for discussing the nuclear issue, in showing no  willingness to hold a dialogue with South Korea. This stand by  North Korea has irritated the South. The resumption of the  North-South dialogue is a precondition for holding high-level  U.S.-DPRK talks. The condition for resuming the North-South  dialogue was dropped because the issue of holding the third  round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks encountered rough sailing.    Whenever the question has been raised about imposing  sanctions on the North since it announced its withdrawal from  the NPT, the ROK has persuaded the nations involved to take  "mild measures against North Korea." The ROK has been concerned  that hard-line measures such as sanctions could incite North  Korea to provoke military clashes on the Korean peninsula.    Experts on the Korean peninsula point out that debates in  the  UN Security Council on sanctions against the DPRK mean another  "crisis" on the Korean peninsula, following the crisis that  arose from an attempt by North Korean commandos to attack  Chongwadae (the presidential office) following the end of the  1950-53 Korean war.    South Korea has made one concession after another to North  Korea in a bid to prevent a recurrence of the past tragedy, but  the DPRK nuclear issue has been aggravated. South Korea, a  counterpart of North Korea, has been unable to talk directly to  North Korea about the nuclear issue. The ROK strongly believes  that the only way to have North Korea change its stand is to  push for UN sanctions in concert with Japan and the United  States while seeking cooperation from Russia and China.    On 15 June, former U.S. President Carter entered North Korea  through Panmunjom. South Koreans are now watching intently to  see what results his trip to North Korea will bring about.</p>

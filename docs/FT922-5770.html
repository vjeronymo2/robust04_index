			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (11): Labour-dominated scene - Economic successes for moderates THE LABOUR Party was returned with ease as the largest party in the recent local elections for the Coventry city council. In April, Mr Dave Nellist, who was expelled last year from the Labour Party, ran as an independent and this factor tended to dominate coverage of the general election for Coventry. These two developments may have created the impression that - seen from a distance - Coventry was a little like Liverpool: an industrial, predominantly working class city, faced with a struggle between the hard left and Labour Party moderates. In the event, Mr Dave Nellist, a popular local man who had built up a reputation as a good constituency member of parliament, was defeated in Coventry South East by the official Labour Party candidate, Mr Jim Cunningham. But it was a close-run thing - Mr Cunningham polled 11,902; Mr Nellist, Independent Labour, 10,551; while Mrs Martine Hyams polled 10,591 for the Conservatives - showing a seven per cent swing to the Tories from Labour since the 1987 election. At a local level, however, any faction-fighting within the Labour Party was not a consideration. The Conservatives did gain five seats at the expense of the Labour Party, but Labour still held an overwhelming 41 seats, with none going to the Liberal Democrats. Mr Bob Ainsworth, who won the Coventry North East seat for the Labour party says: 'The hard left or extreme left - or whatever you would like to call it  -has never had much influence at a local level.' The Labour city council is widely seen as united and moderate council which has been the main driving force behind the successful diversification of the economy. Mr Jim Cunningham the new MP for Coventry South East, who was the leader of the council until his election, says: 'We realised in 1981 we had to change. We had to broaden the base from the car industry. The alternative was mass unemployment. We built the science park with the university; we took the initiative in building Westwood Park - Barclays Bank has moved to Westwood. If Barclays bank is prepared to move to Coventry, then it must be confident of the City's future.' Mr Cunningham says there was little opposition from within the Labour Party to these entrepreneurial policies - 'the only people to oppose us were the Conservatives. The government didn't like the idea of local authorities building science parks - they didn't like the idea of any public authority spending money on that kind of thing.' Mr Bob Ainsworth (Coventry North East) who is a former deputy leader of the city council says: 'We were able to get things moving in the early 1980s because - abnormally for a city council - we had a lot of assets. 'We owned most of the city centre and we had a lot of land. We were able to use this land to enter into deals with developers. It's a lot more difficult now, of course, because any land sales have to go mostly towards debt relief.' Asked whether the disturbances in the estate of Wood End in mid-May are not worrying and harmful for the image of a city still trying to attract new investment, Mr Cunningham says: 'Of course they are worrying - but it isn't just Coventry, is it? All the talk I have been hearing in the House of Commons is where is it going to be next. 'The basic problem in the inner cities is the young unemployed; many, in their late 20s, and without jobs, feel disenfranchised and let down. It isn't an ethnic problem, as has been suggested - the minorities are as badly affected as everyone else. 'The trouble is there isn't enough training: anyone connected with the Tec (Training and Enterprise Council) will tell you there are not enough funds.' Mr Ainsworth, who made his maiden speech on the subject of the Coventry disturbances, says: 'This kind of thing is going to happen until we have a proper urban policy. Unemployment in these estates is so very high and many people are unemployed for so long that it's socially acceptable not to work. These people are without a stake in society.' He continues: 'The tabloid press has exaggerated the disturbances - the police never lost control of the estate. There were not great numbers involved. 'The damage to property was not extensive. But yes, if the exaggeration is believed, then it could harm Coventry's attempts to attract new companies.' Mr John Butcher, a former government minister, the MP for Coventry South West and the only Conservative among Coventry's four MPs, agrees that the Labour-dominated council has done a good job in diversifying the economy: 'I would say that there has been a healthy partnership between the local authority, the educational bodies and the government. 'Now, of course, development of science parks and industrial estates will be more and more in the hands of the private sector.' In regard to disturbances Mr Butcher says: 'It has nothing to do with race, as has been suggested. The problem here is a few young people, known to the police, who decided to go on the rampage. The police have the situation under control. 'The encouraging thing is that older people on the estate want to see the young offenders dealt with. It is wrong to conclude from these events that Coventry has a law and order problem.'</p>

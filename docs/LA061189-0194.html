			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISMISSING IMPERIALISM  </P> <P> Michael Parenti's "The Sword and the Dollar: Imperialism, Revolution and the  Arms Race" succinctly reveals the sordid history of Western Imperialism that,  to this date, victimizes the world's peoples, particularly in the Third World.  </P> <P> One would never know this, though, from reading Kevin Phillips' "review" (Book  Review, May 21). Instead of critically examining the thesis of the book, he  simply dismisses it and redbaits the author by stating that the sources cited  at the end of each chapter refer only to "New York's Monthly Review Press,  International Publishers, Progress Publishers of Moscow and the like." But even  in this statement Phillips misrepresents the book, for each chapter contains  dozens of citations from sources as diverse as the New York Times, Business  Week and George F. Kennan. Parenti's book sheds light on the real causes of the  miseries of the world's peoples. Yet Phillips does not challenge even a single  statement of historical fact; he says nothing about the book but reveals  everything about himself and where he stands.  </P> <P> STEPHAN Z.

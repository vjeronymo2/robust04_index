			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Bleak picture of Rhondda Valley leaves out local vision Sir, Michael Cassell's article ('Good vibrations in Birmingham, but who will help Rhondda?', February 27) paints a bleak picture of the Rhondda Valley. No one would argue that this area and others within the South Wales valleys have their economic problems, the majority of which are the result of the decline of the traditional industries of coal and steel. However, it is important that readers see matters in context. The Welsh Development Agency is responsible for what is Europe's largest land reclamation programme. Vast areas of the valleys, once scarred and redundant, have been brought back to profitable use. By the mid-1990s, all major sites of dereliction will have gone. Working with local authorities, and in some cases with the private sector, the WDA is helping to create towns and landscape which will make the valleys a more attractive place for investment. The policy is already paying dividends. So far this financial year, private sector companies have committed themselves to invest Pounds 102.6m in 36 new or expansion projects in the valleys - a significant increase on both counts on comparable figures for the previous year. These companies - even during a recession  - are demonstrating that the valleys have a brighter future. Our own faith in a rebuilt local economy is exemplified by - among other projects - the ongoing construction of the first office accommodation we have ever undertaken in the Rhondda. Fittingly, the 25,000 sq ft project is under way on the landscaped site of old coal working at Clydach Vale.

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIELSEN REPORT GETS THE PICTURE ON GENERATION GAP  </P> <P> "Roseanne" was the most popular TV series in the country last season -- but not  among people older than 55. The ABC sitcom didn't even rank among their Top 10.  </P> <P> "The Simpsons," on the other hand, was the favorite show among people between  ages 18 and 24 -- but it didn't make the Top 10 among all viewers.  </P> <P> That different age groups would have different TV tastes shouldn't come as a  surprise, but during the regular TV season that fact tends to get masked by the  weekly A. C. Nielsen report that lumps them all together to show the top  programs among all viewers.  </P> <P> When the TV season ended, however, Nielsen issued demographic breakdowns of the  varied Top 10s. The exercise is not just academic: Most advertisers are  interested in reaching young adult viewers because they are thought to be more  willing to try new products and to shift brand allegiances. That's why CBS, for  example -- which had four of the Top 10 shows among the 55-and-older crowd but  none among those for two younger categories -- has said that its fall schedule  will target younger audiences.  </P> <P> Here are the Nielsen breakdowns:  </P> <P> Adults, 18 to 24  </P> <P> 1.

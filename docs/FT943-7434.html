			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: CME seeks strength through harmonisation - The exchange plans to merge its financial and agricultural sectors The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is close to making a fundamental shift in governance that for the first time would give its member banks and other financial traders a free hand in guiding its future. The realignment would put the exchange, which already doubles its business very five years, in an even stronger position to compete internationally and allow it to venture into new product areas. The CME is home to the world's largest futures contract, eurodollar or short-term dollar interest rate futures, and boasts the most expensive memberships of any exchange. Seat values are approaching Dollars 1m, with the most aggressive bidders international banks which find the CME plays an essential role in their interest rate risk management and derivatives strategies. In spite of its high profile in global financial markets, the CME's roots are in agricultural products, and until recently a small handful of pork belly and live cattle traders had final say on important items on the exchange's agenda. Having a few 'cowboys' hold sway over a group of international banks has long been viewed as inappropriate - particularly when sensitive issues of financial regulation are being considered - but because the agricultural block holds most of the voting power, there seemed little prospect for change. Now, long-time chairman Jack Sandner, is manoeuvring a quiet revolution. He hopes to merge the exchange's robust financial division with its obscure but politically powerful agricultural sector as early as October. 'It's time to harmonise the agenda of the exchange,' he says. 'We have two different interest groups, and on some issues the division has the potential to tear us apart. To avoid parochial issues and arguments, we have to unify. We're really here to facilitate trade, and that is what we need to focus on.' Five years ago such a statement could have cost Mr. Sandner his chair. However, with CME seat values double what they were last year, Mr Sandner is enjoying unprecedented popularity at the exchange, and has the backing of important membership blocks. The US futures industry also appears to be ready for the shift, with several executives noting that this summer's merger of New York's two largest exchanges set a valuable precedent for the Chicago initiative. As with the New York merger, the CME is prepared to dip into its treasury to compensate its agricultural members for their loss of political clout and the premium their memberships have commanded. Although the consolidation is being played in Chicago as a purely internal issue, it has serious implications for the exchange's future. With its Reuters-owned after-hours trading system, Globex, eclipsed by successful systems elsewhere, the exchange faces difficult decisions about investing in other ex-pit trading technology. A unified membership that could share equally from returns on such investments would give the exchange a freer hand at strategic planning. Similarly, Mr Sandner's initiative to make the exchange a for-profit entity would also be forwarded by a self-interested membership. The consolidation might also breathe new life into the CME's languishing agricultural futures, and into new contracts that have difficulty attracting traders. One by-product of the CME's soaring seat prices is that the price of entry into the exchange is now so high that few traders can afford to linger in inactive pits. The reorganisation is expected to open these pits to more of the exchange's existing membership, and may also produce a new, inexpensive 'mini-seat' that could be used exclusively for trading small contracts.</p>

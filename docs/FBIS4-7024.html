			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- "Our motherland under  the wise guidance of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song  and the dear leader Marshal Kim Chong-il is making a long drive  as a powerful country," said Chu Yong-il, vice-chairman of the  International Federation of Koreans for Reunification.    He told KCNA:    "I deem it a great honor and pleasure to have had an  opportunity to visit the homeland and celebrate the birthday of  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Seeing the motherland  prospering, I feel my heart swell with pride in being a member  of the Korean nation.    "Thanks to our great leader and dear leader, my motherland  has greeted prosperity without precedent in its history of five  thousand years and become the most dignified country in the  world.    "There is no such person as the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song who has devoted everything to the people all his life,  regarding `believing in the people as in heaven' as his motto.  He has led our people to be the happiest and most proud and  intelligent people. Our motherland owes its singlehearted unity  to this care shown by him.    "The building of an independent national economy, the  embodiment of the chuche idea in the economy, has brought about  a dazzling development of our motherland today and it has served  as an unshakable foundation which is not affected by any  worldwide economic fluctuation and threat from the imperialists."</p>

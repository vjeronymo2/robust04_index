			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Markets: Just how private are your affairs? - Serious Money THE RIGHT to privacy is one which people have every reason to expect from those offering professional services. You would not expect your doctor or accountant to give away details of your health or finances without your permission, and if you found out that insurance companies or tax inspectors were surreptitiously obtaining such information, you would have every reason to feel outraged. Customers expect the same degree of confidentiality of their banks, yet this week serious concerns were voiced about the way in which banks hold and release information about their customers' accounts. Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said that banks were breaking their own voluntary Code of Banking Practice, which was introduced in March 1992 to improve bank/customer relations. Under the Code, banks are not allowed to disclose customer information unless it is at the request of or with the consent of the customer. This is to prevent customers being pestered by bank subsidiaries, such as their insurance arms, trying to sell them products. An increasing proportion of banks' earnings is made through such 'cross-selling' of financial products. However, banks have been getting around this requirement in a manner which Carsberg described as against 'the spirit and perhaps even the letter of the Code.' Tactics include requiring the customer to tick a box only if they do not want information about themselves disclosed and making the provision of services dependent on consent being given. Entry to some competitions or the opening of some accounts is also on condition of consent being given. In other cases, rather than supplying a subsidiary with customers' addresses, the bank itself sends out junk mail on its behalf. This can be refined so that financial information is indirectly passed on to the subsidiary - for example, by telling the subsidiary that customers with a minimum balance will be sent mailshots, so that the subsidiary will know which are the most creditworthy customers. Some customers with a healthy bank balance have received cold-calls at home or their place of work by a bank's financial marketing arm inviting them for a chat in order to sell them pensions and other insurance-related products. This was the sort of behaviour which the Code of Banking was meant to stop but clearly it has not been enough. Earlier this month, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux called for a statutory code to regulate banks' behaviour. It found worrying breaches of confidentiality to third parties. In one case, a man's parents were telephoned and told that unless his Pounds 370 overdraft was paid off, bailiffs would be sent round to the parents' house. Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, also expressed his doubts this week that customer confidentiality is being upheld because banks and other institutions sell information about creditworthy customers to credit reference agencies. These agencies are used by stores and lenders to rate the credit risk of applicants. They supply details about bad debts and county court judgments against the applicants to those who are authorised bodies. When an individual wants to borrow money, it seems reasonable that the lender should want to know something about them. Under the Consumer Credit Act, individuals have a right to see the information which is held on them by a credit reference agency. This is particularly important for those who find they are being denied credit, since banks can and do make mistakes and it can be a long time before incorrect information is spotted - and even longer before it is amended. Howe pointed to worrying developments in the way that this information is gained and used. A black market in confidential personal information is growing because the security systems of banks are being breached and a loophole in the law protects the bank from prosecution. Unauthorised individuals have been able to get information about a person's bank account or credit ratings by calling a bank and pretending to be a tracing agent - a licensed organisation which specialises in debt collection - or by bribing bank staff. If the information is obtained through this kind of deception, the bank cannot be prosecuted for passing on the information. The problem is so serious that Howe has called for a parliamentary enquiry and has suggested changes in the law. For the consumer, these are worrying developments. There was always a strong suspicion that the Code of Banking Practice was little more than a public relations exercise on the part of banks, and the alacrity with which banks have got around their own guidelines will do nothing to diminish this impression. A committee headed by Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, is reviewing the Code and any changes will be introduced next March. But this may not be enough. Breach of confidentiality is a serious matter and if a voluntary code is not enough to halt excess, a statutory one may be needed.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Bush appoints transport secretary PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday named Mr Andrew Card, deputy White House chief of staff, as Transportation Secretary. If confirmed by the Senate, he will succeed Mr Samuel Skinner, the new White House chief of staff. The departure of Mr Card opens the way for a shake-up of White House staff, after a management review by a senior RJR Nabisco executive and friend of Mr Skinner. The new chief of staff blames Mr Bush's recent slide in the opinion polls on poor communications and a staff structure which left the president over-reliant on advice from Mr Sununu and Mr Richard Darman, the budget director. Recent reports suggest a chill between Mr Skinner and Mr Darman, with the chief seeking ways to break the director's near stranglehold on domestic policy. Mr Card, a Massachusetts state legislator in 1974-1983, ran unsuccessfully for the governorship of the New England state in 1982. He served in the White House under President Reagan, and stepped up to the post of deputy chief of staff in 1989.</p>

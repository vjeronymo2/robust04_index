			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers on 29 March  carry editorials and articles on ROK Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu's "hasty" support for the PRC proposal that the UN  Security Council president issue a statement on the North Korean  nuclear issue instead of a resolution.    The moderate CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Diplomatic Authorities Should Watch Their  Words." While positively recognizing the significance of  China's new proposal, the editorial says it is "strategically  and technically" inappropriate for ROK diplomats to say "yes" so  promptly.    The editorial questions if Minister Han had sufficient  discussion with security-related ministers regarding this issue,  and even if he had, the editorial says before conveying  acceptance, the ROK should have persistently asked China what it  will do when sanctions on North Korea become inevitable even  after a UN Security Council president's statement.    The editorial also mentions the possibility of having China  accept more of ROK's position on economic cooperation since the  ROK accepted China's opinion on the nuclear issue.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Even Though A Cooperation System on the  North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Established." The editorial  criticizes that "China is using the North Korean nuclear issue  to obtain better conditions in its negotiations on human rights  and most-favored-nation status with the United States, and  economic cooperation with the ROK."    Noting that the United States, United Kingdom, France, and  Russia have exerted their own efforts to resolve the nuclear  issue, the editorial defines Minister Han's support without  consultation with allies as a "hasty" decision.    The editorial further stresses that if a statement is to be  adopted, it should strongly urge North Korea to accept  additional inspection, resume North-South dialogue, and provide  a fixed deadline.    HANGUK ILBO also publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article  dispatched from UN headquarters by correspondent Kim Su-chong.  The article observes that 15 member states of the UN Security  Council are inclined to agree to China's proposal and that the  United States would have no reason to insist on a resolution  when the ROK supports the new proposal.    The article then details the points to which China disagreed  from the draft resolution and its proposal of "a positive,  objective, and moderate expression."    The article reports that interests will be focused on  China's  role after the statement is adopted. Recalling that China said  it was not in a position to exercise influence on North Korea  last year, the article analyzes that China has changed its  attitude by telling the ROK permanent representative to the  United Nations that "China is exerting its efforts needed in the  situation."</p>

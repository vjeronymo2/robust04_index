			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Asset sales boost profit at NZ lingerie maker CERAMCO, the biggest lingerie maker in Australasia, yesterday announced operating profits after tax for the year to March 31 up from NZDollars 16.7m (USDollars 9.3m) to NZDollars 19.3m. Total profits for the year, after an extraordinary profit of NZDollars 7m, were up 61 per cent to NZDollars 26.3m from NZDollars 16.6m. Directors said they expected continuing improvements in earnings and in the group's financial position. The results include trading profits of NZDollars 851,000 from the sale of two subsidiaries outside of its key interests of clothing and exporting china clays. Directors said both these activities were well placed in the international market with high cash-flows and export growth potential. During the year, Ceramco sold its interests in Steel and Tube Holdings, realising NZDollars 32.5m, a surplus of NZDollars 3.7m over the written-down book value. It also eliminated all debt from the balance sheet and had NZDollars 4.5m in cash on deposit at the year's end. It had also repaid to shareholders half the company's paid-up capital, or NZDollars 24.2m, and cancelled 48.4m shares. Operating revenue was NZDollars 163m, compared with NZDollars 133m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Delays experienced at  voting stations on Tuesday [26 April] -- the first day of South  Africa's all race elections -- were teething problems which had  been sorted out, a top Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]  spokesman said.    IEC electoral administration training head Kumi Naidoo told  a  news briefing most delays had happened in the Pretoria  Witwatersrand Vereeniging region where ballot papers and other  election materials were scheduled to be delivered last.    IEC monitors had reported 246 incidents of disruption at  voting stations countrywide by late morning Tuesday. About 175  cases related to difficulties in distributing election material,  reporters were told.    Mr Naidoo said problems had been resolved "at this stage"  and, if not, he expected them to be resolved within a short time.    Voting at Robben Island -- prison "home" to many of the  candidates standing in this week's election -- was delayed when  the ferry broke down.    But the IEC and correctional services officials were  grateful  for the general smooth running of voting at prisons around the  country, Mr Naidoo added.    Problems at Ulundi -- power base of Inkatha leader  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi -- and other parts of KwaZulu/Natal had also been  sorted out, Mr Naidoo told the lunch hour news briefing.    Mr Naidoo confirmed two trucks ferrying ballot papers to  polling stations in Thokoza and Katlehong on the East Rand had  been attacked and burned on Tuesday.    The IEC was making arrangements to stock up the stations  with  ballot papers for Wednesday. He could not confirm the hijacking  of another truck with ballot papers in Pretoria.    Referring to the failure of monitors to show up at voting  stations, Mr Naidoo said this had happened mostly in  KwaZulu/Natal. Planning of voting stations in this region had  been undertaken at the last moment and this explained the  delays. Voting had started in Ulundi, he added.    It was up to election officials at voting stations to decide  if they would keep the polling stations open after 7PM, the  scheduled closing time.    Presiding officers would consider security at each station.    Many voters -- not eligible to vote on Tuesday because they  were not infirm, disabled or members of the security forces --  had arrived and this had contributed to the delays. "Problems  must be seen in the context of these elections. The IEC's major  concern is to allow every eligible voter to cast a ballot," Mr  Naidoo said.    He appealed for voter patience.</p>

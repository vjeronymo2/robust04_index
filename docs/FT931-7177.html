			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling and lira fall sharply Both sterling and the Italian lira - came under intense selling pressure yesterday as the D-Mark consolidated the strong position it has established against European currencies in recent days, writes James Blitz. The pound fell nearly 4 pfennigs in European trading yesterday, to a new historic low against the D-Mark of DM2.3125. The pound later closed in London at DM2.3275, a new record closing low, and a level some 2 1/2 pfennigs lower than its previous close. Sterling also fell to a new historic low of 76.0 against the Bank of England's Exchange Rate Index, a level that was a full percentage point down on the day. This effectively means that the pound is now worth 76 per cent of what it was in 1985. If anything, the lira was even more depressed against the D-Mark, falling as low as L986.00, before closing at L985.00, some L8 down on the day. A particular sign of weakness was that both sterling and the lira weakened against the D-Mark despite the dollar's stronger performance against the German currency. The dollar closed at DM1.6195, up more than  1/2 a pfennig on the day. Undermining both the European currencies was the ever-present concern that Germany is lowering interest rates too slowly. Fears that the Bundesbank will keep rates high were underlined by the release of inflation figures for some German states, which were poorer than the market had expected. In North Rhine Westphalia, for example, the cost of living rose 0.4 per cent in the month to mid-February. The lira's problems were exacerbated by the political difficulties of Mr Giuliano Amato's government. One London-based market practitioner said that the flight out of lire by native Italians was very great: he had anecdotal evidence that Italians were carrying lira in suitcases over the border to Switzerland, and buying Swiss francs. The pressure on sterling, if a little less picturesque, was still a cause of concern. One London-based dealer said it was always worrying when, as happened yesterday, the pound came under pressure for no very obvious reason. One dealer claimed to have seen substantial selling of the pound by US fund managers. Another claimed that the currency was coming under strong pressure in the Far East. The general consenus was that nobody was in the market to buy the UK's currency. Mr Mark Austin of Midland Global Markets saw no reason why the pound should not fall below DM2.30 in the near term. The pressures on the lira and sterling were partially felt by the peseta inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But the Governor of the Bank of Spain said the peseta could be defended by a tax on the movement of entirely speculative short term capital - and this helped the peseta up to a close of Pta71.94 against the D-Mark from a previous Pta72.58.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pricing squeeze hurts Ares-Serono Sales and profits of Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based manufacturer of human fertility drugs, plunged in the third quarter. Consolidated net income from continuing operations fell 34 per cent, to Dollars 13.9m, on sales off 20 per cent to Dollars 171.5m. The group said it had been hit by enforced price reductions on its products in many European countries. Meanwhile, in the US many patients delayed treatment in the hope that the costs would be reimbursed under the Clinton administration's health care plan. Moreover, devaluations in Italy and Spain, where the group makes nearly half its sales, hurt the figures. The group also pointed out that sales in the third quarter of last year were exceptionally strong. For the nine months, total sales were off 13 per cent to Dollars 548.3m, while net income from continuing operations was down 11.4 per cent to Dollars 52,942. Sales of Saizen, the group's recombinant human growth hormone, rose 4.3 per cent in the first nine months, while sales of Metrodin, a follicle-stimulating hormone, jumped 25 per cent. The company said it was investing Dollars 120m to raise its production capacity for Rebif, recombinant human beta interferon, for use in treating multiple sclerosis.</p>

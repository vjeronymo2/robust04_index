			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ;  </P> <P> DISILLUSIONMENT ON CANADA'S PRAIRIE;  </P> <P> A NEW POLITICAL PARTY'S MESSAGE IS 'WEST FIRST.' AND THAT THEME IS CATCHING ON  IN ALBERTA, BRITISH COLUMBIA AND SASKATCHEWAN.  </P> <P> When Canada-watchers look north for clues on how well this vast, diverse nation  is holding together, they usually set their sights on Quebec, the  French-speaking province in the east that periodically makes noises about  independence.  </P> <P> These days, though, they might just as well turn their gaze west, toward  Canada's prairie heartland.  </P> <P> Here in this tiny town in Alberta province, for instance, about two dozen  citizens turned out on a recent evening in the local recreation center to  discuss, amid the crashing of bowling balls, the need for a thorough revision  of the national agenda. They had not a good word to say about the policies  emanating from Ottawa, Canada's capital. In their own way, they expressed  convictions just as strong as those of the French-speaking supporters of  sovereignty in Quebec, 1,500 miles to the east.  </P> <P> "We're bankrupt. We're broke. We're in a mess," said Bob Slavik, a retired  physician and activist for the Alberta-based Reform Party, who co-chaired the  meeting. Slavik called for massive changes in the way Canada operates:  constitutional amendments, a restructuring of the Parliament, deep budget cuts,  the scrapping of all Indian treaties. His listeners seemed to like his ideas; a  number of them plunked down a small membership fee and joined the Reform Party  at the end of the meeting.  </P> <P> The scene in Thorsby is being repeated in town halls, living rooms and hockey  arenas all across the West as fed-up locals give traditional Canadian parties  the slip and rush to join the Reform Party. Unlike the backers of sovereignty  in Quebec, the Reform Party isn't calling for separation outright. But all the  same, Canadian federalists are worried about the party's rapid growth, since  its West-first message -- coming at a time of heightened regional tension --  promises to drive this country's geographic wedges even deeper.  </P> <P> The burgeoning Reform Party isn't the only sign of the West's growing  alienation from the rest of Canada. Treasury officials in Alberta and British  Columbia have lately been trying to find legal ways of collecting taxes  themselves, to keep the federal government from taking the money away. In  Saskatchewan, Premier Grant Devine has been battling the federal government --  successfully so far -- for the freedom to build a huge dam complex without  completing strict, federally mandated environmental impact studies.  </P> <P> But for all this high-level regionalism, the strongest sign of western  alienation comes not from officials working within the system but from ordinary  people on the outside -- the disillusioned citizens flocking to join the Reform  Party.  </P> <P> "They believe the (ruling Progressive) Conservatives have sold them out," says  Alan Tupper, chairman of the political science department at the University of  Alberta.  </P> <P> The Reform Party didn't even exist until October, 1987. Now it claims more than  52,000 members, with 3,000 more signing up each month, many of them disgusted  defectors from Canada's governing party, the Progressive Conservatives. When  the Reform Party ran its first slate of candidates in 1988 federal elections,  it didn't win a single parliamentary seat. But soon afterward, a member died in  office, a by-election was held, and a Reform Party member won handily.  </P> <P> Six months later, another Reform Party candidate was elected to the Canadian  Senate, the upper house of Parliament, by defeating the closest of his six  opponents by a 2-to-1 margin. (The Canadian Senate is, in fact, an appointed  body, but Prime Minister Brian Mulroney accepted the vote and nominated the  winner eight months later.)  </P> <P> Political analysts are predicting that if another parliamentary election were  held today, the Reform Party would win up to 40 more seats in the 295-member  House of Commons, Parliament's lower house. Although that is far from enough to  make a majority, such a showing could give the pro-West party significant  influence in today's Canada, where the two main traditional parties -- the  Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals -- are fast losing ground.  </P> <P> Neil Weir, a Reform Party executive in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, offers what  he calls "a very likely scenario" for the next elections, which must be held  before November, 1993.  </P> <P> In this scenario, neither the Progressive Conservatives nor the Liberals get  enough votes to form a majority government, but the Socialist New Democratic  Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois don't really flower either. If the  Reform Party could win 40 seats in such a Parliament, Weir says, it would hold  the balance of power and the ability to force its agenda on any mainstream  party trying to govern.  </P> <P> "If you can't be the prime minister, the next best thing is to be the party  holding the balance of power," he says. "The party with the balance of power  can bring down the government, virtually at any time."  </P> <P> Such a prospect is daunting to the many Canadians -- especially eastern  federalists -- who consider the Reform Party a reactionary movement, out of  sync with what it has always meant to be a Canadian. By tradition in Canada,  the federal government takes money in taxes from the wealthier provinces, such  as oil-rich Alberta, and applies it toward helping the poorer provinces, such  as Newfoundland. To Canadians brought up in this tradition, Reform Party  influence would mean not a fair shake for the West but neglect for the marginal  everywhere else.  </P> <P> In addition, the Reformists want to cut welfare payments, end the funding of  public-interest groups and screen foreign immigrants on the basis of their  economic potential. They even want to forbid immigrant Sikhs to wear their  turbans if they join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  </P> <P> "They know what they're against, but there's no positive platform," the  University of Alberta's Tupper says of the Reformists.  </P> <P> Reformists don't like being characterized as negative reactionaries, though,  and they point out that their platform also includes restructuring Canada's  discredited Senate, making members of Parliament more accountable and shrinking  the budget deficit.  </P> <P> One of the Reform Party's most cherished goals is the end of official  bilingualism in Canada. At the moment, Canadian law requires government offices  throughout the West to retain French-speaking employees who can deal with the  Francophone public -- even though there are few unilingual Francophones west of  Quebec. Westerners have long considered this a waste of money, and now that the  Canadian economy is in a recession, Reform Party calls to trim the linguistic  fat fall on receptive ears.  </P> <P> In Edmonton, pro-West activist Alan Clark tells a story that sums up the mood.  A woman in British Columbia started a small business making jam at home and  selling it to health-food stores, he says. She was eventually arrested by  bilingualism authorities for not listing her ingredients in French on her  labels -- even though French is spoken by only a tiny fraction of the British  Columbia population.  </P> <P> Clark is the president of a group that predates the Reform Party by about a  decade, the Western Independence Assn. He takes a harder line than the Reform  Party, arguing that Canada doesn't "work," that no amount of electoral  politicking can save it and that the four western provinces should split off  and form a new country on their own.  </P> <P> Westerners are now flocking to the Reform Party instead of his Western  Independence Assn., but Clark says that's fine with him: The Reform Party  "duplicates our agenda almost perfectly," he says. He thinks every angry new  westerner the Reform Party organizes brings his goal a little closer.  </P> <P> "The Reform Party is doing a fantastic job of educating people," he says. "We  (western separatists) are in an 'up' phase -- not in terms of membership or  money, but because our movement is so close to its conclusion."  </P></p>

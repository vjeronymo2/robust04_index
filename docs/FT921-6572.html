			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: A Union that frustrates and provokes an unreasonable argument (2) Sir, Joe Rogaly draws a misleading analogy between the Scots' drive for constitutional change and the reluctance of white South African supremacists to replace apartheid with a new constitution. By drawing Mr Major as a Mr de Klerk, he implies that the defeat of the Scottish Nationalists at a referendum would be comparable to a defeat of white South Africans opposed to power-sharing with blacks. This takes the argument outside the bounds of reason. Liz Ward, 50 Longley Road, London SW17 9LL</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Surge in private renting FRESH EVIDENCE has emerged of growth in the private-rented housing sector, reversing a decline which has been virtually uninterrupted since 1900. Lettings by members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents increased last year by an average of 13 per cent for each letting agent, says a survey published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. Lettings were up 21 per cent In inner London. Sir George Young, the housing minister, welcomed the increase in private renting. He said it confirmed surveys which showed that deregulation of private renting had halted '75 years of decline'. The survey also indicated, however, that the revival of private renting might be shortlived. About one-in-five new lettings is owned by a homeowner who is unable or unwilling to sell their home during the slump in housing prices. Mr Richard Best, the foundation's director, warned that many of these homes would be sold if house prices started to rise again. 'The numbers of lettings could fall again unless the government provides incentives,' he said. The survey found that the rates of return that landlords earn on their investment varied between 6.1 per cent and 7.2 per cent, net of management and maintenance costs. Members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents believe that net returns need to be above 10 per cent to expand the sector. The best incentive for private landlords, according to association members, would be to exempt rental income from income tax. The survey says this might be enough to attract new investment to the sector at present rent levels. Sir George repeated last week's commitment by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to further action to make investment in private renting more attractive. Yet he appeared to rule out a successor to the Business Expansion Scheme, which offered tax relief on property investments and which is due to end in December. The minister said the aim was to encourage 'respectable institutional funds' to invest long-term in the sector, as well as to encourage the return of the private landlord. He was discussing proposals which would allow institutions to invest in residential property through some sort of intermediary, such as an investment trust. This would enable them to divorce themselves from the direct ownership and management of such homes. The State of the Private Rented Sector. Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 40 Water End, York YO3 6LP.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Struggling APV ousts Strowger: Food processing equipment group's chief executive leaves after shareholder pressure for new direction Mr Clive Strowger has been ousted as chief executive of APV, the struggling UK-based food processing equipment specialist which last month halved its interim dividend and warned it was facing increasing pressure on profit margins. His departure, announced yesterday, follows strong pressure from institutional investors which convinced Sir Peter Cazalet, APV's chairman, and non-executive directors that they needed to take action. The move intensified concerns about the direction of APV, a perennial target of takeover rumours. APV's shares, which had fallen 30 per cent to 83p immediately after the results on September 15, slipped 1 1/2 p yesterday to 72 1/2 p, close to their 1994 low of 70 1/2 p. APV said Mr Strowger would leave with immediate effect. With a two-year rolling contract on a basic salary of Pounds 230,000, he could receive a pay-off approaching Pounds 500,000. In 1993, he was paid Pounds 340,202 in salary, benefits and performance-related bonus. Dr Neil French, finance director, is assuming the additional role of chief executive until a successor is appointed. APV said: 'The half-year results were not as good as we had hoped, and came as a bit of a shock. There was a feeling we needed someone to take the company forward at greater speed and with greater vigour than had been shown.' Mr Strowger, a former finance director at Grand Metropolitan and chief executive of Mountleigh, joined APV in June 1992. He played a big part in the restructuring and redirection of the company that became necessary because of recession, increasing competition and problems digesting acquisitions by former chief executive Mr Fred Smith, who left in 1989. Mr Strowger appears to be carrying the can for last month's interim statement. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 5.8m, but the interim dividend was cut from 2p a share to 1p. More seriously, institutions and analysts were worried by an unspecified charge that is due to be taken in the second half for further restructuring of APV's liquid foods division. City estimates for the charge range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m. Mr Paul Pickford, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: 'The City felt that a lot more work needed to be done, and that Mr Strowger was not the best man to pull the company through.' APV stressed that Mr Strowger's strategy - to move away from low-margin manufacturing and contracting work to develop specific products and processes - remained intact. 'It's a pace of change issue,' it said. However, some analysts remain unconvinced by the strategy. Mr Tim Bennett, at Albert E. Sharp, said Mr Strowger's departure 'does beg the question as to whether APV is a problem that has a solution'. Sir Peter said Mr Strowger's departure did 'not signify that we have found a black hole in the company, as compared with what we knew last month was not a particularly happy situation'. He was looking for a chief executive with 'substantial leadership qualities, who would understand this business and have expertise in manufacturing, marketing and contracting'. Dr French looks to be the internal front-runner for the job, but two directors, Mr Richard Fenny and Mr Howard Stanworth, could be considered. APV is also looking externally using headhunters. 'It will be a real challenge for anyone,' said Mr Bennett.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Heseltine warns miners over pit disruption MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday told miners that pit closures would be 'hard to avoid' if they went ahead with a campaign of industrial disruption. His warning followed a ballot of the National Union of Mineworkers which supported by 60 per cent to 40 per cent the call by Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM president, for a 24-hour strike followed by a 'rolling programme of action' in protest at threatened pit closures and job cuts. The NUM vote was 12,913 in favour of action and 8,465 against, although the 60 per cent turnout was low for an NUM ballot. The vote is expected to strengthen the hand of cabinet ministers who are resisting any significant retreat from plans announced by the government in October to shut 31 pits and shed 30,000 jobs. The long-delayed white paper on the future of the coal industry is expected to come after next week's Budget. Some ministers believe the NUM ballot will silence the group of Conservative MPs who aligned themselves with the miners' cause against pit closures. Mr Winston Churchill, one of the group, said the result had pulled the rug from under the potential Tory rebels. Mr Heseltine said: 'The reason we have a problem today is that very large numbers of customers have chosen to change their source of energy. An important reason for this was industrial relations in the pits. This sort of decision seems to confirm to customers for coal that they were right to move away from reliance on it.' There is a danger of a widening conflict in Britain's coalfields. Last night the leaders of Nacods, the 4,000-strong pit deputies union, said they were confident their members had also voted in support of disruption. The result of their ballot will be known by Wednesday. The National Union of Democratic Mineworkers, strong in the Nottinghamshire coalfield, is not holding a strike ballot. If the colliery deputies have voted in support of protest action their union and the NUM are likely to delay any move for a fortnight. They are awaiting the outcome of the ballot of 63,000 members in the RMT rail union, who are being asked to join in industrial disruption because of British Rail's failure to guarantee no compulsory redundancies in any rundown of the network. Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods general secretary, said the NUM and his union would work to keep public opinion on their side. They would be developing new tactics in their campaign to save pits and not resort to the aggressive mass picketing seen during the 1984-1985 miners' strike. Plans are also being prepared for a day of action across Europe by miners in protest at pit closures.</p>

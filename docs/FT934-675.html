			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: ENI The sale of Nuovo Pignone completes the easiest part of the privatisation of Eni, Italy's state-owned energy group. Even so, the trade sale of a profitable engineering company has taken well over a year to complete. General Electric of the US was an obvious suitor, since the companies enjoy a commercial relationship in turbines. The involvement of Dresser, Ingersoll-Rand and a syndicate of Italian banks is more difficult to fathom. It is hard to believe the triumvirate of hard-nosed US corporations will want to endure a minority position for long. Transfering the larger parts of Eni out of public sector control will require more preparatory work. AGIP in oil exploration and production and SNAM in gas marketing and distribution are attractive enough. AGIP ranks fifth among world oil and gas exploration companies ranked by reserves. But despite promises of restructuring, it seems too much to hope that Enichem might be knocked into shape in time to take part. Its problems are deep-rooted, especially while petrochemicals markets remain depressed. SNAM and AGIP will have to sever their shareholding connections with Enichem before they can be brought to the market. Welding AGIP and SNAM together would create a natural resources company to be reckoned with, but putting a workable management structure in place will also take time. With France due to privatise Elf Aquitaine in the first half of next year, though, allowing international investors to rest between courses may be no bad thing.</p>

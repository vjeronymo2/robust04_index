			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Gyllenhammar switches to banking after Volvo debacle Ten months after resigning in the aftermath of Europe's most spectacular failed merger, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, former chairman of Volvo, has emerged in a new guise as investment banker. The announcement that he is to move to London to set up an investment bank with Hans-Jorg Rudloff, the Euromarkets pioneer, has settled the question of what the former chief of Sweden's biggest manufacturing company would do after the collapse last December of his plans to merge Volvo's car and truck operations with Renault of France. Mr Gyllenhammar said the bank would offer a traditional service - 'very private, very discreet and very focused on the client' - which will operate across Europe. Yesterday 'PG', as he is known in Sweden, was in ebullient mood, full of enthusiasm for his new project and insisting that he harboured no bitterness over the shareholder and management revolt that scuppered the merger plan and prompted his resignation after two decades in charge at Volvo. Mr Gyllenhammar, 59, has avoided - and says he will continue to avoid - talking in detail about the events of last winter. But he did not disguise his criticism of Volvo's subsequent change of direction, nor did he make much effort to dispel the impression he gave in a recent interview that he believed he was the victim of a 'gigantic power play' by the Wallenberg empire to cut Volvo down to size. The Wallenbergs flatly deny the allegation, which Mr Gyllenhammar has not substantiated. Volvo has since decided to concentrate on its core business and sell SKr40bn (Pounds 3.38bn) worth of non-core businesses built up by Mr Gyllenhammar. He is adamant that his strategy of merging the vehicle operations with Renault and diversifying Volvo into other industries was the best long-term prospect. 'I haven't changed my mind. I stand by my conviction that the deal we proposed was a good deal.' Mr Gyllenhammar said he would spend four-fifths of his time working at the as yet unnamed investment bank, which is to be backed by Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert and managed by Mr Rudloff and Mr Peter Ogden, a former director at Morgan Stanley.

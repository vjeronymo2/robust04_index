			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The European  Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has cooperated  successfully with China, Professor C.H. Llewellyn Smith,  director general of Cern, said in an interview with XINHUA here  today.    CERN, set up in 1954, is the world's biggest organization  for  basic research on particle physics.    Nineteen countries participate in CERN, with 5,000 staff  members and 500 scientists from outside the participant  countries.    Prof. Smith said CERN has attracted scientists from around  the globe, and its research is of great significance. At  present, half of the world's high-energy physicists are listed  in CERN.    He said CERN has cooperated with China for more than 10  years, and about 80 Chinese scientists are doing research in  CERN today.    Smith said, "We very much welcome Chinese scientists to join  CERN. They bring with them wisdom and products. We are looking  forward to further cooperation with China, including cooperation  in new experiments and construction of new accelerators."    He said CERN's success is the result of close cooperation  between scientists from different countries.    Chinese scientists have contributed a lot to the L3  [expansion unknown] experiment chaired by famous physicist Prof.  Samuel C.C. Ting, Smith added.    Prof. Ting, a Nobel laureate in physics, told XINHUA that  his  joint work with Chinese scientists dates back to 1977, after  which time 10 to 20 Chinese scientists were sent to work with  him annually.    He said that the Chinese scientists had made important  contributions in the fields of theory and digital analysis.    He said Chinese scientists collaborated in the design and  construction of Laboratory L3 in 1982. They undertook the  building and experiments on the BGO crystal, a time- and  energy-consuming task.    Due to their efforts, the first mass quantity of BGO  crystal,  12 tons, was reaped.    As for CERN-China cooperation promoting China's research in  high energy physics, Smith said that the cooperation provided  Chinese scientists with opportunities to explore physical  origins on the front line of physical structure research while  exposing them to a lot of high technologies, concerning  superconduction, high frequencies, high vacuums and computer  networking, thus training them well in these aspects.</p>

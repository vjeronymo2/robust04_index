			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> A former television anchorman in Erie, Pa., has filed suit against his station,  charging he was demoted because of his age. Hyle Richmond, 62, filed suit in  U.S. District Court against WICU-TV and its parent company, Great Lakes  Communications Inc., seeking reinstatement to his job as an on-air newscaster  and anchorman. The suit claims that Richmond, after more than 30 years on the  air, was demoted to a reporter's job on Sept. 28, 1987, and was replaced by  Lisa Adams, who is in her early 30s. It further says the station also fired or  demoted three other on-air newscasters or anchors who were more than 40 and  replaced them with younger employees. Richmond is still employed by the  station. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

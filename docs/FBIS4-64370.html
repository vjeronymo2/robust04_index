			<p>BFN     [Text] A Maltese oil tanker tried yesterday -- with the  help of Serbian-Montenegrin naval vessels -- to break through  the UN embargo against the Yugoslav Federation. Italian fighter  planes and British and Dutch ships stopped it. Massimo De  Angelis interviewed Defense Chief of Staff Admiral Venturoni.    [Begin recording] [De Angelis] Admiral, did the Italian  forces run the risk of getting involved yesterday in the  Adriatic Sea?    [Venturoni] There has been such a risk, since the Italian  Armed Forces are part of an international allied coalition.  There was an incident yesterday: An oil tanker tried to break  through the embargo. Naval forces belonging to the  Serbian-Montenegrin republic intervened and our forces strongly  reacted. Two Tornado planes from the Gioia Del Colle airbase  also took part in the operation. They helped the NATO and West  European Union ships. According to information I have, the  embargo has caused great difficulties to the republic of Serbia  and Montenegro. We have evidence that their being more ready to  negotiate may be linked to the need to see an end to the embargo.    [De Angelis] So, the international alliance in the Adriatic  Sea to enforce the UN resolutions is really working.    [Venturoni] Yes, it works very well. It is being coordinated  mostly by commands based in Italy. They are under the command  of Italian officers. It is a typical example of what  cooperation should be within NATO and -- thanks to the West  European Union -- also at a European level.    [De Angelis] Does this mean a lot of work for Italy?    [Venturoni] Well, Italy is quite involved. We have three  ships which are constantly assigned to the coalition forces,  maritime reconnaissance planes and also Air Force planes  supporting naval forces. They are on constant alert at Italian  bases. [end recording]</p>

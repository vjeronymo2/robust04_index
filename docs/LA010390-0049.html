			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> HIGHER TICKET PRICES, OK, BUT COUNTRY DICK AS MAYOR?  </P> <P> What's in store for the San Diego pop-music scene in the 1990s? Here are my  predictions:  </P> <P> * The price of concert tickets will continue to go up, with the average cost  doubling to $40 by the end of the decade.  </P> <P> * We're going to see a lot more pay-per-view concerts on cable TV as more and  more superstars limit their tours to the major markets.  </P> <P> * Due to the proliferation of oldies acts hitting the road, there will be a  trend toward packaging three to five has-beens together under a common theme,  such as a British Invasion package, a Motown package, a Summer of Love package.  </P> <P> * San Diego's original-music scene will enjoy a brief renaissance, just as it  did in the early 1980s, and produce another crop of talented bands capable of  drawing standing-room-only nightclub crowds. Inevitably, however, public  interest will soon fade, prompting most of these bands to either break up or  flee to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> * Home-grown bands will not only continue to release their own records, tapes  and CDs, but will start putting out self-produced videos as well. Of course,  local TV will ignore these, just as local radio has long ignored these records,  tapes and CDs.  </P> <P> Here's what some of the San Diego pop scene's veteran movers and shakers  predict will happen in the coming decade:  </P> <P> * Bill Silva, concert promoter, Bill Silva Presents: "In the 1990s, I believe  that eventually -- probably sooner than later -- a major outdoor concert  facility will be constructed that will create a whole new market for upper-end  artists. I also think you're going to see more special events, like Street  Scene, and better packages of two or three big artists. The public is no longer  as excited about going to concerts as they were 10 or 15 years ago, and  therefore it's going to take a special event to entice them to spend the big  bucks to see a show."  </P> <P> * David Swift, concert promoter, Avalon Attractions: "I expect the economy will  slow down and, as a result, there will be fewer shows, and some of the bigger  bands might be playing smaller venues. The free-wheeling spending days of the  yuppies are coming to an end, so we as promoters are going to have to be more  cautious about what we book. If we don't, we're going to be in trouble, because  with people spending less and saving more, it's going to be harder to get them  to go to shows."  </P> <P> * Kenny Weissberg, concert promoter, Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay: "I think  the pop-jazz phenomenon that has been our bread and butter for the last eight  years will wane in popularity by 1992 and that people will start turning out  more and more for music from other cultures -- world-beat music -- from places  like Brazil, Africa and the Middle East."  </P> <P> * Phil Quinn, vice president and general manager of the San Diego Sports Arena:  "I know 1990 will be extremely busy in the concert scene, judging from what  we've got coming up, starting in February and continuing through the summer. As  for the rest of the decade, I don't know, but I think there will always be that  desire to see the performer live. Our own plans are to build a new arena  downtown, with 22,000 seats, by 1993, and I'm hoping that's going to entice  more bigger acts to come down here in the future."  </P> <P> * Dave Hodges, owner, Belly Up Tavern: "My prediction is the Beat Farmers will  make it so big that Country Dick (Montana) opens a chain of small, rowdy  nightclubs and provides young, upcoming garage bands with a place to expand  their knowledge and further their endeavors. These will be the future bands of  the Belly Up Tavern."  </P> <P> * Buddy Blue, leader of San Diego blue-eyed soul group the Jacks: The local  original-music scene "has to get better because it can't get any worse. I'm  hoping we'll see better bands, better clubs, better fans."  </P> <P> * Country Dick Montana, drummer with San Diego roots rockers the Beat Farmers:  "I predict that I will become mayor of San Diego. We will secede from the union  and become the entertainment capital of the world. Our high-powered glitz and  sleaze will make Las Vegas look like Salt Lake City in comparison."  </P> <P> * Robert Vaughn, leader of local rock band Robert Vaughn and the Shadows:  "Acoustic instruments and pure American rock 'n' roll will be the thing of the  1990s. Everyone's burned out with the sterile, plastic '80s -- the wimpy  synthesizer, pop, the blond-haired heavy-metal bass players, the discos where  deejays are stars, all the Spandex, all the posing."  </P> <P> * Mojo Nixon, one-half of San Diego's manic-talkin' blues duo, Mojo Nixon and  Skid Roper: "I think we're going to see the demise of the Spirit and the  opening of Country Dick's Libation City. I think the Bacchanal will eventually  take over the entire shopping plaza where they're at, and the Belly Up Tavern  will have to move to the Miramar Naval Air Station so people can make as much  noise as they damn well want. I also predict that Jose Sinatra will become a  giant star and become the heir-apparent to the Liberace tradition."  </P> <P> * Bartley Mendoza, leader of local mod group Manuel Scan: "I predict the  perseverance of a lot of San Diego's top original bands will finally pay off  and you're going to see an explosion of local talent on vinyl that's going to  take off nationwide. I also think pointy shoes will make a major comeback."  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: There's a good chance that Aerosmith and Skid Row's upcoming U.S.  tour will include a March 2 stop at the San Diego Sports Arena. . . . Laurie  Anderson has just been booked to play Symphony Hall downtown Feb. 15, with  tickets scheduled to go on sale at 10 a.m. Jan. 15. It's the avant-garde  performance artist's first San Diego appearance in six years. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale at 3 p.m. Friday for two upcoming shows at the California  Theatre downtown: the Jesus and Mary Chain, Feb. 2, and the Smithereens, Feb.  7. Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Saturday for Motley Crue's Feb. 11 concert at  the Sports Arena. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: the Psychedelic Furs and East of Eden,  tonight at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Rosie Flores, Friday at the Belly Up  Tavern in Solana Beach; the Walking Wounded, also Friday, at the Casbah;  Delaney Bramlett, Saturday at the Belly Up Tavern; and the Neville Brothers,  Saturday and Sunday at the Bacchanal.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for commercial mobile radio services do not adequately protect subscribers to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market conditions for commercial mobile radio services do not protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial portion of the commercial mobile radio service subscribers in the state or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining basic telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range of basic telephone service alternatives available to consumers in the state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of evidence, information, and analysis that may be considered pertinent to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission in reviewing any petition filed by a state under this section: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the state, the types of services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have offered service in the state; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service provider in the state; trends in each provider's customer base during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of return for each commercial mobile radio service provider; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service provider, including trends in each provider's rates during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data is unavailable; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the commercial mobile radio service providers the state proposes to regulate are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of competing services, and an analysis of any barriers to such entry; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive or discriminatory practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in the state; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with particularity instances of systematic unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon commercial mobile radio service subscribers. Such evidence should include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs. Additionally, evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace in the state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be considered especially probative; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Information regarding customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers, including statistics and other information about complaints filed with the state regulatory commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Petitions must include a certification that the state agency filing the petition is the duly authorized state agency responsible for the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the state proposes to establish if the petition is granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) States have the burden of proof.

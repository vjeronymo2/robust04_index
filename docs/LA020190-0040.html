			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV DENIES HE'LL QUIT AS LEADER OF PARTY  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday that he does not intend to  resign as Communist Party chief, but the nation's media reflected a spirited  debate over the future Soviet power structure before an important meeting of  the party leadership early next week.  </P> <P> Responding to a question about a resignation rumor that sent tremors through  world capitals Tuesday, Gorbachev declared: "I have no intention of doing so  (resigning his party post). No one has said this, and I certainly didn't make  any such statement. Any such suggestions are groundless."  </P> <P> Cable News Network reported Tuesday that Gorbachev was considering giving up  his party post while trying to retain political control through his second  office as president and head of the nation's Parliament.  </P> <P> Buttressing Gorbachev's denial, which was made at a photo session with  Brazilian President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello, Foreign Ministry spokesman  Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a subsequent news conference: "It's better for  perestroika when Gorbachev combines these two posts, because as President he  can influence the party, and as a party member he can influence the  Parliament." Perestroika is the term used to identify Gorbachev's program of  political and economic reform.  </P> <P> Gerasimov also denied that a recent flurry of Western speculation about  Gorbachev's political prospects had weakened the Soviet leader. However, the  spokesman added, "Maybe (Gorbachev) is a little bit annoyed" by the rumors.  </P> <P> After Wednesday's denials, Western diplomats here speculated that the  resignation rumors may have grown out of a genuine discussion under way in  senior political circles about possible changes in the balance of power between  the Communist Party apparatus and the government.  </P> <P> Traditionally, Soviet leaders have reigned primarily through their leadership  of the Communist Party, which still claims the "leading role" in society. But  elsewhere in what used to be the Soviet Bloc, the old system has already given  way. In Poland, for example, Wojciech Jaruzelski gave up his post as party  leader last year and now exercises his power through an enhanced presidency.  </P> <P> Debate over the possibility of a similar change here is occurring at a time  when Gorbachev's program is under mounting threat from a stagnant economy and  separatist threats from rebellious republics in the far-flung Soviet empire.  Those threats, as well as discussion of the future role and structure of the  party, are on the agenda of next week's plenary meeting of the 250-member  Communist Party Central Committee.  </P> <P> The plenum, which sets policy between full-blown party congresses, has the  power to install or remove members of the ruling Politburo, which Gorbachev  chairs.  </P> <P> The lead-up to such a crucial meeting is typically filled with speculation  about leadership changes. Combined with the genuine debate about redefining the  party's role, it provides a natural breeding ground for the Gorbachev  resignation rumors, the diplomats said.  </P> <P> "I find a theoretical discussion completely plausible," one diplomat said  Wednesday, adding: "I just don't see anything happening by the plenum. But I  could imagine it by the end of the year," after other changes that would ensure  no one else could use the party leadership to usurp Gorbachev's authority.  </P> <P> Gerasimov stressed Wednesday that the question of separating the powers and  posts of Communist Party chief and president "was discussed very thoroughly"  nearly a year ago, at the first session of the country's revitalized  Parliament. A majority of deputies decided they wanted Gorbachev to hold both  jobs, he said.  </P> <P> Indeed, the main question raised by a "debate in print" published Wednesday by  the Communist Party newspaper, Pravda, was whether Gorbachev needs more power,  not less.  </P> <P> The newspaper keyed the debate on its front page with an excerpt from an  unidentified reader's letter.  </P> <P> "Democratization often turns into anarchy," it read. "The country and its  economy are rocking under strikes and unprecedented disruptions in  transportation and consumer supplies. Innocent blood is being spilled in some  parts of the country. Did people hope for this when perestroika started?  </P> <P> "But the most discouraging aspect of all is the sight of the central organs of  power displaying disheartening irresolution under crisis circumstances. Perhaps  the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (Gorbachev) does not have  enough powers? Then let's raise this issue . . . and resolve it at once. There  is no time to waste. Perestroika is in danger!"  </P> <P> Vladimir A. Zots, a member of the Central Committee staff, argued for "a  clearly defined" presidency, freed of subservience to the party.  </P> <P> "Theoretically, it is possible that a plenum of the Central Committee revokes  his mandate as a (parliamentary) deputy on the party list, and we shall  suddenly lose our head of state," Zots wrote. Currently, he warned, the Soviet  president "has no legal protection whatsoever."  </P></p>

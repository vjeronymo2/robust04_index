			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: ERM fear factor holds key to cost of currency options THE COST of hedging foreign currency positions or cashflows through the options market fell last week as pressure eased again in the European exchange rate mechanism. By historic standards, though, the market's expectations of future currency volatility remain high, reflecting a nagging fear that it could take several more spins of the ERM roulette wheel before the currency system's future is settled. By the end of last week, implied volatility levels across most currencies - the measure of uncertainty about future price movements, and the biggest influence on the cost of options - had fallen markedly. In the USDollars /D-Mark market, the most liquid of the currency option markets, three-month implied volatility fell during the week from around 14 per cent to just under 13 per cent. Options on the D-Mark/FFr rate also fell  -although this market remains very thinly traded with wide spreads between bid and offer prices. At around 5 per cent by the end of the week, the one-month volatility level still remained well above the fluctuation level allowed for in the ERM narrow band, pointing to the continuing unease about the French franc before next month's elections. Sterling volatility, which had lurched upwards the previous week on an unexpected interest rate cut, also eased. Three-month sterling/D-Mark volatility ended on Friday at 13.5 per cent, down sharply from the 16.5 per cent at which it had started the week. All of this points to greater confidence about current exchange rate levels. As Mr Mike Hargrove, Citibank's chief currency options dealer in London, commented: 'There is a much lower level of overall fear. At the moment, we think options represent reasonably good value.' It remains the case, though, that volatility levels in certain currencies are historically high. One-month Pounds /Dollars volatility, for instance, is roughly in the middle of its trading range of the past three months or so, having come down from the peaks reached when the currency was bounced out of the ERM in September. It has not returned to pre-September levels, although Pounds /DM has followed an almost identical pattern. The cost of hedging cross-rates in Europe also remains high, discouraging investors from buying options. That, in turn, has kept many investors out of the European cash bond markets - despite a generally positive view about the prospects for the 'core' bond markets  - and led to a continuing focus on 'basis trading' between futures contracts to take a position. For instance Lazard Investors, the fund management arm of the UK merchant bank, said it has sold what it calls 'substantial' holdings in the cash French government bond market and bought futures instead. If ERM tension continues to ease, then a growing number of investors are likely to be tempted back into cash markets in the coming months. In France, for instance, the Pibor (short-term interest rate) futures contract had climbed to 89.25 by the end of the week, up a full point on seven days before, implying interest rates of 10.75 per cent. The cost of options on the contract fell sharply. The greater certainty of falling French money market rates that this suggests could signal a sharp convergence between German and French bond yields to come. What price currency protection at such times? The trouble is, should the fear factor return to the ERM, the cost of currency options will bounce back at levels which make today's look meagre by comparison.</p>

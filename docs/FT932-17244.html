			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Brokers line up for SDollars 10bn telecoms offer - The flotation which launches Singapore's privatisation programme IF there's one thing that a Singapore broker craves, it is excitement. The local corporate scene is dominated by a small number of companies - only nine listed on the local exchange have shareholder funds of more than SDollars 1bn (USDollars 613m). While most of these companies can be expected to turn in good results each year, they are seen as steady, if not spectacular, performers. But things are changing. After much official foot dragging, Singapore is about to embark on a privatisation programme which is likely to change completely the character of the local market over the next two to three years. Singapore Telecom (ST), the state-owned telecommunications and postal service, is first on the seller's block. The ST floatation is being billed as the largest public listing yet in the south-east Asia region. When floated, it is estimated that ST will be valued at SDollars 10bn to SDollars 15bn. 'The Singapore Telecom float will add about 15 per cent to total market capitalisation overnight,' said one broker. 'It will be the biggest thing to hit the exchange in a long, long while. Singapore Airlines, partially privatised by the government in the mid-1980s, will be the only listed company comparable in size. SIA now has a market capitalisation of SDollars 12bn. The government has not set a date for the flotation, but all indications point to July or August this year. About 25 per cent of ST is likely to be floated, with about 15 per cent available to foreigners, the rest reserved for Singapore citizens. The government proposes selling shares to Singaporeans at a discount, and is putting SDollars 200m into a compulsory savings fund so as to encourage a wide uptake of shares. Dr Richard Hu, Singapore's finance minister, says people will be given incentives to hold on to shares rather than seek to make a quick profit. 'The discount will be structured to discourage stagging. The last thing we want to see is what happened in the UK, where people took shares at a discount and got out. That defeats the whole purpose of the exercise.' There seems little doubt that the ST issue will be massively oversubscribed. ST is not a plodding state behemoth that the government is anxious to rid itself of. Since it was reorganised a little over 10 years ago, ST has built Singapore telecommunications into the most modern and efficient in south-east Asia. The company has invested heavily in modern technologies such as packet switching, integrated services digital networks (ISDN), fibre optic distribution, international leased circuits, video-conferencing and interactive videotext systems. While maintaining minimal domestic rates, and with some of the lowest international rates in the world, ST has managed to accumulate considerable cash reserves. In the year to March 31 1992, ST's operating income was SDollars 2.48bn, a 12 per cent rise over the previous year. The net pre-tax surplus before exceptional items rose 18 per cent to SDollars 1.33bn. To consolidate Singapore's position as a regional telecommunications hub, ST plans a SDollars 3.7bn five-year investment programme which includes setting up a third satellite earth station and more worldwide submarine cable links. Singapore-based analysts see ST's earnings growing by between 12 and 15 per cent in the medium term. But the company does face some problems. Singapore, with a population of under 3m, offers little room for expansion. The city state already has one telephone to every two people. ST will be up against considerable competition as it seeks to expand its services overseas. But through Singapore Telecom International (STI), formed in 1988, ST says it has already entered into 14 ventures in 11 countries, with total investments of SDollars 250m. While these projects are on a limited scale, concerned mostly with data communications and paging services, considerable opportunities are available in China, Vietnam and Indonesia - markets already well-known to Singapore. The government is determined that the ST flotation will take place without any problems. It is being watched as the guide for a spate of further sell-offs of state enterprises. The Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) and the electricity and gas divisions of the public utilities board are likely to be partially privatised over the next two years. The Singapore mass transit system and portions of other, mostly financially successful state enterprises, will also be listed. In recent years, Singapore has been overshadowed by the excitement of other fast-expanding regional markets. Kuala Lumpur in nearby Malaysia, now has a market capitalisation almost twice that of Singapore. But all that is likely to now change, giving the Singapore broking community a bout of much delayed excitement.</p>

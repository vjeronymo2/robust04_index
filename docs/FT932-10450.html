			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ratners hopes Another jump forward in Ratners - the shares have now doubled in three weeks  -increased speculation that the jewellery company's fortunes had been revived amid reports that sales had lifted in the last quarter. Analysts were unable to obtain confirmation of any upturn because the company is in its closed period, but added that sentiment had been lifted by management changes. This week, the group appointed the former Burton chief executive, Mr Laurence Cooklin, to its board. The shares added 4 to 31 3/4 p yesterday, in turnover of 9.2m. Norwich Union Life Assurance Society was revealed as the big seller of Clyde Petroleum on Thursday. The insurance company said its holding had been reduced to 36.16m shares, or 9.05 per cent of the issued capital. A profits warning, accompanied by news that it is offering a conditional cash alternative for its bid for Aberdeen Petroleum, saw Pittencrieff shares lose 20 per cent of their value, touching 302 before stabilising and closing a net 69 lower at 305p. Pittencrieff said its 1992 pre-tax profit would be 'below expectations'. The latter moved into the market yesterday and increased its stake in Aberdeen to 20.3m shares, or 39.4 per cent. Aberdeen shares held at 17 1/4 p. BP settled a fraction easier at 305 1/2 p with renewed US buying interest said to have been offset by profit-taking in the UK after the much better than expected figures announced on Thursday. Shell moved up 4 to 565p with dealers noting a fresh bout of switching out of Royal Dutch into Shell. British Gas climbed 3 1/2 to 303 1/2 p following some aggressive buying of the shares by income funds ahead of the stock going ex the 7.6p dividend on Monday. Composite insurers provided two of the FT-SE 100 index's outstanding performers in Commercial Union, 13 higher at 581p and General Accident, 20 firmer at 575p, the latter in the absence of a rumoured rights issue. Dealers said the market had been caught short of stock after moving insurance share prices lower in midweek, when Royal surprised the market by launching a Pounds 404m rights issue. General Accident is scheduled to report interims on Tuesday; analysts expect the group to record profits of around Pounds 25m, against last time's Pounds 29m loss. Jarvis, the London-based building and civil engineering contractor, fell sharply after the company accompanied news of a Pounds 3.72m loss for the year and a dividend omission with a Pounds 2.35m rights issue at a deeply discounted 14p a share. Jarvis also revealed a series of board changes, including the appointment of a full-time finance director. The shares fell to 16p before rallying to close a net 2 1/2 off at 18 1/2 p. Takeover speculation revived in Hepworth, the building materials company, driving the shares up 13 to 373p, their best level since June last year. The group is seen by many building analysts as a prime takeover target for MB-Caradon, which has a range of businesses similar to those of Hepworth and which has been seeking aquisitions since it sold its stake 25.3 per cent in Carnaud Metal Box earlier this year for Pounds 475m. Turnover in Hepworth reached 559,000 shares. Marley, another stock put forward as a possible bid target for MB-Caradon as well as being one of the building sector's longest-running bid stories, eased 4 to 136p. Redland extended the strong performance triggered earlier this week by the substantial profits upgrade made by Kleinwort Benson. Redland shares jumped 17 more to 492p, a rise of 47 on the week. Kleinwort was rumoured to have also been behind the good performance by Rugby, 6 up at 264p. Costain rose a penny to 37p on news that it has received several offers for its UK housebuilding operation. AB Ports jumped 7 to 406p, following a presentation at Credit Lyonnais Laing. A confident statement from Hickson International helped the shares gain 6 to 236p. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries rose 9 to 863p, helped by reports that Goldman Sachs had raised its rating on Philip Morris. Textile company Coats Viyella lifted 4 to 234p, after positive statements at the company's annual meeting on Thursday. Steel stockholder ASW Holdings jumped 28 to 217p after two brokers, one considered the City's most bearish on the steel industry, increased profits forecasts.</p>

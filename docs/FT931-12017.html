			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Anarchy in Zaire threatens to destabilise region: Hopes for a respite from chaos are fading as President Mobutu ruthlessly clings to power THE portents of a fragile African nation heading inexorably towards chaos and civil war are unmistakable. Black Africa's second largest country which sits at the heart of Africa is descending into a state of anarchy which could easily parallel the crisis in Somalia. The collapse of Zaire, a country four times the size of France with 37m people, would be serious enough. But it has potentially destabilising consequences for the nine states surrounding the former Congo, including Angola and Zambia. A ruthless dictator unwilling to reform, an irreconcilable 18-month political crisis, the complete loss of control over law and order and the growth of tribal animosities and secessionist sentiments are breaking the country apart. The immediate cause of the fresh spree of violence is once again the economy. Mutinous soldiers are protesting against worthless new Zaire 5m banknotes printed by the pro-Mobutu central bank in December to settle the two months' payroll of the military and civil service. The notes, worth less than Dollars 2 (Pounds 1.30) have become central to the on-going power struggle between the authoritarian president and the opposition which nominally heads a toothless interim government. Mr Etienne Tshisekedi, the reformist prime minister, fearing a rapid escalation of hyper-inflation, declared the notes illegal tender. Petrol stations, shops, market women and commercial banks refused to accept the banknotes. On Wednesday the central bank announced draconian measures to force businesses to use the notes, threatening to suspend central bank operations with commercial banks, to sack managers of state-run enterprises and close down petrol stations and airlines if they failed to do so. Behind the controversy of the new bank notes lies an economic catastrophe, made worse by political instability and rampant corruption which remains endemic throughout the government and civil service. France, Belgium and the US said last week they would restore aid suspended in 1991 if Mr Mobutu forfeits control of the treasury to the government and accepts transition to democracy. The foreign aid is desperately needed to repair economic infrastructure destroyed during the last major army spree of violence and stabilise an economy which has vast mineral resources of diamonds, copper and cobalt. Restoring monetary control would be a vital first step to economic recovery. The central bank is injecting massive liquidity into the enfeebled financial system without any accountability to the government. The Economic Research Institute at the University of Kinshasa estimates that inflation soared in 1992 to 6,183 per cent for goods purchased in stores and 4,179 per cent for traditional market-based consumption compared to an annual rate of 3,525 per cent in 1991. The Zaire's value against the dollar has plunged in the past 18 months of turmoil from 7,500 in August 1991 to 2,695,441 earlier this week. Real GDP is estimated to have fallen by 8 per cent in 1992 having contracted by 7.3 per cent in 1991. Both copper and cobalt production have slumped to new lows. The country is unable to service its Dollars 10bn external debt and has accumulated hefty arrears to the IMF and World Bank. The one chance for any recovery remains a credible government with full control over policy making. However, the economic crisis and the ability of the government to tackle the problems has been compounded by a protracted political tussle between Mr Mobutu and the country's fragmented and increasingly tarnished opposition. Mr Mobutu, who spends most of his time incommunicado steaming up and down the Zaire River on a Belgian colonial riverboat, has consistently refused to bow to demands for multi-party democracy and to hand over significant executive power to the opposition. Although he has appointed a prime minister from the opposition, Mr Mobutu continues to sabotage the government and undermine its credibility. The opposition has sought to remove him from power by waging a civil disobedience campaign while at the same time seeking to impeach the President through the interim parliament. Ultimately Mr Mobutu's survival depends on whether he can maintain the loyalty of the army although a successful disobedience campaign could lead to the country becoming ungovernable. In the political vacuum violent ethnic passions among Zaire's 200 tribes have been on the intensifying, particularly in remote areas which have been effectively cut off from central authority for months. The brewing ethnic conflict is most acute in the mineral-rich province of Shaba, formerly Katanga, where the Katangese people fought for secession in the 1960s and 1970s. Ten of thousands of migrant labourers from neigh bouring Kasai region working in the state-owned mining giant Gecamine and in the informal business sector have been forced to flee Shaba. The tensions could quickly lead to a revival of the secessionist movement in Shaba. With Mr Mobutu determined to ruthlessly cling onto power there appears little hope of respite from further chaos. ZAIRE FACT FILE POPULATION: 36.7m (estimated 1991). AREA: 905,562 sq miles (2,345,409 sq km). ARMED FORCES: 54,100 including a para-military gendarmerie force and a Civil Guard. Military service is voluntary. ECONOMY: Gross Domestic Product Dollars 6.42bn (1992 World Bank estimate).</p>

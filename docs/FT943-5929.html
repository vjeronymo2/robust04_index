			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: First-quarter loss at GPA GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing company which in August successfully strengthened its balance sheet with a Dollars 998m (Pounds 600m) aircraft lease portfolio securitisation (Alps 94-1) package, yesterday reported a net post-tax loss of Dollars 5m for the quarter to June 30. Losses in the year to March 31 1994 totalled Dollars 64m. The package enabled GPA to meet the terms of the refinancing thrashed out with its bankers in October 1993. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 389m and cash inflow from operating activities was Dollars 293m, inclusive of net proceeds from aircraft sales of Dollars 109m. Respective figures for the year were Dollars 1.84bn and Dollars 1.26bn. Shareholders' funds at June 30 were Dollars 182m against borrowings of Dollars 5.4bn. Cash balances stood at Dollars 291m, with undrawn facilities of more than Dollars 200m. Mr Patrick Blaney, chief executive, said the trading performance reflected the continuing difficult trading environment. He was pleased that Alps 94-1 had agreed to acquire a portfolio of 27 aircraft over several months.</p>

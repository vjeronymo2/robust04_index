			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Hindu leaders arrested after wave of riots: Death toll following destruction of Ayodhya mosque climbs to more than 450 THE LEADERSHIP of India's rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party was arrested yesterday for allegedly instigating riots, the death toll from which rose by 180 to more than 450 since Monday night. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, made some headway in his efforts to calm the crisis, caused by the destruction by Hindu militants of a mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya. Government officials took comfort from the bloodless recapture of the disputed site by paramilitary police at dawn and from a lessening of violence in several states. However, communal frenzy continued unabated in six states. Police firing and street clashes between Hindus and Moslems brought Bombay and many parts of Maharashtra state to a halt, with 65 more deaths yesterday, taking the toll there to 125. In nearby Gujarat, 11 more people died yesterday, raising the death count in the state to 72. The army, which was called out in some Indian states on Monday, continued to be deployed in Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is located, and in parts of Madhya Pradesh. Five leaders of the Hindu BJP, including Mr LK Advani, opposition leader, and Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, the party president, were arrested. This move, together with the government's restored control of the disputed site, and an assurance by Mr Rao that a mosque would be rebuilt alongside a temple in Ayodhya, provided temporary respite to the government, which has been criticised for its inability to avert Sunday's events. Political tensions remained high as the BJP, which had organised the rally that led to the mosque's destruction, warned of a Hindu backlash if a mosque was reconstructed on the site they believe is the birthplace of the god Ram. The BJP and its allies, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh, pledged to fight the plan. The Hindu parties also promised to campaign for mosques on other disputed sites to be returned to Hindus. Defiant BJP MPs called a nationwide strike today to protest against the arrest of their leaders, claiming no responsibility for the communal carnage their actions had precipitated. Ayodhya itself remained calm, with thousands of devotees leaving the town before noon. Indian Moslem leaders appealed to Moslems around the world to avoid violence, including attacks on Hindu temples. They welcomed the arrest of the BJP leaders. Farhan Bokhari adds from Islamabad: At least 20 people were killed as protests against the demolition of the mosque took place across Pakistan yesterday and the country observed a day of mourning. In the capital, Islamabad, police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd trying to break through a security cordon around the Indian high commission. In Bangladesh, at least six were killed and more than 500 injured as groups clashed during a general strike. UK Hindus and Moslems, Page 8; Editorial Comment, Page 16; Letters, Page 17</p>

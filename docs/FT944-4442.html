			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Observer: Not shopped quite rite A strange tale emerges of a Dutch fund manager from a tiny village outside Gouda besting the London investment bank BZW during the rescue of discount grocer Shoprite last month. Henk van Heyst, via his 5-year-old fund, Van Heyst Investments, is clearly something of a dab hand in that under-researched corner of the market, the UK preference share. Quick to spot trouble developing in Shoprite preference shares, 15m of which had been issued at 100p in February, and which bottomed at 24p in October after the second profit warning from the company in four months, he stepped in smartly and bought a fat chunk - at what price he will not say, but within a penny or three of the low. Days later, Shoprite announced the sale of most of its stores to Kwik Save, and offered to repay the preference shares at 85p in the pound (reflecting the move in gilts since February). Van Heyst was not pleased and, at a meeting just over a week ago at the offices of BZW, the company's broker, he rallied other preference shareholders around him to try and block the rescue package. Speedy climbdown of Shoprite, advised by BZW, which agreed to redeem the prefs at 100p in the pound. BZW, meanwhile, as sponsor to the pref issue and its lead agent, had been criticised in June for keeping on its books some Pounds 3m of the shares without making this clear to subscribing institutions. In October, though, the market-making arm, it would seem, had a bit of a panic and off-loaded most or all of the shares near the 24p floor - days before the sale of Shoprite on which its corporate financiers were beavering away. Van Heyst discreetly declines to confirm he bought BZW's holding. One source close to Shoprite merely says: 'Let's say that BZW's Chinese Walls are in good order.'</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (9): Benefits outweigh problems - Home-working 'Doesn't your next door neighbour go to work any more?' remarks the nanny as she comes up the drive. 'His car always seems to be here these days, lazy old Rod]' The answer is - yes and no. Rod next door works as hard as ever, but increasingly, like many a salesperson, he does so at home. He sells Rank Xerox photocopiers to the local government and health sector. Rank Xerox has encouraged its sales staff to go home to work, starting with a 'hot desk' policy of shared office space, and moving towards providing them with home-based laptop computers. Xerox was one of the pioneers of the idea (then only for top executives), 20 years ago. Now it is one of a throng. Independent and government-sponsored reports suggest that home-working is already widely adopted, with 300,000 active teleworkers in the UK alone. The Henley Centre for forecasting predicts at least 2,500,000 by 1995. The Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission believe home-working technology can revitalise rural areas. Here in rural Buckinghamshire, we have a microcosm of the social pattern of the 1990s. Of the dozen houses in this hamlet, (not counting the farmhouse), half the occupants are retired, and everyone in the other six households is employed, five people in their own businesses, only one on the farm. Apart from one, the businesses are all 'home-based.' Occupations are mixed: two doctors, our Xerox neighbour, myself the journalist, a gardener, a caterer and an electrical contractor. Of these, I am as yet the only true 'teleworker,' working largely at home, and entirely reliant on computer technology. My computer can connect to the Financial Times' mainframe, and my telephone - most of the time - to the rest of the world. This is written in a 'home office,' equipped with fax, computer, laser printer, telephone and answering machine. The technically self-sufficient home office (I like the term 'telebode') is not to be confused with a telecottage, which is a fully equipped communal resource in rural areas, for the use of anyone who has an occasional need of technical resources and support. Such enterprises also train people for teleworking, particularly women who are then qualified to take their skills back to the most remote areas and become teleworkers. The arrival of ISDN telephone technology gave Scotland a head start in teleworking. Now widely available, ISDN is likely to lead to more exploration of remote working, using teleconferencing and video-groupware to link teleworkers, (see D for Desktop Video). The term 'teleworker' suggests a reliance on technology, and is used to describe those whose work is defined by the computer. The first pioneers were unsurprisingly, in the area of computer programming. The DTI has set up a voluntary Special Interest Group to raise awareness of the potential of home-working - 'our job is to raise awareness, targeting employers,' explains David Barry, chairman of Teleworking SIG. 'The definition extends beyond users of groupware and those on networks to include any home worker. Broadly speaking, productivity can be higher at home: the new telematics technology offers potential savings on the traditional office-based work pattern.' As part of the Computer Supported Collaborative Workshop, the committee is drawn from industry, consultants, practitioners and researchers. Home-working is a source of cost-cutting to employers, who can make savings on office space, travelling expenses, secretarial and administrative support, and even employment costs if they use freelance teleworking contractors. Home workers save on the hassle of travel, have more time to work, and are demonstrated to be more productive, working more flexibly and (not in this house) without interruption. But not everyone is suited to the life: solitary home workers have to be self-motivated, disciplined and independent. One report found that remote clerical work simply wasn't a success, because people partly came to work for the company, without which the task became unbearable tedious. In the 1990s, the leaps made in technology, and particularly in communications, have meant that people can bring their work home with them, yet stay in touch with the office, as never before. Large companies such as NatWest, Sun Alliance and Unipart are sending their sales teams home, equipped with laptops, motivated by regular contact on the network by electronic mail. It is more difficult for the self-employed to establish themselves. But equipping a home office is easier and cheaper than ever before. The price of hardware has plummeted, it has become better packaged, (plug-and-go) and software has become far easier to use without training. Nevertheless, for an IT novice, getting appropriate technical support can be a formidable struggle, and an unforeseen expense. Some products are now specifically tailored to the home market, such as the Arpeggio PC from Sonix Communications in Cirencester, which provides ready-made instant communication links, and cuts out the need for a permanent leased line. Part of Canon UK's product range is aimed specifically at home workers, such as its printers and the BN notebook range. Despite some obvious disadvantages of teleworking, would I go back to working 9am to 5.30pm, commuting to London? No thanks. I don't even need a stroll round the bluebell woods to think about it . . .

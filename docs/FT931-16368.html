			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Economic Viewpoint: A 'hole' should be kept for exports The most important problem facing the British economy is no longer whether or when growth will resume. It is rather, how far and how fast will recovery be able to go before it runs into some constraint? The constraint that is seen by most analysts is that old bogeyman: the balance of payments. Some readers will recall my scepticism about using this aggregate as a guide to policy. The case for a more relaxed attitude to the balance of payments depended on two assumptions. One was that the government's own budget was in order. The other that there was in place an anchor against inflation such as membership of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) or at least public confidence in a firm exchange rate policy. Neither of these conditions now exists. The payments deficit must therefore be taken into account as a warning signal. The budget and the payments deficits are not twins as some American economists used to think; but the two together matter more than either would on its own. What worries the mainstream pessimists is not the size of the UK payments deficit itself but that it should be incurred in a recession which has been much worse for the UK than for its trading partners. Usually, depressed home demand discourages imports and intensifies the quest for exports. Some quantification is provided by David Walton in the last Goldman Sachs UK Economics Analyst of 1992. He has revised downwards his earlier estimate of the gap between actual and potential output in the UK, which he now believes is only about 3 per cent. For since mid-1991, although unemployment has increased, the gap has stopped widening as companies have scrapped capacity. Walton puts the British economy's potential growth rate at 2 per cent per annum, slightly below the trend in the last cycle. If the slack is to be absorbed and unemployment brought down as far as capacity permits, the UK will need to grow at an average of 1 percentage point above trend, ie 3 per cent per annum, over the three years starting in mid-1993. On the Goldman Sachs diagnosis even this unambitious 3 per cent growth rate is unlikely to be achieved, as it would soon lead to a continuing current account deficit of 4 per cent of gross domestic product, equal to the peak reached in 1989, a year of acknowledged excess demand. Let us assume that such a large and continuing deficit could not be easily financed and that the payments gap has to be held not too far above its present levels. Assume too that output in the industrial countries that make up the OECD were to grow by an average of 3 1/2 per cent per annum, which is quite optimistic as it involves a fair degree of catch-up. On these assumptions the UK could, it is said, grow by less than half the international rate. For Britain to be able to achieve 3 per cent growth a further '10 per cent boost to competitiveness' is said by Walton to be required over and above that achieved after departure from the ERM. There is a close similarity between this figure and the 15 per cent further devaluation Wynne Godley has declared to be necessary - a little erosion of devaluation by inflation would bring the two together. It is worth noting too that more optimistic assumptions about the amount of unused capacity available to be taken up or, about the underlying growth rate of the economy, might make the problem worse. For it would point to a higher desirable growth rate and thus a higher potential payments deficit. Throwing in the towel and accepting slow growth would not help either. Not only would unemployment climb inexorably, but the budget deficit would become unsustainable, with diminished tax revenues and increased calls on social spending. I am agnostic about the above analysis which I have cited mainly for its clarity. Mainstream pessimists may have underestimated the responsiveness of British exports to world market growth or overestimated the relation between imports and GDP. Econometricians may also underestimate the effects of improved price and profit margin competitiveness on export and import volume. This last sterling devaluation has occurred when inflation has been lower and recessionary forces in the labour market more severe than on any past occasion. It therefore has a better chance of sticking, and for a longer period, than before. It makes a great deal of difference whether one takes the flattening out of import volumes towards the end of 1992 and the jump in exports seriously or not. Quite small changes over quite short periods can radically alter impressions of underlying trends. At this stage I only want to raise doubts about the fashionable pessimism. There are more controversial areas. The imperfections of the balance of payments data - which will of course be worse this year, while the European Community adjusts to a new recording system and we are deprived of monthly trade figures - are no mere detail. Despite all the efforts of UK official statisticians, there was still a 'balancing item' of unrecorded inflows of more than Pounds 10bn, as large as the recorded deficit itself, during the first three quarters of 1992. Moreover there is still a world 'black hole' of more than Dollars 100bn per annum - the amount by which aggregate world deficits exceed aggregate surpluses. There are also analytical problems. We have no real idea how far the UK current deficit is the mirror image of an inflow of long-term investment which will produce future foreign exchange earnings. It is at least suggestive that the surge in imports over the past few years has coincided with a large inflow of Japanese investment and a trend towards re-establishing the UK as a net exporter of cars. To try to push sterling down further on the basis of fears of a future balance of payments constraint and hopes of the benefits of yet more devaluation would be foolhardy in the extreme. It is touch and go whether the post-ERM devaluation will allow the chancellor of the exchequer's 1-4 per cent inflation guidelines to be met throughout the next financial year. A further devaluation would put the objective quite out of reach and entrench the UK in the third tier of EC countries, which not merely stay out of the Franco-German hard core, but could not even hope to meet the Maastricht criteria for convergence in the middle of the decade. Yet it would be equally foolhardy to dismiss out of hand the payments worries of Godley, Walton and others, and risk letting the economy run into the buffers yet again in a few years. What is required is a medium-term financial strategy which keeps home demand on a tight, but not recessionary, rein. In terms made familiar in the post-1967 devaluation debates, a 'hole' should be kept in the economy, which could be filled, if necessary, by exports and imports saving. The strategy needs, however, spelling out for a world in which the government does not control resources directly, but merely influences money flows. I have frequently urged a medium-term objective for the growth of demand in nominal terms - that is in actual cash - at a rate sufficient to sustain a reasonable rate of growth, but not to finance inflation. The usual way of expressing this objective is in terms of nominal GDP, which is simply the GDP figures as they occur without the customary conversion into real terms. This, however, is only an approximation to the aggregate the government and Bank of England can and should influence, which should be a variant known as 'total domestic expenditure'. The latter includes all the components of GNP with the exception of net exports. If it is kept to a stable and modest path, there will be room in the economy for an improvement in exports relative to imports. Let us accept a 3 per cent per annum average annual growth objective for the next few years and take 3 per cent as a reasonable inflation objective. If there were no payments worries, this would point to an average of 6 per cent per annum as an objective for domestic spending for the next few years. But in view of payments worries this objective should be reduced to 5 per cent. The difference is much more important than it looks. For if inflation continues to average 3 per cent, unused capacity will not be taken up by domestic spending, and will be available to meet overseas demand as that recovers. If the gap is not so filled, the government will be able to take another look at a later date. The immediate implication is that the government should take the benefit of the present upsurge in sterling, so long as it lasts, mainly in rebuilding the reserves and further reductions in interest rates, even if the latter have to be reversed before long. If the interest rate cuts required to prevent a sterling overshoot prove too much of a stimulus, so much the better. For it would give the chancellor the perfect pretext to make an early start on the spending cuts and tax increases which will in any case, eventually be required to put the Budget into better shape. But I thought it better to go through the underlying economy-wide arithmetic rather than simply just moan on about the Budget deficit.</p>

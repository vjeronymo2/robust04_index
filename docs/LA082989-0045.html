			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $40-MILLION PROGRAM FOR JOB CREATION OKD  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley approved a new $40-million loan program Monday  designed to aid the growth of small and medium-sized manufacturing firms in the  city.  </P> <P> "Manufacturing businesses provide a significant number of jobs for  low-to-moderate-income persons," Bradley said at a City Hall news conference.  </P> <P> The Common Bond Reserve Fund program is designed to preserve the city's 330,000  manufacturing jobs and allow those businesses to expand. Marilyn Lurie of the  Community Development Department said two-thirds of those jobs are in  economically depressed areas and are concentrated in the furniture, apparel and  food-processing industries.  </P> <P> The new program, approved unanimously by the City Council last week and signed  by Bradley on Monday, will enable companies to borrow money at the same  low-interest rates usually reserved for larger, Fortune 500-type firms, the  mayor said.  </P> <P> Small and medium-sized businesses concentrated in Los Angeles' poorest  communities are being targeted for the loans. The program would require a  company to create at least one new job for every $50,000 it borrows.  </P> <P> The city is investing $6 million to begin the program. Additional funds will be  raised through the sale of bonds, backed by a letter of credit from Algemene  Bank Nederland.  </P></p>

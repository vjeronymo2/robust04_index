			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODMAN ON THE SEMANTICS OF THE ABORTION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I strongly agree with the Bush Administration. Hopefully, clinic officials will  not be able to give their own advice or opinions and women will not be  encouraged or discouraged to have or not have an abortion. Many women would  probably take the advice of a professional because they supposedly know what is  best, or right.  </P> <P> MARITEZ J. APIGO  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P></p>

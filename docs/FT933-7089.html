			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's challenge KENNETH CLARKE was chancellor of the exchequer in waiting long before he became chancellor. He may already be regretting his temerity. By now he should be painfully aware that there are two kinds of chancellor: good ones and popular ones. The first unified budget, due in November, should make rather clearer what sort of chancellor Mr Clarke will be. If a responsible chancellor is to be popular, he must be very lucky. Mr Clarke has had some luck. He inherits an economy that is not only on the mend, but enjoys low inflation by British standards. Even the Bank of England accepts that underlying inflation is likely to remain within the government's target range of 1 to 4 per cent over the next two years. It is rare for anything in life to come unalloyed and Mr Clarke's luck is no exception. He also inherited a public sector borrowing requirement estimated by the Treasury at Pounds 50bn, or 9 per cent of gross domestic product (excluding privatisation proceeds), for this financial year. Mr Clarke's parliamentary colleagues tell him in response either that he must not cut public spending or that he must not raise taxes. Meanwhile, respectable economists tell him that the fiscal deficit is either mostly cyclical or that it does not matter very much. He is, in short, being told to hope for the best. This might seem sensible. It would, in fact, be rash. Absurd practice The unified budget brings Mr Clarke several important advantages in his attempt to deal with the challenge: it allows him to make explicit the trade-off between spending cuts and tax increases; it should also persuade even Keynesian economists that the lag between the announcement of measures and the beginning of the succeeding financial year renders fiscal fine-tuning unrealistic; most important of all, it can be used to justify a new level of openness. To his credit, Mr Clarke has already abandoned the absurd pre-budget practice of 'purdah'. What has not changed is the secretive way in which tax changes are decided. The Treasury still insists on its unchallenged control over economic strategy. Unfortunately, an institution's authority depends on its performance. Consent is no longer given unquestioningly to what chancellors propose, even on the Tory back benches. It has to be earned. If, as seems probable, Mr Clarke decides on further tax increases, that will prove rather difficult. What the chancellor needs to do well before the budget therefore is to set out the situation, the prospects and the options, as the Treasury sees them. At worst, the opposing factions may then exhaust themselves in internecine debate. At best, someone may come up with valuable ideas on spending or taxation that the Treasury has not thought of. Stable environment Transparency is the first requirement. It is particularly important when policy is purely discretionary. Moreover, there is also an excellent chance of securing long-term growth in the British economy. A second requirement, therefore, is clarity about the underlying principles for economic policy. One of those should be provision of a stable macroeconomic environment, with low inflation not merely secured but actively pursued. Another should be further rebalancing of monetary and fiscal policy. For reasons expounded by Mr Lamont's former adviser, Bill Robinson, in his articles for the FT, further action to reduce the budget deficit will almost certainly be required. Once that is accepted, it makes no sense to postpone the adjustment, especially when its adverse macroeconomic effects can always be offset by monetary easing. Furthermore, the sterling exchange rate, this month's dissolution of the ERM and the low growth of broad money all suggest that such easing is already both desirable and justifiable. This leaves the chancellor the question of how precisely to go about cutting the deficit. Mr Clarke's desire is to preserve current spending plans, which means higher taxes. In the long term that is probably the wrong option, but in the short term there may be little alternative. Either way, choices have to be made. If he decides to avoid them instead, Mr Clarke is likely to go down as just another temporarily popular, bad chancellor.</p>

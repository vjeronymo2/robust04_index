			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Texas enters market for PCs TEXAS Instruments' entry into the market for personal computer microprocessors, announced yesterday, is expected to accelerate the rapid decline in personal computer prices by further eroding Intel's monopoly of the multi-billion dollar market. TI said that in the third quarter it would begin sales of a '486' microprocessor chip that is compatible with the original Intel device of the same name. On Wednesday, Intel slashed the price of its 486SX microprocessors by more than 50 per cent, in an apparent move to counter competition from Texas Instruments as well as from Advanced Micro Devices, which offers its own version of Intel's 386. Advanced Micro is expected to introduce a 486 chip later this year. The Intel price cut would reduce the average selling price of a 486-based personal computer down substantially from its current level of more than Dollars 2,000, said Paul Otellini, vice-president of Intel's microprocessor products group. Texas Instruments obtained rights to the 486SLC through a cross-licensing agreement with Cyrix, the Texas-based semiconductor company which designed the chip. TI is already manufacturing the chip for sale by Cyrix and will begin its own sales efforts in the third quarter. As one of the largest US chipmakers, TI is a serious challenger to Intel, which has dominated the personal computer microprocessor market for the past decade. However, Intel is expected to meet TI's challenge with aggressive marketing and legal tactics. Intel has already filed a suit against Cyrix, charging that the 486SLC infringes Intel patents. Cyrix denies any infringement. Texas Instruments also claimed that it was not infringing any Intel patents, pointing out that they have a patent cross-licensing agreement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Compact Summary" issued by the Panamanian Solidarity Party </F> of the party's government plan; place and date not given]    [Text]  <H5>  Specific Solutions of Needs </H5>   In the first week of August 1993, in fulfillment of a duty  toward the people, the founders of the Solidarity Party  presented to the nation a proposal for a government plan to  solve the country's serious problems. We hereby reproduce a  very compact summary of that government platform, copies of  which have been given to journalists and community leaders.  <H5>  Creation of Jobs; Professional Training </H5>   The unemployment rate is worrisome in Panama. The great  majority of the people agree that the solution of this problem  concerns everyone. From an economic point of view, this problem  can be solved by stimulating investment in fields that can  create a large number of jobs on a short-term basis. A steady  long-term growth rate is also required. The Solidarity Party  hereby wishes to describe some of its government platform's  basic considerations for solving this problem.    -- To stimulate the growth of a truly untraditional,  private-public, commercial development banking, which would give  impetus to the evolution of the economy's informal sector and  protect and stimulate this sector to give rise to the  establishment of small-scale entrepreneurs as a means to create  jobs on a large-scale basis.    -- The private commercial development banking, which should  be state subsidized in the shortest possible but indefinite  time, should guarantee the least expensive money for a quick  replacement of the existing industrial park in the framework of  technological renovation and efficient industry, which can be  competitive in the international market, in the understanding  that market opening and economic integration are the next  century's great challenges.    -- To protect and stimulate the securities market as an  alternate source of inexpensive financing for local and foreign  investors.    -- To present a plan for the rapid professional and  technical  education and training of Panamanian men and women so they can  aspire to worthy and well-paid jobs.    -- To turn the National Institute for Professional Training,  INAFORP, into a complex technical training center for science,  technology, services, and tourism. To provide this training  center with a central information office, which would study the  regional and overall demand for manpower and its qualification  levels. The institute's plans and programs would thus meet the  employers' needs and the population's urgent need for permanent,  well-paid jobs.    -- To transform education, as soon as possible and with the  appropriate technological knowledge, to meet the need for  qualified labor required by the economy, thus enabling  Panamanians to hold jobs created by local and foreign private  investors.    -- To develop and implement a comprehensive program to  stimulate local and foreign investors throughout the country,  and to exploit the most important assets that have reverted and  will revert to Panama through the fulfillment of the Panama  Canal Treaty. Most of the revenue brought by the exploitation  of reverted assets will be redistributed in the rest of the  country, thus giving all Panamanians the economic benefits to  which they are entitled.    -- To update, as soon as possible, all of the sea port and  airport infrastructures to increase efficiency, security, and  the international trade confidence in Panamanian services. To  make sure that the Panamanian labor force is the most capable  and reliable for local and foreign investors in the  international market.    -- To increase the state's investments in basic  infrastructure for development and training aimed at private  investment with methods that can create many jobs.    -- To build and maintain accesses to tourism development  centers. To remove all obstacles that stand in the way of  investors. To have flexible fiscal legislation and government  financing to train Panamanian workers so they can work  efficiently and earn good salaries in the sector.    -- To divert economic and financial resources to guarantee  the employment of a large number of workers. We have resources,  that are envied by other countries, which we are not being  exploited and which could make development possible for the  greater good of all, underlining several tourism variants, such  as ecological tourism, shopping tourism, beach tourism, historic  and ethnic tourism.    -- To develop and improve the quality of the small arts and  crafts industry, which supports tourism. The benefits that the  sector receives should also reach these craftsmen so they can  develop into small but competitive enterprises.    -- To take urgent measures to reduce our limitations in the  international market, particularly in the Central American  market, and at least make ourselves felt in two important  production factors, that is to say, fuel (oil by-products),  taking international prices into consideration and lowering the  current tax as much as possible, and debating the current energy  rate and production costs because these factors hamper  competitiveness in the international market.  <H5>  Public Security and Crime </H5>   We are experiencing a dramatic situation, where crime, drug  trafficking, and the judicial system's weakness, which results  from scandals and the public's distrust of the system's  capability to administer justice honestly and ethically, are  harming the Panamanian people's social and public security to  very dangerous degrees.    Since crime is essentially the result of three basic  factors,  the economic and social situation, the public security level,  and the moral value system, we intend to carry out the following:    -- First of all, and through the democratic system, we will  incorporate all Panamanians into a great plan for national  salvation, economic and social development, tolerance, and true  reconciliation because by raising our social and economic  expectations we all will be prepared to defend our social and  political institutions, which represent our genuine aspirations.    -- Drug trafficking in Panama is the result of the  metamorphosis of the drug market in Europe and North America,  particularly the United States. Dealing with this problem,  however, does not depend exclusively on the country's  willingness but on a firm cooperative alliance with the  international community. For this reason, we will coordinate  programs with other countries to eradicate criminal  organizations, drug traffickers, drug consumers, and drug  distribution networks.    -- Without delay, we will reformulate and implement a  national and public security policy and make the administration  of justice expeditious.    -- In the various international organizations, we will help  strengthen our society spiritually with development outlooks and  opportunities based on a new, fair, and democratic world order.  <H5>  Drug Consumption </H5>   The increased use of drugs and their deleterious effects on  a  traditionally peaceful and civilized society are notorious in  Panama. For this reason, Solidarity proposes:    -- To combat crime through education. This means carrying  out a program aimed at active and potential criminals,  increasing their opportunities for work as well as culture, so  they can be placed in the labor market. To devise instruction  programs for police authorities to let them know that we will  combat this scourge through education, work, and culture, thus  helping put an end to misery and hunger.    -- To coordinate with all sectors of the country,  particularly with the media, a campaign against the culture of  violence which, disregarding traditional peace and good habits,  attempts to take root in Panama, encouraging and stimulating  crime.    -- To strengthen the Attorney General's Office and the  Judicial Branch to correct its vulnerability.    -- To integrate in a single organization all services in  charge of stopping crime, including civic institutions.    -- To reinforce the border police, the National Air Service,  and the National Maritime Service through adequate training,  equipment, resources, and supervision so they can confront drug  trafficking organizations successfully.    -- To create the community police, incorporating the  community and its representative organizations in the prevention  of crime.  <H5>  Justice and Community </H5>   Most of the time, criminal cases in the community are  treated  as police cases by corregidores, who lack the proper scientific  approach and training to deal with the complex problem of the  origin and evolution of crime. Because of this, Solidarity  proposes the following:    -- To train corregidores in properly handling this problem,  supporting them with interdisciplinary professional teams in  charge of instructing the Panamanian family to prevent, rather  than punish, crime by reinforcing the family institution.    -- To transform the national prison system to rehabilitate  criminals. The system should respect human rights and  effectively reincorporate into civilian society the citizens who  have served their sentences.  <H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>   Several studies carried out on this will determine the  possible solutions to the problem of transportation and means of  communications, establishing a strategy of expanding the network  of highways that would solve the vehicle traffic problems in  Panama City into the next century.    The possibilities that this network might be built based on  a  toll system and with private and mixed enterprises facilitates  the option for solving the vehicle traffic problem that is  becoming unbearable. There are economic and social problems  and, particularly, the family-related problems that the vast  majority of the public transportation users must endure. This  is because users must spend up to three hours before and after  work commuting for no reason other than the huge traffic  congestions. Therefore, we propose the following:    -- Recover the national highway network whose maintenance  has  been neglected, mainly the Transisthmian Highway, and widening  two additional highways. To continue expanding the four lanes  on the Pan-American highway with views to turning it into a  freeway all the way to Chiriqui. To build the Colon-Cocle  highway, Chepo-Darien highway, and the Bocas-Chiriqui highway.    -- To develop a network of highway communications in the  central provinces in order to guarantee an incentive for  production.    -- In the metropolitan area, to build the Northern Corridor,  the Southern Corridor, or the Coastal Corridor. To develop a  broad and scientific program of traffic signs, traffic lights,  widening of streets and avenues, vehicles bypasses, and  pedestrian bridges. With the participation of private enterprise  in these projects, we will be able to generate thousands of jobs  which the Panamanians anxiously await.    -- To organize a staggered schedule of public office hours  and persuade private enterprise to join the same in order to  prevent traffic congestion and peak hours in public  transportation.    -- To carry out a broad campaign that seeks to change the  mentality of the drivers. In order to do this, it is important  to guarantee the participation of the government, civic clubs,  and the media. There must be a great crusade for the ethical  and courteous behavior of the population.    -- A large amount of the everyday problems that contribute  to  traffic congestion are due to the attitude of the drivers, who  do not practice common courtesy when they drive. Statistics  show that the lack of driver education or not practicing  established norms entail sorrow and mourning for many homes.  Therefore, it is necessary that formal education incorporate  highway education into its program as a required subject.  <H5>  The Canal and Use of Reverted Areas </H5>   The current world outlook indicates the continued importance  Panama has in communications, transportation, and world trade.  Therefore, we must assign priority to the process of transition  toward the control, management, defense, and administration by  Panama over the Canal and the reverted areas, which are our  country's greatest asset.    Solidarity proposes:    Strengthening the governmental institutional mechanisms in  charge of following up the implementation of the Panama Canal  Treaty, and granting the administrative and technical support  that are required by the Panamanian representatives on the Board  of Directors and the various binational organizations.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Germany losing investor appeal GERMANY is losing its attraction as a location for foreign investors because of high wages and corporate taxation, short working hours and strict environmental regulations, writes Quentin Peel. Between 1986 and 1991 foreign investment in Germany totalled just DM20bn (Pounds 8.20bn), whereas German investment abroad reached almost DM130bn, according to the Institute for the German economy (DIW) in Cologne. The survey of foreign subsidiaries operating in the country showed that in spite of the disadvantages, almost 70 per cent expected to maintain or even increase the level of their investment in Germany. The main motives for foreign investors appear to be proximity to their (German) market and an ability to look after existing customers and open new markets.</p>

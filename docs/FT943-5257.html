			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Govett expands US operations Govett &amp; Company, the fund management and insurance group, has announced a significant expansion of its US operations. It has signed a distribution agreement with American Capital Marketing, a US mutual fund group, which it estimates will more than treble its US sales to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer, added that the move would save Govett some Dollars 3m a year in costs. 'These are obviously welcome, but the most exciting aspect of the deal is the growth potential for our US mutual funds,' he said. Govett currently manages seven such funds. Govett will continue to act as investment manager of the funds, while American Capital will take control of distribution, which Govett says will substantially increase the number of wholesalers selling the products. The US mutual fund market has Dollars 2,100bn of assets under management. International funds, which have been one of the fastest growing segments, represent 8.5 per cent of the assets. American Capital currently manages more than Dollars 16bn-worth of assets through 44 mutual funds.</p>

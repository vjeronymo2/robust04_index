			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos  this evening received Brazil's Ambassador to Portugal Jose  Aparecido de Oliveira. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco was  present at the audience. The Brazilian diplomat is in Angola at  the head of a Brazilian delegation to discuss with the Angolan  finance authorities the rescheduling of Angola's debt to Brazil.  The audience granted by the president of the Republic to the  Brazilian delegation is a sign of the importance the Angolan  authorities are placing on the issue. Finance Minister Alvaro  Craveiro; Jose Leitao, director of the President of the  Republic's Office; and Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos  Feijo also attended the talks between Jose Eduardo dos Santos  and Aparecido de Oliveira.    [Begin Oliveira recording] President Itamar Franco has  conveyed to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos special greetings,  which I forwarded. President Dos Santos visited Brazil  recently, and it is in view of his talks with President Itamar  Franco that I have come from Lisbon to Luanda with a high-level  delegation from Brazil for talks on Angola's debt to Brazil.  Obviously, President Itamar Franco urged us to accommodate the  Angolan and Brazilian interests, and that is what I am doing. I  have come to report on the first meeting underway between the  National Bank of Angola with representatives of the Angolan and  Brazilian Governments. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE CHIEF FIRED OVER MANAGEMENT POLICY  </P> <P> The Baldwin Park City Council on Monday fired Police Chief Richard A. Hoskin,  saying that his his management philosophy was incompatible with that of the  council.  </P> <P> The Police Department had been troubled by low morale and a protracted labor  dispute that left officers in the 70-member police union without a contract for  part of last summer.  </P> <P> Hoskin, 43, had been on administrative leave since Oct. 5. He joined the city  as a police officer in 1968, and was named chief in December, 1986.  </P> <P> Capt. Carmine Lanza has been named acting chief.  </P> <P> The 3-1 vote to dismiss Hoskin follows resignations by the city manager, the  director of housing and the director of community services -- all of whom have  either quit or been forced to resign in the last six months.  </P></p>

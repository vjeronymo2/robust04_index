			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (2) ``She (the mother) said that she did not think he (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> victim) had taken very many pills at the time, and that she was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unaware of the danger of iron overdose'' (Ref. 21, case report No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) ``The mother stated that she called her sister and asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if iron tablets could hurt the victim. The mother stated, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her sister told her that the tablets were just vitamins and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not hurt the victim'' (Ref. 21, case report No. 37).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) ``The mother thought at the most if her son had taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than a couple of the vitamins he would simply throw up and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would be the end of it. She had no idea what a dangerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation her child was in'' (Ref. 22, case report No. 62).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) ``Later in the day (after child had ingested 30&hyph;40 iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tablets) the mother went to the pharmacy to get a prescription  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the daughter's ear infection and she asked the pharmacist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the possible ingestion of iron tablets'' (Ref. 22, case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report No. 73).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as stated above, the data presented by the AG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition show that few, if any, of the commonly available iron-containing products have carried label statements using terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as ``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION.'' Because these terms are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universally accepted as connoting danger, they could be expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to promote awareness among adults of the danger that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products pose to young children and of the importance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventing children from gaining access to these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, because the data demonstrate that: (1) Iron-containing products of all types can cause injury or death when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small children gain access to them, (2) more than 2,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisonings have occurred over approximately 7 years and continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to occur, (3) a small child is at risk of injury any time he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she gains unlimited access to any iron-containing product, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) many adults are not aware of the potential for serious harm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posed by iron-containing products, FDA tentatively concludes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it should require label warning statements for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products to ensure that adults are fully informed as to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential of these products to cause devastating outcomes and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus, to promote the safe handling and storage of these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA's legal authority to require label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements on foods. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FDA's authority to require label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements on food products derives from sections 201(n),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n), 343(a)(1),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 371(a)). Under section 403(a)(1) of the act, a food is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular. Section 201(n) of the act states, ``If an article  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., a food product) is alleged to be misbranded because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling or advertising is misleading, then in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the labeling or advertising is misleading there shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken into account (among other things) not only representations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representations or material with respect to consequences which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as are customary or usual.'' These statutory provisions, combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with section 701(a) of the act, which grants the agency authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> act, clearly authorize FDA to promulgate a regulation designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that persons using iron-containing multi-vitamin/mineral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and iron supplements will receive information that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material with respect to consequences that may result from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the product under its labeled conditions or under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions that are customary or usual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA requires label warning statements on certain types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein products represented for use in reducing weight. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency adopted this requirement in response to a series of sudden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deaths of individuals, mostly young women, who consumed high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein, very low calorie diets (&sect;101.70(d)(21 CFR 101.17(d)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of such diets was intended to achieve rapid weight loss. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of these deaths, which occurred in the late 1970's, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated the warning requirement for such products to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that users of these products are aware of the potential adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of very low calorie protein diets, to indicate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessity for appropriate medical supervision for persons on such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diets, and to identify individuals, i.e., infants, children, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant or nursing women, who should not use these products (49  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 13679, April 6, 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

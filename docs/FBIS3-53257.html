In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, one of the  mediators, a tribal chief, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: The six  hostages and their helicopter were yesterday evening still being  held by the Shudayq tribe some 110 km from Sanaa but various  mediations are under way by tribal chiefs, parliamentarians, and  officers to persuade the Shudayq tribes to release the hostages,  who include a British expert, the Canadian pilot, and four  Yemenis. The tribes, however, are requesting that the state  provide public services for their region such as completion of  the building of schools, inclusion of their region in the  electricity network plan, and introduction of drinking water  projects, medical services, and other projects.    Sources have denied yesterday's reports about the release of  the hostages. They said that Shaykh Muhammad Yayha  al-Ruwayshan, from Khawlan, initiated a mediation the day before  yesterday to persuade the Shudayq tribe to release the hostages  but the tribe holding the experts -- employees of the U.S.  company Hunt, which operates the Ma'rib oilfields area --  demanded definite guarantees that the state would grant and seek  to fulfill its demands. These demands include five to 10 new  Landrovers as security in return for the release of the  detainees and their plane, provided these vehicles come from the  state, not the mediators.    In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Shaykh 'Ali  al-Qayri, who is one of the mediators, said that the mediators  had contacted the official authorities in Sanaa to convey the  kidnappers' demands and secure guarantees for the release of the  hostages, but the authorities have so far refused to grant the  kidnappers' demands and have been looking for ways of putting an  end to these kinds of pressures, which have recently been  frequent, and of putting an end to the kidnapping of foreign  experts for use as a means of pressure on the official  authorities.    He said that a number of senior officials told the mediators  that the state was willing to discuss all legitimate demands  with these people but outside the framework of pressure through  the abduction of foreigners, a method which undermines Yemen's  reputation in the world.    The helicopter and the six experts were kidnapped on the  morning of the Monday before last in the area of al-Yamaniyah in  Khawlan as the experts, including a Hunt company security  official, were about to disarm a mine planted near the pipeline  passing through that area.    According to press reports, the six experts are being well  treated and have not been denied any requests because they  themselves are not the target but the means used to put pressure  on the official authorities and, therefore, are well taken care  of.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: US-Japanese diesel engine deal revealed CUMMINS ENGINE of the US and Komatsu, the biggest Japanese construction equipment group, yesterday announced details of their collaboration plans in diesel engines. The deal was originally revealed in February. The companies will be forming two joint ventures, one of which will be named Komatsu Cummins Engine and located at Komatsu's Oyama plant in Japan. It will produce Cummins' small B-series, used by Komatsu in construction equipment and sold by Cummins in Japan and Asia. This will allow the US company to increase its presence in the growing Asia-Pacific region. The second venture, Cummins Komatsu Engine, will be sited in Cummins' plant at Seymour, Indiana, and produce Komatsu's large 30-litre engines for Cummins to sell worldwide. Production at both ventures will begin by 1996, with annual output expected to reach 40,000 engines at Oyama and 2,000 engines at Seymour by the end of the decade. The link-up between the two companies is one of the most important in the world diesel engine industry. It allows both companies to extend their product ranges and cut costs by sharing R&amp;D and eliminating areas of duplication.</p>

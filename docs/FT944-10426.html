			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: WestLB studies reorganisation of investment side Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, the German regional bank, is considering reorganising its investment banking activities in London, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf. However, the bank said it had not yet made definite decisions. 'We are thinking about our investment bank activities in London,' the bank said. It declined to confirm reports that it planned to move its non-DM bond issuing business to London from Dusseldorf. 'We are not interested in encouraging speculation against the background of an ongoing review (of WestLB's activities),' the bank said. Last month, Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank, decided to put all its international investment banking operations in London, combining its activities with those of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank which it bought in 1989.</p>

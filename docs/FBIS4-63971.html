			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Aleksandr Mineyev and </F> Vladimir Smelov]    [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- "Russia is ready for a genuine,  fully-fledged strategic partnership with NATO. NATO's  Partnership for Peace program also has a part to play in this  process." This was stated in Brussels today by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev addressing a meeting of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] at the defense minister  level. Twenty-five states, including NATO countries and states  of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, belong to this  organization.    However, he said that this program "is not a comprehensive  answer to the realities of the new era." It is merely the first  step toward the emergence of a fundamentally new strategic  community of allies working for peace and security. Russia, the  minister stressed, is interested in a broader relationship with  NATO, one which would be in keeping with its weight and position  in the system of international ties. We are not claiming any  privileged status, he explained. The issue at stake is the  nature of the partnership itself. The states of both West and  East ought to have an equal interest in deepening it.    Today the Russian side presented NATO with a document  containing the parameters of Russia's involvement in the  implementation of Partnership for Peace. At the same time,  Russia proposes that a start be made on preparations for a  large-scale program of cooperation between Russia and NATO,  based on these parameters, and that a framework document be  signed once these preparations are complete.    In the political sphere Russia proposes the establishment of  an effective mechanism for mutual consultations on the entire  range of problems involving European and world security. This  would function both on a regular basis and in emergencies. This  mechanism would be a practical step toward a future system of  collective security and stability in Europe under the aegis of  the CSCE. In the military sphere, Russia is ready to develop  cooperation with the alliance and its partners in such areas as  the coordination of joint military activity, peacekeeping,  transparency in the field of military planning and military  activities, and training of personnel. It also expects to  strike up a partnership in other areas as well, such as  disarmament and arms control, conversion, non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, and environmental protection.    Commenting on this document, P.Grachev stressed that the  Russian Federation advocates the creation of a qualitatively new  system of international security, above all in Europe. In  contemporary circumstances, the inevitable contradictions  between the national interests of various states --  contradictions that used to be eased by the rigors of bloc  discipline -- have come to the foreground. Therefore, it is  essential to spot these differences in time and prevent them  from becoming factors of military danger or threat.    There are several stumbling blocks hampering the  organization  of genuinely equitable bilateral cooperation with NATO,  P.Grachev went on to say. Specific forms and means of securing  cooperation in the sphere of military technology have not been  defined. This could bring about a fresh escalation of the arms  race. A mechanism of cooperation between Russia and NATO in  crisis situations needs to be worked out.    Russia's position, the minister said, is that the  strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms should proceed on an  all-European scale through speeding up the transformation of the  CSCE into an authoritative, fully-fledged political structure.  In the process, the NACC must become an independent body --  though with close CSCE links -- working for all-European  military-political cooperation and prevention and settlement of  crisis situations and armed conflicts. In due course the NACC  could become the military component of a future bloc-free system  of European security. The CSCE and the NACC could exercise  constant supervision and coordination of the efforts of the WEU,  the EU [European Union], and the CIS in the sphere of  strengthening cooperation and mutual security.    P. Grachev declared that Russia did not intend to use the  Collective Security Treaty (CST) concluded in Tashkent between  the CIS countries as an instrument of confrontation with Europe  or Asia, let alone turn it into a closed military bloc.</p>

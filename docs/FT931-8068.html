			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Property: A fillip for foreigners - A leasehold loophole FOREIGN BUYERS stand to profit from the new Housing and Urban Development Bill which, when it receives royal assent in summer, will allow many leaseholders of flats to buy out the freehold. Many foreign buyers have never fully understood the leasehold concept and, however much they love London, are reluctant to invest in British 'wasting assets.' They are buying properties in the UK with some zest already, while prices are low and the pound devalued. It would not be a surprise to see them looking soon at those properties that are enfranchiseable or have been enfranchised, which could even lead to a small rise in prices. If that happens, though, it will mean little to them compared with the bonus of added buying power resulting from the collapse of sterling. Prices of long leases with a few years left should go up. The sudden chance of enfranchisement gives them the chance of extra value which some vendors will try to capture for themselves - to the chagrin of the estates - by enfranchising or starting the process before selling on. It should also be easier to get mortgages to buy them. At present, leaseholds with less than 60 or 65 years do not seem to offer the lender enough security. A freehold is another matter. Yolande Barnes, at Savills, says the result will be that the estates, to protect their interests, will stop granting new and shorter (21- to 65-year) leases. Below 21 years the lessee has no claim; over 65, he might see no reason to enter the enfranchisement battle. The uncertainty of the picture, while leaseholders decide if it is worth the effort to battle potential opposition from the estates, and the estates re-think their strategy, could be another signal to buyers to start their moves - but, perhaps, only if they have a contrarian view of markets. From now on, when you do start looking, check the property thoroughly against the new rules. If your aim is to buy a flat to enfranchise it, you must ask early on about the other occupants. How do their leases stand? What sort of people are they? Will there be the necessary two-thirds majorities? Will you all get on running the building? Overlook this sort of information and you could be in trouble. The agents have well cared-for, attractive properties on the market but you will not spot them when you walk down the street as billboards are forbidden. Among whole houses, a typical selection in Belgravia and Chelsea includes 20 Thurloe Place, SW7 (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley: 63 years to go, Pounds 400 ground rent with reviews, guide price Pounds 785,000); and 68 Chester Square, SW1 (KFR or WA Ellis, 75 years, Pounds 2,000 with reviews, guide price Pounds 1.475m). Far cheaper at Pounds 485,000 are 24 Montpelier Street, SW7 (KFR, 65 years, Pounds 100 fixed), and 8 Graham Terrace, SW1 (Savills or Friend &amp; Flacke, 52 years, Pounds 750 with reviews). Flats include 26 Cadogan Court, SW3 (Winkworth or Strutt &amp; Parker, 82 years, Pounds 100 fixed, Pounds 650,000); and 53 Cadogan Square, SW1 (Foxtons or Francis Russell, 30 years, Pounds 270, guide price Pounds 2,400).

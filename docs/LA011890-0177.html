			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JURORS IN MURDER TRIAL TOLD TO KEEP  DELIBERATING  </P> <P> Jurors in the trial of a West Los Angeles gynecologist accused of strangling  and dismembering his 11-year-old son were ordered Wednesday to begin  deliberations anew after a Pomona Superior Court judge excused one of them  without explanation.  </P> <P> The jury had deliberated 10 days already in the case of Khalid Parwez, 40, who  allegedly butchered his son Raheel on Nov. 17, 1987, and left the pieces in the  trash bin of a Hacienda Heights apartment building.  </P> <P> The jury forewoman had complained to Judge Gregory C. O'Brien Jr. that two  jurors were having difficulty following instructions. On Tuesday she reported  the panel was hopelessly deadlocked, 10 to 1, with one undecided. She did not  say how the vote was split.  </P> <P> After interviewing several jurors Wednesday, O'Brien excused one and ordered  the jury to begin deliberations Tuesday with an alternate.  </P></p>

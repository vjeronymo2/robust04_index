			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Alena Borovickova, Milan Rusko dispatch from Litomysl, </F> Czech Republic: "Views Presented in Debate; Meeting of Seven  Presidents Ended on Saturday"]    [Excerpts] A debate before television cameras in the  Reception Hall of the Litomysl chateau on Saturday after 1300  was the highlight of the two-day meeting of the presidents of  the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Austria, Slovakia,  and Slovenia. [passage omitted] After the television debate,  Slovak President Michal Kovac met with Slovak journalists. He  briefed them on the bilateral talks he had conducted in  Litomysl. With Vaclav Havel, he spoke about the present state  and prospects of relations in the cultural and civic spheres and  about ways of preventing mutual alienation [between Czechs and  Slovaks]. At the meeting with his Hungarian counterpart, Arpad  Goncz, the two presidents agreed that the "Slovak card" should  not be played in the coming election campaign in Hungary, and  vice versa. Michal Kovac informed the Hungarian president that  the present government would carry out adjustments to the  designation of names of communities and surnames but that the  issue of territorial and administrative arrangement would be  postponed on the basis of an agreement reached with the  Hungarian parties [in Slovakia]. While meeting the German  president, Michal Kovac asked him to mediate a meeting between  the German chancellor and the Slovak prime minister. With the  Slovene president, they agreed that Milan Kucan would pay a  visit to Slovakia in the second half of the year.    According to Michal Kovac, the meeting in Litomysl was  significant because vitally important issues of relations and  the integration of the Central European region were discussed.  As he noted, meetings like these can contribute to overcoming  tension and possible disagreements that occasionally result from  intergovernmental talks.    [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 April on page  1,  in the "Single Question" column, carries the following reply by  President Michal Kovac to Maria Sisulakova's question about his  meeting with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz in Litomysl: "We  agreed on further meetings, but, above all, we reaffirmed that  we must not slacken the efforts to establish a good atmosphere  at home and in relations between our states. We realized that  the results of elections in Hungary and, subsequently, Slovakia  might bring new and, it is hoped, positive aspects in this  regard, in that they may establish prerequisites for us to also  address other outstanding issues. We believe, however, that  many issues could be tackled even now, before the elections in  Hungary. This concerns problems of a specialist nature that  have been needlessly politicized. In this regard, however, we  had to take into consideration the fact that, in the matter of  Gabcikovo, for example, the Hungarian parliament is bound by its  previously adopted position. These issues can be partly  clarified before the elections, but the more serious  aspect--that is, the overall attitude toward the hydroelectric  power project--can be changed only after the Hungarian  elections."]</p>

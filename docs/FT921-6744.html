			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Republican senator says Brady must go A LEADING conservative US senator has called for the resignation of Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary, in a sign of the widening rift in the Republican party over the Bush administration's economic policy. Senator Connie Mack of Florida said his constituents, like the voters of New Hampshire in last week's presidential primary, were suffering as a result of the recession, and that new leadership was needed. In a letter to President George Bush, Senator Mack wrote: 'You have been given bad advice on the economy. It's worse than you have been told. That fault rests on the shoulders of your economic advisers and the head of that team is Secretary Brady. 'Mr President, the time has come to ask for Secretary Brady's resignation.' While much of the conservatives' anger among Republicans in Congress has been targeted at Mr Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Treasury has also come in for criticism for its reluctance to take drastic action to stimulate the economy. Florida's economy has been hard hit in the current recession, and its unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent is one of the highest in the US. Although Senator Mack began his career as a Democrat, he is reckoned to be on the right wing of the Republican party on economic policy.</p>

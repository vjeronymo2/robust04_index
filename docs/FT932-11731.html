			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Man in the News: Direct hit by boss of bosses - Peter Morgan Britain, like many of its company boardrooms, is full of 'first-class people putting in a second-class performance', claims Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors and boss of bosses. This week, he won applause from 2,000 company directors attending the institute's annual convention at London's Royal Albert Hall by imploring Britain to end its 'dreary pattern of postwar economic decline'. His critique of past economic mistakes and his assertion that the economy was recovering 'more or less over the dead bodies of Bank of England and Treasury officials' was portrayed as untimely and unhelpful for a governing party posing as the champion of business. But the man who heads an organisation of 48,000 wealth-creators, all paying homage to the entrepreneurial arts, insists his intervention was not a betrayal. A Welshman with a reputedly fiery temperament, he says his criticism was directed less at present ministers and more at the Whitehall establishment which has gripped successive governments by the throat. Known as someone who likes making waves, Mr Morgan says he was also trying to press upon industry its binding obligation to help drag Britain up from the bottom of the international league of economic performance, where it hovers above Greece, Portugal and Turkey. 'Britain has the talent, the leadership and the inventiveness, all the ingredients for enterprise. Yet they don't come together,' he says. The son of a West Glamorgan bank clerk who spent 30 years at IBM before taking over at the IoD in 1989, Mr Morgan says Britain's lowly position stems primarily from companies' lack of productivity, competitiveness and employment and wealth-creating ability. 'If I were a politician I would be utterly frustrated because I would think I was being let down,' he says. Having said that, government - 'I use it in the generic sense' - is not free of sin. As a Trinity College, Cambridge, historian, he mounts his favourite hobby horse to survey the 'anti-enterprise culture' which spread during the postwar decades of trade union power and nationalisation. The Thatcher years, however, were 'pretty successful', ushering in a renaissance in attitudes and practices which offered 'an immediate, measurable response' - such as productivity improvements and a halt to Britain's declining share of world trade. Then it all went wrong. Although he says there is no point in 'going over and over' the messy end to the 1980s, he largely attributes the final, calamitous errors under Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, to the pernicious influence of senior civil servants. 'I am quite sure that no two people have a greater commitment to controlling inflation than the present prime minister and chancellor. But so did Lawson. When chancellors like that end up as he did, you have to ask about the way the system works,' he says. So a fundamental element in the 'radical new approach' to economic management he outlined at the Albert Hall would be a strong, independent Bank of England, removing excessive political discretion from macroeconomic management and restoring sound money and financial instability. The implication is that, without it, the government might again let inflation rip. The IoD, he is at pains to point out, does not expect the government to run the economy, merely to provide the correct framework. It is in the performance of the company sector that Britain's salvation lies, although government can certainly help make its task easier. Which leads to the remainder of his agenda. For the most part, it covers pretty familiar territory. Britain must have an education system which gives it indispensable skills for the 21st century. Companies, Mr Morgan says, must exploit the full potential of their employees by 'getting the ideas out of the heads of management and into the hands of the workforce'. Business must exploit its earning power through higher added value, by importing less and exporting more. Though there has been some progress, government must also dismantle the burden of capital taxation; otherwise, its commitment to helping small businesses in particular will be called into question: 'The perspective that demands capital must be taxed and not allowed to fructify is bad.' For an economy of its size, Mr Morgan suggests, Britain has more than its fair share of world-class companies, but it is failing to flourish further down the corporate scale. 'We do not have the all-important layer in the middle.' His 'radical agenda' begins to sound a bit like a pre-Budget shopping list. But he does not apologise for seeking advantage for companies, upon which everyone's future prosperity ultimately depends. One of the 'brightest things on the horizon' is the revolution in attitudes under way at the Department of Trade and Industry. In seeking to ensure government does not move without considering the impact on business and in drawing both together to win business, Mr Michael Heseltine 'is fulfilling our agenda to the letter'. Beyond the structural, however, there is the cultural. Donning his history hat again, he says: 'If you go back in time, your name was what you did - weaver, thatcher, butcher, baker, archer. But somehow we have lost a sense of common economic purpose.' There is also a cultural undercurrent which has difficulty dealing with success. The public loves to attack directors for high earnings, though he says people are beginning to understand that top management should be well rewarded if they perform well. Mr Morgan - whose IoD contract obliges him to maintain a couple of directorships of his own - is not going to apologise for rewarding success. But the 56-year-old Lloyd's underwriter adds: 'I will not defend compensation which is not transparent in terms of performance.' So how about revealing what the IoD pays him? The institute is not obliged by statute to do so, but has recently been thinking about it. It intends to disclose the sum soon. So why not now? Very well. Mr Morgan says he is paid Pounds 146,000 a year.</p>

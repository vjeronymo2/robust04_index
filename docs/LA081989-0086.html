			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHILHARMONIC CONCERT TO SALUTE GREAT FILM MUSIC OF '39  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, music scores to hundreds of MGM films were dumped in a  landfill in Sepulveda Pass as part of an "administrative housecleaning." Monday  night, reconstructions of some of those classic scores will be heard in  Cahuenga Pass as part of "A Night of Great Movie Music."  </P> <P> Composer David Newman, scion of a prodigious musical family and an admitted  missionary for film music, will conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the  Hollywood Bowl in a program concentrating on films from 1939, considered by  many to be the greatest year in American movie history.  </P> <P> The 50-year-old scores to be heard include "Wuthering Heights," written by his  father, nine-time Oscar-winner Alfred Newman; Max Steiner's "Gone With the  Wind," and a newly reconstructed 20-minute suite from "The Wizard of Oz,"  scored by Herbert Stothart.  </P> <P> "Film music has been tossed aside and thrown away," said Newman, the  35-year-old music director of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute in Utah. "We  want to make people aware of the fact that this music exists, and more  importantly that it shouldn't be destroyed. It should be available for future  generations. . . .  </P> <P> "In 50 years, when it's considered old enough to look at as more than just a  piece of nothing that was written for a film . . . it should be available at  the least for a student of film and at most for an orchestra that wants to  perform it."  </P> <P> The centerpiece of the concert will be orchestrator Steve Bernstein's "Wizard  of Oz" reconstruction, which will include clips from the movie projected on the  Bowl's 27x45-foot screen. Other film clips to be screened while the  Philharmonic plays include "Marnie" and "Day for Night."  </P> <P> Composers Maurice Jarre and David Raksin will preside over suites from their  "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Laura," respectively. And lending the program a more  contemporary tone, Alan Silvestri will conduct his "Back to the Future."  </P> <P> Monday's performance will be the fifth in a series of concerts to benefit the  Sundance Institute, where for two weeks each summer Newman teaches a master  class to young composers. Newman is also on the advisory board of the Los  Angeles-based Society for the Preservation of Film Music (whose members include  the Library of Congress, the American Film Institute, UCLA, USC and Brigham  Young University).  </P> <P> "We're 100% behind the concert," said William Rosar, executive director of the  preservation society, who lauded Newman's efforts "to ensure the survival of  the very repertoire he's wanting to perform."  </P> <P> Newman calls his work for Sundance "proselytizing in nature."  </P> <P> "The MGM dumping is only one thing," he says. "What bugs me is that our society  tends to label things," and considers classical music to be "more artful" than  film music.  </P> <P> Newman admits that "there's a lot of bad film music, but there's a lot of bad  classical music. There's a lot of bad everything."  </P> <P> Last year Sundance spent $250,000 to have such scores as Dimitri Tiomkin's  "It's a Wonderful Life," Max Steiner's "The Searchers," "Wuthering Heights" and  the "Wizard of Oz" suite reconstructed. Newman hopes its next project will be a  record of "The Magnificent Ambersons," the troubled 1942 film directed and  narrated by Orson Welles, which starred Joseph Cotten. "Bernard Herrmann wrote  a voluminous score, most of which has never been heard."  </P> <P> Newman has heard a lot of film music, not only by his father, but by uncles  Emil and Lionel Newman and cousin Randy Newman. Of all that he's heard, his  favorite remains his father's score for "All About Eve" (1950), in which Bette  Davis plays a famous Broadway actress and Anne Baxter her scheming protege.  </P> <P> "What the music did for the movie," says Newman, as it underscored the  characters' emotions, had an incredible impact on him.  </P> <P> With this in mind, he'll sit down this year to score Danny DeVito's "War of the  Roses," starring Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas; Touchstone Pictures'  "Gross Anatomy," and Orion's "Madhouse." His score for "Little Monsters,"  starring Howie Mandel, can be heard beginning Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Korea N-plant visit to decide on sanctions The International Atomic Energy Agency will begin a critical inspection today of North Korean nuclear facilities that could prove to be a turning point in the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. The outcome of the inspection will determine whether the US will press for economic sanctions by the United Nations Security Council against the North or hold a new round of high-level talks as demanded by Pyongyang. The three-member IAEA team will try to fulfil two goals. One is to determine whether the North has removed, without international supervision, a substantial amount of the 8,000 fuel rods that power its 5MW reactor, a violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The North last week reported to the IAEA that it had started to replace some 'damaged' fuel rods, but the extent of refueling operation remains unknown. The US is worried the unsupervised removal of the fuel rods would allow the North to divert the nuclear fuel for the production of four or five atomic devices. Washington has warned that extensive removal of the fuel rods would force it to ask the UN for economic sanctions. The IAEA inspectors will also try to complete an examination of a suspected nuclear processing plant that was blocked in March. The IAEA has warned that if the inspection is not completed by mid-May, it would also refer the nuclear dispute to the UN Security Council for action. Analysts predict that the IAEA and North Korea may differ on the scope of the new inspections as they have done over previous checks. But Pyongyang is likely to make enough concessions to prevent the UN from taking up the issue. The US has promised if the current inspections are completed, it would conduct another round of high-level talks with North Korea on possible diplomatic recognition and economic aid. Even if the new inspections reach a satisfactory conclusion, the dispute is far from being solved. North Korea is also barring the IAEA from access to two undeclared sites that are believed to store nuclear waste. The IAEA wants to examine the nuclear waste, in addition to the fuel rods, to determine whether the North has previously diverted plutonium from its reactor for its suspected nuclear weapons programme. The North may only allow inspection of the two undeclared sites in return for concessions from the US.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Technology: Science and the economy An increase in science and technology teaching at all levels of the education system is essential if Britain is to flourish economically, according to a report* published yesterday by the Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost). In spite of past efforts to improve the image of science and technology in schools, the study reports that many young people give up studying science as soon as they can. Acost, which advises the UK government on its education and science policy, has come up with seven proposals whichit believes could help improve Britain's economic growth: The number of qualified science and technology teachers should be increased, if necessary by paying them more than their counterparts in other subjects. Education from the age of 16 upwards should be broadened to encourage scientific subjects to be incorporated in arts or social science courses. Degree courses should be mademore useful to students and relevant to employment. An optional fourth year of study should be introduced for scientists or engineers who want to go intoresearch There should be more opportunities for mature students to return to studying science and technology subjects. New learning technologies, such as inter-active video systems, should be used in higher education to help make lecturers more productive and so expand the number of students taught. Employment practices should be improved to provide career development which is on a par with those in other professions. On the last point Andrew Bain, chairman of the working group that investigated the employment of scientists in industry and business, said that in terms of pay the worst employer for experienced scientists is the government. *Science and Technology: Education and Employment, HMSO Publications Centre, PO Box 276, London SW8 5DT.

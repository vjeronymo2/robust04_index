			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Four stars for three-D quality HOWEVER sophisticated the latest computer-aided design system, it often stretches the engineer's imagination to believe that the products depicted on the screen are three-dimensional. Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba believes it may have overcome this problem with a prototype display which uses 768 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to simulate 3-D images. The 100mm x 30mm panel mounted with the LEDs slides 50mm back and forth at a maximum speed of 30 times per second, while the computer-controlled diodes are switched on and off automatically. This forms an 'afterimage' effect, so that the images appear to be real. Toshiba: Japan, 3 3457 4511.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK TO GIVE UP LAND, GET PARK BUILDING  </P> <P> The largest residential developer in Moorpark, Urban West Communities, has  entered into an agreement with the city to build a $1-million community center  in exchange for permission to expand a proposed commercial center onto land set  aside for public use.  </P> <P> Moorpark City Manager Steve Kueny said the agreement allows the city to have a  community center that could not have been built "in the near future" because of  a lack of city funds.  </P> <P> The center, to be built off Tierra Rejada Road southwest of downtown Moorpark,  will feature a full-size basketball court, a stage, meeting rooms and a  kitchen. It will be styled after a community building in Borchard Park in  Newbury Park. Construction should begin next year, said Tom Zanic, Urban West  vice president.  </P> <P> The city, in turn, has agreed to allow Urban West, a Santa Monica-based firm  that developed Mountain Meadows, a 2,500-home planned community, to expand a  proposed shopping center onto three acres that the developer had set aside for  public use.  </P> <P> The community-use acreage was required by the city when it gave the nod in  January, 1988, to the final 1,000 Mountain Meadows homes. The project, to be  completed in 1992, includes two elementary schools, a new high school, the  shopping center and a 69-acre park where the community center will be built.  The new homes will be priced from $300,000 to $450,000, company officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bend Over Backwards'  </P> <P> Moorpark City Councilman Paul Lawrason, who worked on the four-month  negotiations, said Urban West had been very generous in the arrangement. "I  realize that Urban West never does anything from the standpoint of generosity,  but they did bend over backwards for this," he said.  </P> <P> Zanic said Urban West's "business in Moorpark happens to be a large one -- and  it's a risky business of home building -- but our attitude is to be as good a  community member as one can be." Although he said his company is in business to  make money, "the good marketplace of the past several years allows us to give  back to the community."  </P> <P> Relations between Urban West and the city have not always been good. Soon after  receiving permission to build its final phase, the company sued the city over a  municipal slow-growth initiative, adopted in 1986, that limits the building of  residential units to 250 a year. Urban West claimed that it was exempt from the  process because Mountain Meadows is a planned community.  </P> <P> The court found in favor of Urban West, ruling that the city had granted  preliminary approval to the entire development before the initiative was  approved.  </P></p>

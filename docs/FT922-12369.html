			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UN grants Kuwait part of Iraqi port A UN COMMISSION setting Iraq's long-disputed southern border has granted Kuwait part of Iraq's only serviceable seaport and a larger portion of the Rumaila oil field, AP reports from New York. The decision is certain to anger Iraq, which used an old border dispute with Kuwait to justify its August 1990 invasion of the emirate. A US-led alliance drove Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991. The Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission said Kuwait would be given part of Umm Qasr, which is linked to the Gulf by the Khor Abdullah waterway and is near Iraq's major offshore oil terminal. Iraq's main port, Basra, has been unusable since the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, when sunken ships clogged the Shatt-al-Arab waterway between the port and the Gulf. The commission's rulings also grant a greater portion of the Rumaila oil field to Kuwait. It was not clear whether Iraq would comply with the rulings. Iraq is represented on the commission but did not participate in the vote on its rulings, apparently in protest. Iraq accepted all terms of the ceasefire agreement that marked its defeat in the war, including the creation of the commission. However, UN officials say Iraq has not complied with other provisions of the ceasefire, including demands for co-operation with UN inspectors overseeing the destruction of its weapons. Under the UN's Gulf War cease-fire resolution, the commission was mandated to set the border with reference to a 1963 agreement which favoured Kuwait.</p>

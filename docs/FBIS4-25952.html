			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The white paper issued  today by the State Council's Information Office on intellectual  property protection in China stresses that China has a  high-grade legal system for intellectual property protection and  that intellectual property is effectively protected in the  country.    It cites concrete examples to prove the point, noting that  the protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered  trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of  trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in  China.    By the end of 1993, the number of effective registered  trademarks had exceeded 410,000. Of these, 350,000 were  domestic, with the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and  regions, the white paper says.    Companies from the United States had only 122 trademarks  registered in China before 1979; by 1993 that number had soared  to 16,221, more than a hundred times the earlier figure, it adds.    In 1993, there were 170,000 applications for trademark  registration in China, including more than 130,000 applications  for new trademarks registration, among the highest number in the  world.    The patent law has greatly encouraged inventions and other  creations in China, and has proved to be a magnet to patent  applications from other countries and regions. By the end of  1993, the patent office of China had handled over 360,000  applications for patent rights. Of those, domestic applications  accounted for 86.4 percent, while 13.6 percent were applications  from 70 countries and regions. By the end of 1993, 175,000  patents had been approved.    The white paper gives an account of China's laws on  trademarks, patents, copyrights, technological contracts, and  scientific and technological progress, as well as the relevant  government decrees, rules and regulations.    The white paper notes that China, in accordance with its  national conditions and the current tendencies in international  development, has formulated and fine-tuned various laws and  regulations on intellectual property protection, thereby  constructing a socialist legal system for intellectual property  protection with Chinese characteristics.    Meanwhile, says the white paper, the scope of the  intellectual property rights [IPR] protected in China and the  degree of protection afforded have gradually conformed with  international practices.    Effective as of March 1983, the Trademark Law and the rules  for its implementation set forth the principles of application,  examination and registration in trademark registration  procedures which are entirely identical with common  international principles.    In 1993, the paper continues, China revised both its  Trademark Law and the rules for its implementation and made them  coincide completely with the requirements of GATT's agreement on  Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights.    The Patent Law and the rules for its implementation came  into  effect in April 1985. The Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress adopted an amendment to the law on September  4, 1992, which included important revisions. This marked the  reaching of a new level of patent protection in China, says the  white paper.    As regards the Copyright Law, the paper says, it protects  computer software in addition to the copyright of written works,  oral works, music, operas, quyi (folk art forms including ballad  singing, story telling, comic dialogues, clapper talks, cross  talks, etc), choreography, works of fine arts, photographs,  films, TV programs, video tapes, engineering designs, product  designs and their descriptions, maps, sketch maps and other  graphic works.    China is among a select group of countries that have  explicitly listed computer software as the object of protection  by copyright laws, the paper says.    The Technological Contract Law and the Law on Scientific and  Technological Progress, as well as a series of administrative  regulations concerning intellectual property protection worked  out by the State Council, together further optimize the nation's  legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights,  in the whole bringing the system close to and in coordination  with international levels of protection.    The paper also says that China has a complete legal system  for the protection of intellectual property rights. China's  intellectual property law stipulates the legal responsibilities  to be borne by anyone who violates the law, including civil  liability, criminal liability and exposure to administrative  sanctions, it adds.</p>

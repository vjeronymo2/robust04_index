			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pifco drops 31% after losses at Russell Hobbs PIFCO HOLDINGS, the electrical appliances group, suffered a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to end-October as it worked to eliminate a loss at Russell Hobbs Tower, its recent acquisition. The extensive surgery at RHT was responsible for the fall in profits to Pounds 577,000 (Pounds 1.81m). The integration process was also hampered by a downturn in consumer spending. In the 28 months prior to its acquisition from the administrators of Polly Peck International in April 1991, RHT lost more than Pounds 30m. Although the purchase had only cost Pifco Pounds 7.75m - just over half of its net asset value - Mr Michael Webber, Pifco chairman, said the culture of the business had to be turned around from 'being driven by the factory to being driven by the market place'. RHT is now close to break-even after tighter quality controls reduced return levels by 10 per cent to 20 per cent; the workforce was cut by 100 to 500 and the head office in Wolverhampton was closed and incorporated into Pifco's headquarters in Manchester. Sales at RHT have fallen significantly, but Mr Webber said that was a price worth paying for getting the business back into the black. The core Pifco Salton Carmen business experienced a difficult six months due to last year's poor summer which resulted in lower sales of Pifco fans. The haircare and personal care business for Carmen was also lower due to soft consumer demand. Overall group sales rose to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 13m). Earnings per share slumped to 5.7p (16p) but the interim dividend is held at 3.5p.</p>

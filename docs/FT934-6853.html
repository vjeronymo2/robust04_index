			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Messiaen's final swan song The high point of the Barbican's in memoriam festival for Olivier Messiaen was naturally the British premiere of Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela . . . , his last major work. The New York Philharmonic commissioned it, and first played it in November last year, six months after the composer's death at 83. On Sunday Eclairs had a resplendent performance by Kent Nagano and the London Symphony on Sunday, so finely prepared and projected as to forbid the easy response, 'There goes Messiaen re-cycling himself again]' Messiaen always did re-cycle himself, of course. At least from the 1940s, material from earlier pieces - not just themes and chord sequences, but particular tropes and whole movement-formats - recurred regularly in his new ones: often because of some devotional significance that they had for him, like sacred 'Leitmotiven'. Since Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela ('Illuminations of the beyond') is a devotional work par excellence, we expected most of the familiar elements again, and we got them in profusion. In the music of a composer with such a highly coloured but restricted vocabulary (original though it was), all that self-quotation has sometimes seemed risky. Even in Messiaen's late mega-'opera' on St. Francis, there are long stretches which sound routine simply because we have known them from long before. Yet in Eclairs . . . the echoes have a silvery new ring, touched with a soft new grace. That might be a sentimental illusion, the effect of knowing that this is an old composer's last testament (as he surely meant it to be); but I do not think it is. There is a parallel between Eclairs . . . and Stravinsky's last pieces: a degree of unforced compression and seeming simplicity, which renders the sense of the music utterly transparent. With the Messiaen that must be owed partly to the refined luminosity of his orchestration (especially in Nagano's beautiful handling), but that is not all. Notoriously, Messiaen adored the hieratic manner - which always made room for minatory thunderings and ultra-sweet quasi-kitsch. Here, however, the old impassioned gestures are reduced to potent hieroglyphs. For more than an hour, the eleven movements of Eclairs . . . (some very short, none very long) pass by in beatific serenity, like panels in a moving frieze, whether in brazen tones or ethereal ones. No hectoring, no over-insistent poignancy (but lots of birdsong); and the proportions are concise and masterly. Love Messiaen or loathe him, this is a quintessential work. Last two concerts in Messiaen series November 29 &amp; December 10, London Sinfonietta at Barbican</p>

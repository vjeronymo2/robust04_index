The people's genuine life has come into full bloom in  the socialist fatherland's rivers and mountains.    During the revolutionary turning year when our country's  socialist construction enters a new developing stage, we have  glorified with loyalty and feats the worthwhile year of struggle  when all the party, all the Army, and all the people should be  mobilized to bring about the great revolutionary upsurge in all  front lines. The morning of the most meaningful day -- the  February national day -- breaks in the chuche-oriented  fatherland.    With the unfolding of the history of a new year, 1994, full  of confidence and optimism, the February national day is the  greatest national felicitous day for which everyone has  earnestly waited.    On the morning of the meaningful February national day, the  people's minds have been constant, like the blue pine trees in  the forests of Mt. Paektu, and have been clear, like the waters  of Mt. Sobaek, and are going toward the secret camp -- the  native home in Mt. Paektu. Mt. Paektu's secret camp is the  native home where the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the  sagacious leader [chidoja] of our party and people and the  supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA], was born.    The voices of the anti-Japanese fighters that were raised  when they experienced the greatest national felicitous day in  this humble house now seem to ring out. The future of Korea is  brilliant, because Mt. Paektu's bright star is brilliant.    Indeed, the birth of Mt. Paektu's bright star was a  grandiose  sunrise of the great guiding star that will inherit and complete  the chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader  [suryong], was a historic event that promised the brilliant  future of mankind, and was a great national fortune that we  should uphold another great man with the Mt. Paektu's legendary  hero and the anti-Japanese female general.    Our people have enjoyed the great happiness and glory  through  16 February. The immortal chuche idea has brought into full  play a stronger magnetism and invincible vitality. The party's  leadership has become the lifeline, thus all the party, all the  Army, and all the people have breathed and acted with a single  ideology and consciousness and the chuche-oriented socialist  cause has been victoriously advanced. This reality shows our  party's authority and might.    All the people have been firmly united around the party with  fidelity. The communist virtue of devoting all sincerity and  even life to society, groups, and comrades is the genuine  appearance of our society.    A heyday in all fields, including politics, economy,  military, and culture, has been unveiled. The revolutionary  line of independence, self-reliance, and self-defense in  national defense bears brilliant fruit in our country. This is  the outstanding pride and might of our country.    Socialism of our own style has pressed hard on the heels of  the enemy without wavering in the face of vicious challenge and  threat and of the moves of separation and blockade by  imperialists and reactionaries. Our people have been proud of  this glorious era in combination with the esteemed name of the  dear leader comrade.    All dignity, glory, and happiness that our people enjoy are  the greatest privilege and fortune that can be obtained only by  upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il -- great leader  with [yongdoja] literary and military accomplishments, loyalty,  and filial duty; and outstanding ideological theoretician,  politician, and military strategist; and model of loyalist  unfailingly faithful to the fatherland the people -- at the head  of the party and the revolutionary Armed Forces.    On the morning of the February national day, all the people  across the country are looking up to the building of the party  Central Committee on which our glorious party's flag is  unfurling.    The compatriots in South Korea and overseas and world  revolutionary people turn their envious eyes upon Pyongyang.  The people upholding the great leader [yongdoja] are the  happiest people. The people who do not uphold the great leader  are the unhappiest people. This is truth. Looking around  today's world, our people deeply feel this truth and they have  deeply experienced the truth through their lives. All of our  people have the great glory and happiness of upholding the great  leader [yongdoja].    We extend the greatest glory and warmhearted thanks to the  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We deeply wish General Kim  Chong-il, our supreme commander, long life and good health.    Our people's wish contains not only the absolute faith that  we and the fatherland cannot exist without you, but also the  ever- victorious confidence that we can win a victory if you  exist. The dear leader comrade has tided over all tribulations  with firm will and matchless grit and turned adversity into  prosperity by single- heartedly rallying the hundreds of  thousands of people through broad-scope politics and the  politics of benevolence.    With the great grit of never being shaken by any thunder and  lightening and with unrivalled strategy of [word indistinct]  everything in the world, the dear leader comrade makes millions  of enemies tremble. Our people have been convinced that as long  as there is the dear leader comrade, there is nothing that our  people fear and cannot implement.    Thus, even when the enemies brought the dark clouds of a  nuclear war and threatened our people while talking about  special inspections and collective sanctions, our people were  not shaken at all. No matter how hard the imperialists may  maneuver to separate and blockade us, our people, upholding the  party's revolutionary economic strategy, have brought into full  play the grit of self-reliance and fortitude and the might of  single-hearted unity.    On the morning marking the great national felicitous  national  day, the only wish cherished deep in the people's mind is long  life and good health of the leader comrade.    We wholeheartedly wish the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il--fate of our nation, fate of the country, great  defender of the socialist cause, and symbol of victory--long  life and good health for the sake of the completion and victory  of socialism of our own style, independent reunification of the  country, realization of turning the whole world into  independence, endless happiness of our people, and the  prosperity of the country for good.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ wool growers face another tough year as prices languish NEW ZEALAND'S sheep farmers, the world's second largest producers of wool, can expect yet another year of slack world demand and low prices, economists warned yesterday, the first day of the 1993-94 season, reports Reuter from Wellington. 'There's more belt tightening in store,' said New Zealand Wool Board senior economist Mr Patrick Conway. The industry, which produces 12 per cent of the world's wool, had begun last season with high hopes of recovery despite large world stockpiles. The average indicator price had recovered from a post-war low of NZDollars Dollars 3.50 (USDollars 1.86) a kilogram (clean) in early 1991 to about Dollars 5.00 a kilogram by June 1992. World economic growth and the return of buyers from China, who have bought up to a quarter of New Zealand's wool in recent years, had been expected to boost prices further. Instead, the large industrialised economies actually fell further into recession and the Chinese buying interest slackened again. 'The long-awaited recovery in Western Europe and Japan just never came, in fact it got worse,' said Mr Conway yesterday. 'There's been a general deterioration in demand for world textiles.' The average indicator fell from NZDollars 4.71 at the first sale of the 1992-93 season to NZDollars 3.77 by the last sale. New Zealand's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries noted in its annual agricultural outlook that Chinese demand had been sluggish for much of the second half of the season. 'This can be attributed to many factors, such as the depreciation of China's currency, foreign exchange allocation problems and temporary disruption to buying as responsibility for purchasing is transferred from state to local enterprises,' it said. The weight of wool stockpiles overhanging the world market compounded the problem of slackening demand, economists explained. 'Falling production continues to be masked by the enormous stockpiles,' said ANZ bank economist Mr Paul Stewert. With stocks at present equivalent to 35 per cent of annual world production economists said nervousness surrounding the growth of the world's largest stockpile in Australia had helped depress prices. Although rescheduling of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's debt repayments by the Australian government in April helped ease the tension, the stockpile was expected to remain a problem while the world economic recovery stuttered. 'Given the sluggish outlook for demand and continuing large wool availabilities, prices for the 1993-94 season are not forecast to increase substantially,' the ministry said. The continued absence of buyers from the former Soviet Union would also constrain prices. . . 'particularly since they've been the major buyers in the past of those shorter crossbred wools,' Mr Conway warned. Most of New Zealand's 54m sheep are crossbred to produce both meat and wool.</p>

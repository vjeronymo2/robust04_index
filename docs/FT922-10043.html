			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow pushed lower by sell programmes Wall Street A ROUND of sell programmes pushed US stocks lower yesterday, but trading was quiet as traders headed home early amid fears that violence would spill on to the streets of New York in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 23.03 to close at 3,336.09, with only 177.4m shares changing hands on the big board. Declining issues led advancing by 908 to 775. Among other market indices, the broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 2.43 at 412.52 while the Nasdaq composite slid 0.54 to 578.14. On Thursday, the Dow advanced 25.94 to 3,359.12. There was some uneasiness following an unexpectedly weak purchasing managers' index report for April, which fell to 51.3 per cent from 54.1 per cent in March. The market had expected the April index to advance to about 55 per cent. Shares in Chrysler continued to lose ground in the wake of the company's unsatisfactory first quarter results. The stock closed at Dollars 18 1/2 , down Dollars  7/8 , after falling Dollars  3/8 a day earlier. Ford lost Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 1/8 , after sliding Dollars  3/8 on Thursday and General Motors eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 , on top of its previous Dollars  7/8 decline. In the pharmaceutical sector, Glaxo Holdings' American depositary receipts fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 25 1/2 .

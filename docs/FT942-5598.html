			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn 55% ahead to Pounds 33.4m A strong profits performance encouraged Powell Duffryn, the distribution, storage and engineering group, to lift its dividend for the first time in four years. Pre-tax profits increased by 55 per cent to Pounds 33.4m in the year to March 31, although the headline figure was flattered by a reduction in exceptional charges from Pounds 7m to Pounds 2.6m. The underlying performance was also strong, with profits before exceptionals increasing by 26 per cent to Pounds 36m. Earnings per share jumped to 31.8p (18.6p). A final dividend of 17p gives a total of 23.6p (22.6p). Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said: 'The benefits of recent corporate restructuring and investment were major contributors to these excellent results.' Operating profits from fuel distribution increased from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 7.6m, thanks to stronger industrial demand, cooler weather and last-minute sales in advance of the VAT imposition. Port services and shipping raised operating profits from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 10.3m. Tees and Hartlepool increased their dry goods throughput by 12.5 per cent, helped by growing roll on-roll off traffic. In engineering, operating profits fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 15.4m. Mr Bill Andrews, chief executive, said sound performances in most areas had been masked by a decline in the contribution from the group's Saudi Arabian pump business and continuing losses in parts of its road and rail transport activities. Mr Andrews said the rail business, which lost Pounds 2m, had a large number of inquiries but an inadequate level of orders. He had confidence in the products, but said the group would have to see firm orders materialising in the current year or further rationalisation would be necessary. The group's bulk liquid storage business increased operating profits from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 6.9m. Gearing fell from 19 to 11 per cent. Mr Hubbard said the strength of the balance sheet provided headroom for further investment. COMMENT The rise in the dividend was good news - though not entirely unexpected given the relatively cool winter, which always helps the fuels side. Less welcome were the problems on the engineering side, which overshadowed good performances by Hamworthy's combustion and compressor activities and a strong showing by the Geesink environmental engineering business. The shares have outperformed the market by 70 per cent since 1992, so have already enjoyed a substantial rerating as the group has become more focused. However, they still offer a 10 per cent yield premium and a prospective multiple of 14.3 does not look demanding.</p>

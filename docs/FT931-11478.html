			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo encouraged by 21% rise PEPSICO, the US soft drinks, snacks, and fast-food restaurant group, yesterday reported an underlying 21 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Dollars 1.4bn in 1992, before including charges related to accounting changes and other one-off items. The company said that earnings per share - on a similar basis - were up by one-fifth at Dollars 1.80, and that the improvements were achieved on a 14 per cent increase in sales, to Dollars 22bn. The bottom-line figures, after taking in the one-off items, paint a very different picture, however. After taking account of a Dollars 195.5m restructuring charge and almost Dollars 400m for the adoption of the new accounting standard on non-pension retirement benefits, after-tax profits fell from Dollars 1.08bn to Dollars 374.3m in 1992. PepsiCo said that it was encouraged by the underlying figures, with all three divisions recording double-digit growth in 'ongoing' profits. 'Our domestic beverage division is being completely restructured,' noted Mr Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo chairman, 'and our aggressive acquisition activity, over 50 (acquisitions) in all, is doing a lot to expand and strengthen our core businesses.' On the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo shares were down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41 3/4 before the close.</p>

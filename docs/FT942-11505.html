			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Record acquisitions year leaves Danka 83% ahead at Pounds 32m Danka Business Systems, the US-based office equipment supplier quoted in the UK, announced an 83 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32m, against Pounds 17.5m, following a record year for acquisitions. The addition of 29 companies in the last 12 months contributed some Pounds 100m of the overall Pounds 161m increase in sales to Pounds 347.2m for the year to March 31. Danka spent Pounds 65m in cash and issued shares worth Pounds 12.5m to fund the acquisitions. The group wrote off about Pounds 57m in goodwill. Sales were also boosted by a 12 per cent improvement in the dollar/sterling exchange rate, and a full year's contribution from company purchases in 1992-93. In an attempt to give some indication of underlying trading, Danka said turnover in companies owned for at least two years was about 14 per cent ahead. Overall, the group had enjoyed the benefits of a recovering economy in the US, where machine sales were beginning to pick up. Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, chairman, said the UK business was beginning to see similar signs of recovery. Margins had been largely maintained, he said. The maintenance and supplies division suffered a 1.3 percentage point drop in gross margins to 47.7 per cent due to the number of acquisitions. The final dividend is maintained at 0.75p for a total 33 per cent higher at 1.5p. Earnings per share were 11 per cent higher at 11.8p (10.6p). The company's shares, which have risen in the last year from 50p, closed yesterday at 335p, up 5p. Danka has spent the last few years pursuing acquisition opportunities mainly in the US, where the office equipment market is estimated to be worth about Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.5bn) a year. Last year the group took its first step into Europe with the purchase of Saint Group in the UK. Mr Vaughan-Lee said Danka intended to continue expanding, with at least one acquisition expected before the end of June. It intends to fund the acquisitions with facilities negotiated last year. The group strengthened its balance sheet with a Dollars 150m credit line in the US and a Pounds 58m placing in the UK. Net debt at the year end was Dollars 21m, against Dollars 30m a year earlier. The acquisition programme has brought substantial benefits to Mr Dan Doyle, the company's American chief executive, who sold his rights to a performance-related bonus to Danka for Pounds 4m over three years. He is believed to have earned a substantial bonus this year under a new scheme related to earnings calculated under US accounting treatments, which rose sharply this year. Under this he is entitled to up to 50 per cent of his base salary. Last year he is estimated to have earned a salary of about Pounds 480,000.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER VOICES SPEAK ON BILINGUAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> When I was in elementary school, Luther Burbank Elementary in Altadena, I was  taught that this great country of ours was a melting pot. For the last 40  years, I have thought the meaning of that was that people from many different  countries came to the United States, became united in their beliefs, and also  united in their language.  </P> <P> My grandfather, who is now 97 years old, was one of those people who came here,  or rather escaped to this country, and learned to speak the English language.  He was not babied and coddled in school; they did not speak to him in his  native Armenian. Perhaps if they did he would not have learned to speak English  so well.  </P> <P> I have my children in a private school. The main reason: I do not want them to  have an inferior education. I feel that by going to a bilingual school they  would have just that. I don't enjoy paying a hefty tuition, in addition to  taxes that support my local school. I feel I am being wronged much more than  Mrs. Quezada and her students.  </P> <P> JANICE AVAZIAN PETAS, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

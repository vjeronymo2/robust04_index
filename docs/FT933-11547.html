			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / NBC pays record sum for Olympics NBC, the US television network, has agreed to pay a record Dollars 456m for US broadcast rights to the 1996 summer Olympics in Atlanta, despite losing Dollars 100m on the games in Barcelona. It beat bids of about Dollars 450m from ABC, regarded as the front-runner, and Dollars 415m from CBS. Mr Billy Payne, chief of the Atlanta committee for the Olympic Games, had hoped for more but said he was 'doggone happy' with the NBC bid. The audience is expected to be the largest in Olympic history. Mr Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, said he expected to make a profit and was confident enough to offer the International Olympic Committee and the Atlanta one a share of revenues if advertising sales exceeded Dollars 615m. NBC's bid did not include a cable partner. Turner Broadcasting System, based in Atlanta, declined to put up any money for the rights fee. The European broadcasting rights were sold earlier this year for Dollars 250m to the European Broadcasting Union.</p>

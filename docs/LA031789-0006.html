			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Lompoc Elks Lodge turned down a black man's application for membership, but  accepted six whites, prompting the local National Assn. for the Advancement of  Colored People to accuse the group of racism. Realtor Joe Martin, 56, said he  was "disappointed" but not too surprised that he was rejected by nine of the  150 Elks who attended the meeting. Another black man, Ernie Hutchinson, was  rejected by the club in January, causing several members to resign. Hutchinson  is a Lompoc housing official and an ex-police officer. NAACP spokesman Art  Hicks said the Elks' blackball voting system discriminates against blacks.  </P></p>

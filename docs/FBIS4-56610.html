			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 5 May (NA) -- The PEN [National  Executive Branch] has announced that the Constituent Convention  will meet as of 0900 [1200 GMT] on 25 May. The executive branch  asked the Entre Rios provincial government "to make all  necessary arrangements for the meeting."    The call comes in Decree 657, which was published yesterday  in the Official Gazette. The decree calls on "Constituent  Assembly members elected on 10 April to meet in Parana, Entre  Rios Province, at 0900 on 25 May 1994."    The decree is signed by President Carlos Menem and Interior  Minister Carlos Ruckauf. It states that the call follows Law  24309, which establishes that the Convention must open within 60  days of the election.    The decree adds that the law declaring the need for  reforming  the Constitution "establishes that the Chamber of Deputies'  internal regulation will regulate the Convention's operation"  and that "due to the importance of the event, the opening date  -- 25 May -- grants the occasion the necessary solemnity and  importance because it coincides with another anniversary of our  independence."</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Lamont stands firm MR Norman Lamont has defended his refusal to devalue the pound ahead of next month's Tory conference where critical motions calling for early interest rate cuts have been tabled. Fears that there will be no short-term cut in interest rates led to new falls in European stock markets. The FT-SE 100 index closed 34.5 down at 2,337.7. Sterling and the dollar weakened against the D-Mark. Report, Page 20</p>

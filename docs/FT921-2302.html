			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: A&amp;P profits halved but margins pressure eases GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the large supermarket group, has revealed profits more than halved to Dollars 70.6m in the year to February 23. The after-tax figure compares with Dollars 151m in the previous 12 months, and is scored on sales marginally higher at Dollars 11.6bn, up from Dollars 11.4bn. The company, which still holds a stake in the British Isosceles retail group, saw margins come under acute pressure during 1991 and, against this background, the final three months of the year actually represent a slight improvement. After-tax profits in the fourth quarter totalled Dollars 16.1m, on sales of Dollars 2.74bn. In the third quarter, the figures were Dollars 3.92m and Dollars 2.6bn respectively. A&amp;P's chairman, Mr Jim Wood, acknowledged that 'competitive activity is still very strong', but said the company had at least been able to reverse the downward trend of year-to-year earnings comparisons which began in the fourth quarter of 1990. 'The pressure on margins was less than it was in the third quarter,' he commented. Shares in A&amp;P, the fourth largest supermarket operator in the US and 53 per cent-owned by Germany's Tengelmann group, have suffered badly over recent months, but yesterday they managed a modest revival, up Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 33 by the close in New York. Mr Wood said the company's aim in the current 12 months would be to maintain market share and keep costs down, with over Dollars 1bn scheduled to be invested in new stores, remodellings and expansions over the next three years. The company operates 1,238 stores under a variety of names  - ranging from Waldbaum's to Farmer Jack's  - and plans to open 30 new stores this year.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Trade News: Hoechst to restructure its North American fibre plants REORGANISATION of the world's fibres business continues with the announcement by Hoechst Celanese, the US subsidiary of Hoechst, the German chemicals company, of a Dollars 600m (Pounds 339m) programme to restructure its North American polyester fibres operations, writes Paul Abrahams. The group plans to build a 125m lb a year staple fibre installation at Queretaro, Mexico, which should come on stream by the last quarter of 1993. This follows an announcement last week that it was expanding the scale of its proposed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plant there from 70m lb a year to 125m lb. The investment would not increase North American capacity. Hoechst said it was considering closing outdated, non-competitive equipment at other Hoechst facilities in the US and Canada. US production would be centred at Spartanburg, South Carolina.</p>

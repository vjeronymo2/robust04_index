			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (3): Market 'will still be distorted' - Industry's reaction to the Inland Revenue's proposals THE Inland Revenue's proposed new company car tax regime has met with a chorus of criticism. At least one accountancy group has warned that 'there will be considerably more losers than winners' if it is adopted unchanged. Critics include the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In a formal submission, it voices 'profound' opposition to the Revenue's proposed retention of price banding as a means of assessing the tax benefit payable on the personal use of company cars. The SMMT argues that any new regime should be based solely on a fixed percentage of list prices, with the exception of very expensive makes such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin, whose manufacturers could be severely disadvantaged by a wholly pro rata scheme. At the heart of its opposition is its belief that any form of price banding will lead to market bunching of manufacturers' models at around the price 'break points', thus perpetuating - even if to a reduced degree - market distortions already complained of by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Despite the SMMT's stance, a survey of company car operators undertaken during a series of Association of Car Fleet Operators 'roadshows' late last year revealed users, at least, divided. Some 50 per cent of those surveyed favoured a more sophisticated banding system but almost as many - 42 per cent - backed a straightforward percentage system. ACFO is a powerful voice in the sector, founded some 20 years ago and now with about 500 member organisations operating some 450,000 cars and light commercial vehicles. But the diversity of views expressed by its membership makes it all the more likely that changes to the scheme as proposed by the Revenue itself are unlikely to be significant. There were, however, some broad areas of consensus: that published list prices, rather than actual cost to buyer or other yardsticks, should be used as the basis for calculating tax; that most users are believed already to be over-taxed - Mr Lamont's claims to tax neutrality notwithstanding - and that no more than 20 per cent of list price should be used to assess the level of tax liability; and most significantly, that the Revenue had done the entire sector a disservice by not allowing business mileage thresholds into the consultation process. thresholds is one of the thorniest in the entire debate. ACFO describes many of its members as being 'incredulous' that it should not be up for review. Mr Stewart Whyte, ACFO's spokesman and a director of the Fleet Audits consultancy group, declares: 'Without addressing this issue, the review can be at best half-hearted. The current system of mileage adjustments is hopelessly anomalous and is widely accepted as generating a great deal of unnecessary business mileage just to exceed the thresholds.' The thresholds are under 2,500 business miles; 2,500 -18,000 and over 18,000. At each threshold, the assessed tax payable is halved to reflect a perceived progression from 'perk' to essential car user. Mr Whyte's argument, endorsed across much of the fleet sector, is that not only does the system waste fuel and company time and resources - through drivers inventing business trips merely to lower their personal tax bills - but it is arbitrary in making no allowances for differences in industry, operating patterns or territorial factors. Fleet Audits has put in its own submission to the government, advocating a sliding scale charge based on the ratio of private mileage to business mileage as an indicator of whether a car is a 'perk' or essential for business. Under these proposals, if less than 5 per cent of total mileage was private, no scale charges should be incurred as the vehicle would clearly confer no tangible private use benefit. Between 6 and 35 per cent, 50 per cent of the scale charge is proposed, rising to 130 per cent where more than 85 per cent of a car's mileage is private. Like other organisations which reacted to the Revenue's request for criticism, the company must wait until next month to find out whether any elements of its proposal have been taken on board. At least on the broad mileage issue it is in accord with the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, which claims that its industry currently buys 25 per cent of all new vehicles sold in the UK. The BVRLA, too, has expressed considerable concern that there is no apparent intention to change the 2,500 and 18,000-mile thresholds. It, too, disputes the government's assertion that the current scale charges 'have moved much closer to realistic levels', claiming that they are now well in excess of the amounts required to cover average private use of a typical car. Like the SMMT, however, the BVRLA advocates a scale charge structure based wholly on the published retail price of cars, and remains opposed to the price banding concept retained in the Revenue proposals. It supports the SMMT that even the new system would 'inevitably lead to distortions and bunching below the price break points and continue to perpetuate some of the anomalies in the present system. 'It is the BVRLA's majority view that a simple percentage of list price would avoid any unfairness at the top and bottom of the band and would avoid the distortions experienced with the current system.' Among other critics, Mr Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, echoes the concern felt by many manufacturers that the drivers who will be hardest hit - senior executives driving the most expensive cars  -are user-choosers who will simply opt for cheaper vehicles. 'The logical result will be a general downsizing of company cars.' The Automobile Association insists that the Revenue's proposals are 'unrealistic', unfair, will encourage inefficient, high-mileage driving and do nothing to correct what it sees as distortions in the new car market. According to Mr Simon Dyer, its director-general, 'work cars should be taxed on one factor alone: the actual value of the private benefit to the employee. 'This should be calculated on the cost to the employer of providing the car, and the number of private miles driven annually.'</p>

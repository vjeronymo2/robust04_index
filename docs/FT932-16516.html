			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / EC ready to tighten screw on Serbia EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers have started preparing moves towards the total international isolation of Serbia, as a means of forcing Bosnian Serbs to agree the peace plan proposed by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. This followed a call yesterday by Lord Owen, the Community's peace negotiator on Bosnia, for 'relentless pressure' to make Bosnia's Serbs accept the plan. 'Everybody believes that this is a time now to put relentless pressure on the Bosnian Serbs and on the governments of Serbia and Montenegro to come and accept the plan. . . .' Lord Owen said after briefing ministers in Luxembourg. The EC said later it had 'elaborated a package of possible measures' - understood to include the closing of Serbian diplomatic missions, freezing Serbia's foreign assets, attempts to block transit trade from states bordering Serbia, and a ban on telecommunications traffic. The Community made clear it was awaiting the outcome of UN Security Council negotiations on tightening sanctions, but Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister and president of the council of ministers, said the EC did not exclude acting unilaterally. In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned the Bosnian Serbs that if they did not agree soon to the peace plan, the US would consult with its allies on the possibility of lifting the Yugoslav arms embargo. Lord Owen said suggestions the embargo on Bosnia be lifted selectively to help the Moslem population defend itself were a 'counsel of despair'. This would introduce more modern weaponry into the conflict for all sides, he said. Earlier, foreign and defence ministers of the Western European Union decided to tighten the blockade on Serbia's river Danube supply routes, by sending eight to ten patrol boats to reinforce sanctions.</p>

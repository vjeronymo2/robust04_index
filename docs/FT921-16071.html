			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo may set US car targets JAPAN will probably have to set import targets for US cars and car parts to satisfy American demands, Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's international trade and industry minister, said yesterday, ahead of President Bush's four-day visit, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The minister was due to appeal to Japan's car industry to boost purchases of US cars and components. 'I must ask for your co-operation to make (Mr Bush's) visit a success,' he told industry officials. Car trade friction and Japan's trade surplus with the US will be high on Mr Bush's agenda. Japan's big carmakers have announced plans to boost purchases of foreign-made cars, but some said there were limits to what they could do. Toyota and Nissan said yesterday they might boost imports further. Sales of US-made vehicles in Japan for January-November 1991 totalled 27,754, out of 180,852 imported vehicles sold there in the same 11 months.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Houses now more affordable - but confidence needs boost Sir, We take issue with your leader, 'Around the UK houses' (November 3), when you say that 'relative to average earnings, house prices remain quite high by historical standards'. According to the latest figures published by the Nationwide Building Society, the ratio between average house prices and average earnings stood at 3.1 in the third quarter of this year. This key ratio has been falling steadily, along with house prices, since it peaked at 4.7 in June 1989. At its current level, the price/earnings ratio is below its long-run average of 3.3 times average earnings, and below its average over the last five years of 3.9 times. On this measure, housing is more affordable now than at any time in the last nine years. The lower price/earnings ratio is a necessary - but not a sufficient - condition for a recovery in the housing market. There is currently three years' worth of pent-up demand from first-time buyers who have held back during the slump. They lack confidence to invest in a market which has seen cataclysmic falls in value - and which shows no sign of having reached the bottom. Decisive action is needed now from the government, fundamentally to rebuild confidence. This will not be achieved now simply by tinkering with interest rates.

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Mortgage benefit curbed further People on income support will not be able to claim for interest payments on mortgages which they have taken out or increased while receiving benefit, under rules introduced by the government yesterday. The rules, which come into effect next month, are intended to prevent any higher payments of income support to meet the interest on new home loans or any rise in existing loans. Mr William Hague, junior social security minister, said yesterday: 'The regulations represent a timely preventative measure at a time when the housing market is showing some signs of improvement.' There are a few exceptions to the new limit: for example, where a loan is taken out for essential repairs. The move represents a further curb on the availability of income support to meet mortgage interest repayments. Ministers have made clear that they want to cut such benefit. In August, a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 was imposed on the mortgage amount for which income support would be available, and this will be lowered to Pounds 125,000 for new claimants from Monday. Mortgage lenders have expressed unease about the prospect of more reductions in availability of income support for interest repayments. The original crackdown came after ministerial embarrassment over a case in which mortgage interest payments of almost Pounds 2,000 a week were made to a former insurance sales executive.</p>

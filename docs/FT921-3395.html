			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lonrho There was an air of finality about yesterday's 17 per cent fall in Lonrho's shares. When in a single day the market can find five separate reasons for selling, chief among them the belated realisation that the group derived 31 per cent of 1991 pre-tax profits from South Africa, investors are scarcely going to argue. Something dramatic is required if Lonrho is to find a way back. Mr Rowland's problem is that the time for a grand gesture was several months ago. He has long needed a large disposal or two to reduce the present Pounds 1bn debt mountain to manageable proportions for Lonrho's chronically weak cash flow. An unsolicited sub-investment grade rating on the debt was not designed to reassure the market. Yesterday's Pounds 45m sale of a few UK newspapers, although it realised a healthy profit, represents enough to cover the final dividend and leave some change. Equally, if Lonrho succeeds in its efforts to extract a cash payment from Volkswagen for the early termination of its VAG motor distribution franchise, the likely sum will be insignificant. At its present market capitalisation of a mere Pounds 620m, a takeover might be the obvious solution for investors, assuming Mr Rowland would ever agree to bow out. Such is the difficulty of valuing Lonrho's assets, however, that even a bold raider might hesitate. Take the leisure division, which last year generated pre-interest profits of Pounds 25m on stated gross assets of Pounds 914m. Assuming a 30 per cent tax rate and ignoring any debt, Lonrho is valuing the assets at 52 times their cash flow. Either that is too high, or the assets are seriously unproductive. But that sums up the market's dilemma. Only Mr Rowland knows their true worth, and he is still not telling.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (1): Sombre mood prevails - Radical economic reforms introduced by the National party government have won glowing international approbation. The sacrifices which have been demanded of the ordinary citizen have led, however, to a sense of disillusionment with the political process A DECADE after their political leaders embarked on a process of radical economic reform, New Zealanders are divided about whether the benefits have outweighed the costs. A substantial improvement in most economic indicators over the past year has given the country what the OECD calls its best opportunity for years to achieve a sustained return to real economic growth. That is something New Zealanders have not enjoyed since their egalitarian South Pacific paradise began to run into economic problems after the oil crisis of 1973. The OECD and most other outside analysts have reported glowingly on the impact of tariff and subsidy reductions, widespread privatisations, monetary prudence and cuts in social programmes. But the reforms are far less popular inside the country. Indeed, outside the ranks of the conservative National government, the national mood is sombre. Many observers say New Zealanders have never been so divided. The reason is the widespread perception among ordinary New Zealanders that they have borne most of the costs of the reform process without receiving any tangible benefits. Many also believe they were misled by both the 1984-90 Labour government and its National (conservative) successor about the difficulties involved in restructuring the economy. The result has been disillusionment with the political process among those who have suffered from the reforms - especially unionised workers, students, pensioners, and consumers of state benefits. Sociologists blame the dislocation caused by the reform programme for rising crime, growing poverty and increasing intolerance of Polynesian and Asian immigrants (though race relations are generally good). But the most dramatic result has been a surge in support for the replacement of the British-style first past the post (FPP) electoral system by a proportional system based on the German additional member system, known in New Zealand as mixed-member proportional (MMP). Mr Ken Douglas, president of the Council of Trade Unions (CTU) says New Zealanders are simply 'fed up' with the political process, which many believe has allowed right wing groups in the main parties to hijack the country. 'There is no fundamental belief that MMP is inherently a better system, but the present system has been disgraced because more than 50 per cent of people believe it is intellectually corrupt,' he says. 'There has never been majority support for the things that have happened here, and people just don't accept the values which can justify the huge costs we have had to carry. 'We are a much more racist, violent and sexist society than we have ever been before, and much of that has happened because people have felt alienated from a political system which does not represent them.' So far, the main beneficiaries of the support for PR have been Mr Winston Peters, a dissident former National MP, and Mr Jim Anderton, a former Labour MP who now leads the Alliance, a populist coalition of protest parties. Mr Anderton's main theme, that only a more consensual style of politics can reverse the continuing destruction of New Zealand's egalitarian heritage, has struck a rich vein of public support. He has also skilfully tapped public anger with both main parties by asserting that they have repeatedly misled the electorate about the scale and difficulties of the reform programme. 'Roger Douglas (Labour's 1984 finance minister) said that if we took the hard decisions in the first 18 months of government then we would pick up the benefits in the last 18 months of the (parliamentary) term,' he says. 'But the short sharp shock has been going on for so long now that people are traumatised by it. It's like being in the dentist's chair for years - the pain goes on and on and there is no gain.' THE appeal of Mr Peters is more difficult to identify. He has built a large constituency by criticising his former government colleagues, and is said to be determined to become New Zealand's first Maori Prime Minister. Yet no-one seems to know what he stands for, unless it is 'old-fashioned, private enterprise, development oriented' pump priming, as the Wellington Evening Post put it in a recent editorial. The minor parties' best chance of breaking the mould of New Zealand politics will come in a referendum on MMP to be held at the same time as the next election, due by November. If the referendum succeeds, as seems probable, MMP will be introduced for the subsequent election, due by 1996. If that happens, neither Labour nor National is likely to be able to form a future government without reaching a coalition agreement with at least one of the minor party groupings. In the meantime, opinion polls suggest that the Alliance could win a substantial number of seats in the next parliament, especially if it comes to an electoral agreement with Mr Peters. Labour's response to the emerging political volatility has been to ignore it in the belief that traditional supporters will return to the fold when they enter the polling booths. Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader, who was Prime Minister for eight weeks in 1990, has spent the 32 months since the last election distancing himself and the party from the 1980s. Mr Moore's strategy has been to exploit the climate of bitterness about the decade of change by presenting Labour as the party which offers New Zealanders both credible economic management and a fresh start - 'the great reforms of the 1980s were, in the main, necessary, but this is not the 1980s, and I am not going to be constrained by the legacy of the 1980s,' he says. Rhetoric aside, however, Labour has no intention of reversing the thrust of the restructuring. The party would retain the existing tight monetary policy favoured by the operationally-independent Reserve Bank, and it would aim for even greater fiscal conservatism than that achieved by National. In the main, a Labour government would restrict itself to relaxing National's deregulation of the labour market, and reversing or amending the government's unpopular changes to the health system and social programmes, which are intended to cut costs by improving targetting. This policy moderation has been reassuring to the business and financial community, which has few qualms about the impact of a Labour government on New Zealand's ability to sustain the economic recovery. But there is little doubt that business would prefer to see the re-election of the National government, which has firmly committed itself to continuing to open up the economy and reduce the size of government. ONLY a month ago, National looked unlikely to remain in office. However, recent improvements in the economy have triggered a rise in the government's poll rating which shows that the battle is not yet over. Ironically, the government is also seeking to exploit the dislike for change by presenting itself as the only party which will not plunge New Zealand into a further bout of reform - 'we have two very substantial electoral cards to play. One is the recovery, and the other is that we are the only party which represents continuity,' says Mrs Ruth Richardson, finance minister. 'The opposition parties are now the ones which are seen as the parties which are offering destructive change.' The key influence on the election may well be the Budget, due next month. While a give-away Budget is unlikely, both Mrs Richardson and Mr Jim Bolger, the Prime Minister, have indicated that they want to extend the fruits of the recovery to ordinary New Zealanders. Time is short, but if the government can do that, it may begin to heal some of the wounds which have so bitterly divided the country. In the long term, that will be of more importance to New Zealanders than the colour of the next government.</p>

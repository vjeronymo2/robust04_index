			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Broadcasting firms should  be allowed to list their stocks publicly, an advisory panel to  the Posts and Telecommunications Minister said Monday [21  February].    The current law that restricts broadcasting firms from going  public should be lifted to let them procure funds in the  multimedia age, the panel said in its report of recommendations.    Among other recommendations made in the nine-point proposal  is the slight easing of a rule prohibiting one company from  owning several broadcasting companies.    The panel also recommended that laws be reviewed to make  television broadcasting across country borders possible, and  that firms' broadcasting areas be enlargened.    The Posts and Telecommuncations Ministry is likely to lift  the stock-listing restriction in March and ease the rule on  prohibiting ownership of several broadcasting firms within this  year.</p>

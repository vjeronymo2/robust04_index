			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Gui Polspoel in Kigali by Jan </F> Becaus in Brussels within a "special" newscast on the situation  in Rwanda -- live]    [Text] [Becaus] And we return to the crisis in Rwanda,  ladies and gentlemen. If all goes well, I will now have my  colleague Gui Polspoel on the line from Kigali. Gui, do you  hear me?    [Polspoel] I hear you loud and clear, Jan.    [Becaus] Where are you at this very moment, Gui?    [Polspoel] I am on the tarmac at the airport where we landed  some 10 minutes ago aboard a C-130 of the Belgian Air Force.    [Becaus] What is going on there?    [Polspoel] Mostly military movements. The C-130s are still  shuttling between Nairobi and Kigali, flying in military  equipment inlcuding trucks, jeeps, and so on, because only then  can the Belgians start their operation. The go-ahead for that  rests with the Rwandan authorities who thus far have not  permitted them to leave the airport. The French can leave, but  the Belgians must remain in place. Negotiations are continuing.    [Becaus] Can you judge from there how the evacuation is  proceeding?    [Polspoel] It is being carried out reasonably well, but  mainly with the French, who can pick up people in town. A  flight with 75 people onboard left for Nairobi, Kenya some 30  minutes ago. The passengers will be flown back from Nairobi to  Belgium probably on board two Belgian Air Force planes, actually  passenger planes, which are waiting at Nairobi airport. Most of  those 75 are Belgians, but we do not have the exact information  on their identities.    [Becaus] If I understand it well, Gui, the Belgian military  is still inactive at this very moment?    [Polspoel] Yes, that is correct. Obviously they are helping  the refugees arriving at the airport, but they have not been  permitted real operations in the town or outside the airport yet.    [Becaus] Can you hear, from where you are, hostilities in or  around Kigali?    [Polspoel] No. Last night, however, the Air Force people  told us that when they left here around 1800, there was heavy  shooting in this neighborhood.    [Becaus] Well, thanks Gui Polspoel. We will certainly hear  from you later in our next newscast.</p>

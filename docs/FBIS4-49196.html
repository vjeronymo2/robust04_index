			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yang Qing (2799 7230) and Li Xiaogang (2621 </F> 2556 1511)]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- Speaking at an  on-site meeting on learning from and promoting Beijing First  Light Industry Corporation's experience in carrying out  extensive integrated reforms, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State  Council, stated: Beijing First Light Industry Corporation's  experience demonstrates that the difficulties facing state-owned  enterprises are not insurmountable, and that state-owned  enterprises can be invigorated and are not without  superiorities; reform holds the key to solving these problems.  Responsible persons from light industry departments and bureaus  in 30 large and medium cities attended the meeting, which was  held by the China National Light Industry Council.    Li Lanqing said: Guided by Comrade Xiaoping's important  talks during his tour of southern China and the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress, and with the full support of the  Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Government, as well as  such departments as the China National Light Industry Council,  the State Economic Restructuring Commission, and the State  Economics and Trade Commission, leaders and comrades in Beijing  First Light Industry Corporation proceeded from reality,  explored new ways, and advanced the idea for carrying out  extensive integrated reforms after giving full consideration to  reforms of the systems of enterprise property rights, land  utilization, personnel and labor, worker training, and social  security, as well as the transformation of government functions.  Those reforms led to "the appreciation of assets, industrial  realignment, functional changes, the transformation of  mechanisms, and the outplacement of workers and staff members."  The corporation achieved remarkable results in implementing the  idea internally, thus promoting its own development and  improving its own economic efficiency. [passage omitted]    Li Lanqing noted: The reform measures embody the unity of  realigned production relations and productive forces, as well as  the unity of reform, development, and stability. They conform  to the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, as well as this year's overall situation.  The experience holds universal significance for carrying out  extensive integrated reforms in small and medium state-owned  enterprises, as well as in large collectively owned enterprises,  in the light industry sector. It is also useful as reference for  reforming and invigorating some large and medium state-owned  enteprises. [passage omitted]</p>

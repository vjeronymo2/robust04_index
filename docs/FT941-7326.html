			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Property: IPD Index The growth in commercial property capital values fell from 2.9 per cent in December to 1.2 per cent in January, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group, writes Vanessa Houlder. Total returns from commercial property remained strongly positive at 1.9 per cent. The rate of decline in rental values in January was unchanged from December, at -0.3 per cent. No sector or region shows clear signs of an upturn in rental values. Total returns slowed across all sectors. Industrials and retails both returned 2.1 per cent for the month, while offices fell back into third place with a total return of 1.7 per cent. Total returns for offices in January fell to 1.7 per cent on the back of a fall in capital growth to less than 1 per cent. Equivalent yields in the industrial sector shortened from 10.5 per cent in December to 10.3 per cent in January. Total returns and capital growth of the industrial sector were 2.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively. Six new funds have been added to the IPD monthly index in January, increasing its total capital value by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.14bn. The monthly IPD charts of quarterly returns are no longer adjusted to show annualised movements. This is to prevent a strong short-term performance from giving an unrealistically high impression of achievable returns.</p>

The two pime ministers talked primarily about the European  integration process, the development and vision of a more united  Europe, and about future Czech membership in the European Union.    Dehaene told journalists afterwards that the meeting had  been  productive, and said he shared Klaus' "vision" of Europe. Klaus  said the two of them agreed that a country like the Czech  Republic must increase its ties to NATO, the EU and other  international organisations. "We have to find something between  association and full membership in the European Union," he said,  adding that Dehaene had accepted his invitation to visit the  Czech Republic in the near future.    Afterward Klaus met with European Commission President  Jacques Delors. Commissioner for Foreign Relations Hans van den  Broek was unable to attend the meeting as had been expected,  since he was out of town in connection with talks on Norway's  admission to the EU.</p>

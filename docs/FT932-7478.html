			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Currency crisis study spreads blame: EC monetary committee believes EMS is fundamentally sound EUROPEAN Community member states must rediscover a consensus on the conduct of economic policy if the European monetary system is to return to long-term stability, according to a report by the EC monetary committee on last year's exchange rate crisis. The report, considered at an informal meeting of EC finance ministers in Kolding, Denmark, at the weekend, spreads the blame for the crisis, which saw the pound and the lira ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism, and successive devaluations of the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt. In a 12-page analysis of the crisis, the report concludes that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the EMS - but the members must play by the rules. Germany is criticised for financing German unification through borrowing - a choice which led inevitably to a tight monetary policy and an 'unbalanced' policy mix, with repercussions for the rest of Europe. The UK is criticised implicitly for failing to raise interest rates at an early date and in a decisive manner. Italy's devaluation is blamed on a failure to get a grip on the government deficit, while Spain saw a significant and cumulative deterioration in its competitive position which undermined the credibility of the peseta rate in the ERM. A key recommendation is that the EMS should adapt its internal rules so that member states can take the initiative to encourage a currency realignment. The report states that existing EMS procedures leave the initiative to the member state whose currency is under attack - a situation which clearly proved unsatisfactory during last autumn's exchange rate crisis. The call for new procedures mirrors a central theme in the report: that the onus is on the targeted member state to take appropriate action to defend its currency using available instruments, such as interest rates. The report also implicitly limits the obligation of central banks to support individual currencies, even when a currency comes under speculative attack in spite of sound economic fundamentals. 'The other member states will determine to what extent and how they can support these efforts through appropriate voluntary actions,' the report says. This statement appears to dilute the obligations of central banks as set out in the 1987 Basle-Nyborg agreement. Here there is at least a presumption in favour of member states whose currencies are targeted without obvious justification. The report comes down firmly against automatic rescue operations by the central banks, declaring that large and prolonged intervention 'may even have a destabilising effect and they can thwart monetary policy in creditor countries'. A central recommendation in the report is the need for frank communication between member states on exchange rate matters and the possible need for a realignment - a recognition of the communications breakdown last autumn which ended in Black Wednesday with the forced exit of the pound and lira from the ERM. The monetary committee would like to create a confidential set of indicators to ensure that misalignments in exchange rates are detected as early as possible. 'They would not be thought of as 'warning lights' and they would certainly not dictate the outcome of the investigation. They should include, primarily, measures of external competitiveness,' says the report. The next step would be to change EMS procedures so that member states could take the initiative. 'In future, they should provide for the situation in which other member states consider that a central rate is out of line. In these cases, there is a need for confidential procedures.' In a separate passage, the committee also calls for 'plain speaking', a 'confrontation on policy issues' and a critical probing of forecasts and policy intentions - a clear admission that the run-up to last year's exchange rate crisis was marked by a breakdown in communication among the member states and, by implication, within the monetary committee itself. The monetary committee stresses that stability in the EMS depends on the credibility of economic policies in all member states. Although strengthening the process of 'convergence' on economic performance is essential for the stability of the EMS, it 'may not be enough unless accompanied by an improved co-ordination of economic policies and a continued commitment to defend the system as a common good'. The report serves notice that re-entry into the ERM can only occur after 'careful preparation' and 'by mutual agreement, with regard to the time and the conditions'. In particular, it says that central rates should be reached 'in a common procedure'. This marks a break with the past when the UK chose to enter the ERM in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 without previous consultation with its EC partners.</p>

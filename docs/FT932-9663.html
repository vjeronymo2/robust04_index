			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Key Hungarian's US pay revealed THE Hungarian government faces a politically embarrassing row following revelations that a US government-financed investment fund has been paying a large part of the salary of the chairman of Hungary's state holding company. The Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund (HAEF), the Dollars 60m institution set up in 1990 to boost the Hungarian private sector, admitted yesterday it was paying Mr Pal Teleki, chairman of Hungary's state holding company AV RT. The payment - about Dollars 130,000 (Pounds 84,415) annually - is much larger than his basic salary. The admission is expected to anger nationalists, who accuse the conservative coalition government of favouring foreign investors. The latter, they allege, have dominated the Hungarian privatisation process to the detriment of potential local investors. US companies have been the most active investors in Hungary and confirmation that the US fund has been subsidising the salary of the man in charge of about half the country's business sector is expected to cause a political outcry. The AV RT controls Hungary's main utilities and the biggest banks and industrial companies. Its portfolio is worth about Ft1,500bn (Pounds 11bn) and includes many of the choicest privatisation prospects. US and Hungarian officials yesterday defended the subsidy as essential for the AV RT to attract Mr Teleki, a Hungarian-American who formerly worked as a geologist for the US government. But several Hungarian officials were critical, saying Mr Teleki's US connection raised conflict of interest issues. The exposure of the large payments to Mr Teleki has hit the HAEF at a vulnerable time. The fund was recently attacked by US congressmen for allowing its independent merchant bank to pay excessive salaries and make deals outside its defined area.</p>

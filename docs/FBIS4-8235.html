This is a disgraceful act and  extraordinary grave of Greece towards Albania, its sovereignty  and integrity, so Greek Government has full responsibility for  its consequences. I demand from the government to take all the  necessary measures to prevent such acts and to respond properly  to this act and policy. I appeal to Albanian opinion,  governments of the whole world, their institutions, and the  international public opinion to condemn this massacre. I point  out that Greece and its policy of blockades and bands aims at  the encouragement of Serb's aggression in the north of Balkans  and the destabilization of the southern part of the region in  favour of Greek expansionist goals. The Albanian will for good  and friendly relationships, Greece was responded systematically  with a series of criminal acts that aim to destabilize the  country, but I stress that going back to the policy of bands  during the beginning of the century, and fostering terrorism,  Greek Government holds the responsibility of converting its  country into a source of dangerous conflicts of which they are  responsible.    At the same time I express mine and government determination  insisting that the Albanian policy should serve to preserve  peace and stability in the southern Balkans, as we have done up  to now.</p>

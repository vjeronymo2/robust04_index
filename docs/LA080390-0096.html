			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BACKS SOVIET MARKET ECONOMY;  </P> <P> REFORMS: AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN WILL HEAD FOR MOSCOW NEXT MONTH TO AID GORBACHEV.  </P> <P> The United States, responding to Soviet requests for economic assistance,  agreed Thursday to bring dozens of top American businessmen to Moscow next  month to consult on this country's transition to a market economy.  </P> <P> The agreement, reached between U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, will commit the Bush  Administration and the U.S. business establishment to ensuring the success of  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, meeting Baker in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, discussed the  Soviet Union's deepening economic crisis and what assistance the United States  could provide as Gorbachev transforms the state-owned, centrally planned,  bureaucratically managed economy into one based on entrepreneurship and the  market forces of supply and demand.  </P> <P> Vitaly I. Churkin, a Shevardnadze aide, said that the Soviet Union is accepting  Bush's offer of assistance, made last December when he met Gorbachev at Malta,  and hopes that extensive consultations will result from the next  Baker-Shevardnadze meeting, planned for Moscow in mid-September.  </P> <P> Robert A. Mosbacher, the secretary of commerce, will bring a delegation of  leading American businessmen to Moscow for that meeting, which will coincide  with the annual session of the Soviet-American Trade and Economic Commission.  Gorbachev will meet with the group for a strategy session on economic reform  and increased trade.  </P> <P> Bush, in renewing his offer of assistance, said recently that the United States  is prepared to provide economic advice, to expand technical cooperation and to  foster increased trade to underwrite the Soviet Union's economic reforms, but  that the United States cannot provide direct economic assistance.  </P> <P> Churkin said that Shevardnadze had outlined a series of areas where the United  States could help, starting with government-to-government agreements to provide  the framework for increased trade but continuing into extensive cooperation  between U.S. and Soviet enterprises as a market economy develops here. Baker  had made detailed proposals when he met with Shevardnadze last month in Paris.  </P> <P> U.S. technical assistance might help the Soviet Union solve such problems as  getting food to the market; more than a quarter of Soviet agricultural produce  rots before it gets to consumers because of inadequate transport and storage  facilities.  </P> <P> American specialists might also advise on the development of a commercial  banking system, the formation of equity markets to raise capital and modern  industrial management.  </P> <P> In other developments at the Irkutsk meeting, Baker and Shevardnadze  established a new channel for quick resolution of issues in the negotiations to  reduce the two countries' strategic arsenals.  </P> <P> As the negotiators in Geneva proceed through the scores of outstanding  questions in drafting a strategic arms reduction treaty for signature by the  end of this year, they will now put those requiring political decisions to the  ministers' deputies, rather than wait for the ministers' next meeting.  </P> <P> "This new channel does not mean new difficulties," Churkin said. "The principal  points of the treaty were agreed in Washington in June. The final preparations  of the treaty are now under way, but there are enormous technical difficulties.  The point is that the two sides are determined to finalize this treaty as soon  as possible."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze formally advised Baker in Irkutsk that the Soviet Union would  complete its deployment of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1991  and thus would halt production of the weapons. Churkin said this should make it  easier to agree on rules for verifying compliance with the agreement.  </P> <P> The two ministers also discussed ways to resolve the principal remaining issue  -- the deployment of warplanes -- in the Vienna negotiations on reducing  conventional forces in Europe and agreed to consult with their allies in NATO  (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the Warsaw Pact to see if these could  be included in a treaty to be signed at an all-European summit in Paris in  November.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze agreed on a timetable for the preparation of a new  Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting to be held in Moscow before the end of the year  with the strategic arms control agreement as its centerpiece, Churkin said.  </P> <P> That will propel the two countries to make a number of key decisions in the  next four or five months on how their relationship will develop, according to  Churkin.  </P> <P> The principal focus of the Irkutsk meetings had been regional conflicts,  particularly those in Asia -- the Korean Peninsula, Cambodia and Afghanistan --  as well as the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Churkin said the result was  one of "narrowing differences" but that differences remained.  </P> <P> "Each time the ministers discuss this (Afghan) issue, they find new common  ground," Churkin said of the continuing Afghanistan civil war, in which Moscow  and Washington supporting opposing sides. "Both agree elections should be held,  that the United Nations should play an active role in the settlement and that  the process should be under international control."  </P></p>

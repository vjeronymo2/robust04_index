			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / S Africa taxi drivers in new protest POLICE and protesting black taxi drivers clashed for a second straight day yesterday, leaving three people injured and tempers high in parts of central Johannesburg, AP reports from Johannesburg. The drivers were angry that some people held in Monday's confrontation remained in custody, despite an agreement with city officials that called for their release. Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said he would declare Johannesburg an unrest area, giving police wide powers to arrest people and disperse crowds. Protesting taxi drivers were complaining that traffic police harass them and that they want subsidies similar to those given the Public Utility Transport Corp. bus company. Taxi drivers are notorious for dangerous driving and are often involved in accidents.</p>

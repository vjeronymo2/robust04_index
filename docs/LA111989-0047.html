			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: UNDER THE TREE OF LIFE -- IT'S SUPERMAC ;  </P> <P> HAROLD MACMILLAN VOL. 2. 1957-1986 BY ALISTAIR HORNE (VIKING; $24.95; 741 PP.,  ILLUSTRATED; 0-670-82980-3)  </P> <P> He would like to be prime minister like his grandfather, young Alexander  Macmillan once announced, "and sit under a tree and read a book."  </P> <P> Harold Macmillan, who started in his family's publishing firm and went back  after a 40-year detour through British politics, never really left his books  behind. In his periodic depressions -- "black dogs" he called them -- he would  turn the government over to Rab Butler, his deputy, and go to the country for a  couple of days to read Jane Austen.  </P> <P> Throughout his life, as Alistair Horne's haunting biography shows, this clever  and sufficiently ruthless politician drew courage, high spirits, images and a  self-image from his reading. Power, which expends so many other people as it is  exercised, expends the exerciser most of all. The loneliness demands  replenishment. Macmillan found company in his books, and resonance.  </P> <P> Thus, for example, his recreational delight was in the prime-ministerial duty  of keeping an eye on Britain's state religion. He would receive the Archbishop  of Canterbury and remark, afterwards, that whereas he, Macmillan, wanted to  talk religion, the archbishop wanted to talk politics. For a moment, he was not  the expansive leader of a shrinking empire, but Trollope in Barset.  </P> <P> Horne's biography is a superbly detailed account of the career of one of the  more active and intelligent British leaders of the century. This second volume,  which begins in 1957 when Macmillan took over from Anthony Eden after the Suez  disaster, covers his seven years in office and the long and extraordinarily  fruitful retirement that ended with his death in 1986 at age 92.  </P> <P> The book has its awkwardnesses. The need to cover, at least cursorily, the  range of problems that confronted the prime minister month by month and year by  year makes for choppiness. There are a few pages on the Middle East, on Cyprus,  on NATO, on weapons, on the Russians; and a new round a year or two later. It's  like tugging a body stocking up a well-fleshed body -- a nip here, a nip there.  </P> <P> Its unique virtue is not the thorough record and analysis of the public life.  Emerging from the account of victories and defeats constructed upon the backs  of events, and the unmanageable procession of "nexts" that wear out any public  career, we get a portrait of the character that conducted the life.  </P> <P> I say "character" rather than "man," and "conducted" rather than "lived." The  man remains elusive, as Horne himself declares, despite his unparalleled  access: Macmillan's unpublished diaries and correspondence, and years of taped  and untaped conversation.  </P> <P> What we get is a literary character extracted by two remarkable authors. There  is Macmillan's account of himself: sensitive and unsparing at the same time,  and colored by art; and Horne's: enthralled and detached at the same time, and  also colored by art. On a lesser scale, of course, but still -- Johnson by  Boswell. To speak of a literary character is not to contest its truth. The tree  Macmillan read books under was his tree of life.  </P> <P> The public image that lingers of him is buoyancy followed by droop. In the  first years of his government there was a kind of euphoric resurgence in the  country. The Beatles and Carnaby Street were icons of trendiness; there was a  renaissance in the arts and the beginnings of a tourist boom; and the economy  seemed to be perking up.  </P> <P> "You never had it so good" -- a campaign slogan -- almost seemed true. Abroad,  the jaunty figure of "Supermac" in a white fur hat, trying to revive summitry  with an explosive Khrushchev, or speaking of the "winds of change" in Africa,  or knitting a comrade-in-arms tie with Eisenhower and an avuncular tie with  Kennedy, contributed to the brightness.  </P> <P> It was on a curve of decline, though. Macmillan was only one of a procession of  British leaders to wrestle unsuccessfully with sluggish domestic productivity  and energetic domestic consumption. Despite his passion to keep Britain as one  of the world's Big Three, Macmillan had to accept the shrinking of his  country's role in the world, a partnership with the United States that owed  more to personal relations than to reality, and De Gaulle's crushing veto of  Britain's entry into the Common Market.  </P> <P> It was these things more than the Profumo affair -- a sex scandal that erupted  around a cabinet minister John Profumo -- that brought Macmillan low and  discouraged him out of office. Without waiting for more considered medical  advice, he decided that a prostate operation he was undergoing would  incapacitate him permanently, and quit. He spent 23 years of subsequent good  health regretting the decision.  </P> <P> Regret can destroy a public man. For a man of letters, on the other hand, it  can open a world. Macmillan took an active guiding role in the affairs of what  was then his family's publishing house. More than that, though, his voice was  freed.  </P> <P> As chancellor of Oxford University, he turned a ceremonial post into a podium  for a cycle of spacious, witty and beautifully turned observations on the  affairs of the world, present and past. The same golden words electrified the  House of Lords when, at 90, he finally accepted the earldom that Queen  Elizabeth had kept on open offer for the previous two decades. They astonished  visitors, and in a series of letters and visits over the years, they provided  solace to Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of his friend.  </P> <P> Filtered through his conversations with Horne, they turn an accomplished  political biography into something much richer. It is a mosaic of vivid  recollections, pungent comments on events and personages, and splendid  observations by friends, old antagonists and the biographer. There was a  quality in Macmillan's wit, as in Falstaff's, that encouraged the wit that was  in others.  </P> <P> Buoyant and suspicious, effervescent and depressed, capable of cutting irony  and real personal and social compassion, Macmillan was an actor who wrote his  own lines (with the help of Sophocles, Machiavelli, Burke, Lucretius, Conrad  and Hardy, among many others). Harold Wilson, a fierce opponent and  not-so-secret admirer, said that "his role as a poseur was itself a pose."  </P> <P> Horne shows the poses. Macmillan did the effete Etonian snob to perfection;  also the bookish gentleman with slipping eyeglasses, a stained cardigan and a  Guards Regiment tie just showing. At 85, he was particularly good at suggesting  senile collapse and then rising to deliver a stunning hour of elegance and  passion. In office, he won the loyalty of his gifted subordinates by  pronouncing all crises to be "fun" or "a bore," and by making a point of never  coming in until late in the morning. He explained:  </P> <P> "If you come to the Cabinet Room at 9:30 and start ringing bells you only upset  them all . . . if you come down too early it's rather like an office too; all  the work piles up, and you must let them have time to open the new letters, the  urgent ones, the urgent telegrams, otherwise you become rather a nuisance."  </P> <P> One can imagine an audience of executive overachievers ("He's always at his  desk by seven, long before his secretaries," the publicity bio goes) listening  to such advice. One hopes they might. It is the kind of thing that explains how  this long-retired political in-fighter, statesman and besotted reader was able,  in his ninth decade, to make his listeners feel wiser and more hopeful. It  makes us feel that way too.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  -- From "Harold Macmillan, Volume II: 1956-1986."  </P> <P> After John F. Kennedy's death, a deep affection grew up between his widow and  the man who had been her husband's ally, friend, adviser and fellow-wit. When  he was alive, Macmillan and Jacqueline Onassis would see each other whenever  either was in the other's country. The extracts from letters between the two  that appear in this book -- mostly unpublished up to now -- give a rare and  moving glimpse of Mrs. Onassis' feelings and her ability to express them.  </P> <P> Here, she replied to Macmillan's initial letter of condolence:  </P> <P> "Sometimes I become so bitter, only alone -- I don't tell anyone -- but I do  truly think that any poor school child looking at the record of the 1960s --  could only decide that virtue is UNrewarded. The two greatest men of our time,  you and Jack -- all you fought for and cared about together -- the Atlantic  Alliance -- how full of charity were your relations always with each other even  when unforeseen disastrous things like Skybolt happened. And how does it all  turn out? De Gaulle is there (words deleted) and bitter old Adenauer -- and the  two people who have had to suffer are you and Jack. . . .  </P> <P> "And then I remember this summer -- when we lost our son Patrick -- and he  showed me the letter from you -- in your own hand -- and you said -- in the  midst of all your troubles -- 'Private griefs are so much worse than public  ones' -- you were in the most terrible time of your life -- but you could write  that way to Jack . . . ."  </P> <P> And here is the last part of Macmillan's reply:  </P> <P> "I shall count it something I can perhaps do for Jack, just being a recipient  of letters . . . I am writing this at home -- in this softly beautiful day,  with the buds on the trees in the woods, just beginning to get that wonderful  purple before the Spring. . . .  </P> <P> "May God bless you, my dear child. You have shown the most wonderful courage to  the bitter outer world. The hard thing is really to feel it inside. . . ."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kunlachada Chaiphiphat] </F>   [Text] Vientiane -- To stimulate its tourism industry,  Vientiane has dropped an almost two decade-long restriction on  the movement of foreigners, allowing them to travel anywhere in  Laos except for areas considered restricted and dangerous.    Tourists can also apply for entry visas at Laos'  international checkpoints besides Laotian embassies.    Those international checkpoints are Vat Tai and Tha Nadeua  at  Vientiane in central Laos, Ban Houai Sai in Bokeo province,  Sanakham in Sayaboury province in northern Laos and Ban Viang  Savan in Savannakhet, all of which border Thailand. Another  international checkpoint in Savannakhet's western frontier is at  Ban Non Savan bordering Lao Bao in Vietnam.    Laos expects a hike in the number of foreign tourists,  especially in the coming months after the opening of Mittaphap  Thai-Lao bridge.    The relaxed tourism measures did not mention new freedom of  movement for foreign diplomats in Vientiane. Vientiane-based  diplomats from western countries have been restricted to within  six kilometres of the capital and could travel to other  provinces only with prior notification from Vientiane  authorities.    To promote domestic tourism, Vientiane will also allow its  citizens to travel within the country using only their identity  cards. Before, they had to apply to provincial authorities for  passes to other provinces.    However residents without identity cards will still have to  seek passes from the provincial authorities.    The newly-formed National Tourism Organization has devised a  motto, "Lao travel in Laos", to encourage domestic tourism.    To foster its new tourism plan for this year, the  organization has divided the country into three zones. In the  northern zone, destinations being touted are Bokeo, Oudomsai,  Houaphan, Xiang Khouang and Luang Prabang.    In the central zone are Vientiane, Vientiane Municipality,  Khammouane within a parameter of 20 square kilometres and  Savannakhet in the orbit of Route 9, while in the southern zone  are Champassak and Saravane.    The steps are being taken to prepare for a Laos Tourism  Year,  which Vientiane hopes will be in 1995.    The new set of immigration measures were approved by an  intergovernment committee comprising representatives of the  Foreign and Interior ministries and chaired by Minister of the  Prime Minister's Office Phao Bounnaphon.    The announcement was made on Monday in the VIENTIANE-MAI  WEEKLY, five days ahead of the inauguration of the Mittaphap  Thai-Lao Bridge set for this Friday.    The newspaper said all authorities concerned in the  provinces  have been informed of the new regulations.    The move followed considerable debate over the past year  between reformists and conservatives within the Lao People's  Revolutionary Party over whether to relax immigration controls.</p>

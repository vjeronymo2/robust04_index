			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Tentative agreement on job security and work rules was announced at a second  Bell Atlantic telephone company, and talks resumed at Ameritech, another of  three Baby Bells tied up in an 18-state strike now in its third week. The  settlement was reached between the union and Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone  in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, but a  spokesman said a walkout that began Aug. 6 will continue until agreements are  reached at all sister Bell Atlantic companies. At NYNEX, which serves 10.5  million customers in the Northeast, no new talks were scheduled between  representatives of its 60,000 striking workers and the company.  </P></p>

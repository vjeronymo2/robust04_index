			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andreas Anzenberger report: "There Is No Security </F> Guarantee Without Anything in Return"]    [Text] The outlines of a possible European security system  are emerging: Sweden and Finland joined NATO's Partnership for  Peace program on Monday [9 May]. Switzerland is also  considering taking this step. At the same time, the Western  European Union (defense alliance of the European Union) offered  cooperation agreements to the East European states.    Austria might turn into a blank space on the  security-political map of Europe. These issues were mainly  discussed during the official visit to the United States by  General Troop Inspector Karl Majcen last week.    The Austrian Government has decided in favor of a "pragmatic  path," which is being understood in the United States, Majcen  pointed out. In spite of a "generally benevolent and positive  assessment of the Partnership for Peace concept," Austria "does  not want to join it officially" for the time being.    Instead, cooperation "will be expanded in the spheres where  we possess expert knowledge" -- that is, in peacekeeping  missions and disaster control, the general announced. A common  basis for that exists already: At the NATO Coordination  Council, a planning group deals exclusively with such  activities; Austria is a participant, despite its international  status as a neutral country.    In addition, contacts with neighboring countries like  Hungary  in the sphere of military training are to be intensified.    The question as to who organizes the peacekeeping operations  is of secondary importance, Majcen stated. Austria will  participate "without looking under whose auspices they are  taking place."    Majcen made it clear that there can be no security guarantee  without any specific return service.    The NATO states would not tolerate efforts by a country to  "obtain a security guarantee as it were via membership in the  European Union without offering anything in return. Entry into  NATO through the back door" is not possible.    Asked whether it would have been better to join the  Partnership for Peace scheme together with Finland and Sweden,  Majcen declined to reply: He is only implementing government  decisions. However, if the referendum on 12 June should yield a  positive result, a certain "speed is required." Austria must  "decide quickly what kind of security policy is useful. Also,  it must regulate its relationship with the Western European  Union."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 25 SAPA -- The National Party [NP]  on Wednesday said the "lunatic left" was just as dangerous as  the "lunatic right". The NP's Daryl Swanepoel was reacting to a  recent statement by the Azanian Students Movement [Azasm] and  threats made by the movement against white teachers in black  schools.    Azasm said earlier in the week threatened the lives and  safety of white teachers, saying blacks would "re-enact June 16  [student uprising in Soweto] and fight with our bare hands".  [sentence as received]    Mr Swanepoel, a member of the provincial legislature and  party spokesman for the Johannesburg and Soweto region, said the  NP strongly condemned the racist statements of Azasm National  Deputy President Kgomotso Modiselle. "Sentiments such as those  expressed by Azasm are totally against the will of the people.  They are a return to the dark days we all thought were behind  us," said Mr Swanepoel. He said it was sad to see there were  still people in South Africa who were prepared to sacrifice the  futures of young South Africans to fanatical political  ideologies. "The NP trusts the government will respond to these  threats and destroy the seeds of intimidation and  destabilisation before they take root. We all thought that the  only bits of racism left in our country were on the lunatic  right. Now we find there is a lunatic fringe on the left as  well and it is just as dangerous."</p>

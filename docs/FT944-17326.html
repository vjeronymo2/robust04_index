			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: BSkyB heads to market - New issues Dominating the markets this week was the announcement on Thursday of plans by satellite broadcaster BSkyB to go public. The issue, scheduled tentatively to take place before Christmas, is likely to involve the sale of up to Pounds 1bn of new BSkyB shares, or 20 per cent of its enlarged equity, valuing the company at just under Pounds 5bn. After years of losses, the company has become increasingly profitable, posting Pounds 176.8m at the operating level in the year to June against Pounds 54.1m the previous year. The proceeds of the issue, to be sponsored by Goldman Sachs and Lazard Brothers, will be used to reduce the group's Pounds 1.7bn debt. The company's four shareholders - Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times; Chargeurs, a French textile company; and UK media and catering group Granada - will benefit from the repayment of the Pounds 1.2bn portion of debt they have given or guaranteed. News, which provided roughly half the shareholder debt, should receive around Pounds 500m after the issue. None of the shareholders intends to sell any shares in the flotation. Indeed, Chargeurs plans to buy more shares to prevent dilution of its stake. Biocompatibles International, a research company moving into medical equipment manufacturing, issued its pathfinder prospectus on Wednesday. It is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 80m and is seeking up to Pounds 40m through the issue of new shares. The pathfinder, which shows that the company had accumulated losses of Pounds 9.77m at the end of June, warns that investment in the company involves a higher than normal degree of risk. Sponsor to the issue is Robert Fleming and the broker is Smith New Court. The pathfinder was also published for Churchill China, which intends to be the third Staffordshire-based china company to float this year. Hoare Govett is sponsor and broker. Despite investor nervousness about new issues, Servisair, the independent aircraft and passenger handling company, announced its flotation was fully underwritten at its target price, valuing the company at Pounds 54.3m. Calluna, a manufacturer of computer hard disks, announced plans yesterday to float on the Unlisted Securities Market through a Pounds 10m to Pounds 12m placing. Dealing began in Games Workshop on Thursday, the shares opening at 115p and closing at a 3p premium. Commodity trader ED&amp;F Man began trading yesterday, the shares closing down 8p at 172p.</p>

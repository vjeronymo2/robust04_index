			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadiness in bonds, firmer dollar lift Dow Wall Street A rally by US stocks carried over into a second session yesterday morning thanks to a steady bond market and a firmer dollar, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 24.60 higher at 3,800.43 as the market tested strong technical resistance at the 3,800 level. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.69 ahead at 466.20. Volume on the Big Board was relatively light, with only 163m shares exchanged by early afternoon. Advancing issues led declines by a five-to-four margin. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.71 at 446.99, while the Nasdaq composite added 1.56 to 749.54. The sustained advance by share prices was somewhat surprising given the absence of any market-moving fundamental developments. Indeed, the day's main economic news was unfavourable to those investors looking for evidence of continued growth in spite of the recent upturn in interest rates. The Commerce Department announced that factory orders of durable goods last month slumped 4.2 per cent, raising the eyebrows of most analysts, who had forecast a slight gain. But most of the decline stemmed from normal summertime shutdowns of automobile assembly plants and a big drop in the volatile aircraft sector. Thus, the significance of the headline figure was generally dismissed. Still, the data were enough to keep inflation-sensitive bonds in positive territory during the morning. The dollar, which posted decent gains against the yen and D-mark after stabilising the previous day, lent additional support to equities. Yesterday, investors could not rely on capital-goods issues to carry the rest of the market forward. The sector grew quiet after a strong outing the previous session, with the news on durable goods snuffing out any lingering enthusiasm generated by Deere's robust quarterly performance. Among the Dow industrials, two other cyclical stocks stepped to the fore. Alcoa advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 78 1/2 while International Paper added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 72 7/8 . On the negative side, IBM was set back Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 a day after announcing plan to slash prices on personal computers used by businesses. Blockbuster Entertainment was trading down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 26 3/8 after its board reaffirmed its approval of plans to merge with Viacom. The news pushed Viacom's 'A' shares Dollars 1 1/4 lower to Dollars 39. In retailing, Best Buy gained Dollars 2 to Dollars 33 3/8 on a 'strong buy' recommendation by Alex Brown &amp; Sons. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was marked down Dollars 2 to Dollars 67 1/8 . The firm reported a 46 per cent downturn in second-quarter profit after Tuesday's close. On the Nasdaq, Oracle climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 after Merrill Lynch raised its estimate of the company's fiscal 1995 net income. Amgen gave back Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 after appreciating Tuesday in anticipation of a imminent takeover in the biotechnology sector. At least two Wall Street securities houses downgraded the stock on the basis of its high price. Canada Toronto stocks soared in active trading boosted by sharp gains in mining and banking. The TSE 300 composite index rose 52.05, or 1.24 per cent, to 4,263.73 in volume of 73.69m shares valued at CDollars 1.04bn. In all, 12 of the 14 stock groups rose. Mining was up 3.64 per cent and banking 2.16 per cent,golds added 1.71 per cent and consumer products gained 1.47 per cent. Industrial products and energy stocks posted little change. American Barrick boosted its takeover offer for Lac Minerals to CDollars 5 plus 0.325 of a Barrick share, or 0.487 of a Barrick share, for each Lac share held. Lac's board recommended the revised offer. American Barrick fell CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 29 3/4 and Lac gained CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 14 1/4 . Mexico Mexican stocks rallied to close up 1.55 per cent on investor confidence after the presidential elections. The IPC index gained 42.69 to 2,798.22 in moderate volume. Venezuela Caracas closed slightly down with the market struggling to regain the upward tendency of the last few weeks. The Merinvest composite index closed 1.52 or 1.05 per cent lower at 142.98.</p>

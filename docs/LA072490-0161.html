			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> VAN GOGH SUICIDE TIED TO VERTIGO  </P> <P> Vincent Van Gogh was neither a lunatic nor an epileptic but suffered from a  common inner ear disorder that led the artist to cut off his ear and eventually  kill himself, medical experts said in a report published today.  </P> <P> They said the Dutch painter, who committed suicide 100 years ago this month at  the age of 37, had Meniere's syndrome, characterized by a painful ringing or  buzzing in the ear and vertigo -- attacks of disabling dizziness.  </P> <P> The report from the Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, Colo., was based on an  examination of medical records and Van Gogh's letters and was published in this  week's Journal of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> An examination of 796 of Van Gogh's personal letters "reveals a man constantly  in control of his reason and suffering from severe repeated attacks of  disabling vertigo, not a seizure disorder," the study said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA also proposes to eliminate the requirement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing &sect;618.8000(b)(4) that the bank annually review each service offered in the district. This change was also supported by the PPC work group and in the FRS petition. As discussed above, the FCA has concluded that the emphasis on accountability is at the institution level, and regularly reviewing an activity and reporting the results to the board should be a standard part of managing an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Section 618.8020_Feasibility Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1.12, 2.5, 2.12, and 3.7 of the Act authorize FCBs, ACBs, PCAs, ACAs, FLBAs, FLCAs and BCs, respectively, to offer related services. Each section specifies that there be a determination of feasibility before a related service is offered. The FCA believes that the ultimate accountability and responsibility in offering related services rests with the institution offering the service. Therefore, although the funding bank has a statutory role to determine that related services are feasible, each offering institution should document the feasibility of providing a related service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither the statute nor the existing regulation defines feasibility. Under the existing approval process for related service programs, a definition is not critical because the feasibility determination is centralized at the bank level and reviewed by the FCA in the prior approval process. However, the proposed rule moves to a post-review environment, which creates a need to specify the feasibility criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 618.8020 of the proposed regulation would enumerate minimum feasibility requirements. The FCA proposes that the feasibility analysis include support that a proposed related service is an FCA-authorized service. (If a proposed service is not authorized, the institution can request that it be authorized via the process outlined in &sect;618.8010(b).) The feasibility analysis would also include an overall cost/benefit analysis based on the evaluation of the market, pricing, competition, expected financial returns, operational risks, financial liability, and conflicts of interest. This would also include an analysis to show that the service is compatible with the offering institution's business plan and strategic goals. These requirements should not be interpreted as all-encompassing, and in many instances there will be other issues that will also need to be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Section 618.8025_Feasibility Reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2.5 of the Act authorizes a PCA to offer related services as determined feasible by the board of directors of the FCB. Section 2.12(15) of the Act authorizes an FLBA to offer related services that it determines, with FCB approval, are feasible. Therefore, the FCB has a statutory role in the determination of whether a related service program is feasible for an association to offer. Historically, the FCB has conducted reviews of each related service, at least annually, at both the bank and association level. Additionally, existing &sect;618.8000(a)(5) requires that the bank board annually determine the financial feasibility of its related service programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the preceding discussion of proposed &sect;618.8020, the FCA believes the determination of feasibility of a proposed program should ultimately be the responsibility of the offering institution. Nonetheless, the funding bank does have a statutory responsibility. Therefore, the FCA proposes in &sect;618.8025 to require the funding bank to verify that the association performed the feasibility analysis pursuant to &sect;618.8020. It would permit the funding bank to prevent the offering of the related service only if it determines that the feasibility analysis is inadequate or that the analysis fails to indicate that the program can be feasibly provided by the association. Any conclusion by the bank that the feasibility analysis is incomplete or fails to demonstrate the program's feasibility must be fully supported and communicated to the association in writing within 60 days of its submission to the bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA concludes that this approach creates the least amount of burden, maintains the funding bank's statutory role, supports the bank's ability to supervise its credit, and permits greater association autonomy. The FRS petitioners suggested making the bank's determination of feasibility automatic, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, for those proposed services that the FCA has authorized. The FCA does not agree that either the bank's or association's determination of feasibility should be automatic. The FCA's determination of whether a particular service should be authorized is fundamentally different from the determination of whether an individual service program is feasible for a given association. Moreover, the FCA does not accept the premise that the funding bank could fulfill its statutory role by making an automatic assumption of feasibility for those services that the FCA has already authorized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

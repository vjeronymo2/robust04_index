			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays suffers banking loss - Highlight was Pounds 122m profit in retail services A LOSS OF Pounds 414m in Barclays' UK banking operations in 1992, compared to a Pounds 68m profit the previous year, was the main factor underlying a Pounds 503m switch from profit to loss in Barclays' core banking division. The banking division, which has Pounds 98bn of Barclays' Pounds 149bn assets, fell to a Pounds 251m loss (Pounds 252m profit) despite raising its operating profit before provisions by 27 per cent partly because of widening loan margins and increased fees. A doubling of profits from Pounds 55m to Pounds 122m in the division's central retail services business, including its Barclaycard credit card operation, was a highlight amid either losses or poor levels of profits in other businesses. UK banking operations outside branches slipped to a Pounds 139m loss (Pounds 27m profit) because of a Pounds 154m rise to Pounds 181m in specific bad debt provisions on corporate lending. Much of this was due to five property-related borrowings. Losses in North America fell to Pounds 16m (Pounds 223m). Barclays Bank of New York, the retail bank sold in December, made a profit before disposal costs of Dollars 42m (Pounds 29.5m). Operations outside the US and Europe raised profits to Pounds 111m (Pounds 77m). Business in continental Europe fell to a Pounds 107m loss (Pounds 31m profit). There were 'very high' levels of bad debts in France and Germany. A loss of Pounds 98m (Pounds 3m profit) in France was caused by an Pounds 87m rise in provisions. The BZW investment banking division achieved a 13 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 241m (Pounds 214m) as assets rose to Pounds 44.7bn (Pounds 37.8bn). Volatile currency markets towards the end of the year pushed up foreign exchange income to Pounds 288m (Pounds 218m). Specific provisions for possible bad debts rose by 50 per cent in the UK to Pounds 1.96bn (Pounds 1.31bn). Those for other EC countries rose to Pounds 145m (Pounds 63m) while those for the US fell to Pounds 183m (Pounds 266m). Almost Pounds 600m of the specific UK bad debt charge was accounted for by 27 provisions of more than Pounds 5m, including one of Pounds 240m to cover lending to Imry, the property developer. The domestic interest margin - net interest income on assets - rose to 4 per cent (3.8 per cent). Domestic interest spread (the gap between interest paid on assets and received on liabilities) rose to 3 per cent (2.4 per cent). Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman, said the increase in interest margin 'reflects our determination to obtain a reward which is commensurate with our risk'. This was despite the bank passing on cuts in base rates to small business borrowers. Non-interest income rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 3bn (Pounds 2.7bn). Mr Buxton said it was 'misleading' to attribute this increase solely to higher fees in the UK because it was helped by progress in fee earnings businesses within BZW. After tax of Pounds 43m (Pounds 237,000), the group incurred an attributable loss of Pounds 343m (Pounds 242,000 profit). It paid out Pounds 243m in dividends (Pounds 338m) on a total dividend for the year of 15.15p (21.15p). The deficit for the year of Pounds 586m (Pounds 96m) weakened its tier 1 core capital ratio to 5.5 per cent (5.9 per cent) while the total capital ratio, including tier 2 capital, rose to 9.1 per cent (8.7 per cent). The bank sustained a losses per share of 21.4p (15.2p earnings). Net asset value per share fell 9 per cent to to 328p (359p). The shares fell by 10 per cent, closing down 41p at 392p. See Lex</p>

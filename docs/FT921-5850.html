			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Gt Portland sells Bride Hall stake GREAT Portland Estates, the property investment company, has sold its 50 per cent stake in Bride Hall, the developer and trader, in a complex deal. Great Portland is making a loss of Pounds 14m on the sale of its stake to a trust of Mr Danny Desmond, its partner in Bride Hall for an initial Pounds 500,000. As Great Portland is withdrawing from development for trading purposes it is treating the loss as an extraordinary item. Great Portland is also buying one of Bride Hall's properties in the Euston Road, which has just been valued at Pounds 22m, for its full acquisition and development cost of Pounds 29m. Great Portland will charge Pounds 700,000 of the loss to its trading profits for the year to March 31 1992 and will take Pounds 8m to its revaluation reserve. The 65,000 sq ft Euston Road building, one of the largest schemes in Bride Hall's portfolio, is pre-let to Gestetner Holdings. In 1987 Great Portland provided a guarantee to Barclays Bank for the project and agreed to make good any shortfall between the amount owed and the proceeds from the sale of the building, without recourse to Bride Hall. Great Portland is raising Pounds 30m by a further issue of 10 3/4 per cent First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2021 to finance further property investment and development. The company confirmed its intention to maintain its dividend.</p>

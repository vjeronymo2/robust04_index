			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Weimin: "Accolades and Alarms Over </F> Farmer-Run Mines"]    [Text] In the 1970s, farmers needing coal were permitted  to dig small pits beside large mines that had been monopolized  by the State for decades.    Since 1978 these farmer-run township mines have dug 4  billion  tons of coal, and Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua praises them for  playing an important role in easing the nation's energy shortage.    Continuous expansion has turned township mines into a mini-  industry employing more than 2 million farmers. Their annual  output has risen from 950,000 tons in 1978 to 472 million tons  last year, equal to that of key State-governed mines.    With their help, China's annual production of coal has  increased to 1.18 billion tons, compared with 618 million tons  in 1978.    But their lack of comprehensive planning and environmental  safeguards has created serious pollution and wasted resources.    As the mining sector has grown, so have the problems.    Latest statistics show that at least 3,700 people were  killed  in accidents in township mines last year, compared with 1,171 in  1978. Since 1984, 40,000 people have died in mine accidents.    In their pursuit of profits, the township mines have shown  little concern for the environment and have not made good use of  resources.    At some places, experts say, for each ton of coal that is  mined, 5 more tons of coal that is more difficult to recover are  left behind.    To ensure that township mines develop in a healthy way, the  Ministry of Coal Industry has proposed regulations and laws to  administer them more closely.    Drafts of the legislation have been submitted to the central  government for approval, Business Weekly was told last week.    Among other things, the drafts propose that a licensing  system be adopted and suggest how to bring order to the mines.  They also recommend procedures for reducing fatal accidents.    Late last month, the Ministry of Coal Industry organized a  four- day conference on the measures that drew officials from  the Ministry of Agriculture and leading government officials  from 13 provinces and autonomous regions.    Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, who participated, spoke highly of  the meeting and said the State Council supports efforts to boost  healthy development of township mining.    Only one similar conference has ever been organized and that  was in 1987, when township coal mining was just gaining momentum.    Coal Industry Minister Wang Senhao said the ministry will  beef up investment to renovate equipment in township mines.    Wang also urged small mines to unite and co-operate within  the rules of a market economy.    The minister promised help from State scientific research  institutes, training centres and technical service enterprises.    Wang said the ministry will make comprehensive plans for the  industry's long-term development. For instance, a hundred  counties with heavy concentrations of township mines will have  priority in receiving financial help in the next seven years.    In the meantime, the ministry hopes that by 1996 a market-  oriented legal system will be adopted to bring order to the  industry.</p>

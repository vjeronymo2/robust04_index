			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule is consistent with, and builds upon, the Agency's final Public Participation Policy, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 46 FR 5740, January 19, 1981. This policy established a uniform set of guidelines concerning public participation in all EPA programs. The guidelines encouraged EPA programs to provide a consistent level of public involvement during EPA activities, including State and local activities funded or delegated by EPA. The 1981 policy embodied many public comments on improving the process and outlined new steps that the Agency should take to ensure that members of the public are given earlier and better opportunities to be involved in EPA decision-making. Among other things, the policy emphasized public access to information as a critical component to successful public participation programs, and encouraged the use of a variety of outreach activities throughout the permit process so that the public can be kept up to date on matters of concern. Today's rule builds upon these policy statements and, in many cases, strengthens them through proposed regulatory language. For example, EPA is proposing regulatory requirements to provide the public with the opportunity to attend a public meeting at the outset of the permitting process. Additional public notices, including improved notification activities, are required at new points within the permit process. These proposed notices will provide information to the public at the beginning of decision-making processes so that the public will have adequate time to respond. Finally, today's rule adopts the ideas suggested by the policy on ``depositories'' and incorporates them into a flexible tool called the information ``repository.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a separate effort, the Agency is reviewing its regulations that impose restrictions on siting RCRA hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). The Agency's current regulations impose restrictions on siting these facilities in flood plains and seismic zones. EPA believes that there may be a need for enhanced national minimum standards as required under section 3004(o)(7) of RCRA. Consistent with Executive Order 12898 on environmental justice, EPA is reviewing existing and potential standards for siting hazardous waste TSDFs. As a part of this review, the Agency intends to look at siting TSDFs in proximity to populations and institutions such as schools, hospitals, and prisons, to determine whether there is a need to consider (and the appropriate way to do so) such factors in siting these facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conducting the review, EPA will recognize the appropriate role of State and local governments in land use planning and facility siting. EPA does not intend to preempt this role. Rather, it is EPA's intention to review the current procedures and requirements to identify whether any additional measures are necessary to protect human health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Structure of proposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In expanding the public involvement activities within the permit process, EPA proposes to place these requirements within 40 CFR parts 124 and 270. EPA placed the general requirements for public participation within Part 124 Subpart B_Specific Procedures Applicable to RCRA Permits. Subpart B is an already established section, which does not contain any regulations at this time. EPA proposes to place public involvement requirements within Subpart B to ensure a clear and orderly integration of new RCRA permitting requirements into part 124. Please note that other sections of this rule will address additional public involvement requirements during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trial burn phase within part 270. The flow chart shown in Figure 1 indicates the points in the permitting process where the proposed additions to public involvement activities would occur.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d639 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEP02JN94.002 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

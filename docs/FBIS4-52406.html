			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unpardonable Treacherous Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets  at "a unification and security policy coordinating meeting"  charged the North with "delaying the settlement of the nuclear  issue" and claimed that "sanctions of the UN Security Council  are inevitable" and that "the international cooperation system  should be strengthened to redouble pressure on the North."    This is criticized by NODONG SINMUN today as an unpardonable  treacherous act.    The news analyst says:    We decided to allow inspectors of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) to be present at the forthcoming  replacement of fuel rod at the five-megawatt experimental  nuclear power station and promptly issued entry visas to the  five inspectors designated by the IAEA.    This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat has not sent  inspectors to the DPRK, raising an unreasonable demand. This is  motivated by its sinister political scheme ignoring the unique  status of the DPRK.    If the South Korean authorities truly want a solution to the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula for the sake of the  nation, they must reject the unreasonable demand of the IAEA  Secretariat and do things helpful to the creation of an  opportunity to find a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue.  But, they are now anxious to do harm to fellow countrymen in  conspiracy with outside forces. What anti-communist fanatics  they are. Outcries for "sanctions" against fellow countrymen  can be let out only by foolish traitors.    It must not be overlooked that at the meeting the puppets  recklessly tried to decry the North-proposed peace negotiations  with the United States for the establishment of a new peace  arrangement that will take the place of the present armistice  mechanism.    By imprudently vilifying the North-proposed peace  negotiations, the puppets, who are neither a signatory to the  armistice agreement nor have the military prerogative, further  revealed their dislike of the establishment of a new peace  arrangement and their sinister intention for division and  confrontation.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROFESSOR DENIES OFFERING A'S FOR RAFFLE-TICKET SALES  </P> <P> A former Cal State Northridge professor who is appealing his dismissal by the  university denied Tuesday that he offered students A grades in exchange for  selling raffle tickets to benefit a foundation that he ran.  </P> <P> Eleazu S. Obinna testified at a state Personnel Board hearing at the university  that he encouraged students to sell raffle tickets during the spring semester,  but "I did not discuss sales for a grade."  </P> <P> Obinna was fired for allegedly offering his students A grades for selling $100  worth of raffle tickets on behalf of the United Crusade Foundation, which  Obinna founded in 1982. He will continue to draw his salary until his appeal is  concluded.  </P> <P> Obinna, a 17-year tenured professor in the Pan-African studies department,  testified that the allegations might have come from a female student who was  distraught about her breakup with Obinna's son.  </P> <P> Obinna added that he had angered the former school administrator who initiated  the investigation by criticizing him a year earlier in letters to CSUN  President James Cleary and California State University Chancellor W. Ann  Reynolds.  </P> <P> Obinna, who holds a doctoral degree from UCLA, said that the 82 students  enrolled in his upper-division field studies course were required to attend  field trips, perform 45 hours of community service and write a term paper.  </P> <P> Earlier, four students had testified that they were told that the only work  required in the course was to sell raffle tickets.  </P> <P> Obinna said the university failed to follow its own guidelines by announcing in  a press release last April that he was being fired for his part in the alleged  grade-selling scheme. Obinna said he first learned of his pending dismissal  from television and newspaper reports.  </P> <P> Former instructor Willie Bellamy was also fired for allegedly telling his  students that they could earn A grades by selling raffle tickets. The raffle  was subsequently canceled and the money has been held in trust pending its  return to ticket buyers, Obinna said.  </P> <P> The raffle money was to have been used to create a community center in Pacoima  to assist black residents, Obinna said.  </P> <P> The hearing before Administrative Law Judge Byron Berry is expected to conclude  today. No decision is expected for at least two months, Berry said.  </P></p>

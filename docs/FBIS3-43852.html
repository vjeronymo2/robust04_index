			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Luanda-based sources have reported that the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA-PT] is preparing to launch an important military offensive  on various fronts with the aim of inflicting military defeats on  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA.  Those sources say that the MPLA-PT media have been stepping up  their propaganda campaign, reporting alleged UNITA attacks on  all Angolan provinces and suggesting that the Lusaka peace talks  are about to break down, thereby psychologically preparing the  Angolan people and the international community for its  offensive. [passage omitted]    Sources in Luanda say that many tonnes of war materiel are  arriving daily in Luanda Harbor and Luanda Airport. Most of  that war materiel is highly sophisticated and comes mainly from  former Eastern Bloc countries, notably the Russian Federation  which is, ironically, one of the Angolan peace process observers  attending the Lusaka talks. Other countries supplying war  materiel to Luanda are Brazil and Spain. Furthermore, Angolan  reporter Aguiar dos Santos has reported that new consignments of  sophisticated military equipment are constantly arriving at  Catumbela Airport. Such equipment includes 6,000 Brazilian-made  X-40 and X-60 missiles, for which the MPLA-PT recently paid $160  million.    Diplomatic figures in Luanda have said that the secrecy UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has imposed on the  Lusaka peace talks has been of great assistance to the MPLA-PT's  propaganda campaign and that the United Nations should demand  that the MPLA-PT behaves in a manner compatible with the peace  talks currently under way. [passage omitted]    A source in the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FALA] General Staff told the Voice of the Resistance of the  Black Cockerel yesterday that the loss of the city of Soyo by  the MPLA-PT had left that party's ruling class without financial  mobility and deprived the Defense Ministry of the benefits it  used to enjoy, ranging from the acquisition of weapons at any  price to a lack of control over logistics-related spending.  That FALA General Staff source further noted that, contrary to  what [Petroleum Minister] Albino Maria Assis had tried to have  the Angolan people believe, oil exploitation in Soyo has already  reached 120,000 barrels per day. Albino Assis had said that Soyo  produced only 40,000 barrels per day. Should Mr. Assis' claims  prove to be true, then the other 80,000 barrels were being  diverted to labyrinthine power structures that must still be  identified, including the Ministry of State Security, Minse, and  the Directorate of Intelligence and Security of Angola, DISA,  which used to have a powerful presence in Soyo.    That source also disclosed that a daily 40,000 barrels of  oil  were taken from the offshore [preceding word in English], while  80,000 barrels were extracted from land oil fields.    Vorgan promises to present evidence concerning the [words  indistinct].</p>

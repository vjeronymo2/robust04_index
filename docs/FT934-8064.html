			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bryanston creditors can expect 40p in the Pounds CREDITORS to Bryanston, the insurance company in provisional liquidation, can expect to receive to receive up to 40p in the pound, according to proposals circulated yesterday. Accounts for the year to December 31 1992 show that there are assets of Pounds 86m against liabilities estimated at Pounds 216m. The provisional liquidators at accountants Price Waterhouse suggest this will lead to a pay out of 30p to 40p. The details appear in documents distributed to creditors as part of a proposed scheme of arrangement under English insolvency law. Bryanston, and its sister company Trinity, entered provisional liquidation in March last year. A scheme of arrangement for Trinity was proposed earlier this year. Actuarial estimates put gross reserves - allowing for substantial future liabilities including legal claims in the US courts on pollution and asbestosis - at Pounds 194m. The document has been circulated to nearly 10,000 creditors identified by the liquidators. They will vote on the proposals in January.</p>

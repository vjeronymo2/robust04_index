			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Art of 'Higher Woollage' Secret Museums: Gauguin and M. Vaquez Montalban; Goya and Paul Nizon; James Ensor and Paul West; Alberto Giacometti and Tahar Ben Jelloun; El Greco and Fernando Arrabal; Georges de La Tour and Pascal Quignard. 80pp, Pounds 13.99. Flohic editions. Distributed by Serpent's Tail. THE AIM of this on-going series of books (at present they are being published in batches of three) is to bring together writers and artists  - living masters of the pen (novelists, playwrights, journalists) and past masters of the brush and the chisel. The writers have been invited to sit back and savour works of art; to reflect upon them; and to give us the fruits of their meditations. Self evidently, the result promises to be unusual, even a little unpredictable, because the task itself is an unusual one. It will be part reverie, part biography, and part formal art criticism; a mixture, perhaps, of poeme en prose and hard scholarship. This cocktail could prove very stimulating, of course; and the publishers have been quick to make a virtue of the method itself in the handsome publicity material that accompanies the first batches of books in the series. They use such words as 'magical', 'other worldly' and even 'emotion of knowledge' as they endeavour to anticipate the likely impact of the texts upon their readers. The matter of design is given a special emphasis by the publishers, too. Each spread, for example, consists of text on the left-hand page (beautifully printed against a background tint of beige as if it were a page from a novel) and a colour plate on the right. This fosters the illusion that the text - a 'book-within-a-book' is how the publishers describe it - has the coherence, the importance and the well-crafted unity of a good novel, and that it will indeed 'permit the reader to advance . . . in these two worlds of the fictional and the artistic'. The titles are also very good value for money: Pounds 13.99 for a book that contains more than 30 large colour plates (made possible, one imagines, by the massive co-edition print run in five languages); they are handsomely produced; the quality of the colour reproductions themselves is above average. So far so good. Everything seems handsome, admirable and courageous - until we come to read the actual translations of the texts written by this roll call of international literary celebrities. And then the niggling doubts begin to creep in. Was the idea of reverie, with all that that word has come to connote of the quasi-mystical wedding of intellect, subjectivity and the unconscious mind, quite enough? Was the publisher's original brief no more than that? Were the authors even given a brief? Or was the fact that they were who they were a sufficient qualification for such a task as this one? For the fact is that the texts are often a disgrace. At worst, they are slipshod and almost incoherent - what Dylan Thomas once described as 'the higher Woollage'. Let me quote one example, from Vasquez Montalban's essay on the painter Gauguin. Opposite the plate of Nature Morte a la Mandoline, we read as follows: 'My attempt to recapture Gauguin (in poems written during the 1960s) was neither onerous nor particularly far-sighted. The aim in the 60s was to achieve a democratic cultural and political order that was universal, decentralising and anti-authoritarian, the left challenged the dialectic fatalism (or contradiction) which forces mankind to pass by way of slavery feudalism and capitalism to reach socialism and repeated mention was made of the Asiatic mode of production giving rise to another potential emancipation process peculiar to a third world which has not undergone the industrial and liberal revolutions . . .' Did anyone read this statement before or after it had been translated into some sort of pidgin English? Did anyone find it interesting, stimulating, intellectually provocative - or relevant in any way whatsoever to an understanding of Gauguin and his work? Did anyone enquire after the meaning of that enigmatic phrase 'Asiatic mode of production?' Did anyone care? Or did the printer perhaps lose the text of the original and substitute for it a fragment from some unpublishable Marxist sociology manual of c1972? There are many examples of untreated verbiage of this kind throughout the series, but let that one suffice. Who is to blame for such bad writing? So much slipshod editing? So many verbal infelicities? So many awkward turns of phrase? The authors themselves? The translators? Were these translations checked and approved by the English distributors of these books before the co-edition presses rolled? And how can books which purport to take art seriously allow Tintoretto to be described as Tintorello] Did the great Venetian belong to the opera buffa after all? Was it the higher harlequinade that he was striving to represent on the great, coffered ceiling of the Scuola San Rocco? Molesworth needs to No.</p>

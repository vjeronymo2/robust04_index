			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Murdoch pays off former editor of Sunday Times Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times for a decade, yesterday severed most of his links with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in a pay-off reported to be in the region of Pounds 1m. Mr Neil, 45, has turned down the offer of a nightly US TV show after Mr Murdoch's Fox Television network axed his planned weekly current affairs programme. He will now concentrate on a freelance broadcasting and writing career, including a book about his years as TheSunday Times' editor. Mr Neil said yesterday: 'It's not divorce, it's an amicable separation.' He denied a rift with Mr Murdoch although he admitted his stint in Los Angeles had left him 'frustrated'. Asked to confirm the Pounds 1m pay-off, Mr Neil said: 'It's not far off.' Mr Murdoch described Mr Neil's contribution to The Sunday Times as 'immense in every respect of its success'. Mr Neil will still write The Sunday Times leader column and will be retained as a special correspondent for Fox TV when he steps down on December 31. He has returned from Los Angeles to prepare for a new BBC2 parliamentary programme, The Midnight Hour, which starts on Wednesday. Mr Neil is one of four presenters who will work on the four-times-a-week show. Explaining why he turned down Mr Murdoch's offer of a nightly TV show, Mr Neil stressed: 'I said I didn't want to spend the next six months doing a show that again doesn't get on the air. 'I made it clear I was very disappointed he hadn't stayed with his original instinct which was to go for the weekly show. I feel he almost regrets that.' Mr Neil said the problem was that there were too many Fox executives interfering and they came from entertainment rather than news backgrounds. 'Although it's disappointing that the weekly show in the end never got off the ground, the past seven months have been a mixture of the best paid sabbatical and seminar I have ever had,' he said. His immediate plans included moving temporarily to his new home in the south of France to concentrate on the Sunday Times book.</p>

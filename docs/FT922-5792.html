			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie retreats to close below 2,700 WORRIES about the prospect of more casualties in the commercial property market, the lingering and depressing effect of Tuesday's poor trade figures, and a clutch of cautious statements from company chairmen proved too much for share prices on the London market. Additionally weakened by the effects of a poorly performing Footsie future, and falls for Wall Street and Tokyo overnight, the FT-SE Index fell early in the session before staging a comeback towards the close, when Wall Street began to improve in response to a firm showing by the dollar and US Treasury bonds. The Footsie ended the day 6.0 down at 2,698.6, the first time it has closed below 2,700 since May 15, when international markets were rocked by news that Olympia &amp; York, owner and developer of Canary Wharf, had sought insolvency protection in Canada. Share prices were given harsh treatment by marketmakers at the start of the session, responding to a sharp decline in the June Footsie future, which moved to a discount against fair value and prompted hefty selling of the underlying stocks by index arbitrageurs.

The increased activity was attributed to a burst of programme trading, with at least three trades being executed during the day. The biggest of these, a mixed programme estimated by dealers to have been valued well in excess of Pounds 100m, was said to have been operated around lunchtime by one of the big UK integrated securities houses. A number of specialists were satisfied at the market's performance, against the underlying backdrop. 'I am very impressed at its resilience, given that the futures' weakness would have put plenty of stock into the market; we have come through in good shape,' said one. Others were not so convinced, pointing to the disappointing building society lending statistics released yesterday, which indicated that the economy remains depressed. Institutions were said to have been looking hard at good quality defensive stocks, such as food retailers. Oil shares continued to gain ground, led by Lasmo, the Footsie's best individual performer. County NatWest carried out a big placing of stock in United Friendly, the life assurer. Mr Trevor Laugharne, equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, adopted a cautious line in the broking firm's latest UK Action Weekly: 'Without a sizeable piece of news (bid, quality rights issue) to move it one way or the other, the general lacklustre feeling could translate into very low volumes and a gently falling trend over the next account.'</p>

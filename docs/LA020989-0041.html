			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD CLINCHES CROWN WITH 10TH CONSECUTIVE WIN, 72-53  </P> <P> Dana Jones turned in a command performance and North Hollywood High followed  his lead to a 72-53 victory over Reseda that clinched the Mid-Valley League  boys' basketball title for the Huskies on Wednesday at North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Jones, a junior center, recorded game-high totals of 22 points, 14 rebounds and  seven blocked shots as North Hollywood (14-4, 9-0 in league play) won its 10th  game in a row and clinched its third consecutive league title. The Huskies  shared the East Valley League title last season with Grant after winning it  outright the previous season.  </P> <P> North Hollywood led, 13-10, after one quarter, then outscored Reseda, 25-12, in  the second period to pull away. The Huskies made 11 of 16 shots during the  quarter and Jones scored 10 of his 15 first-half points.  </P> <P> Ed Davis and Harry Marks (three three-points baskets) had 14 and 13 points,  respectively, for North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Coley Kyman scored 19 points and grabbed eight rebounds for Reseda (8-10, 6-3).  </P> <P> Grant 85, Poly 47 -- Powered by a tenacious defense and a sharp-shooting  offense, Grant clinched the East Valley League title at home.  </P> <P> The victory was the eighth in a row for Grant (16-3, 8-1).  </P> <P> Grant blew the game open in the second quarter, outscoring Poly, 18-4, and  holding the Parrots without a field goal in the period. For the game, the  Lancers made 60.3% of their field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> Scott Cooper scored a game-high 18 points for Poly (10-9, 5-4).  </P> <P> Birmingham 79, Sylmar 58 -- Glenn Sucich had 17 points, 16 rebounds, four  assists and five steals for Birmingham in an East Valley League game.  </P> <P> The win, coupled with Poly's loss to Grant, kept alive Birmingham's (8-11, 4-5)  playoff hopes.

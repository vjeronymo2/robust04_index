			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WORLD CUP SKIING CHAMPION TAMARA MCKINNEY, 28, RETIRES  </P> <P> Tamara McKinney, winner of more World Cup Alpine ski races than any other  American, announced her retirement today from competitive racing.  </P> <P> McKinney, 28, a 13-year veteran of the U.S. Ski Team, will become official  spokesperson for Jimmie Heuga's Mazda Ski Express, a charity ski series which  raises money to fight multiple sclerosis.  </P> <P> Her retirement was not unexpected. Injuries have dogged McKinney for the past  three seasons. She suffered a broken left leg and cartilage damage to her left  knee in a fall during giant-slalom training in Switzerland Oct. 18, 1989,  missing the entire World Cup season that year. Her slow recovery figured to  keep her sidelined again this season.  </P> <P> But McKinney, who also missed most of the 1987-88 season with a broken left  ankle, said the latest injury wasn't a factor in her decision. "Even before  that injury I had decided that last year would be my final season," she said at  a press conference. " . . . It's time to move on."  </P> <P> McKinney won 18 World Cup races, more than any other U.S. skier. She competed  in three Olympics and won gold and bronze medals in the 1989 World  Championships in Vail, Colo.  </P></p>

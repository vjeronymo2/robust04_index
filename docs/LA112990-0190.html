			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CAPSULES;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL LEAGUE  </P> <P> Burbank  </P> <P> COACH: Fred Cook, 2nd season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 3-21; 6th in league, 2-8  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Cook believes that the team has prospered from summer league  -- the Bulldogs went 20-18 -- saying the team is almost two months ahead of  schedule in relation to last season's team. However, center Tyler Smith  (6-foot-3) is the only player taller than 6-1. Mike Palaski (5-10), Jon Warner  (6-0) and Hyung Chun (5-8) are returning starters. Warner will be the primary  ballhandler and can score from inside and outside. "We're going to spread it  out and make people come out and guard us," Cook said. "We're all  interchangeable and everybody can play any position." Burbank might go as deep  as 10 players in its rotation. Also expected to be part of the rotation are  Shawn Williams (6-1), Fuzzy Clocki (5-11), David Ranney (5-11), Steve Rutoske  (6-0), Ken Malous (6-1) and Henry Gandi (5-10).  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "We don't have a power game," Cook said. "We need to force turnovers  and get help on the boards underneath. Our defense and speed will be the key.  It'll be an interesting up-tempo game."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burroughs  </P> <P> COACH: Ira Sollod, 4th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 18-7; 1st in league, 10-0  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Burroughs is the two-time defending Foothill League champion  but only two players with varsity experience return. Forward Mike Rossiter  (6-6), who averaged seven points a game, and guard Victor Hernandez (5-11) were  used sparingly as juniors. Rossiter has developed into one of the team's better  outside shooters, Sollod said. Chris Suarez (5-7) will join Hernandez in the  backcourt and Nate Asamere (6-1) and Rick Mulloy (6-5) will fill the remaining  forward and center positions. Burroughs will emphasize speed to force turnovers  in an up-tempo game.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Sollod tabs Burroughs, along with Alhambra and Hart, as the favorites  for the league title. However, the replacement of graduated point guard Marnie  Calderon, the league MVP last season and a three-year starter, looms as  Sollod's primary concern. "He ran the show," Sollod said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hart  </P> <P> COACH: Greg Herrick, 4th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 18-8; tied for 2nd in league, 7-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Hart made 154 three-point shots last season, but Herrick will  be emphasizing a different three-point play this season. "We have tremendous  talent on the front line," Herrick said. "Our focus will be on the inside and  we will be getting fouled and going to the free-throw line. We're starting a  new statistical category." Seniors Marty Downen (6-5) and Keith Halcovich (6-5)  return at forwards with junior Ali Peek (6-4, 230 pounds), the junior varsity  MVP, at center. As juniors, Downen averaged 12.5 points and 7.5 rebounds and  Halcovich averaged 8.6 rebounds and 1.4 steals. Senior guards Doug Rich (6-0)  and Tony Valenzuela (6-2) round out the starting five. Hart averaged more than  80 points a game last season and Herrick feels that this squad can equal that.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "Our guards are suspect," Herrick said, "but we have so much talent I  could play guard and we would still win. Our early schedule is brutal and the  media will keep us down on their list because of our record, but I think we're  as good as anyone in the Valley."  </P></p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: New peak as futures continue to lead shares - Market Report Another volatile trading session in the London stock market yesterday left market indices at new peaks, with interest rate optimism undimmed by the Bundesbank's decision to leave key German rates unchanged. The FT-SE 100 Index closed decisively above the 3,300 mark and volume was high as basket trading between equities and stock index futures increased ahead of the expiry this morning of the December contract on the Footsie. The market closed just below the day's best, with the FT-SE 100-Share Index 32.4 ahead at 3,311.2, having established a new intraday peak of 3.313.6 earlier. Spreading confidence across the range of the stock market pushed the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up by 42.6 to 3,674.1. Activity among the Footsie Mid 250 stocks indicates the presence of the private investor; these stocks are less affected by futures-related business than the Footsie 100. Further evidence of economic recovery in the UK came in the form of a larger fall than expected in UK unemployment in November. Expectations of cuts in UK base rates early in the New Year remained solid, with analysts unperturbed by the Bundesbank's unchanged stance at yesterday's meeting. Reductions in interest rates throughout Europe are still confidently expected. The most significant factor, however, was the pressure from the stock index futures market. At least five programme trades crossed the trading screens as the big futures players covered positions in futures, where both the December and March contracts on the Footsie are now in full cry. Traders are rolling positions over into the March contract. Those marketmakers lacking positions to arbitrage between the two markets found themselves victims of the programme trades which intensified the squeeze in the blue chip stocks to near unbearable proportions. Seaq volume jumped to 923m shares from Wednesday's 753m and heavy trading losses were suffered by some marketmaking houses. The market's mood was shown at the opening, with the first official reading on the Footsie showing a gain of 15 points on overnight, as London concentrated on its own futures sector and ignored the overnight setback on Wall Street. From that time on, traders kept their eyes on the futures premium and the net gain on the Footsie hovered around 30 points for most of the session. At the close, London again ignored Wall Street which edged ahead by 7 Dow points in UK hours. Utility stocks again responded strongly to the higher dividend payments from the sector. Among the interest related issues, consumer stocks did well but stores remained heavily overshadowed by conflicting reports on the progress of the all-important Christmas selling season. Firmness in sterling in the wake of the UK unemployment figures gave no help to the overseas earning stocks but this was counterbalanced by the presence of most of these blue chip stocks in the Footsie 100 Index list which placed them among the futures-related basket trades. Some traders began to ask yesterday whether the London market was becoming overbought. The futures settlement is likely to dominate the stock market this morning but once this is out of the way, share prices will have little else to lead them until after the Christmas-New Year break.</p>

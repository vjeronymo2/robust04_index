			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese bid-rigging helps US case - Robert Thomson reports on political interference in public works contracts WHEN Japanese prosecutors unearthed evidence that construction companies ranked politicians according to influence, beginning with A+ for the very powerful and down to D for those hardly worth cultivating, they probably helped the cause of foreign contractors in the Japanese market. The investigation into political corruption has confirmed foreign allegations of bid-rigging and political interference in awarding public works contracts. It has also prompted debate about reform of both the building industry and the political system. In the past few days, 17 of the country's largest contractors have been raided by prosecutors searching for evidence in a tax evasion case against Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather of the governing Liberal Democratic party. But their success in highlighting collusion in the industry will force the Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body, to take tougher action. For the US government, the prosecutors have furnished much useful information about the 'synergy' between politicians and contractors, with the former providing the latter with contracts, and the latter donating to the former a small percentage of a contract's value. The US has negotiated with Japan for the past decade in the hope of making the contract process more transparent, and had suspected that politicians were a 'structural impediment' to a free market. But raising the suspicions during formal negotiations was impossible without causing offence. Now, damning material gathered by prosecutors is leaked each day to the Japanese press, and the difficulties faced by foreign contractors have been put in a new context. Prosecutors say that politicians simply rang the appropriate government authority to ensure that contracts were awarded to a company which was close to the LDP. President Bill Clinton will be briefed on construction market access, and he is expected to raise the issue during a meeting next month in Washington with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. The two sides are yet to settle a dispute over technical standards, and the US wants additions to the list of 34 projects for which bidding procedures have been simplified for foreign companies. In response to the emerging scandal, Mr Miyazawa told parliament yesterday that the 'time has come for the government to be more open in awarding public works contracts', and that bureaucrats will be instructed to tighten controls over decision-making. Mr Miyazawa's statement came after a former Construction Ministry official confessed that he was responsible for deciding on a contract during the 1980s, and received a phone call from a senior politician who said Company A should win because 'it has studied the project carefully'. Company A did win, the official said, because of the politician's call, but the public reason for its selection was given as 'technical know-how'. While not all contracts are awarded unfairly, unsuccessful foreign bidders are often said to lack 'technical know-how'. The Ministry of Construction, which has represented Japan at the negotiations with the US, lamented the damage done to the image of the construction industry: 'We have really been making an effort to ensure transparency and fair competition, and we have tried to meet international standards.' Some curious details about the contract process have emerged in Mr Kanemaru's home prefecture of Yamanashi, where an association of local contractors referred to Y1m (Pounds 5,800) kickbacks as manju, a very sweet Japanese cake, while a 'coffee charge' of Y20,000 or Y30,000 was paid by bidders on decision day. Mr Kanemaru is still thought of fondly in his home prefecture, where a recently-build bridge is known as 'Shin's bridge' and a highway has been dubbed 'Shin's way'. But there is widespread anger in Japan that a percentage of the cost of public works contracts was a donation to the LDP. Apart from skewering politicians, the prosecutors have shown that dango or cartels routinely decide which company will win a contract and the price. US negotiators argue dango deny foreign contractors a fair chance, but Japanese companies still say the system gives small companies a decent share of public contracts. A manager at a large contractor raided this week said that 'Americans don't really understand our system', which is based on the principle of 'mutual benefit'.</p>

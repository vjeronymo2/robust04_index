			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Touche attacks ICAEW audit role TOUCHE ROSS, the account-ancy firm, launched an outspoken attack on its professional body yesterday by calling for regulation of auditors to be shifted to an independent organisation. Mr Roger Stafford, the new chairman of the board of partners at the firm, said supervision of auditors should be wrested from the control of Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. 'We take a strong line that audit regulation should be independent,' he said. 'I don't think it can be done any other way. It ought to be divorced from the institute and separated for the sake of public confidence.' His comments represent a rare public attack on the institute, in which a number of Touche partners hold senior positions. But they are consistent with the firm's statements over the past few years. In an article published last week in the firm's annual review, Mr John Roques, managing partner, calls for a single independent body to supervise accounting and auditing to be established rapidly. He says he supports audit regulation by the institute only 'as an interim measure', and argues that greater independence is required to increase public confidence and improve efficiency. The views echo recent growing criticism from accountants and politicians that there is tension between the institute's roles as a trade association and a body required to uphold professional standards in the public interest. The institute is responsible for the regulation of auditors under a framework of self-regulation established late last year under Mr John Redwood, then minister for corporate affairs. All accountants wanting to perform mandatory audits on British companies must now be registered with the institute, and are subject to inspection by a network of staff around the country. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, chief executive of the institute, said last night: 'We believe we have a mandate from parliament and our members to regulate auditing. Regulation is a natural extension of the role we have always fulfilled.' He said any assessment of the effectiveness of the institute's audit regulation processes should await a full evaluation to be submitted to the DTI in 1993.</p>

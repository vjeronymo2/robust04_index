			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Canada's PWA halts payments to lenders PWA, parent of Canada's second-biggest airline, has halted payments to lenders and has sent teams as far as Tokyo to try to sell a full restructuring plan. PWA said its fully-owned Canadian Airlines International would continue to operate as usual and travellers would not be affected. Operating suppliers and trade accounts would continue to be paid, as would fuel taxes and its 17,000 employees. Canadian is in a battle for survival with its rival, Air Canada. The two carriers are losing about CDollars 2m (USDollars 1.6m) a day between them. 'We are confident creditors will see the advantages of our plan,' said Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman. 'We will emerge a stronger and more effective global competitor'. PWA has received a CDollars 50m federal loan guarantee following Ottawa's acquisition of three Airbus 310 aircraft from Canadian Airlines. Executive pay has been cut 20 per cent, fares raised by 5 per cent, and nearly CDollars 15m in annual interest costs have been saved through conversion of debt to equity. American Airlines, itself going through a round of lay-offs, earlier offered to buy 25 per cent of PWA for CDollars 246m if Canadian switched to its Sabre reservations system. However, a statement from PWA made no mention of an equity deal. 'We will soon announce details of the partnership with American, a significant marketing alliance,' it said. Under revised bankruptcy laws, PWA has six months to win agreement from its banks, led by the Royal Bank of Canada, and other creditors for the restructuring. PWA's total debt is estimated at nearly CDollars 3bn, including CDollars 350m lease obligations for aircraft. Three western provinces have been asked for CDollars 100m in loan guarantees. American Airlines has laid off 286 managers and 290 others will leave voluntarily as part of a Dollars 300m cost-cutting plan announced last month, Reuter reports from Dallas.</p>

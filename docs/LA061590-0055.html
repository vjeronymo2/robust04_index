Sununu has accepted an invitation to go to  Moscow to help Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev organize his office, a  spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> Sununu already has been offering advice, meeting this week with a delegation of  visiting Soviet officials who are interested in how the White House works.  </P> <P> President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Sununu was invited by a  member of the group to visit Moscow and has accepted. The date of his trip has  not been set.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Sununu will advise Gorbachev on organizational matters related  to the executive office of the President. Gorbachev was elected to the new post  of president this year, in addition to his position as general secretary of the  Communist Party.  </P> <P> "I think that they would like him to come to the Soviet Union to take a look at  their ideas and their plans and see if he has any advice," Fitzwater said.  </P></p>

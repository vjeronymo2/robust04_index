			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Takeover sweetens the holding - The Taveners deal sees the investment up by 24.6% in six months IN THE autumn Quarterly Review, I selected shares in the sweet manufacturers, Taveners, for the portfolio. I believed that this small company had take-over potential, because it had attractive products, produced reasonable profits, and already had a shareholder, Finnish confectionery group Karl Fazer, with a 29.89 per cent stake in the company. The portfolio bought 3,500 Taveners shares, paying 70p each. In February, Taveners announced an agreed takeover by Toms Fabrikker, a Danish chocolate and confectionery group. The portfolio accepted the takeover terms of 165p per share. In addition, Taveners paid a special dividend of 6p per share. Thus, an investment costing Pounds 2,450 in October produced cash of Pounds 5,985 in March. What is especially nice about accepting a cash takeover bid is that shares can be disposed of without incurring any dealing charges. Together with accrued interest on its earlier cash holding in the Britannia Building Society, this brings the portfolio's cash holdings to Pounds 7,514. This means the portfolio is up a very healthy 24.6 per cent in six months. There is a tremendous temptation, when holding so much cash and having made a modest stock market 'killing', immediately to plunge back into the market and hope to repeat the performance of the Taveners investment. However, the portfolio's other main investment - shares in Gestetner, also bought in October last year - serves as a sharp warning that what goes up can also go dramatically down. In these uncertain times for world stock markets, cash does have some advantages. The portfolio will continue to hold its Gestetner shares, although it will now set a limit at which the shares will be sold. If Gestetner shares fall below 90p and look as if they will fall further, then the portfolio will cut its losses and dispose of them. If Gestetner then continues its share price slide, the portfolio might consider buying back the shares if they were to fall within the 60p to 65p range. Taking a five-year view, I still feel that Gestetner should be a reasonable investment, although recent profits performance has been poor. For example, for the year to October 31, 1991, pre-tax profits fell by 57 per cent, from Pounds 52.1m to Pounds 22.5m. However, the year-end gearing, counting its outstanding loan stock as debt, was sharply reduced from 96 per cent to 26 per cent. The company has also shed more than 1,000 employees, about one-tenth of its workforce. It is also worth remembering that Ricoh, the Japanese office-equipment and camera-maker, bought a 24.2 per cent stake in Gestetner in September last year, paying 250p per share. Ricoh's own business has been suffering recently. It has fallen into losses for the first time since it was listed in 1949. In March, it was reported that Mr Hiroshi Hamada, Ricoh's president, had ordered all Ricoh directors to 'have a resignation letter in your shirt pocket' every day at work, as a reminder that the resignations could be accepted at any time if the company's performance did not improve. It seems likely, therefore, that, if Gestetner does not improve its profits, too, the Japanese may urge some strong action. Or perhaps they might sell their stake in Gestetner to another possible predator or increase their stake to gain control. In any event, Gestetner remains an interesting, if risky, speculation. It has a worldwide spread of interests, and, if the pound were ever devalued (or 'realigned within the ERM'), this could help to boost the company's overseas sales and profits. Ricoh is one of the official sponsors of this year's Olympic games, and will be receiving considerable publicity as a result. One hopes that this will translate into increased demand for its products and extra business for Gestetner, which distributes Ricoh products in certain territories. One company that will be receiving a lot of free publicity for its products during the summer Olympics is Pentland Group. Speedo swimwear has been worn by more gold-medal winners than any other swimwear brand. It ought, therefore, to be prominent at this year's Olympics and worldwide television coverage of attractive bodies competing in Speedo costumes ought to increase brand recognition and sales. Pentland bought various Speedo interests in 1990, and has since significantly increased them with Speedo operations around the world. In addition, Pentland owns 20 per cent of the famous sportswear company Adidas, which also ought to benefit from Olympic publicity. But Speedo and Adidas products are not just bought by sports people - they have an even wider appeal as fashion products. Pentland had net cash of Pounds 273m (equal to 75p per share) at December 31, 1991, mainly due to its disposal of its remaining interest in the Reebok sports shoe company. Pentland is, therefore, well poised to ride out any continuing recession and pick up any 'forced sales' or other bargains of companies whose products it can develop and promote. The portfolio will, therefore, purchase 3,500 shares in Pentland at 99p per share. My wife and I have held Pentland shares in our personal equity plans since June 1990, when we purchased the shares for 75p each. And my personal pension scheme took advantage of a drop in Pentland share price in August 1990, to buy shares at 62p each. I took a long-term view with these purchases, looking for capital growth over the years. The portfolio will continue to hold cash, ready to take advantage of any suitable buying opportunities that may appear, due to continuing unsettled markets. For example, Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments company, would have considerable attractions if its share price fell back to around the 285p level, bearing in mind that its 1991 low was 293p and its 1991 peak was 515p. If Fisons did fall to the 285p level - and looked as if it would not fall much further - then the portfolio would buy 800 Fison shares in the hope of a turnaround in profits or a takeover bid. The company has announced a stream of bad news this year, but has all the bad news been discovered and released - or is there more to come? It is worth playing safe and waiting to see what happens in the next few months. Of course, the share price may not fall much further, and the portfolio may miss being able to buy at its preferred price; but, in the current uncertain economic climate, I feel it is better to err on the side of caution.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE POUNDS 10,000 PORTFOLIO STANDS AFTER SIX MONTHS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Number      Purchase                  March 25   March 25 Company      of shares   price (p)  Cost (pounds)    price (p)   value                                                                (pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gestetner      1,500        183        2,745           99        1,485 Pentland       3,500         99        3,465           99        3,465 SHARES SOLD:                                     Sale price:   Proceeds: Taveners       3,500         70        2,450          171*       5,985 Existing cash++                                                  4,994 Cash from dealings                                               2,520 New cash total                                                   7,514  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                                                           12,464  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Includes 6p cash dividend. ++ Cash includes accured interest in Britannia Building Society's Capital Trust account.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / County Hall hotel proposal approved LAMBETH Council has approved a planning application by Shirayama Corporation of Japan to turn County Hall, the former headquarters of the Greater London Council, into a hotel. Lambeth's planning committee gave permission subject to further consideration later this month of the community benefits the developer will provide. The developer plans to convert the main building, which is across the River Thames from the Houses of Parliament, into a 600-bed hotel with conference and leisure facilities. Shirayama says it will keep all the historic rooms intact and 'brought back to their original splendour'. There will be a chapel and a health club in the basement and a 24-hour public restaurant on the riverside terrace. The council was advised to accept the planning application for several reasons, including the need for high-quality hotel accommodation in London and the employment potential.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS/GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> RIVALS OUTLINE PROPOSALS ON AIDS, DRUG ABUSE;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN: DEMOCRAT VOWS TO ACCELERATE CAMPAIGN AGAINST ACQUIRED IMMUNE  DEFICIENCY SYNDROME AND TO SEEK MORE HELP FOR VICTIMS.  </P> <P> Recalling that she served as mayor of San Francisco when AIDS first emerged as  a "so-called gay cancer" in 1981, Dianne Feinstein visited a hospice Thursday  where AIDS victims go to die and pledged an accelerated state campaign against  the disease if she is elected governor.  </P> <P> "I was there at the beginning and I hope I'm there at the end," the Democratic  nominee told male AIDS victims while touring the 25-bed Chris Brownlie Hospice  near Dodger Stadium. It is the largest such facility in the nation that is  qualified to receive federal and state aid under the Medicaid program.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, the Republican Feinstein hopes to succeed, has been  virtually silent on AIDS, Feinstein said. "I will take a dramatically different  approach."  </P> <P> She outlined a program that included speeding up the certification of AIDS  drugs, preventing discrimination against victims, assuring insurance coverage  and reorganizing the state's AIDS programs. Feinstein said she would reactivate  a state AIDS commission and have it report directly to her. Each of  California's 58 counties would be required to develop a plan for dealing with  AIDS.  </P> <P> In a separate Los Angeles appearance, Sen. Pete Wilson, Feinstein's Republican  opponent, told reporters he would favor "the kind of funding and research that  we have been involved in." He also singled out the need for accelerated testing  of AIDS drugs.  </P> <P> Feinstein said that much could be done by an activist governor without spending  additional money, but if more funds were required, she would get them.  </P> <P> "When I do that budget I'm going to see that AIDS is treated as the No. 1  health emergency and that the state is prepared to accept a leadership role,"  she said. "If that takes moremoney, I'm not going to be shy. I'm going to find  ways of getting it."  </P> <P> During her tour, Feinstein chatted quietly with several patients in a sunny  sitting room, shaking hands with each as she moved along. One man confined to a  wheelchair and who spoke with difficulty continued to grip her hand tightly --  apparently without realizing it -- as she was summoned to visit the second  floor. After several seconds of gentle tugging, Feinstein carefully extracted  her right hand from his grip. She then gave his hand a final squeeze of  apparent reassurance before walking away.  </P> <P> Later, in a statement to reporters, Feinstein thanked the facility staff for  the work it does: "Perhaps for any one of God's children, it's the biggest  test, I think, of the belief in humanity and compassion and the ability to  sustain that humanity and compassion over a long period of time without what  they call burnout." She also talked of the "courage and tenacity" of the  patients.  </P> <P> Before she left, one patient invited Feinstein to pay a return visit after "you  get elected."  </P> <P> "Oh sure," she said.  </P> <P> "And you're going to run for President one day?" he asked.  </P> <P> "No, I don't think that," she replied.  </P> <P> "Why not?"  </P> <P> "I'm going to be old and tired a lot sooner than that, I think."  </P> <P> Feinstein said she first heard of AIDS when, as mayor, leaders of the gay  community "came to me and told me about the terrifying and strange rumors of a  so-called gay cancer." Her administration quickly came up with $187,000 to  investigate the reports, she said, the first public health funding for AIDS in  the world.  </P> <P> More Californians have died of AIDS than were killed in the Korean and Vietnam  wars, she said. She added that it would be a mistake for anyone to think the  virus is limited just to gay males and those who live in cities, or to think  that the disease is static. Growing numbers of women and children are  contracting AIDS, and no corner of California is safe from the disease,  Feinstein said.  </P> <P> When prodded for sources of new state revenue, Feinstein said she would be  willing to increase income taxes on the wealthy if necessary. She said that  most of the tax-reduction benefits in California in recent years have gone to  couples with more than a combined income of $200,000 -- a group that includes  herself and financier husband Richard Blum. If an income-tax boost was  necessary, she said it should shift more of the burden back on the rich but not  increase the taxes in lower brackets.  </P> <P> Wilson has refused to rule out the possible need for a tax increase, but said  this week he would oppose any change in income-tax rates.  </P></p>

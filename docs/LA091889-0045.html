			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> NUDGE FOR PCBS DEGRADATION  </P> <P> Environmental scientists at the General Electric Co. reported that they have  found a way to speed up the degradation of highly toxic polychlorinated  biphenyls (PCBs) by naturally occurring bacteria that live in the Hudson River  and other waterways. PCBs were once widely used in capacitors, electrical  transformers, inks, lubricants and other products until their manufacture and  use was banned by the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1979.  </P> <P> Industrial effluents from GE's manufacture of PCBs heavily contaminated the  Hudson River in New York, and both GE and the Environmental Protection Agency  have been searching for ways to clean up the river. Chemist Daniel A.  Abramowicz of GE's Research and Development Center in Schenectady reported that  researchers could double the rate at which bacteria from Hudson River sediments  degrade the PCBs by the simple expedient of giving them a nutrient medium  containing nitrogen, phosphorus and trace metals.  </P> <P> By varying the relative concentrations of the nutrients and trace metals,  Abramowicz said, the bacteria can be targeted against any one of the 209  different PCBs. The researchers hope to begin tests in the river sometime in  1991.  </P></p>

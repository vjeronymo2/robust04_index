			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Crown Prince Hasan by Mira Avrekh at the </F> royal palace in Amman; date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Avrekh] You have never  given an interview to an Israeli journalist. Why now?    [Hasan] During the Madrid conference, a meeting with an  Israeli journalist might have been construed as an attempt to  intervene in the peace process. Therefore, everything was done  through official spokesmen. But now, after the White House  meeting between Clinton, Peres, and myself, I believe it is  important to present our points of view and concepts.    I must note that something annoyed me, and I will take this  opportunity to clarify it. I am referring to the report  published in the newsletter issued by BIPAC (the pro-Israeli  lobby in Britain). It quoted -- in a very imprecise way -- a  conversation I had with the editor of the Lebanese newspaper  AL-SAFIR and created the impression that I had said that the  meeting with Peres in Washington had been "forced" on me.    I have already sent Peres a message on that via Grenville  Janner (a leader of British Jewry). That story harmed the  Washington meeting, which took place in an atmosphere of mutual  respect. It was also another reason why I thought it right to  meet with an Israeli journalist now.    [Avrekh] The assumption in Israel has always been that  Jordan would be the first -- or at least the second -- Arab  state to sign a peace treaty with Israel. For years, there were  meetings between Israelis and Jordanians, and you made sure the  border remained quiet. Do you foresee an Israeli-Jordanian  peace accord in 1994?    [Hasan] Definitely. I would like to stress that Jordan was,  in fact, first. Already in the 1930's, my grandfather, King  'Abdallah, offered the Jews autonomy. At that time, as is  known, the State of Israel had not yet been established, and  that idea could have served as a framework for coexistence. In  fact, my grandfather paid with his life for his beliefs.    Jordan adopted a long list of initiatives. There is a  lengthy history of meetings between senior Israelis and  Jordanians. In my view, the question is why we did not manage  to make progress on basic security issues for 25 years. It is  our impression that Israel finds it hard to agree openly and  publicly to final recognition of its borders with Jordan.    In fact, this is quite a marginal issue compared with the  territorial problem with Syria or the demand for withdrawal from  Lebanese territory. Israel apparently fears creating a  precedent. But we, for our part, aspire to the principle of  implementing sovereignty on our borders, and I am referring to  the borders from the time of the British Mandate. If we manage  to define sovereignty within the concept of borders, then we  will be able to make progress on water and refugee issues.    I would like to stress that the peace we want is a "warm  peace." Therefore, for instance, we welcomed the Declaration of  Principles between Israel and the PLO because it broke the  "taboo." The very act of shaking hands was important, but what  has still not been done, and must now be done, is to insert that  agreement of principles into an overall peace framework.    It is clear that statesmen on both sides are trying to  create  "windows" to peace. But if we do not have a vision of a  peaceful region, it will be very hard to achieve peace in the  most important areas. The water problem cannot be solved  through bilateral meetings. The human problem cannot be solved  by making Jordan a "garbage dump" in order to solve the  demographic problems of the region.    We therefore welcomed the good news of the Clinton-al-Asad  meeting; we welcomed the good news of the talks between the  Palestinians and the Israelis. But we must ask ourselves: Will  it lead us to a "warm peace?"    [Avrekh] You talk about returning to the mandatory  borders, but in negotiations both parties have to give up  something. Can we reach peace this way?    [Hasan] In Jordan's case, there is a clear, simple line  which starts in the Jordan Valley, runs through the center of  the Jordan River, and continues up to the Red Sea. Therefore,  we are not talking about the demarcation of new borders, but  rather of recognizing a principle -- even if this recognition  has not yet been made public. This must be done in the  framework of the bilateral talks.    I would like to explain that I am not bringing up this  problem as part of an attempt to raise obstacles or sabotage the  process. This issue is important to our people. People will  say, as you mentioned earlier, that for 20 years our countries  have been neither at peace nor at war. Jordan, for of its own  security considerations, was committed to preventing  infiltrations across its western border. People will ask what  Jordan received in return for this?    American visitors come and tell us: We want open meetings  between Jordanians and Israelis. I say: Instead of holding  public meetings on tourism or on economic issues, which we are  doing anyway at the Washington and Paris talks, we must meet on  the issue of sovereignty. This will let us leave the problems  of border demarcation behind and let us move on to discuss the  rational use of our resources.    [Avrekh] How will the Palestinians fit in here?    [Hasan] At the moment, I am talking about the sovereign  affairs of the State of Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan. This  especially pertains to the southern part of the 'Arava valley.  For example, if one seeks to promote the idea of a canal  between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, or develop the  Elat-al-'Aqabah free trade zone concept, then the current  situation, in which soldiers stop potential investors at the  cease fire lines because it is a security area, is  inconceivable. Therefore, a resolution of this problem will  constitute a breakthrough.    [Avrekh] Do you see the possibility of establishing a joint  airport between al-'Aqabah and Elat? The 1986 London Agreement  (between King Husayn and Shim'on Peres) spoke of granting Jordan  access to a Mediterranean port. Do you believe that progress  toward implementing these ideas can be made in 1994?    [Hasan] This once more brings us back to our starting point  -- the border question. After all, if one talks about an  airport, one is also dealing with civilian airspace zones and so  forth. This is also true with regard to ports. Thus, if we  satisfactorily resolve of the problem of sovereignty, we can  make progress toward effectively treating other problems.    [Avrekh] The London Agreement got off to a promising start,  but suddenly got "stuck." What exactly happened there?    [Hasan] I believe there were different interpretations:  There was former Secretary of State Shultz' interpretation,  Peres' interpretation, and perhaps also our own interpretation.  But eventually what happened was that Peres, foreign minister  at the time, went back to the Israeli Government with proposals  which were based on the agreement. The government had just  changed, and Shamir had assumed the premiership. The London  Agreement did not head the government's list of priorities and  it was "frozen." Shultz, for his part, was too slow in  presenting the issue.    We can also go back to 1974. At the time we had some  agreements of a limited nature which were reached after the Yom  Kippur War. The possibility of a partial withdrawal to the lines  of the "Alon Plan" [plan by former Labor party minister calling  for territorial compromise with Israel retaining control of  strategic areas] was discussed. There was also an idea, raised  in 1972, for a Jordanian-Israeli confederation. Ultimately,  none of this was implemented.    As for the 1986 plan, it is important to stress that we  presented a development plan for the occupied territories. It  is reasonable to assume that this plan would have prevented a  great many of the manifestations of extremism you have been  forced to live with since 1988. The plan, however, was rejected  and Israel viewed it as a Jordanian attempt to intervene in the  affairs of the occupied territories.    [Avrekh] Were the issues of water and economy, that you  mentioned before, discussed by King Husayn and Shim'on Peres in  Amman approximately two months ago?    [Hasan, laughing] I will put it this way: Yes, these issues  were raised in the framework of the continuous contacts with Mr.  Peres.    [Avrekh] When, in your opinion, will Israelis be able to  visit Petra? You must know that this has always been the dream  of many Israeli youths.    [Hasan] The question of tourism and reciprocal visits is  very important and has to be discussed in the framework of the  peace process. The issue of tourism must be resolved in the  framework of bilateral agreements between our two states.  [passage omitted]    [Avrekh] How would you describe Jordan's involvement in the  peace process between the Palestinians and Israel?    [Hasan] First of all, one must remember that Jordan granted  the Palestinians shelter -- and, on the other hand, benefited  from their contribution during three demographic waves in 1948,  1967, and 1991 (when Kuwait and other Gulf states expelled  Palestinians to Jordan).    As for the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, it  focuses on the 1967 refugees. The pre-1967 refugees, or in  other words those from 1948, are asking: What do we gain from  this declaration?    This clearly is an emotionally charged problem. We must make  people understand that peace offers something for everyone, for  every human being. This cannot be explained in a one-sided  fashion. You, for example, have a concept calling for the  ingathering of the diaspora, of bringing Jews to Israel from  various, diverse, communities around the world. In addition,  the State of Israel also has a demographic problem. We, when  talking about a comprehensive peace, the water problem....  [pauses] For example, we have to deal with the matter of water  consumers in disputed areas.    In my opinion, most people realize this. They understand  that peace is indeed an effective panacea, as long as peace is  established throughout the entire region. This is the reason we  stress the need for a comprehensive peace.    [Avrekh] What do you expect to be achieved at the meeting  between King Husayn and President Clinton in Washington?  Generally speaking, what is the present state of relations  between Jordan and the United States?    [Hasan] Following the developments of the past three years  and Operation Desert Storm, many questions about Jordan's role  and positions were aired. However, I believe that there is  growing recognition for the active role Jordan plays for the  United States; something between Israel as a strategic asset and  the strategic value of the oil wells.    In order to fulfill such a difficult role -- the  "Finlandization" of Jordan, if that is the way it can be  described (with reference to the important role played by  neutral Finland during the Cold War) -- one must understand the  kind of conditions required to guarantee stability in Jordan.  Stability and security are a comprehensive and all encompassing  concept.    I am also speaking in terms of "hard" security, which common  to Jordan and other countries in the region: The military's  role in deterring terrorism, preventing infiltrations by radical  elements, drug interdiction, stopping weapons sales, and even  preventing money laundering.    There are also problems of "soft" security. I am referring  to problems connected with economic and social progress. I  would like to see more efforts to redress inequality. Only  recently has the American press begun to write about a situation  in which the average per capita income for a Palestinian is  $800, as compared to $15,000 for Israelis or for residents of  the Gulf states.    These problems, which are closely linked to a person's  ability to live with dignity, must be resolved in the framework  of the peace process.    As for the meeting between King Husayn and President Clinton  -- I think it must lead to practical steps. For example, in my  meeting today with a congressional delegation, we discussed the  establishment of a Middle East free trade zone, something  similar to NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) in our  region. We spoke of cooperating in the establishment of a  Middle East development bank.    As I said before, agreement on the issue of sovereignty and  border demarcation is a prerequisite for all this. Afterwards,  we can start work on resolving the water problem, on developing  the region's human potential, and on effecting the economic  integration of the region to bring us into the 21st century.    [Avrekh] With your permission, I would like to return to  the Clinton-al-Asad summit. In your opinion, has al-Asad  changed because the USSR collapsed and he now needs the United  States, or because he realized with time, that war, or a state  of war and no peace, will lead him nowhere?    [Hasan] It is a combination of the things you mentioned.  The bipolar world we knew when the USSR existed is gone. That  means that new regional definitions and characteristics must  grow now. We have to recognize that we must redefine the Middle  East as a "region."    Almost every part of the world is defined as a region,  while,  though called this, the Middle East has so far been a collection  of individual countries that have not operated on a regional  basis. The international community has bilateral contacts with  the various countries, not with the region as such.    In 1975, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan signed an agreement for  economic cooperation with Europe. Israel and Lebanon signed a  similar agreement. I am certain that it benefited Israel much  more than it did the Arab countries. I believe that Damascus  feels, just as we feel here in Amman, that it would be very  difficult to compete with other regions if we do not define the  Middle East as a region. For example, South Africa, where peace  has also been made now, is seeking international investments and  the world's attention.    It would be very difficult to go on talking in the sterile  context of individual Arab capitals or "lonesome Israel."  Indeed, I am certain that the time has come to redefine  Southwest Asia, or the eastern Mediterranean shores. I believe  these views certainly exist in, and are expressed by Damascus.    Naturally, in order to make this aspiration come true, the  parties involved should be given incentives -- and not only  negative ones. President Nixon once told me that in order to  attain peace, you have to "pressure" each of the parties a  little. Well, Jordan has been "pressured" enough... (laughing).    [Avrekh] What do you see as the solution to the security  problems of the Middle East by the year 2000?    [Hasan] I believe in the concept of a Middle East conference  on security cooperation. As will be recalled, this was done in  Europe with success. We must identify and define our enemies,  and I speak of common enemies such as terrorism, which is a  clear case, or drugs. In this case, we may certainly speak of  regional cooperation.    At the same time, if we are stuck with dealing with the old  "skeletons" of the previous conflicts, it would be very hard to  produce movement or flexibility toward an agreement to reduce  the size of the military establishments in the region.    Incidentally, I believe that on this matter we pay too much  attention to American research institutes such as Brookings,  Enterprise, or Carnegie. What do we, the residents of the  region, contribute to the vision of our regional security? This  issue was raised in my discussion with President Clinton and  Minister Peres.    [Avrekh] How do you view the ups and downs of the  Israel-Palestinian negotiations? What do you think of 'Arafat's  conduct?    [Hasan] To a certain extent, the problems stem from the  manner in which the agreement of principles was made -- the  secrecy of the Oslo talks. Still, as we have said several times  before, it is essential to move on from Oslo and the Washington  handshake to the practical things required to make the autonomy  materialize.    [Avrekh] What are the implications of the PLO-Jordan  economic agreement on economic relations between Israel and the  West Bank?    [Hasan] It is obvious that the central banks of Israel and  Jordan share a common interest in promoting an economic entity  that could mediate between the various Palestinian territories.  Naturally, we would like to see international, as well as Arab,  investments in the territories through existing apparatuses.  Obviously, the Palestinians want to establish a development  bank, but I would like it to be established in a regional  framework. In the end, it is up to the Palestinians to decide  on how to solve the practical problems.    [Avrekh] What is your view of economic cooperation between  Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians by the year 2000?    [Hasan] Well, in 1970, an Israeli research institute  presented an "assignment of duties" between Israel, Egypt, and  Jordan. The basic idea was that the Arab countries will provide  the manpower, while Israel provides the technology. I believe  that such strict assignment of duties is not required. I would  like to see the Middle East as the European coast of Asia, and  the Asian coast of Europe.    [Avrekh] Could you point at a date when a peace accord will  be signed between Israel and Jordan?    [Hasan] I have already mentioned that we need "warm peace."  I hope that 1994 will be the year of crossing the threshold to  such peace. Whether this crossing of threshold will include the  signing a peace contract, depends on the creativity and honesty  of the parties.    [Avrekh] But you believe it is possible?    [Hasan] We live in the Middle East, so we have to believe in  miracles....</p>

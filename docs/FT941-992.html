			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Oil price collapse warning as Opec maintains output Oil markets will give their verdict today on Opec's decision at the weekend not to cut output despite warnings that failure to do so could trigger a further price collapse. Delegates from the 12 member states of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries conceded that the decision to extend the present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day for the remainder of the year could lead to lower prices, especially in the next three months, traditionally the weakest period for oil demand. But they brushed aside warnings by Opec's secretariat at their Geneva meeting that prices could fall to single digits unless a cut of 1m barrels a day or more was made. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend closed at Dollars 13.91 a barrel on Friday. The ministers justified their decision by citing forecasts indicating that much higher demand will materialise by the end of the year. Analysts generally welcomed the rollover of the ceiling. They said Opec's decision to suspend the practice of setting quarterly supply levels in favour of the nine-month ceiling removed uncertainty from the market. Most also agreed that demand could be sharply higher in the fourth quarter. 'The market needs a cut to push prices up,' said Mr Mohammed Abduljabbar, economist with the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company. An Opec official, however, described it as 'damage control'. An attempt to orchestrate a co-ordinated cut with eight non-Opec producers collapsed when Saudi Arabia, Opec's dominant member accounting for a third of total output, refused to participate. Saudi Arabia is reluctant to accept any reduction in its 8m barrels a day quota, citing the fact that it agreed to a freeze at that level last year when most other Opec quotas were raised. It also feared that any price gain from a sizeable cut could be eroded by some Opec members cheating on their quota, a perennial issue within the organisation. Officials say Opec ministers now realise that the present pricing policy based on supply management is insufficient. A study of various options, including the possible adoption of fixed or minimum prices, is to be presented at Opec's June meeting. Opec's heavyweight controls the ring, Page 2</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Craxi Ordered To Stand Trial"] </F>   [Excerpt] (ANSA) Milan, May 12 -- Former Socialist Party  secretary and ex-premier Bettino Craxi has been ordered to stand  trial for his role in the fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco  Ambrosiano and for the kickbacks the bank paid into the party's  so- called "protection account" in Switzerland.    Also on trial will be Craxi's ex-right hand and former  justice minister Claudio Martelli; the head of the outlawed  secret free mason P-2 lodge Licio Gelli; the former vice  chairman of the state fuels group ENI [National Hydrocarbons  Corporation], Leonardo Di Donna; and architect Silvano Larini.    All face charges of fraudulent bankruptcy in connection with  the collapse, in the early 1980s, of the Banco Ambrosiano of the  late Roberto Calvi and for the latter's 20 billion dollar  financing of the Socialist Party through a Swiss bank. The  trial is slated to open June 16.    The court here has also ordered that the passports of those  indicted be confiscated. The confiscation of Craxi's passport  had already been ordered earlier in the day, while Martelli's  passport was confiscated last week, and Gelli has not had a  passport for years.    The decision was branded by Craxi as being "persecutory" and  he claimed he was being unfairly discriminated against through  being treated differently than the others.    The former premier, and close friend of the current  government chief, Silvio Berlusconi, went on to accuse  magistrates of conduct which was "discriminatory, politically  exploiting and morally odious".    The action taken against him, Craxi argued, was not based  "on  any reason nor any convincing justification. Against every  action which is of only a persecutory nature I intend to  continue to defend myself. I will do it not only for myself but  also to ensure that the balanced and correct use of judicial  power represent a civilized barrier for all". [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali Sunday  [16 January] met with Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz  for talks on Jordanian-Iraqi relations, officials said.    Diplomatic sources said Mr. 'Aziz, who arrived here  Saturday,  was seeking Jordanian intervention with Washington to end the  international sanctions imposed against his country following  its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.    No official comment was available on the al-Majali-'Aziz  talks, which were attended by other ministers. Officials who  spoke on condition of anonymity said the meeting covered a broad  review of Jordanian-Iraqi relations.    But according to the diplomatic sources, Mr. 'Aziz wanted to  request Jordan to raise the issue of the sanctions during the  Jan. 21 meeting at the White House between His Majesty King  Husayn and President Bill Clinton.    "Iraq has met all the requirements of the U.N. resolutions"  related to the Gulf war ceasefire in March and April 1991, and,  "as such, Iraq believes that the sanctions should be removed as  soon as possible," said a diplomatic sources.    "It is a straight-forward move and Mr. 'Aziz's talks in  Amman  come in the context of the international efforts exerted by Iraq  to end the sanctions," added the source. There was no immediate  word on how Jordan was responding to the Iraqi request.    Dr. al-Majali and Royal Court Chief Sharif Zayd Bin Shakir  as  well as several other members of the Cabinet are expected to  leave for Washington Tuesday to join King Husayn in his meeting  with President Clinton.    Jordan has repeatedly invited international attention to the  suffering of the Iraqi people, particularly children and the  elderly, who are net victims of the sanctions, which have  deprived the country of external revenues to pay for its  people's needs.    The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold a periodic  review of the sanctions on Tuesday, but it is not expected to  lift the embargo for at least another six months--a period that  U.N. sanctions enforcement officials say is needed to ensure  that long-term monitoring of Iraqi weapon development programme  is in place.    Mr. 'Aziz was originally scheduled to be in New York for  consultations with Security Council members this week, but the  plans appeared to have been called off.    Instead, Iraq is focusing on facilitating the mission of  U.N.  weapon experts' mission in its soil with a view to securing a  clean certificate in February or early March to be presented to  the Security Council with a request that the sanctions be lifted  at the next round of the review of the embargo.    Mr. 'Aziz's talks with Dr. al-Majali followed the renewal of  an agreement under which Iraq supplies Jordan's oil needs. The  Iraqi News Agency (INA) said Saturday that the agreement, signed  by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Walid 'Asfur and  Iraqi Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad, covered a broad range of  cooperation in the oil industry. No Jordanian confirmation of  the INA report was available.  <H5>  Grid-link talks </H5>   Dr. 'Asfur, who began a visit to Baghdad last week, is also  attending a meeting with the energy ministers of Iraq, Egypt and  Turkey on cooperation in electricity generation and supply.    The meeting, which began in the Iraqi capital on Saturday,  is  expected to produce technical agreements that will pave the way  for linking the power grids of the four countries at a cost of  $450 million.    The meeting is expected to produce technical agreements that  will enable the four countries working in earnest on a $450  million project. [sentence as published]    The five countries signed cooperation protocols in Amman  last  year to push ahead with the project, which will not violate U.N.  sanctions as it is not expected to be implemented in Iraq until  the end of the decade.    Zaki 'Awdah, Syria's electricity chief, said funding was not  a problem as Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social  Development and the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank had  pledged to finance the project.    Hasan Mahmud Sa'id, Egypt's electricity under-secretary,  said  energy ministers of the five countries planned to meet in Egypt  in April to put the last touches to the mutual agreements.    He said Egypt and Jordan were already working on linking up  their two countries' power networks. He said he hoped the  agreements would be fully implemented by 1997.    The project's economic viability is based on an estimated $2  to $3 billion savings in annual electricity generation costs  after its expected inauguration in 1998.</p>

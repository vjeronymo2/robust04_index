			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tung Chin-fa (5516 0530 4099): </F> "Different Views in the Mainland Toward Tax Assignment System"]    [Text] Editor's note: China started implementing the tax  assignment system this year which has attracted international  notice. Mainland China specialists have different views toward  this new system. This magazine elaborates below how their views  differ for references of our readers. [end editor note]  <H5>  Two Different Views </H5>   A majority of those attending the meeting to discuss this  issue considered that the tax assignment system came about  because of needs in two areas: first, the need to remedy defects  of the former fiscal system of partial tax revenue payments; and  second, the need of a socialist market-based economic system to  establish a large unified market system within China. Some  considered the former fiscal system of partial payments to be  unstable, inequitable and lacking in standard or transparency,  that the system has a major defect in the regional monopoly  created which seriously affects structural adjustment of  state-owned enterprises and adversely affects development of a  major unified market system within the country. The former  system also caused decline in central government revenue  receipts, and created national deficits which endanger  investments in the country's key projects. In addition,  implementation of the former system was far from equitable and  contributed to further widening of the gap between rich and poor  provinces, adversely affecting the national goal of bringing  common prosperity to all areas. Some attendees in the meeting  pointed out that the former system of partial payments had over  decentralized power. As compared to the original centralized  fiscal system of revenues and expenditures, the partial payments  system decentralized fiscal authority to promote efficiency in  resource allocation, but when the system was over-decentralized,  it led to the provinces staking out their own turfs for  administrative control, blocking effective allocation of  resources and producing another kind of inefficiency. Attendees  in the meeting also pointed out that one of the objectives of a  socialist market-based economic system is to realize effective  resource allocation within a national framework, which means  that a unified market system should be established within this  framework, and that the government fiscal system should not be  an obstacle to effective allocation of resources; the tax  assignment system is therefore designed to meet the objective  requirements of a new fiscal system.    Some attendees in the meeting, however, considered that the  necessities for establishing the current tax assignment system  are not self-evident, and cited the following reasons: 1) The  result achieved in over ten years of reform is precisely  decentralization of authority and sharing of benefits, but the  tax assignment system requires reverting fiscal authority once  again to the Central Government which would possibly be  disadvantageous for regional and local developments; 2) the tax  assignment system in a technical sense cannot yet be implemented  because from the beginning of reform to the present, different  sources and kinds of taxes have evolved and changed in the  absence of a stable and standardized taxation system; therefore,  given current conditions, now is not the right time to put the  tax assignment system into effect and that the right time may  not come for a number of years; 3) the division of  responsibilities and authorities between the Center and the  regions is not clearly delineated at this point, and it would be  difficult to divide fiscal authority in a scientific and  reasonable manner while the limits on the authority over revenue  receipts and expenditures are still evolving; 4) the result of  implementing the tax assignment system under current conditions  may very well produce a situation of "hitting the son for losing  an argument with the father," which adversely affects regional  economic growth since provincial, municipal and lower level  governments, faced with a fiscal crisis, may well turn to  raising taxes on enterprises.  <H5>  Different Justifications for the Tax Assignment System </H5>   In explaining the tax assignment system, a majority of  attendees felt that it should be a system of fiscal  responsibility differentiated by level of authority, and that it  should involve not only tax assignment but also separate  systems. But the law setting up the tax assignment system shows  there are different views: some people felt that it should be a  system of separate fiscal authorities focused on assignment of  taxes; others felt that it should be a system of fiscal  management differentiated by level of authority with tax  assignment as the foundation; and still others simply thought  that there are problems in the system itself, and calling it a  system of assignment of taxes is calling for separation of  authority, and if the system means that fiscal authority is  differentiated by level of authority, then one should first make  clear who has the authority for expenditures before deciding who  should be responsible for revenue collection. And it would be  more in line with reality if the reform is defined as a system  of fiscal or budgeting authority differentiated by level of  authority.    Some of the attendees were ingenious by explaining the tax  assignment system in terms of a "triangular system" with  separate components of taxes, authority and mechanism; they  pointed out that tax assignment is the precondition, that  separation of authority is the crux and that separation in the  operating mechanism is a guarantee; they emphasized therefore  that the tax assignment system should be carried out on the  basis of these three elements.  <H5>  Nature of the Separation of Fiscal Authority </H5>   With respect to the nature of the tax assignment system, the  attendees proceeded to discuss whether the separation of fiscal  authority in the tax assignment system means separation of  administrative authority or separation in more meaningful  economic terms. Some attendees felt that the prerequisite of the  system is that administrative authorities and enterprise  responsibilities should be separated, and that lacking such a  precondition, any kind of separation of fiscal authority means  only some form of administrative authority. But under the tax  assignment system, separation of fiscal authority should be made  in more meaningful economic terms. At present, the reform of the  production authority system in state-owned enterprises will  determine the basic characteristics of fiscal authority  separation in the tax assignment system, and only when results  of the above-mentioned reform give assurance that government  administrative authority and enterprise responsibility are  completely separated can fiscal authority separation be truly  justified in economic terms.    The attendees felt that in implementing any reform of the  tax  assignment system, China should follow international practices  as much as possible, and draw upon experiences in dealing with  such an issue by other countries with modern market-based  economies.  <H5>  International Customary Practices in Tax Assignment </H5> System    Some attendees felt that in drawing on international  experiences, the following aspects are most important: First,  whether the country is large or small, a federated or unitary  state, a developed or developing country, international  experiences demonstrate that a central government must  effectively control the most important sources of revenues in  the national economy, and this is not only reflected in the laws  and policies governing revenue collection, but also manifested  in administrative management and collection of tax revenue;  second, for government at every level, revenue receipts must be  adequate to enable government carry out its responsibility for  expenditures; third, the central government's authority for and  ability to effective carry out macroeconomic coordination should  be assured; fourth, any system of fiscal relationships devised  by government should be conducive to development of a unified  market system within the national borders and promotion of  effective allocation of resources; fifth, in terms of regional  fiscal independence and promoting regional enthusiasm, a central  government should also have the wherewithal to effectively  transfer resources to poorer regions in order to narrow the gap  in revenue receipts and allocations between regions; i.e., a  central government must have regular financial surpluses derived  from revenue receipts which exceed expenditures; sixth,  duplication of responsibility for expenditures between central  and regional governments must be reduced to the minimum;  seventh, a central government should use a transparent and  equitable system of financial subsidies to transfer resources to  regional governments and, in the process doing so, encourage and  energize regional authorities to vigorously mobilize for revenue  collection while carrying out its own macroeconomic coordination  policy.</p>

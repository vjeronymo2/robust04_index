			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Derivatives markets continued to give good support to the recovery in the underlying equity market, writes Terry Byland. Trading volume in the June contract on the Footsie had jumped to more than 23,000 contracts in late trading last night. However, the discount of the contract to the cash market, which had been cut to four points in official trading hours, widened to nearly 10 points in later deals. Progress was erratic, however, with the discount narrowing at first but widening later as investors reacted nervously to trends in US bond markets.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Currency traders face down central banks: As dealers shun the dollar, James Blitz explores the role of fund managers in foreign exchange deals WHEN Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, underlined the government's determination not to devalue the pound against the D-Mark this week, his words were directed at one group of people, the currency traders in the world's foreign exchanges. Financial officials in western governments have been waging a battle to win the hearts and minds of dealers in a market that has become increasingly volatile in recent weeks. Central banks have tried to turn the markets by heavy intervention and by giving a boost to their currencies with prepared statements. They have encountered deep scepticism about the value of both sterling and the US dollar. The dealers' scepticism about the pound has partly been the product of the UK's intrinsic economic weakness and the refusal of the UK authorities to raise interest rates - a move that would raise returns for those investing in sterling. A fundamental problem for sterling is the weakening of the dollar against the D-Mark, and the way in which large operators in the foreign exchange market have changed their view of the US currency in recent months. The institutions pushing the dollar down are commercial banks, such as Citibank, UBS Phillips and Drew and Chemical Bank, which are trading their own books and speculating on the dollar's moves. Investment institutions such as pension funds and fund managers have also played an increasingly important role in this market in recent years because of the huge international assets they hold. Some believe it is the fund managers who are responsible for pushing the dollar down through its all-time low against the D-Mark this week. According to Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, the dealers in the inter-bank market initially triggered the dollar's fall in the spring. 'The further easing of monetary policy in the US and the growing belief that Germany would not cut interest rates made it expensive to carry dollars for a long period of time,' he said. Obsessed by a 6.75 percentage point differential in interest rates in favour of Germany, they started to push the dollar down from its highs at about DM1.60 in April. The dollar has not descended from that point in a straight line, however. The US currency has rebounded at times through central bank intervention, short-term profit taking and the existence of a hard core of investors who felt that the US economic upturn was around the corner. This volatile trading has made it difficult for bank dealers to make profits by buying large blocks of single currencies and selling them a short time later. A big factor behind the dollar's fall was action not by bank dealers but by fund managers and pension funds, which hold very large currency portfolios. It appears they sold the dollar down to the new low when they saw central bank intervention had failed to sustain the US currency. These institutions are not active speculators in the market. Normally they take a long-term view. Their potential role is huge, however. Acurrency dealer at a bank normally has at his disposal about Dollars 20m (Pounds 10m) of funds to invest on a daily basis. A pension fund manager is, in theory, able to switch funds into different currencies using a pool of billions of dollars. According to Mr David Cocker, a currency economist at Chemical Bank in London, fund managers have been increasingly keen to invest in currencies because of uncertainty in world stock markets. 'Right now, cash is king and the investment funds have gone for where the higher yields are, namely the D-Mark,' he said. But as the dollar has declined, they have also hedged their underlying dollar-denominated assets by purchasing D-Marks. Although individual fund managers dislike discussing their operations, a market observer claimed that one fund radically altered its currency portfolio last week. 'When the dollar was at DM1.46, all their funds were in dollars,' he said. 'At DM1.44, it was 50 per cent exposed. At DM1.40, it was 25 per cent exposed.' For the last three days, the dollar has held its ground at DM1.40. The market has even managed to push the currency up to DM1.4170, without any prompting from central banks. But, according to Mr Chertkow, if the dollar is pushed below DM1.40, that could trigger more aggressive dollar selling by the big investment funds. 'You could see wholesale liquidation of assets such as we saw in the dollar crisis of the 1970s,' he said.</p>

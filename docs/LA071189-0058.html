			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Filipino banker told the Philippine House of Representatives that ousted  President Ferdinand E. Marcos at one time had $7.5 billion in Swiss bank  accounts. At a committee hearing in Manila, Michael de Guzman testified that he  learned of the amount while acting as an agent of the Presidential Commission  on Good Government. Under a commission plan to track down the allegedly  ill-gotten wealth of Marcos, De Guzman said, he got Marcos on March, 1986, to  authorize him to withdraw deposits from Swiss banks for transfer to an Austrian  bank. In the process, Swiss authorities identified 10 banks holding Marcos'  money and 11 Marcos foundations. The plan was later called off by the  commission, and the money was never transferred, he added.  </P></p>

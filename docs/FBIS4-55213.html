			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 7 (ATA) -- On May 7, afternoon, the  president of the Republic, Sali Berisha, held a press conference  for local and foreign reporters.    Asked about a statement of the spokesman of the Greek  Government, Venizellos, that the relations between Greece and  Albania have a tendency of a new tension, as well as about an  interview of President Berisha with the Greek TV channel "Antena  1," the president said that personally, he is determined to work  not to increase but to ease tension in the relations between  Albania and Greece, believing that this is in the interest of  Albania, the Albanians, Greeks, Greece and other peoples and  countries of the region. The future of the Albanian-Greek  relations, he said, will be determined mainly by the tendency  which will predominate in Greece. "If Greece complies with the  European policy, Maastricht and CSCE principles, I am sure that  the relations between Albania and Greece in a near future, if  not today, will be friendly. There are many prerogatives  testifying that they can be friendly. But if another tendency  predominates in Greece of which many Greeks are proud, I would  say, the Byzantine tendency, or the tendency which identifies  the state with the church, in this case we would have to do with  a difficult future in the relations between Albania and Greece."  Mr. Berisha admitted he was amazed by yesterday's declarations  of the Greek Government regarding the statement of the Albanian  Foreign Ministry, which allegedly was irritating, because it  mentioned the Cam problem.    "The Democratic Party and its government have raised this  problem since it took over and will continue to tackle it. It is  an undeniable problem. The Greek Government, too, has made a  step forward and we have hailed it, because it has acknowledged  the question of ownership. Therefore, I don't see any  irritating element," Mr. Berisha said. Regarding the meeting  of the foreign ministers of the two countries in Zurich, Mr.  Berisha said that although the results were minimal, the meeting  was positive because the two parties showed a clear will for  positive results. They were open and sincere in tackling all  problems. "In my interview with 'Antena 1,' I mentioned the  Protocol of Florence, which is a protocol of the big powers'  border commission, which has designated the frontier between  Albania and Greece. No Greek Government has so far approved and  ratified this protocol. Then, the question rises: In this  context, what is the value of several repeated declarations by  the Greek Government according to which Greece has no  territorial claims at a time when senior representatives of this  government include south Albania in the military schemes for the  defence of Greece, consider south Albania as a Greek unliberated  territory or 'Northern Epirus?' In this case it seems we have  to do with a clear claim whose essence is precisely the non  signing of the Florence Protocol. Therefore, we have insisted  and will still insist on the signing of this protocol.    "I believe all the Albanians know a special merit of the  current Greek Government, which several years ago lifted the law  of war with Albania, a very absurd law, which penalized all the  relations between the two countries. It would also be in its  honour and merit to ratify the Florence Protocol," President  Berisha said.    As regards the problem of the radio stations, Mr. Berisha  reiterated his demand in the interview with "Antena 1" to  interrupt transmission via Konica and Corfu radio stations which  every day call on the Greek minority to join an armed uprising  and topple the regime or make annexionist calls. On this  occasion, Mr. Berisha congratulated the minority, who turn a  deaf ear to these warmongering calls. "These calls," he said,  "have minimal or no effect at all among the minority. Greece is  a democratic country and let the human rights institutions and  organisations, which are aware of the problem, evaluate its  democracy. But it is common knowledge that the UN charter and  other international documents prohibit neighbouring countries to  launch propaganda against one another. Imagine for a moment as  if all in Europe, in which powerful minority factors are  intertwined, to try to solve the minority question through calls  for war, annexations or secessions. So, I do not think my  declarations in the interview with 'Antena 1,' received by  Deutsche Welle, to be really so irritating," Mr. Berisha said  adding that he has demanded and demands from the Greek  Government a realistic policy to succeed in a good  neighbourliness.    Asked about the incident in Kukes and assessment of the  strikers' demands, President Berisha said that the group of the  villagers removed because of the dam in 1978 "deserves a special  and differentiated attention, like all the forgotten groups  which deserve priority," Mr. Berisha said, considering a part  of the demands of the Kukes' strikers as right, rational and  which need solution. "But, there are demands which are  absolutely unacceptable, because they penalize all the society.  If a certain small group forwards demands which in some way are  a punishment for the majority, this is and will always be  unacceptable. A government can never be democratic when it  resigns itself to absurd demands by a minority," Mr. Berisha  stressed.    Concerning the problem of price rise in electric energy and  of taxes, which have given rise to discussions, Mr. Berisha said  that with the latest price fluctuation the Albanian Government  completed one of the most difficult, most important aspects of  the reform, the prices reform. "This is, certainly, the most  painful side of the reform, but it is absolutely indispensable,"  President Berisha said stressing that absolutely all the payed  energy is compensated. "In case we kept the price inherited from  the past, we would practically preserve the socialist sector in  energy, the sector of failure.    "Consequently, no investor would be interested in investing  in the Albanians energy, which certainly makes up the major  source and possibility of Albania to develop, integrate into the  countries around, and to export to these countries," Mr.  Berisha said, also mentioning the compensation for heating in  the next winter, because the heating problem was not envisaged  in the compensation package carried out by the government a  month ago.    Regarding taxes, Mr. Berisha said that the taxes practised  by  the Albanian Government are completely acceptable and that can  be coped with. He said there had been and is no state without  taxes. The policy of taxes, seen through red glasses, seems an  exploiting policy. The last regime had the severest taxes that  any other regime in Albania had ever known. But, being  hypocrite, the last regime had found the formula that 'we are a  country without taxes,'" President Berisha said adding that 72  per cent of the Albanians favour the market economy although  knowing that they will pay taxes. "The gathering of taxes and  their presentation before the parliament is the transparent  procedure which shows to the citizen that it is not him that is  dependent on the state, but it is the state that is dependent on  him."    Regarding this problem, President Berisha said that the tax  system to be applied next year is simpler and has to do with the  value added tax, which is a Pan-European tax.    Responding to a question about the state secret and the  forgiveness of several reporters punished for this problem, Mr.  Berisha said that there is no secret for reporters. I have said  and say this again. It would be regretful to think that the  state is governed through instructions by the head of state.  The state is governed by laws. My views are one thing and the  law is another. I can have my own view but the law is a law and  should be implemented, because the implementation of laws is an  indispensable condition for the state functioning. "For me, the  defence of freedom of the speech and its development, such as  the defence of law and its consolidation, is and will remain a  constant objective," Mr. Berisha said.    To the question by the Deutsche Welle reporter on the  results  of Berisha-Kinkel meeting and Albanian refugees in Germany, Mr.  Berisha responded that in these talks the Albanian party raised  the problem of the Albanian refugees stressing that their  staying and special treatment in Germany is a great direct  economic assistance Germany renders to Albania. "We understand  that Germany has a very great number of refugees from the world  over, but I think that at least from Europe the Albanians are  more in trouble because there are less chances for employment  and they all maintain one or two families in Albania.    "Certainly, I must say that the German state has maintained  a  tolerant stance towards the Albanian refugees, and we are  grateful for this. But, we as a state, we want this tolerance  to continue," President Berisha said.    To the question asking whether there was hesitation on the  part of the police regarding the gathering of the Orthodox  believers on the Easter day, Mr. Berisha responded: "I am  amazed of the fact that they have asked permission from the  police to organise the religious gathering. There is no need to  ask permission from the police for religious ceremonies. There  was a misunderstanding between an officer of the police and a  representative of the church because the latter asked the  guarantee of two processions. I think that this problem, which  also became an intergovernmental problem, was very banal because  the church's senior representative might very well address to  the Foreign Ministry before the Greek Foreign Ministry  interfered in the internal affairs of the Albanian state and the  Albanian Autocephalous Church. Processions and religious  ceremonies have never been prohibited in Albania. To my  opinion, both the incident and the interference were totally  unjustifiable," Mr. Berisha said.    Responding to a question by reporter Jupe about early  elections, President Berisha said that it is a permanent demand  by honoured forces of the opposition. He said that early  elections are held in the event of a crisis in the country.  "But, can one speak of a crisis in a country which ensures the  highest economic growth in Europe, and this is done not on the  basis of the five year plans, but in freedom. Can one speak of  a crisis in a country with the parliament having an  extraordinary high efficiency in laws? Can one speak of crisis  with 70 per cent of Albanians considering the governing of the  country as right? Here we only have to do with a crisis of  posts, but I cannot say that there will be early elections for a  crisis of posts. Elections are held when the country needs  them. Therefore, I say that 1996 will surely be the year of  general elections in Albania," Mr. Berisha said.    To the question regarding vouchers, the president responded  that several patterns of their use in different countries are  being studied and this will be completely a transparent  procedure the parliament will decide upon or which will be  discussed in a round table party talks. Mr. Berisha said that  forgotten and unfavoured groups, that is former owners, the  persecuted and unsheltered should be favoured, whereas the  others will subject to the same chance.    Asked about the extreme right, which is now appearing on the  Albanian political scene, President Berisha said that personally  he favours no extreme, either right or left. Regarding the non  approval of the Right Party by the Justice Ministry, as this  party demands the return of the landlords, President Berisha  said that they cannot be an illegitimate movement for this fact  only. He expressed his personal view that free voting will  resolve their future.    To a question about the Nano question, the president said  that as regards this question one can refer to the Albanian  justice. "There has been much clamour and politicisation about  this question, but I tell those gentlemen who have raised that  clamour that there is nothing political in it, it is a  corruption affair, which is as much political for the Albanian  former government members, who were involved in this affair, as  it is for several Italian ministers under investigation, former  Socialist Party and Christian Democratic Party leaders."    Asked about the clamour raised to shatter the three party  coalition, Mr. Berisha said that the coalition had been and  remains a serious achievement of the democratic forces, that  this coalition yielded its fruits with the March 22 victory, and  that the coalition has produced extraordinary impressive results  over the last two year governing. "One cannot be unsatisfied  with the coalition or co- governing, at a time when inflation,  which was 400 percent, has dropped to 30 percent within two  years." Citing the achievements of this co-governing, Mr.  Berisha said that Albania, the poorest country in Europe, is now  leading the economic growth. Among other achievements he cited  those in the sector of privatization, the granting of dwelling  houses or their selling at symbolic prices. "But, are there  problems? I am head of state and there may be many articles of  the Albanian legislation, which I wished to be different,  however I must say that there is a consensus everywhere. Hence,  the law on education is drafted by a social-democrat, or a group  headed by a social-democrat," said President Berisha regarding  the three-party coalition.    As regards the statement of the English minister, Hogg, that  according to the British Government, Kosova is part of Serbia,  and the prejudice to be made to this problem on the eve of the  Geneva meeting, President Berisha said that "Minister Hogg  expresses himself in favour of an autonomy like that of 1974.  But I must say that it was not Britain that proclaimed the  Republic of Kosova. I consider his visit to Kosova as a very  important step. It has been one of the most significant events  in the problem of crisis. President Rugova has welcomed the  initiative of Minister Hogg as well as Belgrade's request for  dialogue, in case they seriously comply with the procedure of  solving the problem in the presence of a third party. No party  has the right to refuse the third party, because alienation is  great, something that cannot be denied. The third party both  mediates and helps them. It would be very important that the  coming Geneva meeting, alongside the Bosnia problem, also  discusses and decides upon Kosova.    Regarding the indifference and procrastination of the work  by  the local administration and especially by the tribunals, the  president said that there is no doubt that consolidation and  perfection of the state administration will be a constant  preoccupation and he fully agreed that there is unjustifiable  inactivity and procrastination. Regarding the performance in  tribunals, Mr. Berisha expressed his belief that procedures are  more delayed than in other countries. But, he said, it is  important that efforts are being made that the judicial power be  an independent system and most significant for a rule of law.    Regarding the relations of the Albanian state with Italy,  President Berisha said that they are relations with a clear  perspective, because they are friendly relations. They are  developing and will develop further. "Italy is a country which  has rendered a great assistance to Albania during a very  delicate period and, actually, it is the major investor in  Albania. Cooperation with this developed country is of special  interest for Albania," President Berisha said.</p>

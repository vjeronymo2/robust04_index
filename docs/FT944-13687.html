			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (5): Ford and Audi make light of motoring - The motor industry has joined producers in voicing optimism about the metal's future Mr Jacques Bougie, president of Alcan, the world's second largest aluminium group, let me borrow his car last month. He was prepared to do so because the car is significantly different - it is one of the first 40 'aluminium intensive vehicles' (AIVs) built by Ford. This fleet is based on the Mercury/Sable range, and gives the first clear indication that aluminium is suitable for the production of high volume, rather than just low volume 'niche' cars. Ford, the world's second largest automotive group, and Alcan believe they have overcome most of the problems associated with producing aluminium cars from an infrastructure which was set up to make them from steel. Ford still needs to conduct extensive manufacturing trials and consumer tests on the new AlV, and Mr Bougie's car is part of that programme. My half-hour drive from downtown Montreal to Dorval airport and back did not give much scope for serious testing. But back in May the AIV was given a much more gruelling try-out when four of the cars were taken to the Saint Eustache race track, near Montreal, to be put through their paces by some automotive writers and professional drivers. The drivers were also provided with equivalent steel-bodied cars - 400 lbs or 47 per cent heavier that the AIVs - to compare performances. After this test, Mr Jack Heebler, of Automotive News, reported: 'This car (the AIV) handles so well it's as if it has sticky tyres to help it hold the road. The AIV actually seems to carve through the turn without the heavy feeling of the steel-bodied car.' Similar favourable reviews greeted the Audi A8, the first production car to use aluminium as its primary structural material. This was good news for executives at the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) and at Audi who have spent the past 12 years in a co-operative research effort, and have invested a great deal in the project. Audi has spent about DM1bn (Dollars 650m) to bring the new luxury AS to market, and Alcoa has spent Dollars 70m for a plant at Soest, in Germany, where it is producing space frame components which it also hopes to sell to other car makers. Alcoa and Audi took a different route from Ford and Alcan. As aluminium is initially much more expensive than steel, they believed it would be too expensive simply to substitute aluminium components for those traditionally made of steel. Instead, they designed a car that has many fewer individual components and structures than are used in a steel vehicle. They developed a space frame, a skeleton-like body structure, composed of fewer than 100 extrusions and castings, compared with as many as 300 for a stamped steel body. Like Ford and Alcan, Alcoa and Audi had to develop new manufacturing processes to produce these space frames, and new aluminium alloys were also developed. All this activity has been prompted by increasingly stringent regulations covering both car fuel economy and emissions. This is a global trend, but is strongest in developed markets such as the US, western Europe and Japan. Both requirements can be met by lighter vehicles. And, as customers are resisting any attempts to make cars much smaller, designers are focusing on lighter materials to replace steel and plastics. Aluminium used in a typical US car has grown from 50 lbs in the 1960s to nearly 200 lbs today. Most of that extra aluminium has been used in components once made of steel or cast iron. There is still growth to come from this substitution process. Alcan's Mr Bougie says that demand growth of about 6.6 per cent a year can be expected for such things as castings, forgings and some aluminium sheet for cars, from today's starting point of 4m tonnes. However, now 'both Alcan and Alcoa have demonstrated the use of aluminium in car structures, this gives us growth potential for another 20 years. But the big growth does not come until after the year 2000. Aluminium structures in high volume models do not come until 2000 to 2005.' At present, the Audi-Alcoa technology is not economically viable for cars produced at a rate of more than 100,000 a year. Mr Bougie points out that Alcan's technology was from the start aimed at high-volume production of mid-sized cars. 'It is in the mass-produced models that the real volume market lies, a market we should see developing over the next five to ten years.' Mr Donald Macmillan, vice-president and general manager (automotive) for Alcan Rolled Products, whose job puts him face to face with the US car companies in Detroit, says the automotive groups are preparing themselves for even tighter regulations, and that, in order to achieve those new standards, they will need to hit higher miles per gallon figures with high-volume, mainstream vehicles. When a car is designed specifically to be made of aluminium, secondary weight savings can be incorporated - a lighter body means that engines can be smaller, braking systems do not have to be so powerful, and so on. There are still some question-marks over the use of aluminium in cars - questions about aluminium's reparability and its cost. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study showed that car-makers were having to spend an extra Dollars 1.50 a car for every lb saved - not particularly welcomed by an industry that likes pinching its pennies. The motor industry is also worried about the volatility of aluminium prices. Both Alcoa's chairman, Mr Paul 0'Neill, and Mr Macmillan, of Alcan, insist, however, that 'life of car' stable prices can be offered as long as these reflect the cost of replacing the smelters used to produce the metal. The North American groups are not the only ones likely to share in the potential bonanza. Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group and Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, has a vested interest in the success of the space-frame concept, which could be a big user of extrusions. Hydro has been successfully co-operating on car space-frame concepts since the mid 1980s with various groups, including Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy. Alusuisse-Lonza, of Switzerland, has a virtual monopoly in the supply of aluminium sheet for the car industry in Europe, because it has developed and patented an alloy that other companies prefer to use under licence rather than develop an equivalent material. There is still a possibility that the avalanche of new business that the aluminium industry hopes for from the motor industry will not materialise, and executives remain cautious about some of the more extravagant forecasts being made. The steel and plastics producers are working hard to ensure their car business is not further eroded. Already a lightweight cast iron for automotive components available is available from Sintercast, a Michigan-based, Swedish-American company. Nevertheless, Alcan's Mr Bougie can say confidently: 'By the year 2010, the world automotive industry could be consuming as much as three times the aluminium it does today. The additional shipments to this market alone could require the equivalent of the output of 30 to 40 additional world-scale aluminium smelters, although by that time a growing part of this would come from recycled aluminium.'</p>

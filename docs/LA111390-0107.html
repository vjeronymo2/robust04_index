			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 RIGHT-WINGERS FACE RUNOFF IN GUATEMALA;  </P> <P> POLITICS: CARPIO, THE PRE-ELECTION FAVORITE, WILL RUN AGAINST SERRANO, FORMER  AIDE TO DICTATOR RIOS MONTT.  </P> <P> A right-wing businessman and a former leader in one of Guatemala's bloodiest  regimes who has strong roots in the nation's large evangelical movement emerged  Monday as the candidates to be president in January after a first round of  voting failed to select a majority winner.  </P> <P> With 76% of the votes counted from Sunday's balloting, the two leading  candidates were Jorge Carpio Nicolle of the National Centrist Union, the  pre-election favorite, with 25.33%, and Jorge Serrano Elias of the Solidarity  Action Movement, with 25.03%. Ten other candidates shared the remaining bvotes.  </P> <P> The two front-runners, who have no basic differences on dealing with human  rights abuses and economic inequities and who are both acceptable to  Guatemala's still-dominant military, will run again Jan. 6. The winner will  succeed Christian Democrat Vinico Cerezo Arevalo, who was ineligible to run  again. It will be Guatemala's first transfer of power from one elected  government to another.  </P> <P> Carpio, a conservative 48-year-old newspaper owner, has suffered from a  reputation as a lackluster candidate; one of his major supporters once  described him as having "the charisma of a baked potato." And he has faced  opposition from other members of the business elite who say his moderation on  some social policies betrays his economic stance.  </P> <P> But it was Serrano, the evangelical and onetime chief assistant to Gen. Efrian  Rios Montt, the former dictator, who was a major surprise. He had been expected  to finish no better than third.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, an unexpected combination of factors put him in the runoff,  including the significant support he gained from backers of Rios Montt, who was  disqualified from running for president earlier this year because he had gained  power in a 1982 coup.  </P> <P> Serrano, a 45-year-old Stanford University engineering graduate with a  hard-line conservative economic view, had served as head of Rios Montt's  Council of State and was an outspoken supporter of the general's bloody policy  of repression. And he has tacitly echoed Rios Montt's campaign pledge that he  would use similar tactics to deal with Guatemala's high crime rate and social  disarray.  </P> <P> At the same time, many experts say they think Serrano also has greatly  benefited from the support of the 35% of the country belonging to the  evangelical movement, although he played down religion as a public issue.  </P> <P> On Monday, both candidates immediately began looking for alliances among the  losing parties, with Serrano playing to the third-place finisher, right-wing  businessman Alvaro Arzu, who has a personal and political bone to pick with  Carpio, and the remnants of the outgoing Christian Democrats.  </P> <P> Carpio is expected to try to pick up Christian Democratic support as well and  to obtain the backing of the country's large but apolitical Indian population.  </P> <P> But neither Carpio nor Serrano has a truly distinctive program, particularly on  the most serious issues facing Guatemala: one of the world's worst human rights  problems and a rotted economy marked by a nearly singularly unbalanced  distribution of wealth.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, neither candidate has proposed fundamental changes in what is one of  the most unbalanced economic systems in Central America -- one that has left  more than half the country underemployed or unemployed. According to the World  Bank, only 13% of Guatemala's 9 million inhabitants live above the poverty  line, and illiteracy stands at 67%.  </P> <P> None of this is likely to change as a result of Sunday's elections. In a recent  interview with the New York Review of Books, Edmond Mulet, a Carpio supporter,  said: "Nobody in Guatemala dares to mention the idea of redistributing wealth.  Everybody knows it should be done. . . . But if you say it too loudly, you  scare the (large landowners) and the army. The gap between rich and poor  remains."  </P></p>

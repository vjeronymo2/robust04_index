			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule at &sect;631.2 added an additional definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response assistance)'', which establishes a minimum threshold for the provision of rapid response assistance. This minimum threshold cannot be waived, but a new provision, at &sect;631.30(b)(6), which provides the Governor with alternatives for complying with the threshold and providing rapid response assistance in exceptional circumstances has been clarified. In addition, that provision has been expanded to reflect a requirement of the NAFTA Worker Security Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters questioned whether the ``employment loss'' in this new definition relates to a single business or to the geographic area. To maintain consistency with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, ``employment loss'' in this context relates to a single site of employment .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the new definition of ``substantial layoff'', another commenter stated that employers periodically lay off, temporarily, 50 or more employees during a 30-day period and then recall these individuals. Therefore, the commenter recommends that rapid response assistance should only be authorized if the duration of a layoff is expected to last for 6 months or more. The Department believes that, after determining a layoff meets the definition of substantial layoff for rapid response assistance purposes, a State is still required to determine, among other things, the expected duration of the layoff, the level of need of the affected individuals and their individual eligibility for services. Ascertaining their need for assistance should include contacting the employer and a representative of the workers. The State should then decide whether or not to offer services based on these determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters believed the new definition would exclude rapid response assistance for numerous small scale reductions and stated that, if the definition could not be altered, more latitude should be given to the States under the ``exceptional circumstances'' provision to respond to smaller layoffs. A commenter suggested expanding ``exceptional circumstances'' to include other situations, and another commenter suggested alternative language for &sect;631.30(b)(6) to allow the Governor to establish a threshold below 50 for rapid response assistance purposes. Finally, one commenter thought &sect;631.30(b)(6) directly contradicted the definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response assistance)'' and questioned the legislative basis for this new provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a statutory provision, the minimum threshold of 50 employees established by the new definition of substantial layoff cannot be waived. However, through &sect;631.30(b)(6), the regulations do provide flexibility to States to establish policies that allow rapid response assistance to be provided to layoffs of less than 50 workers at a single site. The Governor must establish guidelines defining parameters for ``impact on a local community.'' The only limitation is that States must maintain a capability to respond to single site layoffs of 50 workers or more. In other words, States cannot establish policies which would exhaust their ability to provide effective and timely rapid response to layoffs of at least 50 workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few comments reflected concerns with both definitions of substantial layoff or with having two separate definitions. One commenter believed the Governor should have the discretion to reduce the worker threshold below 50, while another believed the definitions must be flexible enough to accommodate local circumstances. A few commenters stated that having two different definitions was administratively confusing and could lead to disallowed costs as a result of the difficulty of ascertaining if the 33 percent threshold had been met. To promote consistency, they recommended using the definition of ``substantial layoff for rapid response purposes'' as the sole definition of the term. Other commenters believed having two distinct definitions established a possible conflict (i.e., individuals who receive services through rapid response assistance may not meet the title III eligibility criteria), and indicated that a single definition of rapid response was preferable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions of ``substantial layoff for participant eligibility'' and of ``substantial layoff for rapid response purposes'' are different as a result of responsive title III policy evolution. Originally, the Department used the WARN definition of ``mass layoff'' to establish a linkage between title III programs and WARN, and to set forth a minimum threshold for the provision of State rapid response services. To provide greater flexibility for State rapid response assistance, Congress provided an additional definition of substantial layoff, but clearly made it exclusively for rapid response purposes. Therefore, the two definitions of substantial layoff will remain intact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Participant Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Broader eligibility rules (criteria) are established in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;631.3(b) for the receipt of selected readjustment and retraining services in instances where an employer makes a public announcement of a plant closure, pursuant to section 314(h) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters asked what constitutes a public announcement of a planned closure. One commenter specifically asked what constitutes a public announcement for the State, and if a WARN notice or a letter to the Governor or locally elected official from the employer would suffice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 631.3(b)(4) states that ``the Governor shall establish criteria defining `public announcement'. Such criteria shall include provisions that the public announcement shall be made by the employer and shall indicate a planned closure date for the facility (section 314(h) of the Act).'' The Department believes a WARN notice, and most likely a less formal declaration by an employer, would meet these criteria. However, within the parameters established in the regulations, the Governor ultimately determines what constitutes a public announcement of a planned closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters questioned what would happen if a decision to close a plant was changed. A few commenters specifically asked what would occur if a decision was reversed (e.g., Would the project be canceled? What happens to the workers who were determined eligible and enrolled? Are they terminated? What impact would a reversal have on cost category limitation, performance standards and outcomes?). They recommended the institution of a hold harmless provision. One commenter asked if an individual would remain eligible for retraining should a closure date be delayed or if an individual in classroom training never received a notice of layoff. Finally, another commenter stated that the participants should not be denied service or experience an interruption in enrollment due to delays in closing dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

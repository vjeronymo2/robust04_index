			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (17): A brighter trend on the roads - The two- and three-wheeler market seems to be benefiting from an early upturn IF A demonstration was needed of the power of a well-chosen joint venture, it was provided last year by the Indian two-wheeler sector and Honda, writes Michael Smith. As Indian motor-cycle sales fell 9 per cent to 430,000, Hero Honda, a joint venture in which Honda has a 26 per cent stake, increased volumes by 13 per cent to become market leader. In scooter manufacturing, Kinetic Honda, another Honda joint venture, added 10,000 to its sales to reach 87,000, again in a shrinking market. The Indian two- and three-wheeler market, which last year totalled 1.68m units, is dominated by six players. Bajaj Auto, Hero, Kinetic, TVS (which has a joint venture with Suzuki), LML and Escorts. Together, they account for more than 90 per cent of sales. Fortunately, the collective gloom which resulted from the severely depressed market of last September-January, when the market slipped by more than a quarter on the comparable period of the previous year, appears to be lifting. Monthly sales since January, are closer to last year's levels and in some cases above them. That means that the two- and three-wheeler sector was affected later than cars and has benefited from an earlier upturn. In India, long-term growth is assured because two-wheelers are commonly used to carry three and four people and are viewed as the poor person's car. The problem for companies like Bajaj Auto, the market leader for all two- and three-wheelers, and Escorts, the motor-cycle market leader before last year, is the competitive threat posed by Honda and, to a lesser extent, Suzuki. Bajaj has done well to carve out a 47 per cent share of the market for two- and three-wheelers. Although that is well down from the 80 per cent it had prior to the liberalisation of the industry in the early 1980s, it is a significant improvement on the 40 per cent of eight years ago. Under the chairmanship of Mr Rahul Bajaj, the company is considered to be one of the better-run indigenous Indian organisations with, for example, a relatively enlightened approach to research and development. R&amp;D is the only department in the company which does not have budget constraints. But the task is tough. 'Honda of Japan spends more on R&amp;D than our annual turnover,' says Mr Bajaj. 'Where does that leave us?' The answer is striving hard both to increase market share further and boost exports from their current 2 per cent of production to a targeted 15 per cent. Indian market share increases can come from initiatives such as the introduction in 1990-91 of a 50cc moped which in its second year of production took 10 per cent of the market. Bajaj still claims to be cheaper than most of its rivals in most of its products. Achieving the exports target will be more difficult in the absence of dealer networks available to companies with joint ventures and doubts among potential foreign buyers about the quality of Indian manufacturing. For similar reasons, Escorts will struggle to increase exports which last year accounted for about 1,000 of its 120,000 motor-cycle production. Although Escorts has collaborations with overseas companies including Yamaha, it has no joint ventures with Japanese companies. Product development has suffered as a result and it is still developing a fuel-efficient, four-stroke model to match the one behind Hero Honda's success. Mr M. M. Mehta, Escorts vice-president, says that when it comes, in two to three years' time, it will be better than those of its competitors. He also draws comfort from a revival in demand for Rajdoot motor-cycles which were behind the company's earlier success. 'We cannot meet the demand for Rajdoots. In the mid-1980s it suffered from the Japanese competition. But we have been making constant improvements and the price has become more favourable against the Japanese because of rises in import duties.' However, Mr Mehta does not disguise his regrets about the lack of a joint venture. 'If an Indian company has a joint venture, the (foreign) partner is concerned with the technology and the well-being. For example, if the yen-rupee relationship slips, the collaborator will give some consideration on the price of imports.' Not surprisingly, Escorts is considering the possibilities of a joint venture.</p>

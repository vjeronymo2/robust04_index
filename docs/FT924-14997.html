			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Saving water at the root Fertigation - a combination of fertilisation and irrigation used widely by fruit and vegetable growers in hot, dry climates - could reduce pollution and water consumption in cooler, wetter countries such as Britain. Horticulture Research International, the state-backed agency which carries out research for the UK fruit and vegetable industry, is investigating fertigation at its Kirton experimental station in Lincolnshire. The technique supplies metered quantities of nutrients directly to the roots of the growing plants through a 'trickle irrigation' system. It requires thin-walled piping to be laid along each row of crops. Preliminary results suggest that fertigation could reduce the water and fertiliser requirements of British vegetable growers, while bringing crops to market more quickly. 'Results so far have shown a good response in cauliflowers, some of which matured 18 days earlier than conventionally produced crops,' says Mike Wood of HRI Kirton. But he believes the big advantage of the technique would be to eliminate the need for traditional large-scale 'broadcasting' of nitrogen fertiliser, together with overhead irrigation which can wash much of it into rivers and groundwater. Fertigation also conserves water resources, which are becoming increasingly scarce in the vegetable-growing areas of eastern England. Fertigation is already used extensively for growing fruit and high-value vegetables in parts of the world with hot dry summers, including the Mediterranean countries, California and Australia. Its commercial uptake in the UK will depend on developing hardware to match the very different economics of production in the British climate. But Wood believes that the technique could be in commercial use by 2000.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Hundreds of Nestle staff jobs to be shed Hundreds of redundancies among administrative staff were announced yesterday by Nestle UK, part of the world's largest foods and mineral-waters groups, Lisa Wood writes. The company declined to comment on the redundancies but the employees affected said that up to 450 jobs were being cut, with the heaviest losses at the company's headquarters at Croydon, south London. It is understood that the losses will be over 18 months and many should be voluntary. Nestle, which is reviewing all aspects of its business, said: 'Details of the results of the first stage, which looked at ways of simplifying working practices at Nestle UK's headquarters in Croydon and at parts of the York and Hadfield sites, are currently being given to employees and we are unable to comment further.' The group has 17,000 employees in the UK.</p>

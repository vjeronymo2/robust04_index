			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / How to Spend It: A staid fashion house with a real buzz - Lucia van der Post discovers some of the secrets of Celine, a chic Paris fashion business. She also goes in search of objets d'art THE PARIS fashion house of Celine is one of those opaque French institutions that seems, mysteriously, to flourish although from the outside it is hard to fathom how and why. Celine has always had about it an air of satisfied, bourgeois comfort - respectable, but exciting? Hardly. It is not only in Paris that Celine has flourished. The London franchise, owned by Michael and Lawrence Feldman since 1967, has been just as successful. Quietly, without fuss, it has grown into a good, profitable business, even managing in these dire times to increase profits, doing 10 per cent more business in 1991 than in 1990 and another 20 per cent more in 1992 than the year before. 'We don't mind the fact that our name isn't on everybody's lips,' says Michael Feldman, 'it gives us a certain low-key appeal.' If it has appeal it has to be low-key, for its clothes are not much featured in the fashion press, its Paris shows do not set the headline-writers' pens a-quiver. Who then buys Celine and what is its secret? It is hard to tell. But in the UK several members of the royal family are known to troop through the door - Princess Alexandra, the Duchess of Kent, Princess Michael of Kent as well as the Thai royal family, rich Indonesians, richer Japanese. In Paris, besides Madame Pompidou and the well-heeled matrons of the 176th arrondissement, actress Catherine Deneuve, Princess Ira Furstenberg, model and actress Margaux Hemingway, television presenters and young actresses saunter in to the chic little premises off the Avenue Montaigne. Its secret is summed up by one of its fans: 'It's Chanel-style at half the price.' Whereas a Chanel suit cannot be had for much under Pounds 1,200, the newest Celine boutique on Sloane Street is filled with flirty, desirable little numbers, with lots of zip and class at prices that start at Pounds 500. As Celine is known to use the same sub-contractors as Chanel, the value for money is clear. All those career women wanting a fresh, fashionable and classy little suit to take them through the day which they can then dress up with jewellery at night, will find lots to choose from. Anyone wanting a handbag will find a beautifully made, fine leather number with a pedigree look at about half the price that one of the more high-profile names would charge. Celine seems to be a very clever business - somehow its founders managed to attach to the ready-to-wear label the sort of cachet and status that puts it right up there with the haute couture houses. It was bought from its founders, Celine and Richard Vipiana, three years ago by Bernard Arnault, head of the French group Financiere Agache, who decided that the thoroughly respectable Celine was just what he needed to round out his luxury brands group. A safe, 'very clean name,' to use the words of Nan Legeai, Celine's chairman and chief executive, the label had never been debased. Arnault's next move was to put Nan Legeai, an American whom he had met when she working at Dior, in charge of Celine to ginger it up. 'Turn it into the hottest thing in town,' he told her, 'and triple the profits in three years.' Three years on, taking in a world recession, the Gulf war and tough competition, Celine may be not the hottest name in town but it is definitely higher profile. Younger women are trooping through the door and profits have been tripled. Legeai says she had no doubts that Celine could be turned into a top class international fashion name, even without the traditional engine for such status, a haute couture range. She is sure that there is a role for high-class ready-to-wear and that is where Celine has carved a niche. Its style is haute couture - formal and dressy without the relaxed insouciance of Armani or Max Mara. It is more anonymous, more Continental than Donna Karan or Ralph Lauren. It could happily go to Longchamps or Ascot, to cocktails or weddings. Yet its prices are ready-to-wear. 'Modern men and women,' she believes, 'want simple, modern, well-cut, well-tailored clothes in beautiful fabrics, excellently priced. They are more confident in their own style and do not need to pay the Pounds 5,000 and more that a haute couture number would cost.' Much of the cleverness has been the pricing strategy. Nearly all the couture houses have three different lines: couture, which it is reckoned only some 3,000 women in the world can afford; boutique, very expensive exclusive ready-to-wear; and a lower-priced diffusion line. Celine has just one collection, priced between the couturiers' boutique and diffusion lines. It is able to deliver this kind of quality at that kind of price because there are no star designers on mega-buck salaries and all margins are closely controlled. Legeai's first task was to make sure that everything Celine shops sold originated in Celine design studios. 'I wanted all Celine customers everywhere to be able to buy every Celine line. Every shop throughout the world offers the same range from the same two collections a year.' A major task, of course, was rejuvenating the name, bringing in new, younger customers without alienating the existing ones. This she has done and part of the purpose in opening the new store in Sloane Street this week is to enable the British customer for the first time to buy the new, fresher, zappier lines. It is a tough time to be opening a new shop in London (Michael Feldman likens it to 'buying a deck-chair on the Titanic') but they are both confident. 'Yes, sure, times are tough but the more competition one has, the more difficult things are, the better one must become. Our designers have really to think about how to do things better and less expensively. A lot of very important things start during recessions. Next year we will add new products  -watches, sunglasses and a fragrance.' Hot gossip in Paris has it that Nan Legeai is likely to be given the task of jazzing up Christian Dior but she dodges any questions on those lines very artfully. What might her future plans include? 'Well,' she says, 'I think Celine has come a long way in three years but we have a lot further to go. We are strong in Europe, very strong in Asia but we are only just starting in America. I want to turn Celine into one of the most profitable fashion houses in the world. 'I have just done a plan for the next three years and even looking ahead conservatively I predict that we will grow between 15 per cent and 20 per cent per year. Fashion is there to make people look good and feel good - that's what Celine is all about.'</p>

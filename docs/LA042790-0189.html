			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BOWIE WILL TAKE A NEW DIRECTION  </P> <P> David Bowie's new Sound &amp; Vision Tour, which starts its American leg  tonight in Miami, will feature his hits from the 1970s and early '80s -- and  Bowie says this is the last time he'll perform them.  </P> <P> "After this, I'm through with it all," he told the Sun-Sentinel in Ft.  Lauderdale. "You'll never hear those songs again. It's the '90s. A new decade.  What better way to start out than by cleaning house, getting it out of the way  and moving on."  </P> <P> "I won't be singing 'Suffragette City' when I'm 50."  </P> <P> The tour, which has already visited Canada and Europe, features all-request  shows, with Bowie playing songs named by fans calling a 900 telephone number.  </P></p>

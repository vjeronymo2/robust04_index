			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Hata pledges rapid end to trade row: Coalition chooses new leader Mr Tsutomu Hata, nominated by Japan's ruling coalition yesterday as its candidate for prime minister, pledged to forge ahead with economic deregulation and to resolve the trade dispute with the US. Mr Hata, who admitted to trembling with apprehension on accepting his selection, said Japan should settle the US trade row before the Group of Seven summit of industrialised countries in July. His government's first job was to get rapid agreement on the current year's budget. It was to have come into effect on April 1 but has been delayed for the past month by a parliamentary row over the personal finances of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned as prime minister as a result, and then by the power struggle which followed. By June, Mr Hata aims to produce a package of market opening measures and issue plans for a permanent reduction in income tax, keenly awaited by the US, to be funded by a rise in indirect taxes. In a meeting with Mr William Perry, the visiting US defence secretary, Mr Hata, in his current capacity as foreign minister, confirmed that he would work closely with Washington to keep up the pressure on North Korea to open suspected nuclear weapons sites to international inspection. Mr Hata's nomination was made possible by an early morning policy accord between the main parties in the ruling coalition, in which the Social Democratic party, the alliance's largest member, lifted objections to a rise in indirect taxation and a firm line on North Korea. The compromise was met with dismay by the SDP's left wing, suggesting that the new government could be stormy, like the last one. Japanese business organisations greeted the end of the leadership row with relief, but gave Mr Hata a surprisingly lukewarm welcome, reflecting his image as a competent operator seen as unlikely to break new ground. The nomination was 'appropriate', said Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren business federation, who hoped Mr Hata would take a strong initiative in completing political and economic reform. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, said Mr Hata was a 'natural' choice, as long as the coalition maintains its current framework. Mr Hata is to be confirmed as Japan's new leader by parliamentary vote on Monday, when he is assured of a comfortable majority over the main rival candidate, Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. Soon afterwards, Mr Hata aims to select the new cabinet, thought to be similar to the present line-up, and make his first policy speech to parliament the following day. The struggle over the leadership and a joint policy platform has intensified a split between the right and left wings of the coalition and provoked a fresh round of defections from the LDP. However, Mr Hata maintained yesterday that the debates had been 'meaningful' and helped clear the ground for tax reform.</p>

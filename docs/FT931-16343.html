			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Bankers force Lilley into receivership LILLEY, the UK contracting and construction group, last night asked to be put in receivership, after a financial rescue package failed to obtain the unanimous support of its bankers. The Glasgow-based group, which employs 2,800 people, said that like many other companies it had experienced very difficult conditions in its core construction activities and had been over-exposed to property development. Lilley recently announced a plan to reschedule its debts, inject Pounds 12.5m of new equity and in October appointed Mr James Hann to replace Mr Robert Rankin as group chief executive. Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said: 'Lilley is not alone among construction companies in having moved into property in the eighties: indeed this was the motivation of the Pounds 28m management buy-in of August 1988, headed by the former chief executive. 'It is unfortunate the policies he spearheaded were pursued too long against a changing economic background. The board addressed this situation and a change of management produced a feasible way forward. I deeply regret that the requirement for unanimity among the banks has frustrated this, despite support from a broad front of investors and lenders.' Lilley was founded in Scotland in 1918, and became a publicly-quoted company in 1965. It grew to be one of the UK's biggest construction and civil engineering groups, specialising in public works, the construction of pipelines, water and sewerage treatment plants and tunnelling. During the seventies it specialised in construction at oil and gas terminals. Lilley recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.05m in the six months to June 30 on sales of Pounds 156m. In 1991, losses in housebuilding and property development caused pre-tax losses of Pounds 5m on turnover of Pounds 340m, compared with profits of Pounds 14.1m. At its last year-end, Lilley had net borrowings of Pounds 30m. The shares closed, before the announcement, unchanged at 7 3/4 p, giving the group a market value of Pounds 16m. Lilley Construction Scotland, MDW, Eden Construction and Robinson and Davidson operate mainly in Scotland and the north of England; Lilley Construction Midlands, Standen Construction and Piper Buildings in the Midlands; and Lilley Construction Southern, Henry Jones Construction and Hatfield Construction in the south of England.

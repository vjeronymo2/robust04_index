			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by ROK President Kim Yong-sam upon arrival from his </F> official visit to Russia and Uzbekistan at Seoul Airport in  Seoul on 7 June--live]    [Text] My dear fellow countrymen: I have returned home,  winding up my one-week visit to Russia and Uzbekistan.    Through the visit, I have opened a new historic horizon for  ROK-Russian cooperation. Ending the era of conflict and dispute  between them, the two countries have built a firm foundation for  mutually complementary partnership relations.    Russian President Yeltsin promised to suspend [chungdan]  selling arms to North Korea and said that Russia will in fact  scrap the mutual assistance treaty [sangho wonjo choyaktto  sasilsang pegihagettago hangosun]. This will contribute to  establishing a new basis for our security.    Russia promised resolute measures, such as joining  international sanctions, when necessary, to stop the North  Korean nuclear program. Russia delivered to us data concerning  the Korean War. This means that the Cold War past between the  ROK and Russia has been completely liquidated.    That I have visited the Russian Pacific fleet as ROK  president symbolizes that the two countries are closely  cooperating in security as well.    These are epoch-making events that were hardly imaginable a  few years ago.    Our two countries have agreed to open a new era of common  prosperity. Based on the agreements of cooperation of various  types signed during my visit, the two countries can now carry on  practical economic cooperation and technological cooperation.    With my visit to Russia, I have completed the visits to four  countries, namely, the United States, Japan, China, and Russia.  I have completed the framework of the rectangular diplomacy to  bring forth peace in Northeast Asia, to establish a new world  order, and to promote our national interest.    My dear fellow countrymen: That we have promoted friendship  and cooperation with Uzbekistan during my visit also has a very  important significance. Uzbekistan has been carrying out the  most steady reform among the CIS countries. Uzbekistan not only  has abundant natural resources, such as gold and cotton, but has  a great potential for development.    Uzbek President Karimov proposed active economic cooperation  with our country. President Karimov assured me that a legal and  systematic foundation will be laid so as to promote our  businesses' advance into the Uzbek market. Large-scale joint  investment has already been undertaken between the businesses of  the two countries. I expect that Uzbekistan will in time play a  role of our forward base for the Central Asian region.    My dear fellow countrymen: I met our beloved brethren in  Russia and Uzbekistan. They were pioneering life with vigorous  power vitality. Despite the history of hardship they suffered,  they preserved well the Korean tradition and culture. With  diligence and sincerity characteristic of our nation, they were  enjoying a high reputation. They were proud of their  fatherland's development. I was deeply moved by their positive  life.    I was assured of ample consideration by the governments of  the two countries so that our compatriots may not suffer  disadvantages as a minority.    I visited Vladivostok on my way home. Vladivostok is closely  connected with us historically as a base for our independence  movement. It is a region whose importance is highlighted for  our economic advance into Siberia. I visited the Russian  Pacific Fleet there, and had a historic opportunity to look over  the Korean peninsula from there.    It took no less than half a century to go there,  Vladivostok,  which is close to the Tumen River. I have returned home with a  hope that I will be able to go there by a shorter way without a  detour next time.    My dear fellow countrymen: Through the rectangular diplomacy  which began toward the end of last year, I vividly felt that our  country is importantly appraised in the international community.  We can play a leading role in the Asia-Pacific era. We can  stand aloft in the center of the new sphere of civilization.    Through the visits I have made, I renewed my resolve as well  as my confidence. In the world ahead, competition will be even  more keen among countries and regions. If we fail to keep up in  competition, we will be a straggler and loser. The advanced  countries were active in meeting this challenge. The countries  that are catching up are also transforming themselves at a  tremendous speed. The only way we must follow is to carry on a  practical reform more vigorously. I will do my best as  president to strengthen our security and promote the  competitiveness of our country.    Let us all advance forward vigorously united in one,  overcoming the syndrome peculiar to a transitional period.    Thank you.</p>

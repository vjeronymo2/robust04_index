This has also been confirmed by the Defense Ministry,  while Defense Minister Janez Jansa has already appointed a  special commission that will carry out an investigation. The  commission has allowed the experts of the country that owns the  aircraft to carry out some security measures on the aircraft's  armaments. Robert Rakar from Radio Koper has more details:    [Begin Rakar recording] Secovlje Airport has been virtually  closed since 1022 when a U.S. F-16 aircraft carried out a crash  landing there. The pilot chose Secovlje for the crash landing  because of an engine fault. Witnesses to this incident have  told us that the aircraft first touched the runway at its  beginning, whereupon it bounced into the air and its engine  died. It then tried to land again, and during this last attempt  its undercarriage collapsed. The aircraft then crashed into a  verge at the end of the runway. The pilot was not injured and  two hours after the accident he was transferred to Aviano by  special U.S. Army helicopter where he will undergo all the  necessary medical checkups.    A special Defense Ministry commission, lead by Brigadier  Iztok Podbregar, took over the matter from the border police.  We can expect the arrival of a special U.S. military commission  to carry out the necessary investigation together with the  Slovene commission at any moment. It is very difficult to  obtain any information, but unofficially six miles out of  Secovlje the pilot disarmed two rockets and dumped them into the  sea. We will be able to confirm this information once the  commission has completed its work. Brigadier Podbregar promised  that the investigation will be carried out as swiftly as  possible.

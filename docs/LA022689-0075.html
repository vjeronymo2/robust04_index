			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AZUSA TAKES UNUSUAL STEPS TO SHUT DOWN TWO TAVERNS  </P> <P> City officials, who say they are unable to control drug trafficking and other  illegal activity at two bars, have taken the unusual step of asking a judge to  close the taverns.  </P> <P> In the interim, the city has persuaded a Pomona Superior Court judge to grant a  temporary restraining order requiring the owners and tenants who operate La  Villa Bar and JJ's Cocktail Lounge to take steps to prevent drug activity at  the establishments. The landlords and tenants were also ordered to clean up  inside the bars and the property outside.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the owners said that their clients had no knowledge about any  illegal activity but that they will work with the city to remedy any problems.  The operators of JJ's, Reynaldo and Victoria Virvia, could not be reached for  comment. Manuel Vargas, who runs La Villa with Jose L. Gonzalez, declined  comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scores of Complaints  </P> <P> The bars, located in the 500-block of Azusa Avenue downtown, have prompted  scores of complaints from residents, city officials said.  </P> <P> "Just about any and all types of criminal activity have taken place there,"  said police Lt. Jim Skogh .  </P> <P> The city's complaint alleged that last year police arrested 65 patrons at JJ's,  23 for either being under the influence of, having possession of or having  possession for sale of cocaine and heroin. The other 42 arrests involved  assaults, battery, possession of stolen property, public intoxication and  serving alcohol to minors.  </P> <P> At La Villa in 1988, police reported 20 arrests of patrons for being under the  influence of, having possession of or having possession for sale of cocaine and  heroin. During that time, police made 24 other arrests at the bar for incidents  involving gunfire, battery, illegal possession of weapons, possession of stolen  property, public intoxication and serving alcohol to minors.  </P> <P> Police Chief Lloyd J. Wood said that neither the owners nor operators have been  charged with a criminal offense in relation to any of the illegal activities in  the bar.  </P> <P> In seeking the closures, the city is using an innovative approach that relies  on part of the state Health and Safety Code. Under the code, municipalities can  "permanently abate" properties that present a public nuisance arising from  continued drug sales.  </P> <P> In its complaint, the city has requested that the taverns be closed for one  year, that the court be given control of the disposition of the property during  that time, that the bars' furnishings be auctioned and that the proceeds be  used to reimburse the city for legal and other costs. The city has also  requested a $25,000 fine be levied against each landlord.  </P> <P> On March 8 the city will ask Pomona Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Nuss to  prevent the taverns from selling alcohol until the case is tried, said City  Atty. Peter M. Thorson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Main Objective'  </P> <P> Thorson said the city ultimately wants no bars to be housed at either of the  properties, even if the landlords follow through on promises of evicting the  current tenants.  </P> <P> "Our main objective is to prevent alcohol being served there and to end the  narcotics activities," Thorson said. "If (the lessees) are out, we have no  objection to the premises being used for legitimate commercial or retail  activities."  </P> <P> According to the city's complaint, the property where JJ's is located is owned  by physician James Joseph Femino, who has held title since 1982. A businessman,  Mark Chapin Johnson, has owned the La Villa property since October, 1987, the  complaint said. Neither could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Attorney Robert L. Bacon, who represents Femino, said the lease with the bar's  operator expires on Tuesday and will not be renewed. David R. Nissen, who  represents Johnson, said the tenants have been notified that they must  immediately comply with the court's order or face eviction.  </P> <P> Both attorneys criticized the city for not informing them of the problems  before the complaint was filed.  </P> <P> "This is an incredible case of what I feel is outrageous conduct by the city of  Azusa," said Bacon, a West Covina city councilman. "How can they punish the  owners of the property when they've never given the owner . . . an opportunity  to correct the situation?"  </P> <P> Nissen said the lawful operation of the establishment is the tenant's  responsibility.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expedient Method  </P> <P> "Our client desires his property to be used in a lawful manner and not to be a  problem for the city," he said. "He's taking all steps appropriate under the  law to see that all activity the city has alleged to have taken place there is  stopped immediately.  </P> <P> "But . . . a simple phone call would have taken care of it without a lawsuit."  </P> <P> Thorson said the city believed it was more expedient to go to court because the  majority of landlords would have been unresponsive to the city's requests.  </P> <P> "Normally a phone call doesn't do it," he said. "If a phone call would have  worked here, great. But 999 times out of 1,000 it wouldn't."  </P> <P> As to the assertion that the tenants, not landlords, were responsible for the  conditions, Thorson said the law holds the property owner liable.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate that the innocent landowner suffers," he said. "But they are  the people who are ultimately in control of the property, and they're the ones  the court says are responsible."  </P> <P> Azusa officials said the civil approach has been used successfully in Los  Angeles and San Diego and that they learned of the procedure through  discussions with attorneys from those cities.  </P> <P> "The cop on the beat can only do so much," Lt. Skogh said. "Basic crime  fighting doesn't always work, so it's nice to have this civil remedy to fall  back on."  </P> <P> "Over the years it's been like putting your finger in a dam or stomping on a  brush fire," Skogh said.  </P> <P> The suit included affidavits from 25 police officers, four residents and six  owners of neighboring businesses who complained of illegal activities and the  effects of the bars on the community.  </P> <P> The complaint also notes that in November, a group of Azusa residents presented  the City Council with 170 signatures from residents complaining about the  "deplorable" situation at the bars, citing broken bottles, trash and drunks.  </P> <P> In the restraining order issued by Nuss on Feb. 16, the landlords and tenants  were ordered to report to police any illegal activity at the establishments,  something police say the operators have not done in the past.  </P> <P> In one incident, Skogh said, the police were notified by emergency-room staff  of a stabbing at one of the bars after the victim sought treatment. "By the  time our officers got there, the blood had been cleaned up," he said.  </P> <P> Other provisions of Nuss' temporary restraining order include installing  outdoor lighting, hiring security guards, cleaning up the area around the bars,  refusing to serve patrons who appear to be drunk and adhering to state  Alcoholic Beverage Control Department regulations.  </P> <P> The order also states that signs be posted at the front and rear of the bars  indicating in English and Spanish that anyone in violation of the order could  face civil or criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> Skogh said the landlords have cooperated thus far with the city, but that not  all the provisions of the judge's order have been met.  </P> <P> As of late last week, the bars had yet to provide security guards or signs that  followed the exact wording and specifications outlined by the court, he said.  </P> <P> Chief Wood said he anticipates that similar actions may become necessary as the  city tries to combat narcotics problems at bars.  </P> <P> Wood, who in January was named president of the Los Angeles County Police  Chiefs Assn., predicted that other small cities would follow Azusa's lead,  because the procedure "offers the only permanent solution to this kind of  problem."  </P></p>

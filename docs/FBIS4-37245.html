			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hasan Muhammad Mayy] </F>   [Text] Sanaa -- Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, deputy prime  minister and planning minister in the Republic of Yemen, has  disclosed that his government agrees to negotiate with the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders who had announced the  establishment of a state in the southern and eastern  governorates of the Republic of Yemen.    In a statement to AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-Iryani specifically said:  We are ready to negotiate with any of the YSP leaders within  the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 924, which  invites those concerned from the Yemeni parties to search for  peaceful solutions to the Yemeni problem. He said that the word  "concerned" includes leaders from the YSP.    Al-Iryani said that the delegation which will leave for  Cairo  to seek a solution to the current crisis comprises an equal  number of members from the three parties which participate in  the coalition government: the General People's Congress, the  Yemeni Reform Grouping, and the YSP.    Al-Iryani, who was preparing to leave for New York to pursue  the search for a solution to the his country's crisis, said : I  am going to New York to see what the Americans and the Saudis  have in their quiver.    The Yemeni minister, who is close to President 'Ali  'Abdallah  Salih, did not elaborate on what other steps he believes the UN  Security Council could adopt on the Yemeni crisis. However, he  voiced extreme anger toward Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid's recent statement warning that the UN  Security Council will impose sanctions on the Republic of Yemen  if the cease- fire is not respected. Al-Iryani said that by  making such a statement, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has exceeded  his authority as Arab League secretary general. The Yemeni  minister said: I am surprised that the Arab League secretary  general steps forward to condemn an Arab League member. He  added: The only time we heard similar language was during the  second Gulf War. Al-Iryani called on Arab League officials to  act within the Arab League's framework. Addressing the Arab  League secretary general, al-Iryani said: 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid  does not have the right, nor is it his duty to act as an agent  for issuing UN resolutions against the Republic of Yemen or any  other Arab state.    The Yemeni planning minister said that his government wishes  to reach a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni problem to avoid  further losses resulting from the war against the YSP. He  added: However, we will continue to resort to force if the YSP  leaders adhere to their intransigent stands against the Republic  of Yemen's constitutional legitimacy. He announced that the  Yemeni forces will enter Aden and al-Mukalla by force if no  peaceful settlement is attained. He added: I do not know of any  country in the world which, faced with this situation, would not  resort to force. He condemned those who try to impose a veto on  the Yemeni forces entering Aden. He said: Those who impose a  veto should submit a political alternative. He said: We act on  the territory of the Republic of Yemen and we totally reject  that they tell us not to do so.    The Yemeni planning minister seemed confident of military  victory and restoring the rule of legitimacy to the entire  Republic of Yemen territory.</p>

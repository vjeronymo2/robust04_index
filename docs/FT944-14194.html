			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Morgan Stanley in Chinese bank deal Morgan Stanley of the US and the People's Construction Bank of China agreed yesterday to set up China's first international investment bank, aimed at making it easier to raise capital abroad to satisfy the country's huge funding requirements for economic development. The bank, to be known as China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), will also be used as a model to help to introduce new investment banking techniques to an antiquated financial sector undergoing reform. Mr John Mack, president of Morgan Stanley Group, the US investment bank, said at a signing ceremony in Beijing that the CICC would be well positioned as a conduit for a country with a 'tremendous appetite for international capital to fund its economic expansion and the development of its infrastructure'. Partners in CICC, whose initial capital is Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m), include the People's Construction Bank with a 42.5 per cent stake; Morgan Stanley with 35 per cent; and three other shareholders, each with 7.5 per cent. The minority shareholders are: the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GSIC); the China National Investment and Guarantee Corporation, a Chinese investment guarantee institution; and the Mingly Corporation, a Hong Kong-based investment company. The investment bank, to be based in Beijing, will also advise Chinese state enterprises on restructuring, assist in project financing and corporatisation - turning state enterprises into western-style corporations  -and help foreign investors to make direct investments in Chinese enterprises. Morgan Stanley representatives said the People's Construction Bank was an 'obvious choice' as a partner because it is China's biggest lender for infrastructure projects. The bank, for example, has been responsible for 80 per cent of the funding for power projects. The People's Construction Bank, one of China's 'big four' specialised banks, will 'identify investment opportunities in infrastructure projects and industrial facilities, introduce potential restructuring, corporatisation and mergers-and-acquisitions candidates and (seek out) Chinese partners for joint ventures', according to Morgan Stanley.</p>

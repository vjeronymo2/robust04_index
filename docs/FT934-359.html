			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Buses carry civilians out of Sarajevo A second wave of civilians was evacuated from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital besieged by Serbs, yesterday evening, agencies report. The evacuees, mainly pensioners, war-wounded or mothers with children, boarded three buses returning from an earlier shuttle to the nearby Serb-held district of Lukavica. Most were to go to Split in Croatia, with some going on to third countries. Other evacuees were to go to Serb territory. The long-delayed operation had been blocked several times by fighting along the intended route or by bureaucracy. A month ago, the convoy was abruptly cancelled when Bosnian Croats failed to provide promised buses. An official from the city authorities who organised the evacuation estimated that only about 1,100 of the 1,265 people on the list had actually left. Sarajevo has been under siege by Serb forces since April, 1992. More than 50,000 residents have been killed or wounded by shelling and sniping since the siege began. The Socialists of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic failed to win an overall majority despite a repeat vote in 45 constituencies in Serbia, party officials said yesterday, Laura Silber writes from Belgrade. The party said the new round had not substantially altered the outcome, according to unofficial results. The first poll saw the Socialists returned to parliament as the biggest party, with 123 of the 250 seats.</p>

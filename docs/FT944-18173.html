			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt panel to rule on US-Venezuela dispute The governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday agreed to set up a disputes panel to rule on a Venezuelan complaint that US rules for reformulated gasoline discriminate against imports. In a meeting dominated by trade issues involving the US, Washington bowed to a separate panel ruling against local-content requirements for tobacco used in US-made cigarettes. However, it continued to resist pressure by other nations for adoption of a controversial panel judgment against its embargo on imported tuna. Venezuela's complaint relates to rules on certification of imported gasoline which it claims use a less favourable methodology than that used to certify domestically refined gasoline. Venezuela also claims that under the rules some exporting countries receive preferential treatment, breaching Gatt's non-discrimination rule. Mr Alberto Poletto, Venezuelan trade minister, said yesterday that the new certification rules, adopted last December by the US Environmental Protection Agency, could reduce the value of his country's exports to the US of Dollars 478m last year by at least Dollars 150m. The rules would also reduce the return on a Dollars 1bn-plus investment programme Venezuela has launched to upgrade its refineries. At the same meeting, the Gatt council adopted a disputes panel report which found against a US law requiring US-made cigarettes to contain at least 75 per cent US-grown tobacco. The US said yesterday it would accept the ruling, and measures to implement it have been attached to the legislation for the Uruguay Round trade accords. Washington continues to resist adoption of a panel report which says the US is violating Gatt rules by imposing an embargo on tuna from countries whose tuna fishing nets kill too many dolphins. Yesterday, in spite of overwhelming support for adoption among trading partners, Mr Booth Gardner, US ambassador to Gatt, said only he would report their views to Washington. Among other items on yesterday's agenda the council: Took note of a working party report on the European Union's Lome Convention with African, Caribbean and Pacific nations, which failed to reach consensus on its Gatt consistency. The US and Canada again called for the EU to seek a specific waiver for the Convention from Gatt rules; Agreed to pursue consultations on a US proposal to make most Gatt documents public.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 33.5% INCREASE IN L.A. SEWAGE FEES ADOPTED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a 33.5% increase in  sewage fees and tentatively approved a parking tax and increased trash pick up  charges.  </P> <P> The average homeowner's sewage fee will increase from $10.43 to $13.93 a month  beginning July 1.  </P> <P> However, officials said that if a rate payer manages to cut back water use by  10%, in accordance with Mayor Tom Bradley's proposed water-rationing, the fee  will rise to only $12.54.  </P> <P> The parking and trash measures failed to garner the unanimous vote needed for  formal approval during the first reading of an ordinance and will be  reconsidered next Tuesday.  </P> <P> The parking tax would be levied on all those who park in commercial garages and  parking lots, and is expected to raise $22.5 million in the coming fiscal year.  Monthly sanitation charges would increase from $1.50 to $3 for homeowners and  from $1 to $2 a month for residents of apartments and condominiums.  </P></p>

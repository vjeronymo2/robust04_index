			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US group plans Dollars 40m brake plant in Europe KELSEY-HAYES, the motor components subsidiary of Varity of the US, is to invest up to Dollars 40m in a greenfield plant in Europe with an eventual annual capacity of 1m vehicle anti-skid braking systems. Mr John Utley, Kelsey-Hayes' vice-chairman, indicated in London yesterday that Spain, Portugal and the UK had been ruled out as locations for the new systems plant. Last year, Kelsey-Hayes established a European research, development and sales headquarters in Frankfurt. However, Germany's high cost base makes it almost certain that the new plant - a high-technology centre expected to employ only about 100 people - will be based in France or one of the Benelux countries. The location is expected to be announced within two weeks. Mr Utley said the group had signed two contracts worth Dollars 110m a year to supply European car makers with the anti-skid systems, starting late next year. The move comes as Hayes Wheels International, the group's vehicle wheel manufacturing operation recently floated on the New York Stock Exchange  - in which Kelsey-Hayes retains a 46 per cent stake - prepares to sign this week an agreement to create a joint venture company with Czech steel maker Ostrava to supply car wheels to both east and west European car makers.</p>

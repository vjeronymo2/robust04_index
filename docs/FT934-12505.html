			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian offerings find firm demand from overseas THE STRONG response from international investors to recent offerings which provide exposure to India gives some indication of the volume of foreign money which is waiting to flow into the country. India is widely regarded as the emerging market of the 1990s, following the introduction of free market reforms. Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets said yesterday that its new India fund had attracted around Dollars 150m, well above its expectations of Dollars 50m-Dollars 100m. There were also reports yesterday that the Dollars 125m six-year Euroconvertible bond issue from Reliance Industries, India's largest private-sector company, had been oversubscribed by 10 times. The issue is expected to be priced today. When Reliance's issue was launched last Thursday, lead manager Morgan Stanley said that the issue was already several times oversubscribed. However, Morgan Stanley declined to comment on yesterday's reports. Mr Sanjit Talukdar, the fund manager of F&amp;C's Indian Investment Company Sicav (Indico), said that the sum raised was equivalent to one day's trading volume in the Indian stock market. Half of the money came from UK institutions, followed by Asia which accounted for 40 per cent. The remainder was divided equally between the United States and continental Europe. Indico is an open-ended fund which aims to invest mainly in medium-sized Indian companies. Mr Talukdar said that initially only 20 per cent of Indico would be invested in medium-sized companies because of the lack of liquidity in these stocks. The remaining 80 per cent would be invested in blue-chip Indian companies. However, more than 50 per cent of the fund would be invested in medium-sized companies by the end of the first year, he said. Indico, which will be listed in Luxembourg, is due to start trading later this week once it has received the final approval from the Indian regulators. The strength of international demand for Indian investments has prompted several Indian companies to tap the international capital markets this year. They include SCICI, a financial institution; ITC, a tobacco and hotels company; and Hindalco, an aluminium company. Bombay Dyeing, a textiles manufacturer, is expected to launch an issue of global depositary receipts with warrants later this week. Lead manager CSFB declined to comment on the size of the issue but there were reports that the issue would only raise between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Bundesbank urges local councils to curb spending The Bundesbank has launched an attack on a root cause of inflation with a demand that west German local authorities act to stem rising deficits and local service charges by reducing their workforces, privatising more services and preparing for several years of belt-tightening. The central bank also warned the federal government to avoid loading extra burdens on to city and local administrations by forcing them to provide increasingly sophisticated services. The calls came in the bank's latest monthly report, published yesterday, which highlighted the extravagant spending policies that have turned the local authorities' 1989 surplus of DM2bn into an estimated deficit of DM10.5bn last year. Growth in spending exceeded growth in revenues by an average 2 percentage points annually in the three years to the end of 1992, and total local authority debt rose 14 per cent to DM127bn (Pounds 49.4bn). Underscoring the plight of urban authorities, the report showed Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, with debts approaching three times its annual tax revenues. The Bundesbank, which has in the past identified rising public service charges among the most persistent sources of inflation, noted that spending had slowed markedly last year. Total revenues rose 5 per cent in the first nine months of 1993, compared with an average of 7 per cent in the previous three years, while outgoings increased 5.5 per cent, the report said. Personnel costs, which account for 25 per cent of local authority expenditure, rose around 3 per cent last year after soaring 26 per cent in the previous three years. But social welfare costs had gone up a further 14 per cent after rising 32 per cent in the three years to the end of 1992. The report noted that income from taxes last year hardly increased, attributing the stagnation to corporation tax reforms and, indirectly, to sharply rising unemployment and falling real incomes. These factors are expected to continue depressing revenues for some time, while authorities will have to find extra funds to pay for statutory kindergarten places, new sewage treatment works demanded by European legislation, and, starting next year, increased contributions to help eastern Germany. The report, which closed for publication before last week's effective real pay freeze for public sector workers, made no mention of the deal's likely benefits. However it noted pressure on budgets would be eased by new funding methods for care of the elderly and infirm, and federal measures to stem the flow of refugees and asylum seekers whose housing and welfare has in the past largely been the responsibility of local authorities.</p>

It will also establish a special task force to streamline  the  nation's legislation to deal with international regulations in  the aftermath of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT).    The judicial agenda for this year was contained in a report  submitted yesterday by Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui to President  Kim Yong-sam at Chongwadae.    In the report, Minister Kim said that there is an implicit  need for establishing criterion by which legislation can be  respected and adopted by the citizens of South and North Korea  alike.    He noted that there will be a wide range of problems  resulting from the reunification of the divided country and due  process needs to be initiated in advance to deal with them  effectively.    Not only are the existing laws of South and North Korea  widely different as far as they are known, guidelines to cover  special problems relating to reunification, such as disputes  over properties, should be constructed in advance although it  remains to be seen when they will be applicable.    He also said his ministry is looking into the need and  possibility of setting up border control offices to monitor the  movement of residents from either side after the national  division comes to a close.    Along these lines, Kim told the Chief Executive, the Justice  Ministry will study the German unification as a model to adopt  aspects which are seen as applicable and beneficial.    On the crime side, the minister explained that the existing  16 task forces at prosecutor's offices on environmental and  health violations will be reinforced throughout the country.    Kim said the ministry has already fortified a 24-hour  investigative system to deal with four of the most violent  crimes including organized crime, narcotics and human  trafficking.    As far as international issues are concerned, he emphasized  the need for stationing judicial cooperation attaches in  organizations like the United Nations and countries like  Switzerland and China in addition to those now existing in the  United States and Japan.    He said close cooperation will be maintained with government  officials stationed at missions in foreign countries to collect  the latest judicial information, evaluate it and make it  available to domestic organizations.    "With the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it is critical  that prosecutors and lawyers specializing in international law  be fully utilized to exercise global influence," Kim elaborated.    Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry has begun to realign  investigations on environmental crimes such as the recent  contamination of the Naktong River with harmful chemicals and  human and livestock wastes.    Minister Kim said environmental issues are critical to the  quality of life and that investigations and punitive actions  will be initiated from the viewpoint of protecting the health  and rights of the public.</p>

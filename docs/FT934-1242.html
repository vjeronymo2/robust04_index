			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Ukraine nears nuclear deal: Kiev claims preliminary pact on compensation for arsenal The Ukrainian government said at the weekend it had reached a preliminary agreement with the US and Russia on the 'idea of compensation' in exchange for Ukraine's relinquishing of its nuclear arsenal. There was no confirmation of the deal yesterday in Washington or Moscow. However, Mr Al Gore, US vice president, said in Budapest at the weekend that 'all sides will tell you that progress is being made.' If a concrete agreement on financial compensation for uranium is worked out in subsequent talks, it would remove one of the three main conditions Ukraine has imposed for giving up its remaining 176 strategic missiles and becoming a non-nuclear state. Kiev's other two demands are technical aid for dismantlement and security guarantees. Ukraine's presidential foreign affairs adviser, Mr Anton Buteiko, also reported in an interview with the Financial Times that during trilateral talks, which lasted until midnight, experts were finalising agreements on technical assistance and progress was being made in negotiations on guarantees. According to the government press service, Mr Valery Shmarov, deputy prime minister, said: 'The idea of compensation for tactical weapons was accepted.' He was referring to the 2,760 short-range nuclear warheads Ukraine transferred to Russia last year. Mr. Shmarov hoped that compensation for these warheads would offset Ukraine's Dollars 2.5m energy debt to Russia. 'As part of compensation for strategic weapons, agreement was reached to supply uranium for Ukrainian nuclear power stations for five years.' Trilateral discussions between the US, Russia and Ukraine have been going on since early autumn. Ukraine's announcement followed two days of talks on Thursday and Friday. Kiev's public posture seems to be an attempt to take advantage of the west's possible new sympathy for Ukraine's security concerns in the wake of the nationalist victory at the Russian polls. While the west is reassessing its relations with Russia, Ukraine may be hoping create some rapid momentum to get the best deal it can.</p>

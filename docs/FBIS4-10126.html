			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Official sources told EFE  here that acting Brazilian Foreign Minister Roberto Abdenur  today asked the United States to increase its contribution so as  to achieve the pacification of Angola.    The request was made by Abdenur during a meeting with  Madeleine Albright, the U.S. permanent representative before the  United Nations, in Brasilia. Albright exhorted Brazilian  President Itamar Franco to support the U.S. position to exert  pressure on the DPRK.    The United States is seeking diplomatic support to intensify  its pressure on the DPRK in order to oblige the latter to abide  by a recent UN Security Council resolution and allow the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its nuclear  facilities.    Abdenur took advantage of the U.S. diplomat's visit to  Brazil  to ask the United States for greater involvement in the United  Nations so as to establish peace in Angola. There are strong  cultural, economic, and historical bonds between Brazil and the  African nation.    Abdenur and Albright decided that they will keep consulting  with each other to continue assessing the tense situation  confronting the Korean peninsula due to the DPRK's refusal to  agree to the inspection of its nuclear facilities.    Albright today met President Franco, with Abdenur, and Army  Minister General Zenildo de Lucena. She is to leave Brasilia  tomorrow to travel to Argentina.    Abdenur and Albright expressed optimism about the electoral  process in Mozambique, which will culminate with next  September's elections.    Nevertheless, the acting foreign minister voiced concern  about the hasty reduction of UN peacekeeping forces stationed in  Mozambique.    Both diplomats also discussed future regulations to enhance  the effectiveness of the economic sanctions the United Nations  imposes on some countries and to alleviate the harm caused to  innocent nations or people.</p>

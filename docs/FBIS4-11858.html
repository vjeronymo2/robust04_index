			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to </F> Arab Magreb Union summit in Tunis on 3 April -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate; Your Excellencies, at a time when the proceedings  of our council are about to be concluded, I am pleased to  express to you once more our pride at hosting this Maghreb  meeting in which we have changed viewpoints on our joint Maghreb  action, on the most efficient means to give a boost to the march  of our Arab Maghreb, and on the most prominent matters and  international issues. [passage omitted]    There is no doubt that any progress on the path of building  a  unified Maghreb is liable to add strength and competence to the  economies of our countries for integration and positive  interaction with the international economic community and  achieve more equilibrium in the exchange relations with the  large economic groups and particularly those with which we have  traditional relations in our immediate neighborhood. [passage  omitted]    At the end of my speech, your excellencies, I am pleased to  express on your behalf and in my name most sincere  congratulations to His Excellency President Liamine Zeroual, the  head of state of the fraternal People's Democratic Republic of  Algeria, on his taking over the Presidency of the Arab Maghreb  Union this year. We are convinced that his undertaking these  supreme tasks will give our unionist march, thanks to the wisdom  and conviction in the Maghreb unity that characterize him, more  impetus and progress to the course of building our Arab Maghreb  towards achieving the common aspirations of our peoples.    May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.  [applause]</p>

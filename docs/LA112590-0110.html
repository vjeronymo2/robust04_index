			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION POLICY'S VICIOUS CIRCLE  </P> <P> Yes, Measure M will produce a lot of money to improve our roads. Two articles  ("Engineers Plan to Roll Fast on Measure M List," Nov. 11, and "Watchdogs Vie  to Oversee 'M' Funds," Nov. 13) emphasize the huge sum that the additional  half-cent sales tax will yield.  </P> <P> Sure, the money must be spent for purposes intended by the statute. The Times  reports that 324 people applied for positions on the watchdog committee set up  by the measure to monitor spending.  </P> <P> The promise of Measure M is stillborn because the measure does not address the  cause of auto pollution: overdevelopment of Orange County. Measure M fails to  effectively address the issue of growth: population pollution.  </P> <P> Do you have any doubt that traffic improvements from Measure M expenditures  will be pounced upon by developers to argue for further growth? Developers did  not pour in huge sums supporting the measure because they desired better  quality of life for the rest of us. Congestion is profitable.  </P> <P> Traffic relief provided by Measure M funds will be temporary unless growth is  curtailed, because our capacity to produce more drivers for more cars far  outstrips our capacity to provide the roads upon which they must operate.  </P> <P> My prediction: After the $3 billion garnered by Measure M has been expended as  the measure requires, our automobile transportation mess will still be with us  -- all pain, no gain.  </P> <P> Worse, the politicians who approved the growth that placed us in this mess will  have continued those same policies, and they will still be in office.  </P> <P> I would be a lot more impressed if 324 people had volunteered to monitor the  politicians who made the decisions that produced this congested chaos in the  first place.  </P> <P> C. CHESTER BRISCO, Tustin  </P></p>

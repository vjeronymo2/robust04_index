			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Jaguar workers vote to accept two-year deal MANUAL WORKERS at Jaguar, the loss-making luxury car manufacturer, agreed yesterday to a two-year pay deal worth a minimum of 8 per cent, linked to continuing changes in working practices. Workers voted by 3,072 to 565 in favour of the deal in an 88 per cent turnout of union members. Union officials described the deal as fair and realistic given the current economic climate. The company said the agreement would help Jaguar improve efficiency. Under the pay deal workers will get a 4 per cent increase from November 1 and a further 4 per cent next year - or an increase linked to the RPI if inflation goes above that figure. Employees in return have agreed to the continuing removal of demarcation lines, a growing reliance on multi-skilled grades, and the extention of teamworking on production lines. The pay element is similar to the most recent settlement in the UK car industry - at Rover - where unions recently accepted a two-stage, 18-month deal worth a minimum 7.3 per cent. Many of the working practices included in the deal are now widespread in manufacturing industry, including companies in the car sector such as Rover and Ford. For Jaguar they represent the next stage in the radical shake-up of the company's previously outdated work culture, which started with changes two years ago. The size of the vote in favour of the agreement reflects acceptance that the pay deal was the best achievable in the present economic climate and a realisation of the particular difficulties Jaguar faces because of declining sales in many overseas markets. Jaguar in recent weeks has announced that it is shedding 820 jobs and cutting its planned production for this year to 23,000 - unchanged from last year - compared with the 27,000 forecast earlier. Jaguar's current strategy of overhauling working practices to include a requirement that workers remain on the production line until the end of a shift follows the company's takeover by Ford two years ago. The package includes agreement by the current workforce not to object to the recruitment of temporary employees if and when a new model is pro-duced. The pay element in the package illustrates the continuing downward pressure on private-sector pay, with settlements around 4 per cent.</p>

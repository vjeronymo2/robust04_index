Microinjections administered locally  into the nucleus raphe and hippocampus revealed the role of the  serotoninergic mechanisms of these brain formations in the  studied anxiety conditions of varied aversive genesis.  Injections of ipsapirone and campirone into the nucleus raphe  elicited anxiolytic effect in various types of tests. Chemical  stimulation of the hippocampus elicited an anxiolytic effect in  several (ipsapirone) or isolated (campirone) tests. Dissociation  of anxiolytic effects in tests of differing aversive genesis,  due to the introduction of 5-OT and its agonists into the  nucleus raphe and hippocampus, may indicate the ambiguous  neurochemical effect of these substances, and the presence of a  non-serotoninergic component in the mechanism of anti-anxiolytic  action of derivatives of 1-(2-pyramidinyl)-piperazine.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: HOLZER MAY HAVE OWN STORY FOR PRISON READING  </P> <P> YOU CAN expect some books spotlighting the convicted Broadway producer Adela  Holzer. Since she pleaded guilty to a grand larceny rap Monday, she can be  sentenced to four years or at least 34 months in prison. (Adela already served  a previous term wherein she became friends with the imprisoned Jean Harris.)  </P> <P> Michael Alpert, who was Adela's theater press agent during her career as a  functioning producer, will write his own version -- "the true story of what  happened." (One of Adela's best and funniest shows was the priceless Terrence  McNally comedy "The Ritz.") Literary agent Betsy Nolan is already circulating  Alpert's manuscript to publishers and it has the title "Laid on the Willing  Only."  </P> <P> This is a quote from Thomas Jefferson about lotteries, which he described as "a  tax that was laid on the willing only." I assume this means that Adela took  money from people who were willing. (But did she have to tell them she was the  secret wife of David Rockefeller?)  </P> <P> This week in court, the judge asked Adela her birth date. She conferred with  her lawyers, then quietly inquired: "Can they tell it to the clerk privately?"  </P> <P> NOW ABOUT that fetching photograph of Donald and Ivana Trump stepping out of a  movie theater in Stamford, Conn., last Saturday night. (Did anybody bother to  find out what movie the Trumps saw? Well, they took in "Pretty Woman," starring  Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.)  </P> <P> Anyway, let me muse a second. Before going on vacation, I ran a story that  Ivana's side thought they had the goods on Donald in the matter of his possibly  keeping Marla Maples in an apartment in the Trump Tower. To be certain Donald  got to respond and refute, I made an early, firm appointment to talk to him at  a specific time. I called on the dot but he had departed. So naturally I didn't  get to offer Donald's side of this.  </P> <P> While away, I note he again accused me of being a tool of Ivana's press agent  and her lawyer, who he said, again, were "playing Liz like a fiddle." (Donald  has to get some new imagery; I guess we all do.)  </P> <P> I ask you -- who is it Donald plays like a fiddle? Could it be the New York  Post? Or do you really think that paper just happened to have a photographer at  the ready near the Stamford movie house last Saturday? Could such a tip  possibly have come from Donald? Or is the Post just prescient?  </P> <P> Reconciliation? Well, Ivana certainly wants it; she's funny that way. But she  still doesn't want it at any price (other women are a no-no) and she still  wants a new nuptial contract that is more equitable. Donald, meantime, just  might want things to cool down and going to the movies after alerting the Post  seemed like such a lovely idea. Then there is always La Publicite which, in his  mind, never hurts.  </P> <P> IVANA ON the cover of May's Vogue in lovely photos by Patrick Demarcelier,  overseen by Andre Leon Talley -- this is a real sweetheart story. The writer,  Vicki Woods, met Ivana several years ago in London, was prepared to dislike her  but ended full of admiration for a "self-assured woman who looked her age, 38."  </P> <P> When Vicki met Ivana again, after the recent unpleasantness, she found her  "fragile and delicate, with a sense of being hunted." However, she says Ivana  now looks "vulnerable. She looks about 15 pounds thinner than I remember, also  15 years younger."  </P></p>

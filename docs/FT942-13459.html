			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Observer in South Africa: Free, fair, fuddled Commonwealth observers once monitored elections to see if they were 'free and fair'; no more. Still smarting from the bashing they took after giving the nod to Kenya's December 1992 election in the face of widespread electoral abuse, the observers in South Africa  - led by former Jamaican premier Michael Manley  - have given themselves plenty of leeway. Their terms of reference require them to  - take a deep breath  - 'consider the various factors impinging on the credibility of the electoral process as a whole and determine in its own judgment whether the conditions exist for a free expression of will by the electors and if the result of the election reflects the wishes of the people'. Simple, really.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Where paper profits are growing up a gum tree THE MONKEY puzzle is probably Chile's best-known contribution to the world of trees. But its commercial use being prohibited, the country's timber business is built on the pine and other softwoods that thrive in its temperate climate, writes David Lascelles in Santiago. Five hundred miles south of the capital, near the provincial town of Los Angeles, a newer industry is evolving round the eucalyptus. Once imported from Australia, the tree is now a familiar sight in the rolling hills of Chile's south central region. The eucalyptus has taken well to Chile. In the right conditions it grows as much as a foot a month, reaching a harvestable height of 25 metres within eight to ten years. Much of the pioneering work is being done by Santa Fe Group, a wood pulping joint venture 60 per cent owned by Royal Dutch Shell, and 20 per cent each by Scott Paper and Citibank, which converted some of its outstanding Chilean debt into the investment. Founded in the late 1980s, Santa Fe now owns 49,000 hectares (120,000 acres) of plantations, of which 32,500 are planted. According to Mr Ian Powell, resource manager in the forestry division, much of the land needed thorough restoration before it could be used. Years of cattle farming had compacted the soil, requiring it to be ploughed to a depth of 80 cm to loosen it up. Large quantities of fertiliser and weedkiller were also needed to 'control the competition', as he puts it. In the nurseries on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the company is developing two strains: eucalyptus globulus and the more frost-resistant eucalyptus nitens. Considerable work has gone into genetic improvement using cloning technology developed by Shell researchers at their laboratory in Sittingbourne in Kent. The highly automated nurseries have a capacity for 10m seedlings, which are grown under wide net tents and watered with a special mix of nutrients fed by sprinklers. The seedlings are kept for up to 10 months before being planted out. The nursery and plantations will eventually provide all the raw material for Santa Fe's pulping plant to the west of Los Angeles. But at the moment the 18-month-old facility still has to buy in a third of its annual 800,000-cubic metre requirement from other sources. The importance of eucalyptus is that it provides a ready source of short-fibre pulp, as opposed to the long fibre in pine wood. Short fibre has special uses, such as tissues. The plant's output is 250,000 tonnes a year and the bulk of its Dollars 100m-a-year sales go to Scott Paper affiliates. Although Santa Fe marks an advance for the Chilean timber industry, its timing has been bad. Mr Nick Whalley, the executive vice president, expects recent softness of the pulp market to delay the venture's move into profit. 'The short term profitability is not good,' he says, 'but we project substantial financial returns two to three years from now.' One of the heavy costs in establishing the plant has been environmental control, which Mr Pedro Navarette, the plant's environmental engineer, estimates to have accounted for Dollars 28m of the investment. Like many foreign ventures, Santa Fe is expected to abide by the highest environmental standards, while local, state-owned competitors have more leeway.</p>

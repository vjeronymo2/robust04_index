			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> THE STORY OF CHRIST'S BIRTH TAKES ON MANY INCARNATIONS;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY: THE NATIVITY CONTAINS ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IT A CLASSIC FOR  THOSE OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE.  </P> <P> The tale has all of the elements of the "good story" that a high-school English  teacher preaches about -- strong character development, rich plot, a sub-plot,  good setting, pathos and even animals.  </P> <P> And for every person captivated with this tale, there are the small figures of  Mary, Joseph, the baby and the other Nativity characters that dominated some  segment of their childhood.  </P> <P> There never appeared a need to enter the debate of a creche on public property,  roped off for security. The Balboa Park Nativity scene had never met my  personal criteria for a viable creche. Yet last week, as young and old hands  meticulously wiped away the paint sprayed by vandals on the park figures, the  Balboa Park creche took life. For in my lifetime I have concluded that a true  creche is one that has been touched by human hands.  </P> <P> The Immigrant's Nativity. Although they vary in size, dimension and hue, there  is always the same underlying narrative that accompanies the immigrant's  Nativity. The figures of Mary, Joseph and the baby have been gingerly  transported by hand by those who fled Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Poland or  Germany. As a childhood friend's Polish mother explained, she had carried the  tiny figures from her parents' village to the new world where she hoped they  would become part of her children's history.  </P> <P> The Monsignor's Creche. Generations of children growing up in a northwest  Detroit parish, deep in a blue-collar neighborhood, received an early education  in art history from a generous monsignor. Born into a wealthy automotive  family, the monsignor passed his vacations roaming the European countryside for  religious art. His parish church was embellished with ornate church kneelers  and chairs and magnificent oils and sculptures depicting scenes from history  that absorbed little minds restless during Mass.  </P> <P> On the first Sunday of Advent, the monsignor's creche graced the church lawn.  Majestic and beautifully carved, it shared a rich history with a neighborhood  of first- and second-generation immigrants. Time has not dwindled how splendid  was Mary in her flowing blue gown, gently smiling at her child. No railing or  rope separated the onlookers from the figures of this creche. One remembers the  monsignor himself taking small children closer to the figures to partake in the  story.  </P> <P> The Newlywed's Creche. Purchased during World War II by the newlyweds at the  J.L. Hudson Store, this terra cotta set was as beautiful as it was fragile and  held an important place in a front room. The young couple who purchased the  terra cotta figures could not have foreseen the touching by the little hands of  seven children or the misplaced balls or careless bumps that would alter the  creche's appearance.  </P> <P> Each December, the family would carefully unwrap each piece from the J.L.  Hudson box. Then they would evaluate its condition. Usually, someone was sent  down to the store to get a new shepherd or king, or to see if they had a cow or  lamb that could substitute for the damaged ones. In later years, the creche was  an ensemble of love. With no regard to scale or size, the subsequent additions  were an assortment of forms.  </P> <P> Yet, the original central figures of Mary, Joseph, Jesus and the Angel Gabriel  of the newlywed's creche survived. True, Mary's nose had disappeared, the Angel  Gabriel sported only one wing and much of the paint on all the figures had  eroded, but they had served a family well, to tell and retell the story of the  Nativity each Christmastide.  </P> <P> The Lincoln Log Nativity. Found years ago in a married-student housing unit in  Rochester, N.Y., this set was the inspiration of a young mother who allowed  three red-headed boys under four years of age to play with it as a way to  occupy the time during the cold and snowy month of December. Every afternoon  after naptime, as the wind and snow whipped through the housing unit, these  three little boys constructed with Lincoln Logs a different form of stable for  the weary travelers to Bethlehem.  </P> <P> The Woolworth Special. Purchased in 1975 at the Fashion Valley Woolworth's,  this Nativity scene is constructed of rubber with painted exterior. Over the  years, it has been fondled and lovingly touched by countless hands each  Christmas. The purchaser always felt she would replace it with a "better set"  -- upgrade, so to say. The years, however, have diminished the desire to  replace this set.  </P> <P> The Hanukkah friend, Jane, now 9, who always calls in early December to note  that she can "help trim the tree," has spent hours arranging the Woolworth's  Special. She prefers the round set-up approach -- the bambino in the center,  and everyone in a circle about him. However, her 9-year-old gracious hostess  promptly rearranges the set, according to her own liking, the moment Jane  returns home.  </P> <P> Last year, poor post-Christmas packing or carelessness left the kneeling  shepherd from the Woolworth's special out of the box. Like the traveler left  behind, the shepherd has spent the year in the office desk drawer greeting  those who search its contents for scissors and the stapler.  </P> <P> Shall we upgrade the Woolworth's special, asks the father? The mother thinks  not. She points to its now-developed history of a family and its friends.  Moreover, responds the mother, an "upgraded" set could be intimidating.  </P> <P> For you see, the mother feels that Nativity scenes are meant to be touched by  small hands.  </P> <P> Mary, she believes, would concur.  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Central TV chief sees new rules on takeovers MR LESLIE HILL, chairman and chief executive of Central Independent Television, predicted yesterday that the ownership rules governing ITV companies would be changed to allow the nine largest companies to take each other over. 'I think we have won the commercial arguments. The ownership rules will change because they will have to change. We are not dealing here with commercial logic we are dealing with political intricacies,' he said. He was speaking as Central announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 15.1m) for the six months to the end of June, a rise of 9 per cent. Turnover fell 6 per cent to Pounds 149m (Pounds 158.6m). Mr Hill has long campaigned to change the takeover rules. He believes that there should be four or five ITV companies rather than the present 15. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is to chair a ministerial committee meeting later this autumn on the issue. Central's earnings per share increased by 8 per cent to 37.5p (34.7p) and the interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 11p (10p). The company has increased its share of the ITV advertising and sponsorship revenue from 14.83 per cent to 15.26 per cent. It is believed that Central's cumulative advertising share so far this year has been the highest in the network, the first time this has happened for such a period. Mr Hill yesterday predicted real growth of 2-3 per cent for the ITV system, a considerable improvement on the past few years when advertising sales have been flat at best. 'There are encouraging signs but its patchy and short term,' he warned. Mr Andy Allan, who has just been promoted to managing director of the Central group, said yesterday he expected more competition for audiences to come from the BBC over the next 12 months. Mr Hill said the company was continuing to review the progress of the new media of satellite and cable television. 'I am sure we will be in the new media. It is a question of doing the right thing, with the right partners at the right time,' Mr Hill said. Central won its franchise back with an annual bid of Pounds 2,000 but also has to pay 11 per cent of qualifying revenue to the government. The company will probably pay between Pounds 22m and Pounds 26m to the government this year, compared with a levy payment of Pounds 22m in 1991.</p>

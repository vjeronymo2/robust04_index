			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Andean Pact still split on outside tariff  -FT writers on a growing market's oldest problem Trade is growing rapidly among the five countries of the Andean Pact but its member governments remain divided over an issue that has dogged them since the trade grouping was founded 25 years ago - a common external tariff. Preliminary estimates from the group - comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela with a combined gross domestic product of more than Dollars 130bn - show a 30 per cent jump in trade among its members in 1993 after an increase of 20 per cent in 1992. Intra-regional trade, including fuel products, reached a record Dollars 2.89bn last year, against only Dollars 1bn as recently as 1989. The grouping has been particularly important for a growing band of small and medium-sized companies selling non-traditional products. Colombian businesses view the Andean region as a good testing ground for more difficult markets and see the enlarged market as important in encouraging foreign investment and cross-border joint ventures. Colombia is the chief exporter to other countries within the group, responsible for 41 per cent of all intra-regional exports last year. With imports to Colombia from Ecuador and Venezuela also rising rapidly, infrastructure on these two borders is already under strain. Special border posts created by the pact provide frontier services for transporting goods but there are still many difficulties caused by differences in national legislation. Air services between all Andean countries have improved substantially, with several regional carriers now flying between the main cities. More good news for the pact came last month with the decision by the Peruvian government of President Alberto Fujimori, which temporarily withdrew in August 1992, to return as a fully-fledged member by the end of the year. Its withdrawal had been prompted by what it called unfair competition. Ministers criticised the subsidies they claimed Venezuela and Colombia were granting to exporters and said Peruvian companies were put at a disadvantage by higher energy costs and public service tariffs. Although it is not clear that these issues have been resolved, Peru has said it will gradually rejoin the free trade zone, applying from this month a zero tariff to products previously paying 5 per cent and by December to products now paying 10 per cent. The central relationship within the pact is that between Venezuela and Colombia: trade between the two rose 45 per cent in 1993 and Colombia's President Cesar Gaviria said last week that bilateral trade would reach an annual Dollars 2bn very soon. The two are also talking to Mexico over the establishment of the so-called Group of Three, which would join Colombia and Venezuela in a trade accord with Mexico. Ecuador has already said it would like to join once it gets off the ground. Final negotiations over the G3 have proved slower than expected, in part because the three-month-old Venezuelan government of President Rafael Caldera has had other priorities. When Mr Caldera met Mr Gaviria last week - the latter's eighth visit to Caracas - the two leaders re-confirmed their commitment to a G3 agreement. Venezuelan officials say Mr Caldera recognises the importance of free trade with Colombia and has indicated he will not let problems - such as border disputes, transhipment of cocaine and Colombian guerrilla action along the border - hurt trade relations. Despite the perception that relations with Venezuela are more important, Mr Gaviria's administration has also kept up pressure for the Andean common external tariff to come into effect as soon as possible. The common tariff was supposed to have been effective at the start of 1992, but a decision has been postponed several times and it is far from clear an accord can be reached soon. The talks centre on a a four-tier external tariff of between 5 and 20 per cent, which some external observers regard as excessively complicated. Bolivia already has a two-tier tariff structure with a maximum of 10 per cent, and is likely to keep it despite the potential for Bolivia to be used as a platform for entry to the free trade zone. Ecuador has been insisting on important exceptions to the common external tariff which others find unacceptable. The Peruvian government wants it set at a flat 15 per cent - the rate it now levies on 98 per cent of imports. Most of Peru's manufacturers and exporters would prefer a staggered regime - but the Fujimori government is committed to a flat rate, which the International Monetary Fund and World Bank also favour. Some observers reckon that the longer the decision on the external tariff is delayed, the less likely it will be that an agreement will be secured. While growing fast, trade among Andean countries is still a relatively small proportion - about 5 per cent - of the region's overall trade. Meanwhile, other groupings - such as the G3 and Mercosur, the southern cone market which Bolivia wants to join - are also growing in significance and exerting a centrifugal force on the pact's members.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bethlehem--QUDS PRESS--Authorized Palestinian  sources have informed QUDS PRESS that the Palestine National  Liberation Movement, Fatah, and the Palestinian People's Party  [PPP] (formerly the Palestinian Communist Party) are about to  agree on a political program that will identify the bases of  future Palestinian action, thus ending bilateral differences.    Hanna 'Amirah, a prominent PPP official in the occupied  territories, said that intensive talks are currently under way  between both sides under President Yasir 'Arafat and PPP  Secretary General Bashir al-Barghuthi, who is currently in Tunis  at the head of a large PPP delegation.    'Amirah described the talks as "positive and constructive,"  adding that they are being held in a "cordial and fraternal  atmosphere." However, he has not set a date for signing this  program.    In a statement to a QUDS PRESS correspondent, 'Amirah said  that the bilateral talks are focusing on the delineation of a  higher Palestinian authority, a comprehensive negotiating  strategy, and the criteria to be heeded when the future  Palestinian National Authority is formed. This authority,  'Amirah noted, must represent all colors of the Palestinian  spectrum. The citizens of the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip, women, and clergymen must be involved in this authority.  The composition of this authority must also heed the factor of  territorial representation, as he put it.    'Amirah said that a detailed discussion of the formation of  this authority has been postponed pending the signing of the  program of action by both sides. He added: "Both sides must  now reach such an agreement to settle all contentious political  issues."    The Palestinian official ruled out the PPP's possible  participation in the Palestinian committees negotiating with  Israel at present, saying: "This is contingent upon the  Palestinian leadership's compliance with the recent PLO  Executive Committee decisions, which spelled out the bases of  negotiations."    The PPP is considered Fatah's major partner in the  negotiations with Israel. However, it has suspended its  participation in the negotiations since the ninth round of the  Washington talks due to substantive differences on the bases of  the negotiating process.    The PPP, along with other Palestinian factions, is demanding  democratic reforms in the Palestinian decisionmaking process.  It is also demanding changes in the way the negotiations with  Israel are being conducted. Palestinian reformists fear that  these secret negotiations could be a mere attempt to fragment  their ranks, particularly in the aftermath of their launching a  follow-up committee to press ahead with their demands with the  Palestinian leadership.</p>

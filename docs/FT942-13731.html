			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Irish firepower keeps IRA on the run: Michael Cassell witnesses a hunt for guns in the gorse on the republic's side of the border Lt Col Michael Lucey, commanding officer of the Irish army's 29th Infantry Battalion, casts a professional eye across a remote County Monaghan hillside. The gorse bushes might conceal a rabbit warren or an AK47 rifle. Beyond a line of police officers beating the undergrowth in search of concealed weaponry lies the River Blackwater and the border with Northern Ireland; an ill-defined, 282-mile-long line on the map, the only land boundary the UK shares with a foreign state. Monaghan thrusts far north, close to the same latitude as Belfast, leaving three of Northern Ireland's six counties to close in around it. Its geography puts it in the front line of UK-Irish efforts to stop the IRA waging war in the north from safe refuges in the south. Lt Col Lucey's career has taken him to the Lebanon, Cyprus and Egypt, far from the muddy fields which stretch away to Figanny Bridge and Killyfaragh. Shouting to be heard above the noise of an Alouette helicopter hovering overhead, he reckons the IRA is no match for Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian Lebanese faction. UK security forces on the other side of the woods see things differently, given the deaths and injuries inflicted upon Royal Ulster Constabulary and army personnel by the world's most technically advanced terrorists. Even so, security forces on both sides of the border say their relationship is better than ever and that their combined onslaught means the IRA is under intense pressure. This week's joint operation in the UK and the Irish Republic, intended to strike at the heart of IRA finances, represented a striking public example of the partnership in action. Yet it is not free of new disagreements or old suspicions. Privately, Garda (Irish police) criticise the British for manning easily targeted, permanent border checkpoints which they say are provocative and disruptive, while the British still hint that the Irish are more enthusiastic about uncovering weapons than apprehending their fellow countrymen. But while some UK politicians demand more direct communication links - the UK army has to go through the Garda to talk to Irish army officers - forces on the ground claim they have few complaints about operational arrangements. The Irish anti-terrorism effort, whatever the perception in some quarters, is extensive, expensive - Irish taxpayers pay more per capita than those in Britain - and appears increasingly successful. Nobody would claim that 200 open border crossings and millions of acres of countryside which seamlessly stitch together two nation states could ever be rid of terrorist traffic. But Garda assistant commissioner Ned O'Dea, who is responsible for the national surveillance unit which targets terrorists, says there are no budget constraints: 'What we need, we get.' What he gets includes 1,000 police officers stationed along the border, 1,400 troops acting as back-up to the civil power and a Garda emergency response unit armed with Uzi machine guns, Heckler and Koch rifles and pump-action shotguns. Special Branch officers and undercover agents complete the set-up. Constant patrols, spot checks and searches last year around the republic yielded more than 500 firearms, nearly 27,000 rounds of ammunition and almost 4,000lbs of explosives. Together, says Mr O'Dea, 'they add up to a lot of lives saved'. There is no room for complacency, however, with the Garda yet to locate hundreds of rifles and machine guns along with rocket launchers, missiles, revolvers, ammunition, detonators and explosives all known to have been shipped into the republic nearly a decade ago. Though Garda and army personnel have been killed by the IRA, the Irish accept that the security forces to the north face a much greater threat. Mr O'Dea says: 'If a body lies on our side of the border we can simply walk up to it; if it's on the other side they fly over it and round it and only go in under heavy protection; it could be booby-trapped.' Neither do the Irish confront a border-area population that regards the security forces as legitimate enemy targets. Not that the people of Monaghan queue up to help the Garda. Chief Supt Tom Curran says: 'A great many people around here have no time at all for the IRA and want to see them defeated. But fear of reprisals on family members north or south of the border means they won't tip us off.' But there is a conviction the fight is being won and Mr O'Dea and Lt Col Lucey look forward to the day when the IRA has no hiding place left and both men can resume normal duties.</p>

She also warned  librarians not to become "cherished Queen Bees and warm and comfortable fairy  godmothers."  </P> <P> She was the author of five children's books, including the popular "Bluebonnets  for Lucinda" (1934) and was co-editor of "The Anthology of Children's  Literature" (1958 and 1970.)  </P> <P> A graduate of the Carnegie Library School in Pittsburgh, she joined the New  York Public Library in 1918 and served there until 1923 when she came to  California and married. She was children's librarian at the Los Angeles Public  Library in 1923-24 and at University Elementary School in 1924-25. She also  lectured at college and university library schools throughout the state.  </P> <P> She returned to the New York Public Library as superintendent of children's  literature in 1941, remained there until 1952 and then joined the UCLA  Department of English as a lecturer in children's literature.  </P> <P> When the UCLA School of Library Service opened in 1960, she was asked to join  the faculty by founding Dean Lawrence Clark Powell. She retired in 1965.  </P> <P> In the forward to her "Summoned by Books: Essays and Speeches by Frances Clarke  Sayers," Powell wrote of her "gift of celebration, of stamina, scholarship and  vision, the passion for people, especially young people, and for books, old and  new. . . ."  </P></p>

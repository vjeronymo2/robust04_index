			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attendance, breeding biology, and behavior will be monitored during the breeding season in marked and unmarked birds in plots at the South Farallon Islands so that recolonization responses at recolonization sites can be more effectively evaluated. Certain colonies with potential for future intensive monitoring efforts may be examined in greater detail, including reproductive success. This information will be important in evaluating and modifying the social attraction methods used at the restoration sites. Information that is only available at this larger, more accessible, and closely monitored common murre colony, including known-aged common murre information, will be used to refine and assess recolonization efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Actions:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Social attraction techniques will be used to recolonize common murres at Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks. The use of decoys and tape-recordings, similar to those used elsewhere to encourage recolonization by several seabird species, is proposed (Podolsky and Kress 1989, Kress 1990, Podolsky 1985). Preliminary work will consist of selecting observation points to view recolonization sites, constructing and installing observation blinds, obtaining access permits, and purchasing needed equipment. Periodic observations of winter attendance of colonies will also be conducted in fall and winter 1994&hyph;1995. Aerial surveys of central California breeding seabird colonies and periodic observations of breeding colonies from vantage points will be conducted in the spring and summer of 1995. Additional aerial reconnaissance of Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks will be conducted to obtain photographs for mapping the restoration sites. Reconnaissance trips to Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks will take place to determine equipment and procedures needed to deploy social attraction equipment. Ladders may be installed to allow safe access onto the colonies for project personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decoys and audio equipment will be placed on the rocks in fall 1995 before common murres begin to frequent nesting islands. Recordings of common murre breeding vocalizations will be made at the Farallon NWR. Life-size common murre decoys will be positioned on suitable nesting habitat. The decoys will be secured to the rock in a fashion that simulates occupied common murre colonies. Several omnidirectional weather resistant loudspeakers will be positioned at the recolonization sites. Endless tape loops or compact disks of California common murre vocalizations will be played throughout the breeding season from December to August. Daily observations of the recolonization sites will begin once decoys have been deployed and will continue through July. Devil's Slide Rock will be observed from the mainland using a portable blind and telescope. San Pedro Rock observations will occur from a blind located on the rock, from a boat, and/or from the mainland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data collected will include common murre arrival date, number of common murres present, behavior of common murres, interaction with other species (e.g., Brandt's Cormorants ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phalacrocorax penicillatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )), location on rock, attendance patterns, and presence of predators. Prospecting common murres will be plotted by location on maps of the recolonization site. One or more aerial photographic censuses of the central California common murre colonies will be conducted annually between May and June. The censuses will be used to calculate annual breeding population sizes at the recolonization sites and nearby reference colonies in central California, compare trends between years, and assist in determining numbers of common murres not visible from the mainland or boats. Social attractants will be displayed through the breeding season until after common murres normally leave the breeding sites, usually in August. The decoys and audio equipment will be collected after all bird breeding on the rock has been completed. Equipment will be checked, cleaned, and replaced as necessary. The equipment will be redeployed during the following fall before common murres begin to frequent nesting islands. Monitoring of recolonization sites will continue annually after the first social attractants are deployed. The restoration efforts will be evaluated annually and revised as necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The breeding behavior and colony attendance of common murres will be monitored at four nearby colonies in the Point Reyes National Seashore and/or the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary: Point Reyes, Point Resistance, Double Point Rocks, and Miller Point Rocks. Several variables will be monitored to allow comparison to recolonization sites, including population size and status, attendance patterns, timing, breeding phenology and success, behavior, interaction with other species, impacts of predators, and human and other disturbances. The population size and status would be determined using similar methods employed by Birkhead and Nettleship (1980), Gaston et al. (1983), Mudge (1988), and Hatch and Hatch (1989). Only subcolonies that can be viewed from a safe location will be selected. Reconnaissance work and preliminary observations and logistics would begin in spring-summer 1995. This work would consist of obtaining access permits to conduct work, selecting subcolonies to be studied, selecting plots within subcolonies, and conducting aerial surveys of the colony. The monitoring period would parallel that followed at Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

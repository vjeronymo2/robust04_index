			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Educational Efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Review of Consumer Education Issues in Citizen Petitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two of the three petitions submitted discussed the benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of educational efforts for the public and health professionals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focusing on the prevention of accidental pediatric iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning. The AAPCC petition and the NDMA petition advocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational efforts and outlined specific actions as described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The AAPCC petition.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AAPCC petition called for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiation of an FDA educational campaign for four different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segments of the population. The four target segments are: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parents, babysitters, daycare providers, and other consumers; (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatricians; (3) obstetricians; and (4) other health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals such as physicians, others who can prescribe iron,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pharmacists. The petition suggested that pediatricians  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discuss the dangers of an iron overdose with parents at the 6-month checkup, and that obstetricians inform mothers at the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postpartum checkup.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NDMA petition.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the fall of 1993, NDMA in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperation with CPSC, developed and launched a national consumer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education campaign to be carried out in conjunction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary labeling and packaging measures (described above in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section I.D. of this document) that were undertaken by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members of NDMA and NNFA. The purpose of the campaign, as stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the petition, is to inform adults about how to protect children from accidental iron poisoning. The three major themes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the educational campaign mirror some of the messages in NDMA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and NNFA's voluntary warning statements for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Adult awareness of the dangers to children if iron is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidentally swallowed in excess,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reclose the child-resistant package after every use,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Keep iron-containing products out of the reach of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NDMA and CPSC began the educational campaign by distributing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> video and print news releases, radio news releases in English and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spanish, and public service announcements emphasizing the three-pronged message. The public service announcements are also being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sent to consumer, health, and women's magazines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Agency Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA agrees with the petitioners that the public needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed of the dangers of pediatric iron poisoning through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public education efforts. Such efforts can be one important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> element in combating a cause of injury and deaths that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected thousands of children over the last approximately 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. Thus, FDA commends NDMA and CPSC for their joint efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in developing and distributing a national educational campaign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targeting accidental iron poisoning, to coincide with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary packaging and labeling measures for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that have been undertaken by the members of NDMA and NNFA. FDA believes that the themes of this campaign are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate and are responsive to a fundamental need that exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for more awareness among adults of the dangers of pediatric iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning and of the means to prevent these poisonings. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the seriousness of the problem, i.e., accidental iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion is the leading cause of poisoning deaths among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children, FDA intends to contribute to educating the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, FDA is developing materials for a public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information campaign that would address AAPCC's request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complement NDMA and CPSC's educational efforts by emphasizing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same awareness and prevention elements as the NDMA/CPSC campaign,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Iron-containing products can seriously injure or even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kill young children who accidentally swallow them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reclose the child-resistant package completely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every time iron-containing products are opened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Keep all containers of iron-containing products out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reach of children  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all the time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's campaign will also address steps that should be taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by adults if an accidental ingestion of iron occurs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When children accidentally ingest iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, the attending person should quickly call a poison control center and follow their instructions, or take the child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an emergency room.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Although the first symptoms, vomiting and diarrhea, may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur within 30 minutes, and these symptoms may be followed by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearance of recovery, the child may still be in danger.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, immediate professional consultation is critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDA materials will include print pieces available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution to different audiences, such as a backgrounder, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flyer, an FDA Consumer  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> magazine article, and camera-ready  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newspaper columns. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA Medical Bulletin,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which has 1,000,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician subscribers, is another vehicle that can be used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publicize this message.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The diversity of the audiences to be targeted by FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information campaign will include the AAPCC's suggested target  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations. The FDA backgrounder will be a detailed handout for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health professionals and consumer organizations. The flyer will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a short piece conveying the elements of FDA's message in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple and concise manner for use in the home by parents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grandparents, and babysitters. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA Consumer  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> article will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reach the 23,000 subscribers to the magazine, a group that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes physicians and other health professionals, educators,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporters, and consumers. The camera-ready newspaper columns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be distributed to 10,000 smaller-circulation newspapers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide. In addition, FDA intends to provide information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer newsletter editors and consumers through ``Dear Editor'' letters and ``Dear Consumer'' letters about the efforts to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidental pediatric iron poisoning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Different offices in FDA, such as the Office of Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affairs and the Office of Consumer Affairs, and offices of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Health and Human Services will assist with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of these materials. FDA intends to utilize its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff of public affairs specialists to distribute these materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the widely varied constituencies with whom these specialists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently interact, such as other government agencies at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal, State, and local levels, advocacy organizations, trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations, consumer groups, health professional organizations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other interested groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has carefully considered the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action will not have a significant impact on the human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

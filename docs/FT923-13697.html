			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Italians to lose their 'golden' pensions ITALIAN pensioners have long been the most privileged in Europe. Yesterday's reforms approved by the new Amato government are a belated attempt to reduce the state's generosity and bring Italy more into line with European Community practice. The main innovations are the raising of the pensionable age to 65 years for both men and women, an increase in the minimum contribution period from 15 to 20 years, and equalisation of state and private schemes. There have been three previous proposals for reform since 1984. All suggested changes similar to those announced yesterday but foundered because no party was prepared to court unpopularity by reducing benefits. The latest proposals, to be presented to parliament as a decree, stand a better chance of acceptance simply because the budget can no longer afford the existing system. Pensions for 14.2m people account for more than 80 per cent of social spending and are equivalent to 14 per cent of gross domestic product. If the system were to continue, pensions would absorb the entire budget in under 20 years. Alternatively, it would require something close to a 50 per cent contribution from salaries to balance contributions and payments within 30 years. Until now, women have been able to retire at 55 and men at 60. The reforms envisage a range of incentives for people to stay at work until 65 and disincentives to discourage early retirement. Some workers in arduous jobs such as mining will be excepted, and allowed to retire five years early. There is also an attempt to tidy up abuses of early retirement in the state sector, where men have been able to retire after only 20 years' work, as opposed to 35 years in the private sector. A recent study showed 87 per cent of all state employees retired early. The authorities are also committed to examine claims for early retirement on health grounds with greater rigour. No fewer than 4.2m, one third of all pensioners, receive disability pensions, many of which have been granted as political favours or through payments to compliant health officials. The government also intends to stimulate the growth of the undeveloped pension fund business. This is seen as the most effective way both of expanding Italy's capital markets and of ending the anomaly whereby state employees have no pension fund - their pensions have been covered out of current annual budget expenditure. At present a state employee can receive up to 94 per cent of final salary. There is now likely to be a ceiling of 80 per cent. Many state employees have abused the pension scheme and taken advantage of early retirement to take up other jobs because they have been poorly paid by the public administration.</p>

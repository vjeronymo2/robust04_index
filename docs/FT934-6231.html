			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Economic policy defeat for Brussels: EU finance ministers force changes in paper on growth and jobs The European Commission yesterday bowed to opposition from EU finance ministers and published a watered-down version of its guidelines to boost economic growth and halt rising unemployment. The Commission's document avoids earlier calls for a reduction of 2-3 per cent in short-term interest rates, steers away from recommendations to broaden the tax system to pay for reductions in employment taxes, and retreats from the specific goal of creating 15m new jobs by the end of the century. Although senior Commission officials played down the extent of the political defeat, other officials warned that a similar fate might overtake Mr Jacques Delors' White Paper on competitiveness and growth. The Commission president's long-waited paper is supposed to be the centrepiece of the European summit early next month. European finance ministers picked holes in a summary of the Commission president's White Paper at a meeting in Brussels last Monday, particularly his tentative proposals for work-sharing as a means of alleviating unemployment. Mr Delors is said to be determined to bypass finance ministers and deliver his paper direct to heads of government at the December 10-11 summit. The Commission's 'Broad Guidelines for the Economic Policies' of the 12 member states was published according to provisions in the Maastricht treaty. Commission officials said the document had taken on added significance as a framework for policy-making after the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism. The guidelines agreed by the Commission yesterday include a general call for cuts in interest rates, wage restraint, lower budget deficits and government debt, as well as higher investment and alterations in the tax system. The paper must still be approved by EU finance ministers. The only specific targets include an average inflation rate of no more than 2-3 per cent in the EU by 1996, against 3.8 per cent this year, and wage rises to be kept below one percentage point of productivity growth. The paper also urges member states in 1994 to prevent any further deterioration in their budget deficits. Mr Henning Christophersen, European commissioner for economics, said there was never any intention to set specific macro-economic targets. 'This is not a planned economy,' he said.</p>

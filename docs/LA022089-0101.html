			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE POLICE RAID EXHIBITION, CONFISCATE 6 NUDE PAINTINGS  </P> <P> Chinese police have raided an exhibition of nude paintings influenced by  Tibetan Buddhism and shown to a shocked Beijing public, artists said Sunday.  </P> <P> A security van with flashing lights rushed to the Beijing Artists Gallery on  Saturday evening. Uniformed policemen confiscated six paintings and questioned  artist Cao Yong, a witness said.  </P> <P> The exhibit had been open for 5 days and was being packed up when police  arrived. The raid followed the closing of several nude photographic exhibitions  in the eastern city of Nanking recently.  </P> <P> Artists said the authorities wanted to put the brakes on a new wave of artistic  freedom that is taking China by storm.  </P> <P> Earlier Saturday, officials from the legal department of Beijing's cultural  office visited Cao's exhibition to tell him that members of the public had  complained.  </P> <P> One painting shows a heap of naked women below Buddhist-monklike figures and  another depicts a woman dragging two men by their genitalia out of a fire.  </P> <P> Friends said Cao, 26, an ethnic Han Chinese -- had spent a lot of time in Tibet  and was sympathetic to the Himalayan region's culture and religion.  </P> <P> "The authorities are still not sure of the dividing line between art and  pornography in China," said one avant-garde artist.  </P> <P> Artists won a major cultural battle last month, opening a controversial  exhibition of nude paintings in Beijing's national art gallery. Huge crowds  flocked to see it.  </P> <P> The show was followed this month by a major exhibition of avant-garde art that  was closed temporarily after the artists angered the authorities with  performances of "action art."  </P></p>

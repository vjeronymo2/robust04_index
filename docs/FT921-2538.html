			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tide may turn as recession bites - South-East: The question marks over a clutch of Tory marginals ACROSS the rich green fields, the shopping malls and the drive-in Mcdonalds of southern England, the warm tide of Thatcherism rolled in during the 1980s, bringing prosperity. Now, for thousands of home counties voters hit by recession, the tide of wealth has ebbed - placing important question marks over whether the Tories can hold on to a clutch of marginal seats strung across traditional Conservative territory. If Labour is to have any chance of forming the next government, it must capture at least half a dozen marginal constituencies in the south - places such as Slough and Swindon, Basildon and Dover, and the two Southampton seats. Neil Kinnock's party faces a tough struggle, but Labour has been helped greatly by the regional pattern of the recession. In contrast to the 1980-81 downturn, high interest rates and sluggish demand have affected the service-based economy of the south more than heavy industry in the north. Starting from a much lower base, between February 1990 and January 1992, the numbers out of work rose 210 per cent in Berkshire, 143 per cent in Essex, 131 per cent in Hampshire and 127 per cent in East Sussex. On Merseyside, by contrast, the much higher unemployment rate has risen by a relatively modest 17 per cent in the last two years. In Slough, one of the most crucial marginals where the Conservatives are defending a 4,090 majority, the business mood is subdued. Leslie Robinson, head of the Slough Chamber of Commerce, says job losses have been felt across the board, from engineering to financial services, although he sees glimmerings of an upturn in a recent pick-up in local order books. Mr Robinson says of the Conservatives: 'They are fighting an uphill battle. They banked on being able to demonstrate quite clearly that the economy was out of recession. But we don't see that. To some extent, that has left them exposed.' John Watts, a jovial accountant who took the seat for the Tories in 1983, says he is confident of winning with a reduced majority. Eddie Lopez, his Labour challenger, claims that early opinion polling puts his party ahead with a double digit percentage lead. These are still, of course, early days. Speaking of the many who are still undecided, Mr Watts says: 'There are a lot of people who voted Tory last time, and whose instincts are still Tory. We have to convince them that they should follow their instincts.' He admits, however, that 'errors of judgment' in the government's handling of the late 1980s boom have made the pain worse. With a mortgage of Pounds 145,000 taken out near the interest rate trough in 1988, Mr Watts says he, too, is feeling the squeeze. In Southampton, John Denham, Labour candidate for the Itchen constituency, says concern over unemployment, housing repossessions and falling incomes have given Labour an early campaign lead. Mr Denham, a 38-year old consultant, claims: 'A large number of people who voted Tory last time have now come over to us.' Speaking of rising debt problems for individuals and small businesses, Mr Denham says: 'A lot of people are no longer secure. They feel betrayed.' James Hill, Conservative MP for Southampton Test since 1979, defending a 7,000 majority, is confident of holding the seat. But, in a sign of the Tories' overall defensiveness, he says additional economic turbulence caused by the last few months of uncertainty over the election date has made him a supporter of fixed-term parliaments. Peter Beebe, director-general of the Southampton Chamber of Commerce, says a 'cold draught' has blown up the Solent. High interest rates to beat inflation have exacted an 'enormous price'. 'It has curtailed investment, driven away consumer confidence and frightened people from spending money, let alone borrowing it,' Mr Beebe says. Local business fears that a Labour government might lead to 'high and destructive taxation'. But Mr Beebe says that the pragmatic Labour-controlled Southampton council - from which both Mr Denham and Alan Whitehead, the Labour candidate for Southampton Test, are drawn - is a good example of how a 'sensibly moderate' Labour administration might work nation-ally. In another 1980s boom town, Swindon - where Labour, as in Slough, needs a 4 per cent swing to unseat the Conservatives - the downturn has raised the spirits of the opposition. Jim d'Avila, the Labour candidate who is chairman of the local council's economic development committee, says: 'People are suffering and feel threatened. They're frightened that they may be next.' The Conservatives' task across the Tory heartlands is to focus on a different set of voters' fears: the uncertainties associated with a prospective Labour government. But the party will have to make a double effort to convince people like Ian Devine, the hard-hit proprietor of a Southampton pine furniture shop, that it is worth sticking with the Tories. Mr Devine, who has had the 'sale' posters in the window ever since he opened his shop a year ago, says he was 'forced' into setting up his own business after being made unemployed. 'People are hanging on to their money. They don't want to spend it,' says Mr Devine gloomily. 'It will be a very close election.'</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ruhrkohle confirms cut in jobs RUHRKOHLE, Germany's largest coal producer, confirmed yesterday that 14,000 jobs would be axed in the next two years because of the worsening steel crisis. Sales for 1992 fell DM900m to DM12.8bn (Dollars 8bn). The company, which receives heavy state subsidies, reported a loss of DM78m against a DM20m loss the previous year. Ruhrkohle said it was hard hit by declining orders from steel groups, with unsold stocks in 1992 amounting to between 3m and 3.5m tonnes of coal. It said it was particularly affected by the closure of a coke plant by Klockner, the steel group which recently agreed to capacity cuts to push through a debt-relief scheme. The company reduced its production capacity by 9.5 per cent to 42.8m tonnes of coal, coke and lignite. Over 6,000 jobs were cut in 1992. Last month, Ruhrkohle closed a coke works in Essen, in the Ruhr valley, where 1,000 workers were employed. It plans to shut down the largest part of a coke works in Hassel by the end of October. The threat of closure continues to hang over the Aden/Monopol mine in Bergkamen, where 8,000 coal miners are employed. The company said it had to speed up its restructuring.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAVAZOS SAYS STUDENTS NEED ENGLISH TO LEARN AND GETS EARFUL OF CRITICISM  </P> <P> Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos told educators from this Texas-Mexico  border area today that students who do not speak English are not ready to  learn, and drew swift criticism.  </P> <P> Cavazos, speaking to about 1,500 Laredo principals and teachers, urged them to  get parents more involved in education and to make sure students have a command  of English.  </P> <P> "Parental involvement and language competency are basic," Cavazos said. "If  that child cannot speak English the first day of school, that child is not  ready to learn."  </P> <P> In a panel discussion afterward, South Texas superintendents took issue with  Cavazos.  </P> <P> To rousing applause, La Joya Supt. Robert Zamora called the secretary's remarks  "disabling." Zamora said students are capable of learning in other languages.  </P></p>

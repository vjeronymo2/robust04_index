			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT OF UNITED EDUCATION &amp; SOFTWARE INC. RESIGNS  </P> <P> United Education &amp; Software Inc., the parent of embattled trade-school  operator United Education &amp; Software, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  reorganization last December, said Aaron Cohen resigned Friday as president and  chief executive officer.  </P> <P> Cohen was replaced by United Education's chairman, Stanley R. Schoen.  </P> <P> Cohen also announced plans to resign as president and chief executive of the  company's subsidiary, but that must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court,  the company said. Cohen will remain on the boards of directors of the parent  and subsidiary and will serve as a consultant to both.  </P> <P> United Education's troubles started in 1988 when a government probe uncovered  major foul-ups at its former student loan-processing subsidiary, including  failure to notify delinquent borrowers.  </P> <P> Last year, its problems mounted when the California Student Aid Commission, the  state agency that administers the federal student loan program, responded to a  federal audit that found widespread mismanagement at one of United Education's  schools. As a result of the audit, it said the school should be banned from the  loan program.  </P> <P> Facing several lawsuits, including a $24-million suit filed by the state of  California, United Education filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 4. Since  then, the firm has sold or closed 12 of its 26 trade schools and closed its  Encino headquarters. The company is now run from one of its schools in downtown  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> C. Ronald Kimberling, United Education's executive vice president, said that  since the bankruptcy filing, Cohen has been involved primarily with the  company's reorganization plan and has removed himself from involvement in  day-to-day operations. "He just felt it was time to step back," Kimberling  said.  </P></p>

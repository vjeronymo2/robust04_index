Currently Beijing's foreign construction market is confined  mostly in southeast Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent  States.    Last year, Beijing signed contracts for 530 million U.S.  dollars-worth of construction projects. With a total of 3,200  people abroad, the city completed a business volume of 160  million U.S. dollars.    These include construction of a residence area in Kuala  Lumpur, Malaysia, of a flyover in Sri Lanka and of a 180-km  highway in India.    Wan said that he is hopeful to snatch a sizeable share in  the  construction market of those more advanced countries as Beijing  has the country's best professionals in architecture and  construction.</p>

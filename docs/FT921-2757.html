			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker venture unravelled - Agreement with Power, but other 'knotty' problems remain BRENT WALKER, the heavily-indebted leisure group, and Power Corporation, the Irish property company, have finally unravelled their property joint ventures which include the Trocadero in central London. The deal was a condition of Brent Walker's Pounds 1.6bn financial restructuring, which is due to be completed by the end of this month. Bond holder and shareholder resolutions passed last December approving the plan expire on March 31. Bankers feel that if it became necessary to go back to investors it would be difficult to hold the restructuring together. Brent Walker must also come to an agreement with Grand Metropolitan over the disputed purchase price of the William Hill betting shop chain and a Pounds 50m payment due to GrandMet. There are also other smaller but 'knotty' difficulties to sort out, advisers said. The effect of the deal for Brent Walker is to replace a liability to Lloyds Bank of Pounds 60m plus interest and potential development costs by debts of Pounds 13m and remove an asset valued at Pounds 11.2m from its balance sheet. Brent Walker shares fell  1/2 p to 12 1/2 p. Under the arrangement, Power will take full control of Walker Power Corporation (WPCL) which owns the Trocadero Centre, the shopping and leisure complex in Piccadilly, and adjoining Island Site, and of Walker Power Blackpool which owns the Tower Shopping Centre in Blackpool. Power will also have a 60 per cent stake in Wilshire Centre Partners, which owns 80 per cent of Trump Wilshire Associates, which owns the Ambassador Hotel site in Los Angeles. Brent Walker had written down the value of its Power joint ventures to Pounds 11.2m in its December 1990 accounts. The two companies have been discussing an untying of the relationship for over a year. Power will take on Pounds 18m of Brent Walker's debt. Brent Walker will assume a Pounds 9.5m debt to Lloyds Bank, and will repay Pounds 3.5m to WPCL in February 1993. Brent Walker is also released from its obligations to contribute to the development costs of the properties. Power intends to find a new joint venture partner to replace Brent Walker. It will continue to hold its 50 per cent stake in the two Walker Power ventures as long-term investments and equity account the profits. The other 50 per cent stakes will be held under current assets in the balance sheet as at March 31 1992.</p>

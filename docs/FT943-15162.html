			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: United they stand United Airlines shareholders will vote tomorrow on a radical restructuring plan which involves the workforce accepting an estimated Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of labour concessions in return for 55 per cent of the company's stock. The proposal has been hailed as an imaginative experiment in industrial democracy in an era where the distinctions between labour and capital have been blurred. But there are huge doubts about the deal's specific industrial and financial logic. It is hard to make employee ownership work at the best of times as conflicts of priority arise between employee benefits and capital investment. Yet United operates in one of the most ferociously competitive markets in the world. The worry is that United's cost advantage would prove temporary anyway. If other airlines respond with similar measures then the whole industry would experience a step change in cost structure, which would be quickly followed by further painful reductions in fares and therefore in total industry revenues. Assuming United's shareholders also hold stock in other airlines, they may make the hard-hearted calculation that it would be better to block the United deal and allow a major airline to go bust. Only by removing excess capacity will it be possible for other carriers to make a decent return on capital. The distorting effects of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure have kept too many carriers in the air for too long. If the Clinton administration is committed to restoring the aviation industry's health it should encourage companies to fail rather than stick financial plasters on their wings.</p>

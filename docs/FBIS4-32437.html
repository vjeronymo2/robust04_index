			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F> Kaczmarek by Ina Boruszewska and Jerzy Krajewski; place and date  not given: "A Calculation According to a Simulation"]    [Text] "Returning property to its owners would cost 6  trillion zlotys [Z]," Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw  Kaczmarek tells ZYCIE WARSZAWY.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will Polish people receive  certificates of participation in the popular privatization  [swiadectwa udzialowe]?    [Kaczmarek] We are planning distribution of the certificates  for the end of this year and the beginning of next year--that is  to say, either in December or January. We do not yet know who  will be handling the operation. Negotiations are in progress,  among others with Poland's largest banks and the Postal Service.  I think that over 2,000 distribution centers should be set up  throughout the country, so as to have at least one in each gmina  [small administrative unit].    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How much will each participation  certificate cost?    [Kaczmarek] Every adult citizen is entitled to receive a  popular participation certificate. The appropriate statute  provides that only registration fees will be collected, which  will be up to 10 percent of the average salary. The  certificates will be in the form of bearer securities. One will  be able to sell or buy them from someone else for any price that  is set. If a certificate is lost, destroyed, or stolen, no  duplicate will be issued. Through brokerage houses making  appropriate account transactions, it will be possible to  exchange certificates for one of the shares in investment funds.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko  recently presented "Strategy for Poland," which is the  government's new economic program for the next three years.  Among other things, it envisions speedy commercialization of  large state-owned enterprises. What will happen next to the  enterprises that are transformed into Treasury-owned joint-stock  companies?    [Kaczmarek] Through commercialization, we want to introduce  management of state wealth through capital partnerships [spolka  kapitalowa] in order to have a situation where supervisory  boards [rady nadzorcze] and not employee boards [rady  pracownicze] play a decisive role in firms subject to the  transformations. Employee boards destabilize the situation of  many companies.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the "Strategy" program envisions the  establishment of company boards [rady zakladowe].    [Kaczmarek] It is an attempt to look for areas of agreement  in cases where there are, for instance, 15 different trade  unions in an enterprise. I cannot imagine negotiating with each  of them separately. Company boards--perhaps the name is not  good--are to represent the entire work force of a company.  Currently, we are helpless, faced with cases of obvious law  violations. The recent strike in "Katowice" Steeelworks, for  example, was a violation of the principles defined by a statute  concerning the settling of collective disputes. An agreement was  signed on salary policies one day, and, the following day, a  small trade union was capable of turning everything upside down  through its strike, not paying attention to whether the firm can  afford the demanded pay raises.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But, in partnerships based on the  Commercial Law, there are work force representatives sitting on  supervisory boards.    [Kaczmarek] Employee representatives sit on a supervisory  board, while company boards are addressed at trade unions. This  reflects the "higher-level area of agreement"--that is to say,  the Trilateral Commission (government, employers, trade unions).  In a commercialized company and privately owned firms, we  suggest the following scheme: owner, supervisory board, company  board.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will commercialization begin?    [Kaczmarek] I would like it to begin on 1 January 1995 and  to finish the following day, but, because of administrative or  legal obstacles, that will not be possible, so we plan on  finalizing commercialization of the 1,500 largest enterprises in  the second half of 1995.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How long will the State Treasury continue  to own these enterprises?    [Kaczmarek] We want to privatize them.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] By what method?    [Kaczmarek] Mainly by using the capital method and, to some  extent, also through National Investment Funds.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How long will the privatization done this  way last?    [Kaczmarek] Ten to 20 years.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] That long?    [Kaczmarek] It may seem like a long time, but let us look  objectively at how much we succeeded in privatizing using the  capital method over three years. It was several hundred firms.  That is the most in Europe or the world, anyway.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Speaking about other countries'  experiences, do you not think we could use the Czech example and  carry out privatization of large state-owned enterprises through  the coupon method?    [Kaczmarek] I think the Polish and Czech popular  privatization programs will converge at some point in the  future. Then we shall see who gained a bigger advantage. The  Czechs began by going "from the bottom up": First coupons were  issued, then they were exchanged for shares in the funds. What  we want to do is set up the funds first and then issue popular  participation certificates.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The Polish popular privatization program  covers just several hundred enterprises, while the Czech program  covers almost all of them. One cannot compare the two.    [Kaczmarek] Given that we are muddling through conflicting  interests right now, where every lobbying group wants to guard  its own interest only instead of looking at macroeconomic  policies, I cannot imagine coupon privatization being done in  Poland. I am sorry, but I do not identify myself with the Czech  philosophy of "capitalism coupons."    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But it may turn out that, in five years,  the Czechs will have completely privatized their economy, and it  will be much more efficient than the Polish one, which continues  to be state-owned to a large extent. It is Czech firms and not  Polish ones that attract more foreign capital.    [Kaczmarek] The Czechs recently announced that they have too  much foreign capital. When it comes to Poland, you just cannot  do everything contrary to public opinion. First, one must prove  to the people that privately owned firms are more efficient than  state-owned ones, and only then can one move on. One cannot  draw such a conclusion from Polish privatization experiences.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Do you agree with the view that privately  owned partnerships are more efficient than state-owned ones?    [Kaczmarek] Are you talking about the world or about Poland?    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Both.    [Kaczmarek] In other countries, the privately owned sector  is indeed clearly more efficient than the state-owned one.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Does it follow that you regard Poland to be  an abnormal country and that you want to consolidate inefficient  structures here?    [Kaczmarek] No. I want to carry out privatization, but that  requires time. We are certainly not planning on "preserving and  stabilizing the old arrangement," as Henryka Bochniarz, who was  the industry minister in the Bielecki Cabinet, says.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The Czechs have already demonstrated that  one can privatize practically anything, even the refinery  industry or regional railways. They have 900 enterprises  registered on their stock market, whereas we have just 25.    [Kaczmarek] Yes, but what kind of a stock market is it  really? Look at the enterprises, the share values, and the  procedures applied. All of that is of very poor quality, so  what you are saying does not convince me.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Why are the railways or the refinery  industry not being privatized in Poland?    [Kaczmarek] Why do you ask me that?    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Because you are the ownership  transformations minister...    [Kaczmarek] But I am not responsible for that. Address  these questions to the transportation minister and the industry  minister. Once I represent the owner of these firms, I will try  to answer your questions.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What will happen next to the institution of  the State Treasury?    [Kaczmarek] The Finance Ministry has prepared a draft that  is based on a French/Italian model and that envisions the  establishment of a management operating within the structures of  state-owned enterprises through several different holding  companies. The model, especially its Italian version, was a  disaster. I am opposed to the idea because I do not want the  emergence of another field for corruption. The Ministry of  Ownership Transformations [MPW] proposes a merger of the  structures of regional State Treasury offices, the MPW's  regional branches, and departments of economic development and  privatization in voivodship offices into single bodies called  "agencies." Under the MPW's supervision, they will be managing  the State Treasury's wealth at the regional level. We want to  abandon central economic management. The proposal is included in  the "Strategy for Poland" program. There is no question of a  ministerial approach.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What will happen next to the  reprivatization law?    [Kaczmarek] Its draft was transferred over for  interministerial consultations.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will it be debated again by the  Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers?    [Kaczmarek] In a month or two.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] A few months ago, you said that a  reprivatization referendum would be absurd. Right now, you,  along with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Deputy Prime  Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, are in favor of voting on the issue  of returning property to its rightful owners.    [Kaczmarek] I think that at times it is worth asking people  whether they are willing to take the burden stemming from  decisions that were made 50 years ago. We have adopted the  principle that, as of 1945, a lawful legal order was in  operation in Poland, and there are currently no reasons or  conditions to apply the principle of restitution of property.  So reprivatization will not mean a return of everything that  was nationalized but only reimbursements for that property that  was taken illegally. Former owners will receive reprivatization  coupons in return.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But these coupons will be worth less than  the property that was plundered.    [Kaczmarek] Why do you say that?    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Since you assume a degression scale will be  applied on property worth over Z2 billion, everybody knows even  now that the coupons' value will be lower than the value of the  property.    [Kaczmarek] If we were not to adopt a degression scale,  then, according to our estimates, the reprivatization would cost  the state as much as Z200 trillion, and that would be only in  the case of law violations that occurred between 1944 and 1958.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] That is not the reprivatization cost but an  estimated value of the property that is being claimed by former  owners. Tell us how much exactly taxpayers would have to pay in  order for the state to return a plundered mill, a brickyard, or  a manor house with a park to its owner?    [Kaczmarek] That is easy to calculate. It would be about Z6  trillion out of the state budget.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] According to what criteria?    [Kaczmarek] According to simple simulation...    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What simulation are you talking about?    [Kaczmarek] What do you mean what simulation?! This is  property that is in the hands of the state...    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the state is not its owner.    [Kaczmarek] What do you mean the state is not its owner?!  No, this conversation makes no sense at all...    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Mr. Minister, the state is just managing  the property...    [Kaczmarek] And please explain to me why you are saying  something like that.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Because the property was illegally taken  away from its owners...    [Kaczmarek] No, it was not. It was nationalized in  accordance with the appropriate laws.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the state budget does not include the  property.    [Kaczmarek] What do you mean?    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The state budget is a list of state  revenues and expenditures.    [Kaczmarek] Exactly. Property can be sold, and revenue  accruing from the sale can be listed in the budget.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Why cannot at least part of the plundered  property be returned in its natural form?    [Kaczmarek] Because I do not want to have hundreds or  thousands of conflicts. That is because I do not know why I am  supposed to return a mill in Siedlce Voivodship in its natural  form but not one in Ciechanow Voidodship because over there it  would result in a major brawl. Everybody will be treated  equally in the process; there will be no better or worse people.  They will receive their coupons for which they will be able to  purchase real estate. Nothing will be returned to them.</p>

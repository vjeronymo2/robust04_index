			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Dutch left and right unite to rule: Ronald van de Krol on the 'purple' coalition which will bring together three unlikely allies The Netherlands is about to make first-hand acquaintance with the old adage that politics makes strange bedfellows. By the end of the month, the country will find itself governed by the first left-right coalition in its history, bringing together three unlikely allies  -the Labour party, the right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66. The unusual 'purple' coalition - so-called because of the mix between the Labour 'reds' and the Tory 'blue' Liberals - will squeeze the centrist Christian Democrats out of power for the first time in living memory, ending their era as the natural party of government. The odd grouping of parties in the new coalition is underlined by the personalities of the main protagonists. Mr Wim Kok, the Labour leader and the man destined to be prime minister, is the son of a carpenter. He studied business but went on to become the leader of the Dutch labour union federation before entering politics. His counterpart in the Liberal party, Mr Frits Bolkestein, is a former Shell executive with a posh accent and a fondness for tennis. Mr Hans van Mierlo, D66 leader, is one of the few Dutch politicians who could be accused of possessing charisma. A former journalist, he founded the D66 party in 1966 in an attempt to break the mould of Dutch politics. The advent of a left-right cabinet will not, however, herald radical changes. 'Left' and 'right' are relative terms in the Netherlands, and the three coalition parties have not put forward a programme significantly different from what the Christian Democrats would have tried to achieve. Boosting employment will be the main goal of the new cabinet, which is to be inaugurated before the end of the month with Mr Kok as prime minister. Government spending is to be cut by Fl 18bn (Pounds 6.4bn), with about half given back to households and the business community in the form of lower taxes and social premiums. By reducing the cost of labour to companies, the new government hopes to foster the creation of 125,000 jobs. In addition, economic recovery should lead to 230,000 extra jobs in the government's four-year term in office. Social spending will be cut in some controversial areas, but the level of unemployment and disability payments will not be lowered. People covered by the national health scheme will be required to pay a deductible of Fl 200 a year for medical treatment, as a way of both reducing the cost of health care and discouraging unnecessary visits to doctors. The wide-ranging government plan also covers topics from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport - night flights are to be curbed - to slightly more liberal shop opening hours. Indeed, it is the detail in the 69-page plan that explains, in part, why it has taken the Netherlands more than 100 days to come up with a new government since the May 3 general election. But another factor is the sheer unfamiliarity of an attempt to bring together parties from opposite sides of the narrow Dutch political spectrum.</p>

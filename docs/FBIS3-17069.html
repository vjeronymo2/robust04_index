In </F> January, 52.6 Million People Were Below the Poverty Line, in  February 24.8 Million"]    [Text] There is hardly any need to demonstrate that, of  all the negative consequences of the reform, the most painful is  the truly calamitous situation in which millions of our indigent  fellow citizens find themselves. The sentimental pictures which  have flashed on our television screens -- charity dinners and  charity gifts, clearly pursuing publicity purposes -- have been  quite unable to rectify the situation, merely underlining the  depth of the people's sorrow.    In January, 35.4 percent of the population had an income  below the living wage. Let us call things by their proper  names: More than one-third of our fellow citizens were doomed  to a slow extinction.    But then the situation changed materially in February, when  16.7 percent of citizens remained below the poverty line. The  little word "only" is clearly inappropriate here. It is equally  inappropriate to be moved by the changes that have occurred.  Because 24.8 million hapless citizens represent, all the same, a  very large number, monstrously large! Therefore the words used  to form the headline must be perceived with a certain degree of  irony.    And yet the cited facts require careful analysis. They  attest that Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet has replaced the  "declaration of intentions" with practical steps aimed at giving  social protection to needy sections of the population. It is  very important to investigate the mechanism of such actions.    What, then, happened?    First, the difference in the wages that were increased as of  1 December last year and as of 1 January this year for working  people in the budget-funded sphere and in management organs was  paid in February. The payment was increased by the amount of  the compensation relating to pensions.    Second, the rate of inflation slowed down sharply in  February  and stood at 9.9 percent. The increase in wages (10 percent)  overtook inflation probably for the first time.    Third, owing to the low rate of inflation, there was an  insignificant change in the actual size of the living wage:  51,360 rubles [R] in January, R56,574 in February.    A natural question arises: How stable is the trend which has  become apparent? First of all, it should be said that provision  has already been made for a number of protective measures in the  social sphere. Thus, as of 1 February it is proposed to increase  compensation for pensioners from R11,700 to R20,000, and to  R29,600 as of 1 May.    But this, of course, is not the main point. Everything  depends on the limit to which the level of inflation can be  kept. This is primarily dependent on the republic budget  deficit, which is to be compensated for to a considerable degree  by money emission. The government intends to keep the budget  deficit within quite a rigid framework -- approximately 9  percent of GDP. This would also ensure a moderate rate of  inflation.    The final fate of the budget is not yet known, however. At  the end of last week Viktor Chernomyrdin signed its draft and  sent the document to the president and the State Duma. It can  only be hoped that its classes of expenditure will not swell up  under pressure from various lobbyist groupings.    In any case it is gratifying that the cabinet's social  policy  has occupied priority positions not in words but in actual fact.</p>

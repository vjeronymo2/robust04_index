			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: HIGH SCHOOLS NEED TO SHOW MERCY ON WEAK  </P> <P> In the aftermath of last Wednesday's controversial girls' basketball game  between Inglewood Morningside and South Torrance, questions remain unanswered.  </P> <P> Many fingers were pointed at Morningside Coach Frank Scott, who allowed Lisa  Leslie, his All-American center, to score 101 points in a half.  </P> <P> There was sympathy for South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez, who removed his team  from the game at halftime, trailing, 102-24, and for his team, which had begun  the game with seven players but finished with four because two fouled out and  one was injured.  </P> <P> Many supported South Torrance's decision not to take the floor to begin the  second half, preventing Leslie from breaking Cheryl Miller's eight-year-old  national record of 105 points.  </P> <P> When South Torrance school officials abided by Southern Section rules and  suspended Ramirez from coaching the last game of the season, many people still  said that Ramirez had done the right thing.  </P> <P> It was difficult to find backers for Morningside, even though the Monarchs  could probably win nearly every Ocean League game by a similar margin. But  Morningside was, in a way, a victim of the unwritten code of high school  athletics that says a superior team just cannot play its best against a weaker  opponent.  </P> <P> The Southern Section even changed its position last Friday morning when it  reinstated Ramirez and allowed him to coach the Spartans' last game, saying  that he had just cause to forfeit.  </P> <P> With Ramirez on the bench, the inspired South Torrance team went on to lose to  North Torrance by only 10 points, 60-50. Morningside, the defending state  champion in Division I, went back to its normal ways, defeating Compton  Centennial, 78-44.  </P> <P> So, what was gained from last week's activities? Did the Morningside team learn  a lesson in sportsmanship? Did the South Torrance team? No one can truly answer  those questions.  </P> <P> But if the Southern Section would like to see the situation not repeated, it  should simply establish a mercy rule, as it has done in eight-man football,  under which a team ahead by a certain margin is awarded the victory.  </P> <P> In the Morningside-South Torrance game for example, with a 50-point mercy rule,  the game would have been over early in the second quarter. No tears, no  finger-pointing and no records broken.  </P> <P> Having a mercy rule would be more logical than expecting a team not to play its  best. In individual sports, such as track and field, it is not expected that a  runner will slow down in every race against inferior opponents. Nor is that the  case in tennis, swimming or wrestling.  </P> <P> The City basketball playoffs will begin Friday with Manual Arts as the  top-seeded team in the boys' 4-A Division. The Toilers, who lost to Crenshaw in  the City final last season and again in the State Division I semifinals, won  two close Western League games last week, beating Westchester and Fairfax.  </P> <P> "We have paid our dues this season," Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said.  "We have played a tough schedule and we won our conference, but I don't  necessary like us being the top seed."  </P> <P> The Toilers, who won the state Division I title in 1988, are 21-3 this season  and the Times' top-rated team in the City. However, in finishing conference  play undefeated, they needed late heroics from senior forward William Celestine  in both their 74-73 victory over Westchester and their 64-63 double-overtime  victory over Fairfax.  </P> <P> Simpson calls the 6-foot-5 Celestine, who is one of only three seniors on the  team, the most underrated player in the City. Celestine is averaging 19 points  and 12 rebounds a game. He is joined by the senior backcourt tandem of 6-2  guard Marcell Capers, who is averaging 14 points and 11 assists a game, and  Cedric Jones, a 5-7 three-point specialist.  </P> <P> When asked to predict a final four for the City semifinals at the Sports Arena  Feb. 23, Simpson said he expects Manual Arts to meet Dorsey, which routed  Crenshaw last Friday, 91-67, and Crenshaw to play Fairfax.  </P> <P> Quarterback Charles Levy of Lynwood, who was regarded as one of the top players  in Southern California last season, said Monday that he will attend Arizona  next season.  </P> <P> The 6-2 Levy said that he chose Arizona over Colorado and Washington because  the Wildcats had recruited him as a quarterback.  </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> Debbie Fischer of Huntington Beach Edison upped her own Southern Section  records for three-point field goals for a career (100) and season (92) and tied  her game record by making 10 of the long shots in the Chargers' 88-83 victory  over Westminster last week. She had 49 points in the game. . . . According to  Volleyball Monthly, UCLA is expected to sign three high school All-American  girls Wednesday, the first official day of the letter-of-intent signing period,  in Amy Boyer of Poway, Irene Renteria of Las Vegas Clark and Allison Randick of  Moraga Campolindo.  </P> <P> BASKETBALL POLLS  </P> <P> Through Feb. 12  </P> <P> BOYS  </P> <P> City  </P> <P> No., School, League: Record  </P> <P> 1.

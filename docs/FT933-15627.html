			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Easing lines of communication - Phone bills are becoming easier to read If UK telephone customers find their bills easier to read these days, they have Clear Communications to thank. Part of Siegel and Gale, the Saatchi and Saatchi-owned communications group, the new company was launched in June. Its arrival signals the priority now being given to clarity and directness in company literature and other public dealings. The telephone bill, which was called the 'telephone account', until Clear Communications got hold of it, is in some respects just as complex as the old bill. There are more subtotals rather than fewer leading up to the one number you really need to know - the one you will write on your cheque. This is because the aims of clarity are often at odds with marketing demands from companies, such as BT, offering special options and customer incentives. Improvements only go so far and groups, such as the Plain English Campaign, remain critical of official gobbledegook. Some arcane details remain unaltered. Why, for example, do BT's customer account numbers bear no relation to the unique numbers by which all customers are already known - their telephone numbers? US telephone companies have abolished this anomaly. Nor do the bills reveal another piece of information customers want - the date they really have to pay by. Much of the demand for simpler, clearer company communications originated in the US, where Siegel and Gale has long held a commitment to what it calls 'language simplification'. In Britain, recent months have seen complaints about form-filling and paper-pushing from bodies as diverse at the Metropolitan Police and the Arts Council. A study by Siegel and Gale with KPMG Peat Marwick shows that documentation can consume up to 10 per cent of operating costs, but that only one senior manager in 15 knows this. Matters are often so desperate that any change is an improvement. But better may not be good enough. Simplification should not be used solely as a marketing tool but seen as a good thing for its own sake. There is no substitute for sincerity, according to Chrissie Miles of the Plain English Campaign. Technology is one reason for current improvements. The new telephone bill's secret is that it is laser-printed. This allows bills to be designed to present more of the company's information and yet still appear simpler to the customer. Computers edit data so that bills may be prepared for particular customer types and yet still be printed economically. 'One of the keys is being able to customise information,' says Susie Gear, director of Clear Communications. This much was possible before. The advantage of laser-printing is that it presents this information elegantly, in typefaces that blend with the BT corporate style rather than hard-to-read computer capitals. Barclays Bank reports a 75 per cent increase in applications from students in the year, following the introduction of Clear Communications' Barclaycard application form. Students need only fill in the one form, ticking boxes to indicate which of several cards they wish to apply for, rather than filling in many forms and duplicating basic information, such as addresses, known to the bank from the first form. Clear Communications is currently tackling the design of waybills for DHL, the express carrier, due to be used in August. Clear Communications found that DHL's use of 24 slightly different variants of the waybill slowed processing. Customers filled in the confusing forms wrongly, leading to delays in customs and insurance losses, and did not read the company's Terms and Conditions. The problem seems obvious in this case as in many others. But will the solution be that much better? Probably not, according to the Plain English Campaign which awards 'clarity diamonds' for clear writing. It surveyed some of Siegel and Gale's work in the US. 'The stuff they've called plain English I wouldn't give a pound of tripe for,' says Miles. Now, that's clear communication.</p>

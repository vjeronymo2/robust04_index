			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 5 Feb (INA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH has urged Mr.  Ekeus to announce a date for the beginning of the trial period  for future monitoring as agreed upon during the Baghdad and New  York talks in last July and November.    In an article today entitled "Ekeus Talks in Baghdad, the  Unjust Blockade, and the Responsibility for Prolonging it," the  paper says that any procrastination or deliberate delays will  increase the suffering of millions of Iraqis and will stain  Ekeus' reputation in Iraq. He himself has acknowledged that  Iraq has cooperated with him in a positive manner to help him  fulfill his mission despite all its complications and  difficulties.    The paper recalls an announcement made by Hans Blix,  chairman  of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iraq has done  what it was required to do and that what is left to be done is  the part concerning the work of the Special Commission under  Ekeus. He also noted that this commission was slow in  accomplishing its mission.    The paper says that Mr. Ekeus should prove that he has not  gone beyond the limits of his mission, which is technical in  nature. He should not be influenced by the wishes of this or  that party. His mission is technical, not political. It is  wrong to link Part C or Paragraph 22 to other paragraphs,  because this paragraph is independent and has a clear meaning.    The paper brands the attempts of the Clinton administration  and those following suit to make strange interpretations of  Paragraph 22 for clear political purposes as unacceptable. The  paper also says that it is unacceptable for Ekeus to submit to  these attempts. It notes that this is not in line with the  technical nature of Ekeus' mission and runs counter to the  principle of neutrality, honesty, and sincerity, to which he  often stresses commitment.    The paper adds that honesty makes it incumbent upon Mr.  Ekeus  to announce now the starting date for the monitoring as agreed  upon, provided that this period is not in excess of six months,  after which he would announce that his mission has been fully  completed. This means that the UN Security Council would be  compelled to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which  means lifting the economic blockade.    The paper adds: Mr. Ekeus should specify the starting date  for the monitoring period during his current talks in Baghdad  and he should do it as soon as possible. It would be fair to  say that this period should have started last July when Iraq  agreed to install two monitoring cameras in two different  positions in Baghdad, and when Iraq declared its approval of  Resolution 715 in November.    The paper says that Iraq approved the (?proposed) trial  period in order to dismiss all the pretexts that are being  floated by some influential UN Security Council members,  specifically the United States. Iraq's approval, the paper  says, was in order to make it possible to implement Paragraph 22  of Resolution 687, which means lifting the economic blockade  against Iraq. The evil powers want to prolong the blockade to  achieve tendentious political objectives that have nothing to do  with the UN Security Council resolutions.    Concluding its article, AL-JUMHURIYAH says that the current  round of talks with Ekeus has special importance because it will  discuss an important issue pertaining to the suffering of an  entire people. Its results will negatively or positively affect  the credibility of the United Nations and the Security Council,  specifically the credibility of the permanent big powers and the  extent of their commitment to the implementation of the  resolutions which they have voted for, especially since Iraq has  honored its obligations, especially with regard to Part C of  Resolution 687.</p>

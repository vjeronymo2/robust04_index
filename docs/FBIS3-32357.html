The U.S. officer, who is  accused of killing a Salvadoran bodyguard last January, was  taken out of the country illegally by U.S. Embassy officials who  flew him in an aircraft to Panama.    On Tuesday, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Salaverria said the diplomatic mission violated the country's  laws. [sentence as heard] Today, President Cristiani abandoned  the foreign minister's position, and he said a protest will be  forwarded to the U.S. Government.    [Begin Cristiani recording] A protest will be submitted to  the U.S. Government, because the country's immigration laws have  been violated with the departure of Major Lopez. We cannot  tolerate this, regardless of who has diplomatic immunity. We  feel that our country is willing to respect all international  laws. There was no reason why Maj. Lopez was taken out of the  country without going through the country's immigration  procedures. This is the statement that will be sent to the  State Department. We are demanding that the U.S. Government, in  keeping with international agreements, impose penalties on those  people responsible for violating the country's immigration  procedures. [end recording]    According to the president, the diplomatic mission also  ignored a series of legal procedures with which it should have  complied before taking the U.S. officer out of national  territory. The head of state also said instructions have been  issued to control the exits and entries of all types of aircraft.    Regarding compensation for the relatives of the victim, the  Salvadoran president said his government has included this in  the protest note, because the judge in charge of the case in the  United States must be made aware of this. The U.S. Embassy has  announced that Maj. Ismael Lopez will be tried by a military  court in the United States. In this respect, President  Cristiani said the government has requested the presence of a  representative of the District Attorney's Office as an observer  at Maj. Lopez' court-martial.</p>

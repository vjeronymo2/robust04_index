The meeting, originally scheduled for March 21, may be  postponed because of scheduling conflicts with the plenary  session of the National People's Congress and Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing, the  spokesman said.    The meetings would interfere with the schedules of ARATS  personnel, including ARATS Standing Vice Chairman Tang Shubei  who is a member of the CPPCC.    A final decision on when the talks will be held will be made  at a later date, the spokesman noted.    Meanwhile, SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Chao  Jen-ho said Thursday that both sides may sign agreements on  repatriation of hijackers, illegal immigrants and fishery  disputes in the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks.    Chao said that during the previous three rounds of talks,  SEF  and ARATS have worked toward agreement on the issues and may  reach agreement during the coming round of talks.    Chao also said that if the negotiation teams have time, they  will also discuss cross-strait anti-crime cooperation, judicial  assistance, protection of intellectual property rights and the  rights of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland.    In related news, SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu, said Thursday  that  if the proposed talks go smoothly, a second meeting between Koo  and his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan could probably come at  the end of June or early July.    Koo and Wang met in Singapore in April, 1993, marking the  first high-ranking contact between the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait after more than four decades.    Koo said it is beneficial for both sides to increase  contacts  and he said that protection of rights of Taiwan businessmen  would be the focus of his meeting with Wang.    Koo added that the he would also like to discuss  cross-strait  technology exchanges with Wang.</p>

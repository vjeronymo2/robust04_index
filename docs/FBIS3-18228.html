			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] has reacted with unusually  drastic words to the resolutions adopted by the general assembly  of Alliance 90/The Greens at the weekend. Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl described the results as alarming and warned the  Social Democratic Party [SPD] against entering into a coalition  with that party. A coalition between the SPD and the Greens at  the federal level would have "devastating effects on Germany,  both in terms of domestic and foreign policy."    With their radical slogans and positions the party would  destroy any hopes for economic upswing if it were to participate  in the government. "Foreign investors would be deterred and  internal security no longer be guaranteed," Kohl said in his  statement. Thus, for the first time directly commenting on the  results of a Greens Congress. In terms of foreign and security  policy, the radical course of Alliance 90/The Greens would  "drive Germany into isolation and constitute the end of the  political union of Europe and of our alliance with the United  States," Kohl said.    Kohl called on the SPD "to answer with absolute clarity the  question whether it was seeking a coalition with the Greens at  the federal level, too." The CDU will force the SPD "to finally  answer the coalition question." In Stuttgart, CDU Secretary  General Peter Hintze made a similar statement: "Alliance 90/The  Greens are a danger for Germany."    The spokeswoman for Alliance 90/The Greens, Anne Nilges,  commented on Kohl's statement in the following way: "The more  enemies, the greater the honor." That Kohl, for the first time,  personally discussed the results of a Greens Congress shows how  serious the party is now taken even in the opponent's camp.  "Kohl is afraid of a change in the government," Nilges said.    Before, the spokeswoman for executive committee of the  Alliance 90/The Greens, Marianne Birthler, rejected the  criticism especially of the security-policy resolutions adopted  by the congress in Mannheim. "Nobody demanded that NATO  disintegrate into thin air immediately," she said on  Deutschlandradio on Monday. The Greens are interested in the  creation of structures of joint security, for the benefit of  which NATO should be gradually dissolved. "Our program is  anything else but hostile to responsibility or politics,"  Birthler said.    With its resolutions, the party has created a good starting  position for the election campaign and for coalition talks.  Even if the SPD was not distancing itself from the offer in  public, it was now clear that "the cards will be reshuffled in  the night following the election." Thomas Westphal, chairman of  the Young Social Democrats, clearly came out in favor of an  SPD-Greens coalition at the federal level. "Only with them is a  true social-ecological policy of reform possible," he said on  Saarland Radio.</p>

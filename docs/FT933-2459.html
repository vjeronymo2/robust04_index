			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: VW rethinks Skoda investment strategy VOLKSWAGEN'S dramatic last-minute withdrawal from its planned DM1.4bn (Dollars 875m) financing deal for Skoda, its Czech affiliate, was forced by the drastic reduction in the group's capital investment plans, Mr Rutbert Reisch, VW group treasurer, said yesterday. 'It is apparent that our investment plans for Skoda will change substantially,' he said. Volkswagen yesterday had been due to sign the DM1.4bn Skoda project finance facility, the biggest yet planned for east Europe, with a banking group led by the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The four lead commercial banks were Dresdner and Deutsche banks, J. P. Morgan, and CS First Boston. 'It was the more honest and professional thing to do - to call off the deal, rather than have all the banks come and sign - when we know that the investment plans in the prospectus documents will change dramatically,' said Mr Reisch. 'It was the lesser of two evils to call off the deal at short notice.' The treasurer himself was only informed on Thursday morning by the group's management board that the financing deal, which had been under negotiation for nearly two years, was to be abandoned. Mr Reisch was unable to provide any detail of how VW now planned to proceed with the development of Skoda, in which it is acquiring a majority 70 per cent stake. VW had planned to spend DM7bn over 10 years at Skoda. This would have been to double its production capacity to more than 400,000 cars a year, to modernise its facilities, and to renew its products with the addition of a second car range. With VW suffering from heavy losses and sharply declining sales, Mr Reisch said the group's investment plans were now 'in flux'. 'The whole expenditure process is being restructured and reviewed. This is a huge task that proceeds at an enormous pace, but it still takes time to run through all the elements,' he said. He did not expect the move to have a detrimental effect on VW's banking relationships. The surprise of London bankers at VW's withdrawal from the financing deal was mirrored by the Czech government and Skoda itself. Skoda executives said yesterday they had been informed the deal was off less than 24 hours before the planned signing. Mr Jiri Hrabovsky, Skoda spokesman, insisted the company still planned to double production to around 450,000 cars a year by 1997.</p>

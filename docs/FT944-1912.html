			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Sterling steady Sterling was yesterday left unmoved by the ruling Conservative party's massive defeat in the Dudley West by-election, writes Philip Gawith. A poor showing by the government had been so widely discounted as to be of negligible impact. The pound actually finished the day in London slightly firmer, at DM2.4561 from DM2.4542, and at Dollars 1.563 from Dollars 1.5615. For the most part, foreign exchanges were lost in a deep pre-Christmas slumber. There was little currency movement of note, and volumes were in some cases so low as to be derisory. The Irish punt showed no reaction to the formation of a new government, and in America the dollar was unresponsive to President Clinton's address in which he promised Dollars 60bn in tax cuts over five years. It ended barely changed at DM1.5714 and Y100.15. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.5727 and Y100.225. In Europe, Mr Jacques Santer, incoming president of the European Commission, said the Community would have failed if it had not achieved monetary union by 1999. He said he hoped to achieve the third phase of monetary union by 1997. The Irish punt showed almost no reaction to the formation of the new government, resolving a month of political uncertainty. It finished at IPounds 1.0164 against sterling, from IPounds 1.016. Mr Jim Power, senior economist at the Bank of Ireland in Dublin, said: 'There is nothing in the programme of this government that could disturb financial markets. The biggest threat on the interest rate front will be when the UK next raises rates.' The incoming government bolstered sentiment by pledging adherence to the Maastricht convergence criteria. Mr Power noted that the punt is not a heavily traded currency. 'Most of the business is customer driven. Virtually no-one takes speculative positions in the currency.' The markets' apathetic response to the UK by-election result was explained by Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC. 'To the extent that the by-election defeat merely reflected expectations, it had no currency impact.' Some observers believe that President Clinton's tax plans could help the dollar. They reason that the corollary of fiscal relaxation will be higher interest rates in the current cycle, which should help the dollar. In their fortnightly survey, the financial consultancy IDEA found that respondents 'remained dollar bullish, but suggested on the whole that any reasonable rally would wait until after the turn of the year'. On a two-month outlook, respondents saw the dollar reaching DM1.59 and Y102. Traders continue to watch the lira closely. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has confirmed that there will be a vote of confidence next week, which he could well lose. Fanning the flames yesterday was Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, and member of the coalition government. He said he expected a change of government in the new year. The market remains confused about the implications. In the same IDEA survey, the lira was a popular choice both as best and worst European currency in 1995. Respondents were more positive about sterling, with a net 20 per cent looking for a bullish return. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.1bn money market shortage, at established rates, in its daily operations.</p>

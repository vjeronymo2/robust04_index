			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rathbone hits a record Pounds 4m RATHBONE Brothers, the private banking and asset management group which operates in London and Liverpool, reported record 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.08m, an increase of 31 per cent on 1991's Pounds 3.12m. Turnover was up 25 per cent at Pounds 14.97m (Pounds 11.92m), thanks partly to the acquisition of Framlington's private clients and three independent investment managers in Liverpool joining the company with their clients' portfolios. There is no final dividend. However, befitting its role as a specialist in financial and tax planning, Rathbone declared a second interim last week to ensure its payment yesterday, thus beating the Budget, which will cut tax relief on dividends paid after April 6. The second interim of 4.5p compares with last year's final dividend of 3.5p. The year's total is 6p (5p). Earnings per share were 16.07p (13.31p). Mr Michael Bryant, deputy chairman, said 1993 was shaping well, with word-of-mouth among investors a potent source of new business. 'With interest rates coming down so much, the balance of private client interest is shifting to equity markets. People are looking for long term growth,' he added.</p>

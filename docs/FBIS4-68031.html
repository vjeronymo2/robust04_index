			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The case of Dandenys Munoz Mosquera, a.k.a. La  Quica, could take an abrupt turn in the United States. Only a  few days before the trial against him begins in New York,  Colombia obtained an important statement directly implicating La  Quica in the case of the Avianca aircraft, contrary to what El  Arete [Carlos Alzate Urquijo] had stated in a report that caused  a scandal a few days ago. The Prosecutor General's office has  the statement and is expected to turn it over to the United  States within the next few hours. This is an exclusive report.    By a strange boomerang effect, the letter from Prosecutor de  Greiff to the U.S. judge who is examining the participation of  La Quica in the attack on the Avianca aircraft prompted a very  credible informant to confess all he knew about the sinister  attack. According to the confession, given to an appointed  prosecutor, the informant, whose identity is being maintained in  strict secrecy, confessed that the Avianca aircraft explosion  was carried out directly by Dandenys Munoz a.k.a. La Quica, with  the participation of other accomplices. In other words, La Quica  was the one who staged the attack.    Even more surprising, the informant confirmed that La Quica  had staged the attack as ordered by Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo,  a.k.a. El Arete, who was the one that stated before Prosecutor  de Greiff that La Quica had nothing to do with the sinister  incident. In other words, El Arete blatantly lied to Prosecutor  de Greiff regarding La Quica. The informant, who contradicted  the statement by El Arete, and who has puzzled the  investigators, has a great deal of credibility with the judicial  and security organizations, because he alerted the authorities  about an attack on the U.S. Embassy and about other planned  attacks, even against Prosecutor de Greiff.</p>

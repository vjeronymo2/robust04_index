			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / CDU nominates Heitmann Mr Steffen Heitmann, the 49-year-old justice minister of the state of Saxony, was formally nominated on Saturday as the Christian Democratic Union's candidate for the German presidency, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The unanimous decision of the party's national executive was taken in spite of widespread criticism of Mr Heitmann as an unremarkable conservative nationalist. He has been attacked by fellow members of the CDU, the party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as by the Free Democratic party in the ruling federal coalition. His principal opponent in next year's election will be Mr Johannes Rau, the Social Democrat premier of North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: IPPR suggests reform for House of Lords THE House of Lords needs radical reform to make parliament more effective and revitalise the democratic process, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research, the centre-left think-tank, John Willman writes. The institute says today that there is an essential role for a second chamber in sharing the legislative burden and scrutinising the government, but the Lords lacks the legitimacy to function effectively. The institute proposes a 300-member second chamber with 270 members elected in regional constituencies by proportional representation. Reforming the Lords. IPPR, 30 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA. Pounds 7.50. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

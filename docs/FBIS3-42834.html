Pyrozhenko, candidate of geographical </F> sciences: "Where Are We Living Today?"]    [Text] There are problems with the safe use and renewal of  forest resources.    A geographic approach has to be taken in formulating  ecologically and economically sensible concepts for forest  management since it encompasses the entire complex of economic,  social and ecological issues at hand.    Ukrainian forests are subject to intrusive anthropogenic  factors in heavily industrialized areas with large power plants.  The extensive forests in the zone of the Chernobyl nuclear  accident and adjacent territories of the Kiev, Zhytomyr,  Chernihiv, Rivne and Volyn oblasts differ as to type and  functional designation and the degree of radioactive  contamination. On the average, forests take up 27.3% of  the  land area, a figure that reachers 36% in the 30 km  Chernobyl  zone. This represents 2.4 million hectares, or 38.4% of  the  forest lands of Ukraine. Artificial reforestations accounts for  50.3% of the area in those regions, versus an average of  68%  for Ukraine as a whole. Coniferous forests predominates  (63.0%), followed by hardwood forests (17.5%).  Most (48.5%)  are young and mid-age (37.5%) growths. Cesium-137 is the  most  widespread contaminant of the three major radionuclides (cesium,  strontium, plutonium); however, in the 30 km Chernobyl zone  strontium-90 and plutonium are the dominant contaminants.    Utililization of these forests for timber and recreation and  their levels of radioactive pollution is depicted in Fig. 1. The  map shows that the forests can be classified into eight types:  1--Conservation and recreation; 2--Conservation and timberland;  3--As category 2 in combination with radiomonitoring; 4--As 3,  but with moderate commercial use; 5--As 3 but with low level  commercial exploitation; 6--Conservation and limited commercial  exploitation; 7--Conservation with radiomonitoring; and  8--Conservation and protected against commercial use.    Forests that predominate in the Kiev Oblast--which suffered  the most from the Chernobyl fallout--fall mainly into categories  7 and 1. The primary categories in Zhytomyr Oblast are 3, in  Chernihiv Oblast 2 and 3, in Rivne Oblast 3 and in Volyn Oblast  2. The most contaminated forests to which access is forbidden  are found in the Chernobyl and Polissya forest preserves in the  Kiev Oblast, and in the Narodnytskyy, Ovrutskyy and  Slovechanskyy preserves in Zhytomyr Oblast. This classification  does not include forests in the 30 km zome or the dead 'brown  forest' there.    This for of classification may make it possible to include  the radiopolluted forests in the timber economy. For example, in  the Kiev Oblast 14.0% of the forest areas have economic  (including recreational) value, 66.0% have limited  potential  with mandatory radiomonitoring, and 20.0% (excluding the  30 km  forbidden zone) are out of bounds for any type of use. The  corresponding figures for the Zhytomyr Oblast are 4.5, 75.2 and  37.3%, in the Chernihiv Oblast 37.3 and 62.7%, in  the Rivne  area 9.7 and 90.3%, and in Volyn Oblast 52.2 and  42.8%. In  terms of economic potential the last three oblast are in the  most unfavorable position, although even they have undergone  changes in the way their forests are categorized.    Constant efforts are required to maintain and renew the  forest resources where radioactivity ranges from 1.1 to 5.5  Ci/sq. km. and higher. These efforts are hampered by poor  working and living conditions, particularly where tree husbandry  is concerned, and danger of radioactivity. Both factors  contribute to a shortage of labor. Forestry workers--especially  loggers--have been shown to receive 1.5- to 2.5-fold as much  irradiation as other segments of the population. Accordingly,  such work must be curtailed on territories where radioactivities  exceed 10 Ci/sq. km., and the work force must be further reduced  by employing tree planting machines that have already been  approved for use in the 30 km zone.    In summary, the forestry industry must be carefully  reassessed and nurtured in the Kiev, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv, Rivne  and Volyn oblasts. Full utilization of these resources must be  based on the above classification and economic impact  projections of the Chernobyl accident.     <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-016C-20A>             Classification of Forest Resources on Radiopolluted Territories </FIG></p>

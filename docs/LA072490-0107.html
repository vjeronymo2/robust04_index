			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME UNLV PLAYERS WANT TO SUE NCAA OVER POSTSEASON PENALTY  </P> <P> An attorney representing several Nevada Las Vegas basketball players said  Monday that he has been asked to try to overturn the NCAA decision barring the  defending national champions from postseason play next season.  </P> <P> "The ones I've spoken to are quite hurt and they want action," attorney Stephen  Stein said.  </P> <P> "They feel they should not be penalized for something that occurred when they  were 6 or 7 years old."  </P> <P> The NCAA announced Friday that it was taking its action because the university  had not suspended Coach Jerry Tarkanian, as ordered, in 1977. Tarkanian sued  the NCAA over his suspension and won a court order preventing it.  </P> <P> UNLV officials said earlier that they would not go to court to battle the NCAA  and would work within the organization's guidelines in appealing the ban.  </P> <P> Also Monday, All-American forward Larry Johnson said that he will return to  Nevada Las Vegas for his senior season. He and other UNLV seniors would be  allowed to transfer and be eligible to play immediately because of the penalty.  </P></p>

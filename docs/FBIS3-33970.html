The Americans want  Jordan unilaterally to end the economic boycott of Israel,  before achieving a peace treaty, while Israel, in its turn, will  give nothing in return. They are pressuring Jordan to  expeditiously sign a peace treaty with Israel and not to wait  for a comprehensive solution on the Palestinian and Syrian  tracks. They are also exerting pressure toward holding meetings  between Jordan and Israel on the highest levels without any  preconditions and before resolving the pending problems or  signing a peace treaty just to record achievements for the U.S.  Administration in the interest of Israel.    What the Americans are asking from Jordan is neither  requested nor expected by Israel itself. They are asking for  this without making any concession to Jordan with regard to the  blockade imposed on al-'Aqabah, reducing Jordan's debts, or  without putting pressure on Israel for the sake of creating a  balance. They want us to tighten the blockade on sisterly Iraq,  which has implemented the Security Council resolutions, and, at  the same time, end the boycott of Israel which has not  implemented one single resolution.    If Jordan does not succumb to this American pressure, its  punishment will be: the freezing of aid, tightening the siege  of al-'Aqabah, protesting the flow of Iraqi oil to Jordan,  pressuring the IMF to fabricate an excuse to withhold its  adoption of the economic reform program -- and consequently not  to reduce or reschedule the debts, and also instigating some  sides stationed in Jordan to undermine internal stability.    Such pressure was exerted here in Amman by the visiting U.S.  delegations such as the secretary of commerce and the  Congressmen who visited Jordan recently. Pressure was also  exerted in Washington with the ranking Jordanian delegation. In  order for such pressures to bear fruit, an atmosphere of  instability needs to be created so as to confuse the government  and make it feel that it is living in a mine field and that it  is fighting on many internal and external fronts, and  consequently, the state will lose its stability.    The following are signs of the atmosphere that is being  created to subjugate Jordan:    The attempt to torpedo the sales tax law to justify  cancellation of the economic reform program and a return of the  1988 crisis which resulted from our debts;    The cinema blast on the pretext that the cinema shows  pornographic films, to accuse Islamic sides of the blast and  drive a wedge between these sides and the government.    The differences with the PLO and the return of concern,  fear,  and hegemony attempts.    The assassination of a Jordanian diplomat.    The atmosphere created by the food and medicine bomb hurled  -- with good intention -- by the minister of health at the right  time. And more to come.    The factors that will guarantee our steadfastness in the  face  of pressures are: a cohesive internal front--through carrying  out investigations and questioning for the sake of the homeland  and reform, and not just to register stands; seeking the  participation of all parties and not excluding any force;  respect for institutions; popular awakening; and responsible  acts.</p>

The prime minister briefed his brother the chairman of the  Presidential Council on the outcome of the tours made by him and  his deputies to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates  [UAE] and Kuwait as well as on his meetings with the leaders of  those countries and their briefings on the latest developments  in the Yemeni crisis and the war imposed on our Yemeni people by  the gang of the bloody al-Ahmar family.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid welcomed the patriotic personality  of al-Ustadh 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj who returned to  the homeland to participate with his brothers in building the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, a new modern state, a state of law  and order. The brother chairman of the Presidential Council  expressed his satisfaction about the outcome of the tours made  and praised the stand of those countries and their leaders on  the side of the cause of our Yemeni people as well as their  efforts at the Arab and international levels to stop this  destructive war which causes concern for the security and  stability of Yemen and the region. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid  reiterated the unilateral and strict commitment of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen to the decision of the UN Security  Council Resolution No. 924 on the cease-fire.    He stressed that all efforts must be concerted to implement  the Security Council resolution and to compel the Sanaa military  regime, which is challenging international legitimacy and is  violating the council's resolution, to abide by the cease-fire  resolution, stop the war and resort to peaceful dialogue to  tackle the political situation.</p>

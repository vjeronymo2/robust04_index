			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Unison honeymoons in Brighton: Lisa Wood on the problems of the marriage between three unions WITH HIS trim figure, gold spectacles, smart blue suit and well-polished black shoes Mr Alan Jinkinson looked like the managing director of a fast-growing company as he addressed the TUC conference as the boss of Britain's biggest and newest union. Mr Jinkinson is general secretary of Unison, formed in July by the merger of Nalgo, Cohse and Nupe, the public-service unions. Their experiences during the courtship and marriage forms just one of a number of examples that other unions may consider in formulating merger plans. Unison, with assets of Pounds 80m, employs 1,800 staff to look after the interests of 1.4m workers, ranging from white-collar town-hall employees to hospital ancillary workers. These pay annual subscriptions totalling almost Pounds 100m. Mr Jinkinson, previously general secretary of Nalgo, says that merging unions cannot be compared with merging companies, which have different objectives. The main aim of the unions' merger was to prevent employers from playing them off against each other. Economies of scale were important, but not at the expense of union democracy and jobs. Critical to the success of the merger, he says, was that no single union should be seen to be in the driving seat and that compromises were made at every level. It took more than four years of meetings, consultancy reports and delegates' conferences before the knot was eventually tied. There have been no compulsory redundancies and none of the offices around the country have been closed. Nor have the three London headquarters of the former unions been rationalised. The belief is that buildings will be sold gradually over time and staff levels will be reduced by natural wastage. Pay for Unison's employees has yet to be standardised, which could result in the wage bill going up. The three unions had very different cultures - from the activist-led Nalgo with its roots in local government to the more bureaucratic Nupe where poorly paid workers, such as ancillary workers in hospitals, drew heavily on the assistance of full-time officials. Administration also differed: Nupe collected its subscriptions centrally, while Nalgo raised funds through its local branch network. New structures are being introduced which reflect a successful compromise of the different backgrounds, says Mr Jinkinson. It is a claim that is only partly endorsed, with some officials arguing that a more 'big-bang approach' might have been useful to knock heads together. One says: 'Some feel a touch of Stalinism would not have gone amiss.' Officials talk of the practical difficulties of, for example, dealing with fluid groups such as those representing women and black people, and the more bureaucratic elected committees of Nupe. Mr Mike Folliard, an ex-Nupe branch secretary and chairman of the staff side at Central Manchester Healthcare Trust, says: 'Not a lot has happened locally because part of the agreement was that there would be a transitional period of two years.' Employers say they have not yet seen any benefit from the merger. West Dorset Community Health Trust, like a number of other trusts, wants to trim Unison's presence around the bargaining table from six to two representatives. The trust says: 'Unison argues that two people cannot represent the interests of such a wide variety of people. We disagree.' Mr Jinkinson admits there is duplication at present, with joint branch secretaries and chairpersons reflecting the entrenched self-interest. But he believes this will resolve itself in time, and he refuses to be drawn on whether there is over-representation of the union in workplaces. A colleague says: 'We are not here to help the employers - our job is to represent the interests of all our members.' Unison disputes claims - such as one made recently by the Royal College of Nursing - that the merger has alienated some of its members, including nurses, who do not want to be part of a big general union which they believe is dominated by Nalgo. Mr Jinkinson argues that membership of Unison will confer big benefits. 'Employers can no longer divide and rule - playing off white-collar workers against blue-collar ones.' Unison's power has not yet been tested. Mr Jinkinson hints that there could be a call for a show of strength next year if pay offers are not generous. If any evidence was needed to show that the vigour his former union for taking on the bosses had not been sapped, it came yesterday. Unison, with the majority of its delegates drawn from the former Nalgo, was the only big union to support a call by Mr Arthur Scargill to break the Tory labour laws.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: More bad news on the way? Sir, Doubtless the gloomy words of Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays Bank ('Recession to last 'two more years'', August 7), are encircling the world and there must be a danger that a few people will regard his comments as having some relevance to the economic circumstances and prospects of the UK. Should we not ask how it can be that a person gifted with such remarkable economic foresight presides over a bank that incurred a billion pounds in bad debts in one year? Should we not also conclude that Sir John's purpose is to prepare his shareholders for more and more bad news? Gordon Hazzard, 5 Balfour Place, Mayfair, London W1Y 5RG</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Rights issue by S African gold group A R250m (Dollars 74.2m) rights offer opens today for Eastvaal Gold, the company financing the development of the R1.7bn Moab gold mine, one of the largest high-grade gold deposits remaining in South Africa. Eastvaal, which until now has been privately held within the Anglo American group, will also be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange later this month. The Moab project will be the No 11 shaft at the Vaal Reefs complex, one of South Africa's richest gold mines. Vaal Reefs is managed by the Anglo American group, the world's largest gold producer. Production at Moab will start in 1997. In peak production years, it will produce between 12 and 13 tonnes a year, at an estimated recovery grade of 11.2 grams/tonne. The issue will cover the after-tax capital expenditure on the project until early 1995.</p>

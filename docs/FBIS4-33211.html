			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 2  June.    Media Secretary Raul Burzaco reported that Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo today informed the cabinet that the total  provincial deficit stands at $1.3 billion, of which $500 million  involves the northwestern provinces. (Buenos Aires Radio  Nacional Network in Spanish 1600 GMT 27 May 94)    It was reported that the unemployment rate hit 12 percent at  the end of April 1994, or an increase of 2.7 percent in the past  six months. In October 1993 the unemployment rate stood at 9.3  percent. Industrial circles blamed the increase on foreign  competition, increasing internal costs, and the incorporation of  new machinery and technologies that replace labor.

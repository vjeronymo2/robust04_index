			<p>BFN     [Text] The Information Service of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army 1st Corps has issued a statement saying that the enemy is  still attacking on the Visoko, Vares, and Breza fronts. The  Chetniks have been pounding Visoko from their positions in  Dolipolje, Kriva, Jelica, and Siljak. The Vares area has also  been exposed to heavy artillery fire, particularly the defense  lines in (Mesevicko Brdo) the villages of Rokoc, [words  indistinct], and the town itself. The aggressor has been using  his entire artillery arsenal in these attacks, including  howitzers, tanks, mortars, heavy guns, and antiaircraft guns and  machine guns, from his positions in Brezac, Jeljani, [words  indistinct].    Several Chetnik infantry attacks on the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army positions have been routed, but the enemy plans to continue  to attack the free territory. This is [words indistinct]  bringing in new forces and digging in. All these attacks and  preparations have been under way in the exclusion zone, says the  Army Press Center, and adds that -- considering such an indolent  attitude of the UN Protection Forces -- the fighters and the  units of our army are even more determined in their defense.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / S Korea leader starts four-day visit to China SOUTH Korea's President Roh Tae-woo began a four-day visit to China yesterday, another step towards Korean unification and an end to the cold war in Asia. The former ideological enemies are expected to discuss expanding trade ties, the situation where China remains one of reclusive North Korea's few remaining allies, and north-east Asia in general. The president will hold talks with China's President Yang Shangkun, Premier Li Peng and Communist party general-secretary Jiang Zemin. Mr Roh's visit comes a month after Seoul and Beijing formalised diplomatic relations. The two sides have lacked formal ties since the Korean peninsula was divided after the second world war and communist China was founded in 1949. Trade between China and South Korea has grown strongly in recent years, despite the absence of formal relations. Bilateral trade reached Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.4bn) last year compared with Dollars 3.8bn in 1990. It has already topped Dollars 6bn in the first half of this year. South Korean investment in China, which has a population of about 3m ethnic Koreans in the north-east, is estimated at about Dollars 500m. These are funds committed before diplomatic ties were forged, and investment is now tipped to grow rapidly. South Korea wants Chinese co-operation in solving the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula. China says it co-operates with the north's nuclear programme only for peaceful purposes. It officially claims to favour the removal of all nuclear weapons from the peninsula and of US troops from the south. Although South Korean business is happy to see the end of mutual hostility which has put a brake on trade and investment growth in the giant Chinese market, some economists warn of a threat to Korean export markets in textiles and electronics because of China's low labour costs. Chinese exports have exceeded South Korean exports for the first time this year. In the first eight months of 1992, China exported goods worth Dollars 50.62bn, compared with South Korea's Dollars 49.24bn.</p>

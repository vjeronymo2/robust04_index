Otherwise, he added, their is no use in holding a meeting  of the Airport Committee.    After attending a ceremony to raise donations toward a  school  building fund under Project Hope, which was held by the Shatin  Rotary Club yesterday, Zhang was asked to express his view on  the Hong Kong Government application to the Legislative Council  (Legco) Finance Committee for the amount of HK$1.6 billion [Hong  Kong dollars]. In reply, Zhang said the British side is always  raising obstacles and expressed the hope that the British side  would act according to the MOU.    When commenting on Chris Patten's accusation that the  Chinese  side is refusing to hold a meeting, Zhang Junsheng said: The  British side's programs have always failed to comply with the  MOU. In that case, what is the use in holding a meeting. The  British side, as well as Mr. Patten, has repeatedly stressed the  need to value the interests of Hong Kong people above everything  else, but they have stirred up so many political disputes and  now they have refused to tackle the airport issue according to  the MOU. I believe Hong Kong citizens will judge for themselves  whether the British side and Mr. Patten have acted in their own  interests or in the Hong Kong people's interests.    When asked whether the two sides had explored the  possibility  of resuming talks through diplomatic channels, Zhang responded:  If the British side should withdraw the partial electoral bill  submitted to Legco by the Hong Kong governor, it would be  possible to discuss through diplomatic channels the likelihood  of resuming talks. But the British side has closed the door  tight.    When asked to comment on the Hong Kong Government's  allegation that the tabling of the first phase of the  constitutional reform package in Legco was to prepare for the  1994/95 elections, Zhang said: That is just an excuse. If the  British side had sincerity and had not created side issues, the  two sides would have reached agreement on the district board  elections in the 17th round of talks. If the British side had  not insisted on lumping the single- vote, single-seat system for  Legco elections with the district board elections, an agreement  would have been reached. The relevant legislation would have  been easy and there would have been no time problem. So it is  meaningless for Chris Patten to keep talking nonsense. He  added: Since the Sino-British talks over the 1994/95 elections  have broken down, there will be no through train, and the  three-tier councils will be disbanded after 1997, because  British rule over Hong Kong will expire on 30 June 1997. The  British foreign secretary and Chris Patten have said on several  occasions that it is impossible for China to reorganize the  councils. That is their illusion. The Preliminary Working  Committee is now discussing ways to reorganize the councils and  will present a proposal to the Preparatory Committee of the  Special Administrative Region for a decision.</p>

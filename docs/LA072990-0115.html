			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'FAMILY-THERAPY PARTICIPANTS TRY TO SHED CHILDHOOD ANGUISH'  </P> <P> I enjoyed your article ("Menninger Dies: Changed U.S. View of Mental Illness,"  July 20) reviewing the contributions made to our society by Karl Menninger.  </P> <P> I am so sorry you didn't send this reporter to listen to John Bradshaw last  week. Who knows? Bradshaw may be today's Karl Menninger. Bradshaw also is  "delving into his patients' early life experiences . . . " and involving "the  patient's family . . . " believing that problems are preventable and treatable.  </P> <P> DELLA J. CARROLL  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

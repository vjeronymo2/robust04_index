			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / People: Shuffle in HSBC boardroom Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank, has been appointed a non-executive deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings, replacing John Gray who is stepping down as an executive deputy chairman in order to concentrate on his new job as chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Sir Peter's promotion follows HSBC's acquisition of Midland earlier this year and, while not unexpected, is part of a boardroom reshuffle which means that Midland directors will hold a quarter of the seats on HSBC's 20-strong board. Sir Peter, 61, who was chairman of BP for eight years until March 1990, is being joined on the HSBC board by Sir Colin Marshall (left), 59, chief executive of British Airways, and Geoffrey Maitland Smith (right), also 59, chairman of Sears. Richard Delbridge, a former JP Morgan banker who only joined Midland three years ago, is joining the HSBC board as executive director finance. It was originally intended that Sir Patrick Meaney, the chairman of Rank Organisation and one of Midland's longest serving directors, would go on the HSBC board, but he died some months ago. In addition Brian Goldthorpe, who had represented Midland on the HSBC board since 1991, also died recently. Meanwhile, Nigel Rich, managing director of Jardine Matheson Holdings, and John Swaine, deputy president of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, will step down as non-executive directors of HSBC Holdings but will remain on the board of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. John Gray will remain on the HSBC board. ***** Eric Cliffe (above), Boots Pharmaceuticals' managing director, is to retire next month after 33 years with The Boots Company. He is not being directly replaced; the organisation he headed has been divided into three separate units: Boots Pharmaceuticals, Boots Healthcare International and Boots Contract Manufacturing. Barry Clare has been appointed managing director of Boots Healthcare International which is responsible for Boots' European consumer products. Meanwhile, John Watson has been made managing director of Boots Contract Manufacturing which supplies Boots The Chemists. Gordon Solway is now managing director of Boots pharmaceuticals as well as a main board director of The Boots Company. He faces the difficult job of overseeing the international launch of Manoplax, a heart treatment vital to the company's hopes of remaining a credible drugs group. Boots expects the medicine to be approved in the US, the world's largest market, by the end of this financial year next March.</p>

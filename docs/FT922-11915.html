			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Plenty of headroom in the UK economy During the recent British election campaign, there was a recondite form of activity indulged in by many in the City of London. This was to make shock horror predictions of the state of the British economy which either party would inherit. If I single out Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, it is not because it was more alarmist than others, but because it took the trouble to spell out its forebodings in The Fiscal Reality Gap (March 1992). Coopers' shock horror scenario was that by 1996, a Conservative government would have to raise income tax by 13p in the pound, on the illustrative assumption that the Conservatives intended to return to a balanced budget by 1996. If this pessimism had been based on worries about public spending, it would have been understandable. For not all the very large deficit reflects the automatic effects of recession. But Coopers did not make public spending its central concern. Indeed, its pessimism was almost entirely based on the charge that the Treasury had overestimated likely economic growth. On the contrary, I think it has underestimated it, not necessarily for this year or next, but over the 1990s. The besetting sin of would-be down-to-earth types is that they always project the present and the recent past and forget that the economy moves in cycles of varying lengths, and that therefore neither booms nor slumps go on forever. Next week, we will have a new Confederation of British Industry Quarterly Trends Survey which contains the question: 'Is your present level of output below capacity?' The last survey showed 70 per cent below capacity on this criterion. Yet despite this slack, the Treasury projections show output rising only slowly off the bottom of the tramlines, with only a gradual reduction in the amount of slack. This projection may be right or wrong: but it hardly shows much over-optimism. The implication is also that unemployment will continue to rise, if at a slower speed until, say, this winter, and will thereafter improve at a snail's pace. The adjoining back-of-the-envelope table accepts the official assumption that the trend growth of real gross domestic product is now some 2 1/2 per cent a year. Indeed, excluding the North Sea contribution, it is 2 3/4 per cent. The estimate looks plausible in view of the average 2 per cent a year rise achieved in the first Thatcher decade and the signs that there was some underlying improvement in the course of the period. Another assumption in the table is that the economy was working at a sustainable or equilibrium rate around the final quarter of 1990. The amount of slack has had to increase temporarily in order to get the inflation rate down. The table plots the Treasury's output projections alongside the implicit path of capacity. It shows a large margin of slack persisting throughout much of the 1990s. It is not until 1994 that there is substantially less unused capacity than today; and even by 1996 there is still some excess slack. It is worth remembering that a margin of slack of 5 per cent of GDP amounts to Pounds 30bn a year of lost output and a corresponding number of unemployed or discouraged workers. What is there to be cheerful about in this outlook, which might represent a platform from which Bryan Gould could launch his attack on the crossbench consensus on macro-economic policy? The optimism lies in the headroom that is provided for non-inflationary growth. There is ample room for the economy to grow by even more than the 3 to 3 1/2 per cent rates projected by the Treasury from 1993 onwards, while still maintaining some downward pressure on inflation and without running into capacity barriers. It is a much better base both politically and fiscally than starting at the top of a boom. What could prevent reasonably rapid growth from being attained? The cliche answer is that the UK has been running a current payments deficit in a recession, which is supposed to be very naughty. The gloomsters have for the most part not noticed that the Central Statistical Office has revised the 1991 current deficit downwards to Pounds 4.4bn, or well under 1 per cent of GDP. And while the world economic slowdown came too late to blame for the UK recession, it can certainly be blamed for the failure of exports to offset more than a modest amount of the turndown in demand at home. The extremely low interest rate differential between Britain and Germany does not suggest either expected currency depreciation or any expected difficulty in financing the payments deficit - if there is one. As Mr Gladstone realised, if the government's own Budget is in order, the chancellor does not need to know what the balance of payments is. The real cause for concern is not the state of the British economy, but worldwide worries about credit retrenchment, the state of the banking system, and so on. The centre of these worries is not Britain, nor even the US, but now Japan, the country we were all told to emulate. But it really is too parochial to regard this syndrome of problems as a weakness for the British economy, which suffers from them less than many others do. Indeed, with a low and declining inflation rate, a much improved underlying productivity trend and a strong currency, Britain is in a reasonable position to ride out storms and take advantage of opportunities. In this connection, Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers has performed a service by showing that an upward blip is likely in the RPI which may only just miss 5 per cent this May. The blip will also affect the so-called underlying rate. But the true core rate, which omits a larger number of erratic items, will continue to fall - perhaps towards 2 per cent next year. * * * I would (as an ERM supporter who would like to see an eventual single European currency) shelve any attempt to narrow the UK's ERM bands from 6 per cent to the normal 2 1/4 per cent this year. There is obviously more scope for Britain to have moderately different interest rates from Germany's with wide bands than with narrow ones, provided that there is a general atmosphere of confidence in the currency, which is more likely after the election. With narrow bands, either the UK has to stick with German-type interest rates; or it has to do something very dramatic, such as leave the ERM, or at the other extreme, try to replace Germany as the anchor country of the system. With wider margins, these choices can be postponed and more time provided for Germany to overcome its unification problems and restore more normal interest rates.  -----------------------------------------------             UK GROWTH PROJECTIONS                       Indices 1990=100  -----------------------------------------------               OUTPUT      CAPACITY      GAP                                     (% of GDP)  ----------------------------------------------- 1990           100           99         +1 1991            97 1/2      101 1/2     -4 1992            98 1/2      104         -5 1/2 1993           101 1/2      106 1/2     -5 1994           105          109         -4 1995           108 1/2      111 1/2     -3 1996           112 1/2      114 1/2     -2  ----------------------------------------------- Treasury assumptions  -----------------------------------------------</p>

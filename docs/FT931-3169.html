			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Three ways to stop tax savings - Avoidance Rules THE CHANCELLOR announ-ced three measures yesterday to counteract tax saving by UK companies. All three measures will have immediate effect. The first is to bring within the UK tax net more overseas subsidiaries situated in low tax countries, the so-called controlled foreign companies. Under present arrangements, overseas companies will become subject to UK corporation tax if they pay local tax at less than half the UK rate. The chancellor proposes that this limit should be raised to three-quarters. As a result, many UK subsidiaries operating in such places as Hong Kong will now become subject to UK tax. The tax burden of the UK holding company will therefore rise. Measures are also proposed to tax interest received by UK companies from their overseas associated companies on an accounts basis. Previously the interest may have been taxed when it was received, and provided an opportunity for a group to benefit from a tax deferral on the interest received in the UK. At the same time, the paying company was receiving overseas tax relief when the interest was charged to its own accounts. The proposals will reduce the attractiveness of such arrangements. Finally, the chancellor has moved to prevent groups of companies from benefiting from the use of capital losses in companies they have purchased from outside the group. The Inland Revenue had previously announced that it would not object to the purchase and use of these capital loss companies, but the loss of tax revenue to the exchequer from the use of such companies to reduce groups' tax liabilities has clearly caused a rethink.

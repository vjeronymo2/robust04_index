			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Security forces are investigating the explosion of a  grenade thrown by unidentified individuals Wednesday night,  which killed a child and wounded 17 other people. The forces  also are investigating another explosion that did considerable  damage to the Legislative Building and nearby areas. This is  Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso.    [Begin recording] [Ortiz Moscoso] Perpetrators of this  barbaric method will get nowhere. It is only a means of  underscoring their personal positions. Printed materials found  at the site of these explosions call on the people to imitate  these rebellious groups in opposing the plebiscite. I think,  however, that they are getting nowhere and will not get  anywhere. The Guatemalan people are fed up with this type of  tactic and violence.    [Unidentified reporter] What about the bomb thrown last  night  in front of the [words indistinct]?    [Ortiz Moscoso] That is something different. That was not a  leaflet bomb. We are alarmed about this explosion. I visited the  place at about 1930 on my way home after leaving my office. The  police were there in force also. We want to capture these  irresponsible, wicked people. This is the only way I can  describe them. I must inform you and the general public of my  grief on learning that a child was killed by the this morning's  explosion. This blood must be on the head of the perpetrators.  It is unthinkable that such people detonate grenades at a place  where tired people are waiting to go home.    [Reporter] Can such explosions be regarded as attempts at  destabilizing the government?    [Ortiz Moscoso] I would rather say it is an attempt at  destabilizing the democratic system, which is different. The  government is represented by President de Leon. Such an attack  on innocent people cannot be understood to be an attempt to  destabilize the government but as a direct attack on democracy  and the Guatemalan people's desire to live in peace.

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Maxwell inquiry arrest expected THE SERIOUS Fraud Office is expected to arrest and charge a fourth man early this week in connection with the Maxwell affair. An arrest may arise from the arm of the SFO inquiry which is concentrating on the movement of money from the pension funds into the private companies in the Maxwell empire. This is one of five lines in the SFO investigation. It is uncertain whether an arrest would take place with police raiding the man's house early in the morning in front of television cameras, as happened when Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg were arrested in June this year. So far, the two Maxwell brothers and Mr Trachtenberg, a financial adviser to the late Robert Maxwell, have been charged with a total of 15 counts of theft and conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 135m. Mr Kevin Maxwell faces two counts of conspiracy to defraud and six of theft. Mr Trachtenberg faces two of conspiracy to defraud and four of theft. Mr Ian Maxwell faces a charge of conspiracy to defraud. All three are due to make their next court appearances on December 1.</p>

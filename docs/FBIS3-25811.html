			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Lending Roles Divided"] </F>   [Text] The Agricultural Bank of China will split into two  banks before the summer harvest this year to separate the  functions of policy implementation and commercial lending, a top  bank official said.    The two banks will be the Agricultural Development Bank and  the Agricultural Bank of China, said Ma Yongwei, president of  the Agricultural Bank of China.    Ma said the move is in line with the government's decision  to  forbid State policy banks from providing commercial loans.    The Agricultural Development Bank will implement the  government's policy of supplying subsidized loans to farmers,  starting this summer.    Although the 15 years of economic reform have raised  farmers'  living standard impressively, granting them long-term,  low-interest loans will continue to be a fundamental function of  the government bank officials said.    Many agricultural projects involving crop production  irrigation and technological development will continue to  receive government- subsidized soft loans.    These kinds of projects usually need huge outlays but have  slow returns and such loans are often considered highly risky by  commercial banks.    Bank analysts say the creation of the Agricultural  Development Bank is part of the government's efforts to maintain  its strong backing of agriculture while encouraging banks to do  their business according to more commercial practices.    They add that many villages remain undeveloped, even aside  from problems such as slow growth of farmers' income, high  inflation in general and skyrocketing prices of farming  materials in particular, and the huge number of surplus rural  labourers. But officials with the Ministry of Agriculture note  that agriculture in China has its own character and in many ways  is unlike agriculture in other countries.    After the summer harvest this year, the Agricultural Bank of  China can still find its clients in the countryside for its  commercial loans, they added.    The burgeoning rural industries, which grew by about 40  percent last year, have already become the backbone of the rural  economy.    Meanwhile, rural households' limited access to the markets  requires the government to extend huge loans to its grass-roots  commercial units each year to buy farmers' products.    Since rural industries and grassroots commercial units can  soon see profits from their investment, they should no longer  receive government-subsidized soft loans.    Starting this year, the Agricultural Bank of China will have  to balance assets and liabilities and manage business risks.    Both the Agricultural Development Bank and the Agricultural  Bank of China will be under the leadership of the People's Bank  of China, the country's central bank.    Both will have to be guided by the Central Bank's credit  quotas to help the government ensure its control over total bank  lending, according to bank officials.    In response to the government's call for strong backing of  agriculture, the Agricultural Bank of China raised its  outstanding loans to 968 billion yuan ($111.26 billion) by the  end of last year, up 176 billion yuan ($20.5 billion) from the  previous year.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo on the loose Champagne corks were popping at Lasmo's headquarters last night. The rejection of Enterprise's hostile bid was in part a thumbs-up for Lasmo's reformed management and balance sheet. But more decisive than Lasmo's positive qualities was Enterprise's failure to show any industrial logic in the bid and investors' distaste for the all-paper offer. So Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, still has to prove he can get the company's costs down and make the most of its development prospects. The bigger challenge, though, is faced by Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive. Shareholders have shown little confidence in his 'big boys' strategy of growing through acquisition. Lasmo's defensive salvos have thrown into doubt whether past acquisitions have been in shareholders' interests. Moreover, Enterprise's desperate purchase this week of 10 per cent of Lasmo is showing a paper loss of about Pounds 30m, while the company has wasted millions more on bid costs. Now is a good time for Enterprise to reassess its strategy. Growth through acquisition does not seem the best way to enhance shareholders' wealth. It would be better to focus on exploration, where Enterprise's previously excellent record has recently become rather tarnished. One way of sharpening the focus would be to split Enterprise into two. One half would contain the bulk of its production assets, pay investors handsome dividends and gradually liquidate itself. The other half would concentrate on exploration. But before Enterprise could contemplate a radical change of strategy, it would probably be necessary for Mr Hearne to split his roles of chairman and chief executive.</p>

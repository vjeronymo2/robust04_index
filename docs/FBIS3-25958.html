			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Candidates Chosen for Overseas Flotation"] </F>   [Text] China has selected 22 domestic enterprises for  possible flotation on overseas stock markets this year.    The list has been submitted to the State Council for final  approval.    However, authoritative sources say not all are certain to go  forward.    The 22 have been strictly selected by the State Council's  Securities Policy Committee, the China Securities Regulatory  Commission (CSRC), the State Economic and Trade Commission and  the State Planning Commission, said CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru.    And he said the list was weighted toward enterprises in  energy, transport, telecommunications, raw materials and some  key technical renovation projects.    They were large industrial firms which have performed  strongly in the past and continue to have great potential.    The majority of them would apply to be listed on the Hong  Kong stock exchange, Liu said, adding that some will arrange  listings on other international exchanges such as New York.    In 1993, the first nine Chinese enterprises were selected to  list their shares in Hong Kong.    Six of them had issued and listed 4.08 billion H shares by  the end of last years pooling HK$8.49 billion [Hong Kong  dollars] ($1.08 billion).    And their performance since has been as good as some blue  chip firms.    The remaining three are expected to make their debut in the  first half of 1994.    To ensure the overseas listing develops smoothly, Liu urged  the 22 firms to pay great attention to their transformation into  standardized shareholding companies.    He called on the firms to carefully appraise their assets  and  finance audits.    Their staffs should be familiar with international  accounting  standards and laws.    And he asked firms to carefully select their intermediaries,  including accountants, law firms and assets appraisers.    It was also crucial to select good underwriters, he said.    Liu urged the firms to grasp the chance to enter the Hong  Kong market early, as it is currently bullish.    He said more foreign capital will continue to flow into the  market as prices rise.  <H5>  The List of Candidates </H5>   The 22 companies are: Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, Dongfeng  Automobile, Tianjin Steel Tube, Qingling Automobile, Northeast  China Electricity Transmission and Substation Equipment, Harbin  Power Station Equipment, Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant,  Huaneng International Power, Shandong Huaneng Power, Datang  Power Plant, Shandong International Power Source Development,  China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Foshan  Ceramics, Guangzhou- Shenzhen Railways.

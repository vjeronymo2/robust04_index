			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 12 May (MENA) -- Former President 'Ali  Nasir Muhammad has affirmed that the road to understanding,  dialogue, and national reconciliation in Yemen is not closed yet  in spite of the ferocity of the ongoing battles.    In an interview with a MENA correspondent in Damascus,  Muhammad said that he put forward an initiative to resolve the  Yemeni crisis and that he is consulting about it with some  personalities who are not involved in the current dispute.    He added that if these personalities and the parties to the  dispute respond to this initiative, he is willing to go with  these personalities to Sanaa or Aden to stop the bloodletting  and save unity.    He stressed that any efforts, suggested solutions, or  initiatives to resolve the Yemeni crisis must be based on the  principle of safeguarding the Yemeni unity, not on returning to  the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990.    The former Yemeni president pointed out that he had  presented  several initiatives last year and this year and that he warned  earlier against turning conflicts among the members of the  ruling coalition into the funeral pyre of unity.    He regretted what is going on in Yemen, reaffirming his  backing for every effort to safeguard unity and resolve the  conflict through dialogue and peaceful methods. He noted that  what is happening at present does not help the two sides to have  a peaceful dialogue.    Commenting on the appointment of a defense minister and a  navy commander from among his old loyalists, he remarked that  his loyalists who went to Sanaa with him after the January 1986  incidents were divided between the General People's Congress and  the Yemeni Socialist Party, after these two partners had  (?aborted) the setting up of a democratic unionist party during  the honeymoon that preceded unity. He pointed out that this was  the choice of his loyalists and that it was not planned.    Muhammad affirmed that appointments to party and government  posts are according to the prevailing political rules and that  he has nothing whatsoever to do with these appointments. He  remarked that accepting an appointment is the personal choice of  the person selected for a post.</p>

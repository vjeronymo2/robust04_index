			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> HOUSE FIRE BELIEVED TO HAVE STARTED IN WIRING  </P> <P> City fire officials said they do not suspect arson in a house fire that broke  out Wednesday afternoon in an exclusive harbor front neighborhood which has  been plagued by a string of suspicious blazes recently.  </P> <P> The fire caused about $25,000 in damage to a home at 1960 Port Ramsgate at  about 1 p.m. No one was injured.  </P> <P> It began in the attic near some of the home's major electrical circuits,  according to Rosemary Williams, a Fire Department spokeswoman who said the  resident reported that the electricity first went dead in the house and then  there were loud crackling and popping sounds.  </P> <P> Moments later, Williams said, neighbors spotted smoke coming out of the house.  </P> <P> "It sounds like it was probably electrical," Williams said. Arson "is not  suspected in this case."  </P> <P> However, until the cause is established, Williams said, the possibility of  arson will be checked by investigators.  </P> <P> Williams said the area has been plagued in the last 10 months by fires  deliberately set in houses, cars and trash cans.  </P></p>

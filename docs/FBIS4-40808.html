			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang will agree to former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter's plan concerning its nuclear program if a comprehensive  solution is found to all other problems, North Korean Ambassador  to Moscow Son Sung-pil told the State Duma's international  affairs committee on Monday.    He said that after consultations in Pyongyang and a  telephone  conversation with Washington officials, Carter had unveiled a  plan for a U.S. rejection of sanctions against North Korea and  the resumption of bilateral talks broken off in March.  Simultaneously, Son said, Washington has agreed to provide to  North Korea a technology for a nuclear reactor working on light  water.    If the plan works, North Korea will fully comply with the  nuclear non-proliferation treaty though IAEA's inspection of its  nuclear installations will be impossible while the negotiations  are under way, he said.    At the same time, the ambassador warned that his country  would take proportionate, but strong measures in response to any  international sanctions which would be seen as "a declaration of  war and would respond accordingly."    On the Russian Foreign Ministry's initiative for an  international conference on the issue, Son said his country had  "a certain interest" in it. However, "we cannot accept it" if  the forum is intended to try to bring pressure on North Korea,  the ambassador said.    Son spoke of holding a series of talks with the Russian  Foreign Ministry to try to get the details of the conference  proposal.</p>

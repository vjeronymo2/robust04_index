			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Change of image for stainless steel THE STAINLESS Steel Fabricators' Association, which represents 180 companies in the UK stainless industry, has relaunched itself as the British Stainless Steel Association as part of a new assault on the marketplace. Mr Dick Wakelin, chairman of the association, said the change was more than cosmetic. Many member companies are not fabricators; they are stockholders, manufacturers, owners of foundries or involved with finishing. The association says its main aim is to promote the use of stainless steel in all its forms. Stainless is the only ferrous metal whose use in western markets is predicted to grow this decade. Through greater promotional activity, the association wants to increase the use of stainless steel in the UK to be nearer that of Japan and other leading industrialised countries. Japan uses 16kg per head per year while the UK uses only 5kg. The discovery of stainless steel was one of the world's first defence industry spin-offs. Sheffield metallurgist Harry Brearley was examining the excessive wear of rifle barrels and observed that steel with a high chromium content would not rust.</p>

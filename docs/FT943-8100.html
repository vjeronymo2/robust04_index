			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Tutsis to take over safe zone Rwanda's victorious Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) guerrilla army will move into the French-protected 'safe zone' as soon as Paris withdraws its troops next week, Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kigali. 'We want to occupy all Rwanda,' he said. 'Indeed, for the credibility of the government we have to occupy all Rwanda. But we will not attack the zone.' Mr Twagiramungu told reporters his government, which came to power last month, would co-operate with UN African forces taking over from the French forces. His remarks are likely to instil fear in hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees staying in the zone set up by France last month to protect Rwandans from being attacked by the former government army and militia, and to stop the rebel advance. They are also certain to upset the UN, which had hoped the zone would remain demilitarised after the world body took over the area following the French withdrawal, scheduled to be completed by Sunday. Thousands of Hutus are already leaving the safe zone and heading into neighbouring Zaire ahead of the French withdrawal, fearing reprisals from the RPF.</p>

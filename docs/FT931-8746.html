			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / 'We cannot keep asking for more': As east German unemployment rises, Judy Dempsey witnesses fierce debate in a Berlin cafe over whether workers are pricing themselves out of jobs BRIGITTA Strater has seen better days. 'Before the Wall fell, I was selling 450 white loaves and 600 mixed loaves a day. Now I am selling about 20 white, and 90 mixed loaves. 'People aren't buying that much any more. Its not because my prices are too high. Its because of the unemployment.' Her small, brightly lit bakery is in Kopenick, once the pulse of east Berlin's industrial heartland. Before 1989, more than 25,000 men and women worked in the region's six biggest factories. Today, fewer than 5,000 have secure jobs. The customers, who in the space of half an hour passed through her shop on a bitterly cold and snowy morning, were all unemployed, except for Heinz. 'I have a job, over the road with BICC,' he said pointing across to the large 19th century cable factory which the British-based BICC bought earlier this year. 'I am lucky. The managers know what they are doing. They said they will make the plant competitive with other big German firms. There's some hope for me.' Heinz, an electrical engineer, earns DM1,800 (Pounds 762) a month, low by western German standards, but high by eastern ones. He says he can get by. 'I know everyone is complaining about the price rises, especially for housing. You know we are losing all our subsidies. I now pay DM600 for my flat, a rise of DM350. And the flat hasn't even got hot water. But I think I would settle for jobs rather than a higher income at the moment.' His remarks provoked a lively discussion in the bakery. 'Are you crazy?' shouted Andreas. 'The unions said we could get the same wages as the Wessies (the term used for west Germans).' Andreas used to work in a small tool shop, close to the cable factory. 'The shop closed down last year. No one would buy any of our stuff. The unions said we would get 26 per cent more this year. We need the money.' 'And then what will happen?' said Heinz. 'There will be even more unemployment. We have to make compromises, at least for a short time. We are talking about getting our country off the ground.' Frau Strater, dressed in her big, white baker's apron, said it was time for everyone to make compromises. 'The old structures are dead. We have to start all over again.' She added that I G Metall, Germany's giant engineering union which is holding arbitration talks with the employers' federation in the five east German states in order to secure a 26 per cent rise for its members, would have to settle for less. 'The people want to work. Jobs will come here eventually. But we can't keep asking for more and more.' 'I am not asking for more. I only want my job back,' said Irmgard, a 26-year-old with a three-year-old daughter. After maternity leave, which was generous under the former communists in east Germany, Irmgard returned to the Berlin Plastikwerke, her employers, last March. 'They said my place was no longer guaranteed. I now have DM600 a month to live on. I am angry. I'm not looking for the higher wages. I am looking for work.' Every day, Irmgard comes into the bakery and flicks through the Berliner Zeitung. 'Something has to turn up,' she said. In a nearby smoke-filled pub, young men were downing litres of beer by eight o'clock in the morning. Henry, 22, a truck driver, kept criticising the unions. 'They should get us more money,' he said. His drinking colleagues said they didn't really care about the unions. 'I'm telling you. We are finished if we lose our jobs,' said Gerhard, 43, a driver for Coca-Cola. Out in the streets, which three years ago were full of activity, Cornelia was hurrying to work - across the River Spree to west Berlin. Until last year, Cornelia, 49, had worked as a nurse in an old people's home in east Berlin. 'I could have stayed there. But the money is better in the west. I now earn DM3,000 a month. I consider myself lucky on one level. But also I got up and did something about my situation. We can't keep moaning. We can't keep demanding higher wages if we are not producing anything. 'Eventually, things will get better here, and in the rest of Germany. We have to make it work,' she said.</p>

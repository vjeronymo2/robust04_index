			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Salomon included in IADB new core banking group SALOMON Brothers has been included in a new core group of banks picked by the Inter-American Development Bank, another sign of its rehabilitation following last summer's US Treasury bond market scandal. The IADB, the largest supplier of long-term development capital to Latin America, this year expects to raise up to Dollars 5bn in the capital markets. It has told banks this week it is abandoning its method of selecting lead managers for US dollar bond issues by rotation, and replacing it with a system of competitive bidding. Salomon has been chosen as one of only four banks which will be invited to bid each time the IADB seeks to raise dollars. The others are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and CSFB. Mr Carlos Santistevan, IADB treasurer, said the choice of Salomon reflected its efforts to improve its internal control to prevent a recurrence of last year's Treasury auction rigging, as well as Salomon's leading presence in the US dollar bond markets. The IADB's switch to competitive bidding is part of the overhaul of its financial functions, begun two years ago after the appointment of a new management team. It had previously rotated the lead management of dollar bond issues between three banks in the international bond market and four in the domestic US market. Now, a single group of seven banks will bid each time the IADB seeks to raise dollars in the public markets for periods of more than five years, with no distinction made between the domestic and Eurodollar markets. 'We believe that more competition and getting firms involved in both markets will help us narrow the spreads we get for our funding,' Mr Santistevan said. He added, though, that the bank would not necessarily always accept the lowest bid it received. Besides the four core banks, two others - Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan - will be invited to bid on alternate transactions, while six others will bid on one deal in every three. Since its capital increase two years ago the IADB has become a more active borrower, having raised only Dollars 1.8bn in 1990. It arranges roughly a third of its borrowing in dollars, with a further third in yen and most of the rest in low-yielding European currencies. It is thought likely to undertake a similar reorganisation of the syndicate of banks it uses to raise yen.</p>

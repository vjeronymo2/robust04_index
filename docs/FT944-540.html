			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Corruption worries Mahathir Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, says he is worried that corruption recently disclosed in the Malaysian football league might spread to the country's political system. Malaysian police have arrested at least 50 football players in recent days on suspicion of fixing the results of matches. Dr Mahathir said that he was concerned that if people were willing to offer money to ensure a side wins in a football match then they might also indulge in similar practices in the political arena. The investigations into football bribery in Malaysia comes at a time of mounting allegations about corruption in various sectors of Malaysian society.</p>

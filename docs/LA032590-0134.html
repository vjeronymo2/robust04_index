			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE UNIVERSAL MYTHS HEROES, GODS, TRICKSTERS AND OTHERS BY  ALEXANDER ELIOT (MERIDIAN: $8.95)  </P> <P> In this useful reference volume, Alexander Eliot has collected myths from  various countries and grouped them around recurring themes -- Death and  Rebirth, Monsters and Mythic Beasts, Bringers of Magic and the Arts, etc. The  Greeks and the tribes of the Guinea coast of Africa both had legends about a  ram with a shining golden fleece.  </P> <P> The ancient Hebrews told stories about the fallen angel Azazel, who taught  humanity the art of working with metal, while the Buryat tribes of Mongolia  traced the knowledge to Boshintoi, the blacksmith of the solar forge. It's  interesting to compare these stories, but Eliot's brief synopses lack the  poetry that gives myths their power and beauty. The introductory essays by  Joseph Campbell and Mircea Eliade seem more immediate and compelling.  </P></p>

As a matter of fact, in what way is East Europe different  from West Europe? Back in 1945 it ended up in the Soviet zone  of influence, deprived of an opportunity for normal development,  but an event which had fatal consequences for the East Europeans  occurred even earlier, in August 1939. It was the  Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with all its secret protocols, which  divided this part of Europe between the Soviet Union and Germany.    This is why two Europes exist. As far as the West Europeans  are concerned, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is just a vague  memory of the dark past. For the East Europeans, this division  of the continent was a reality. East Europe can be defined as  the group of countries which became the objects of trade between  Moscow and Berlin in 1939.    A reduction to the role of historical object leaves deep  scars, Polish writer Czeslaw Milosz remarked, and calls for  caution toward the two large neighbors -- Russia and Germany.  Decades of pain and humiliation -- this is what distinguishes  the East European countries from those in West Europe.    All the arguments cited by Moscow, Washington, or Paris  against East Europe's inclusion in NATO are sensible and  rational: "It is not worth investing large sums of money to  reequip and retrain the East European armies to NATO standards.  The East Europeans themselves would find it more useful to aim  for membership of the European Union and worry more about the  economy than the army. And the main point is this: There is no  need to antagonize the Russians, many of whom still consider  NATO to be their enemy...." To put it briefly, a great power  enjoys some advantages in geopolitics -- people try not to  insult it unnecessarily.    But the perfidious scar of Europe's prewar division has not  disappeared off the face of the continent. Another question:  Is it worth the Lithuanians or the Poles exploiting this tragic  past and exciting anti-Russian feelings in the West now, when  there are no grounds for it? It is, however, obvious that the  inbred fear of a fresh division will govern the policy of the  present and future generations of East Europeans.    Historical guilt is a metaphysical term which is rejected by  many people. But it is, nonetheless, not worth while expressing  enthusiasm because of NATO's decision and gloating over other  people's humiliation.</p>

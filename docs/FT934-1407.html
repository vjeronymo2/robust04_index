			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Motoring: Diesels hit the heights The year of the diesel car breakthrough: that is how 1993 will go down in the annals of British motoring. Sales rose so fast - to their present 26 per cent of registrations - that industry forecasts at the beginning of the year were overtaken by events. A year ago, it was agreed generally that 200,000 diesel cars would be sold in Britain in 1993. I had a gut feeling this was a considerable under-estimate; 250,000 would, I thought, be nearer the mark. Even this was not optimistic enough. An educated guess puts year-end UK sales of diesels at more than 300,000 in a total market expected to be just under 1.8m. Two years ago, when only one new British-registered car in 10 was a diesel, anyone suggesting that kind of figure for 1993 would have been told he was hallucinating. Now, it is hardly fanciful to suggest that next year's total could be nearer to 400,000, with one new car in three (against this year's fewer than one in four) having a diesel engine. There is no simple explanation for why it has happened. It is not as though diesel fuel suddenly has become a lot cheaper than unleaded petrol, as it is in France where close to half the new cars sold are diesels. Probably, it is down to a combination of factors. The economic and environmental benefits of diesel cars are now appreciated widely. They have become as pleasant as their petrol equivalents to drive, while the price differential between a diesel car and a petrol car with fuel injection and catalytic converter has narrowed, even disappeared. The cost of filling a car's tank has increased, and will continue to go up faster than the rate of inflation for the foreseeable future. So, for company car fleet managers, if not yet for all who drive them, fuel consumption has become a matter of practical rather than academic importance. For years, the French PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen) has made most of the running with diesel cars in Britain. Now, although its products are as good as ever, they no longer enjoy a monopoly of excellence. Ford has pulled itself up by the bootstraps. Its Escort and Mondeo turbo-diesels have gained so much power and refinement that they can now hold up their heads in the company of, say, the VW Golf, Citroen Xantia and Peugeot 405. The latest Granada/Scorpio turbo-diesel, with an Italian VM 2.5-litre engine and very tall gearing (90 mph/145 kmh at only 3,000 rpm), wafts along motorways with the silence of the chairman's limousine. Vauxhall, using turbo-charged engines made by Isuzu, General Motors' Japanese associate, first doubled and then trebled its diesel sales this year. So, too, did VW-Audi, which is now offering the super-economical direct injection diesel, once exclusive to Audi, in the latest VW Passat models. No car has made a better impression on me this year than the BMW 325tds SE I have been driving lately. The turbo-charged and inter-cooled six-cylinder diesel combines muscle with finesse. Push it hard and it goes (indeed, even sounds) like a sporty BMW - but it pulls fifth gear silkily at less than 30 mph/50 kph and will yield 40 mpg (7 litres/100km) on a journey. Among other competent and pleasurably driveable European-made diesels and turbo-diesels are Fiat's Tipo, the Renault 19, Seat's new Ibiza (exceptionally keen value), the urbane Mercedes-Benz C-Class and E-Class, and Rover's Montego turbo-diesel estate - which must be one of the most under-rated cars around. The Peugeot-engined Rover Metro, 200 and 400 diesels are well-built and finished with care. But it is a pity that Rover has not yet produced a turbo-charged and inter-cooled 600 diesel for the company fleet managers who are abandoning petrol engines to cut costs. Land Rover has shown that the inherently rather noisy (but exceptionally frugal) direct-injection Rover diesel engine can be quietened significantly. The latest Land Rover Discovery automatic, with a 2.5-litre version of this engine, is a class leader for refinement, driving ease and modest fuel consumption. One large gap in the diesel car market remains. Where are the automatics? Diesel engines and automatic transmission are a natural fit, but the majority of makers are reluctant to offer two-pedal models. They think the greater cost of automatic transmission, plus the slight loss of performance and economy, would deter most buyers. Citroen - a welcome exception - has two-pedal, non-turbo ZX diesels at Pounds 735 more than their manual gearbox equivalents. The XM turbo-diesels have automatic transmission as standard, but a two-pedal Xantia diesel is still a little way off. Automatics are available either as standard or at extra cost on all Mercedes-Benz diesels as well as the Audi 80 and 100 TDIs, BMW 3-Series and 5-Series, and Volvo 940. Other makers really should follow. An automatic Ford Granada/Scorpio or Rover 800 turbo-diesel must appeal to managers turning to diesel for their company fleets and looking for something suitable to offer executives.</p>

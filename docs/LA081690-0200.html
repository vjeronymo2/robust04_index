			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM THAT TRACKS DOWN TEEN DRUG ADDICTS COMES UNDER FIRE;  </P> <P> REGULATORS: ONCE FOUND, THE RUNAWAYS, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE PARENTS, ARE  TRANSPORTED TO TREATMENT FACILITIES. THE STATE IS INVESTIGATING THE COMPANY FOR  NOT HAVING THE PROPER LICENSES.  </P> <P> When their 15-year-old daughter ran away from their Simi Valley home in 1988  after a history of cocaine use, Donald and Alice Soeder were frustrated and  scared.  </P> <P> They wanted their daughter, Jane, off the streets and in a drug abuse treatment  program, but they had only a vague idea of where to find her and no clue of how  to get her to help.  </P> <P> On the advice of a Port Hueneme drug treatment facility, the Soeders called  S&amp;L Teen Hospital Shuttle, a Canoga Park firm that transports youths with  drug problems, sometimes forcibly, to treatment programs.  </P> <P> Within days, using photographs of the girl and telephone records, the firm  found her and drove her -- with her hands and feet bound -- to the Port Hueneme  facility. Two years after Jane completed treatment, she and her parents have  nothing but praise for S&amp;L. "There was no way that they by themselves could  have gotten me," Soeder said of her parents.  </P> <P> But the firm, the only one of its kind currently operating in the Los Angeles  area, has also drawn criticism from some drug treatment officials and the  attention of regulatory officials.  </P> <P> S&amp;L operates as both a transport and an investigative service, those who  have used the firm said. Sometimes the company simply drives stubborn youths  with drug problems from their homes to treatment centers. In other cases, such  as Jane Soeder's, it tracks down addicted teens who have run away from home,  then restrains them during the drive to rehabilitation facilities.  </P> <P> State officials last month began investigating the company, which is  recommended to parents of addicted teens by a handful of Los Angeles drug  treatment facilities.  </P> <P> S&amp;L is authorized by the state to operate as a transport service. It is  registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, the agency that  licenses businesses such as limousines, buses and airport shuttles.  </P> <P> The firm is listed in the telephone book as an ambulance service, but is not  licensed as such by the city, county, or state, officials said.  </P> <P> Neither is S&amp;L licensed to conduct private investigative work. Last month,  the California Department of Consumer Affairs' Bureau of Collection and  Investigative Services began to investigate S&amp;L, said Gretchen Werry, the  bureau's program coordinator.  </P> <P> Leslie Miller, who with Steven Sawhill owns and operates S&amp;L out of the  couple's Canoga Park house, referred questions about the firm and the state  investigation to their lawyer, Larry Mandell.  </P> <P> "They just transport kids that have drug problems because the parents can't do  it for themselves," Mandell said. "They have their referrals, and things are  working out good, and they'd just like to keep it at that."  </P> <P> Mandell declined to discuss S&amp;L or the state's investigation in more  detail.  </P> <P> The Department of Consumer Affairs last week sent S&amp;L a "cease and desist"  letter ordering the firm either to shut down permanently or to stop the  investigative part of its work until it applies for and receives the proper  state license, said Denise Grayson, the department investigator assigned to the  S&amp;L case.  </P> <P> Miller and Sawhill will have one month from the day they receive the letter to  respond, Werry said. If they ignore the letter or cannot show that they have  proper licensing, she said, the department ultimately could recommend  prosecution.  </P> <P> Operating as a private investigator without a state license is a misdemeanor  punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and a jail term of up to one year, Werry  said.  </P> <P> To obtain a private investigator's license, an applicant must perform 6,000  hours -- approximately three years -- of investigative work with either a law  enforcement agency or a private detective firm and must pass a written test,  Grayson said.  </P> <P> The "cease and desist" letter sent by the Consumer Affairs Department this week  was the second such notice mailed to S&amp;L in a year. On Aug. 3, 1989, days  after they learned of S&amp;L in a magazine article that mentioned the firm,  officials from the Los Angeles Department of Transportation sent the firm a  letter ordering it either to obtain a transport service license or shut down,  said Donald Mansion, a DOT investigator.  </P> <P> It was nine days later -- on Aug. 12, 1989 -- that Sawhill and Miller applied  for state authorization to operate as a transport service.  </P> <P> In their permit application, the couple identified themselves as an equal  partnership under the name "SLTHS." They claimed five years of experience in  the transport field, and described their business only as "shuttling teen-agers  and adults to requested destination."  </P> <P> Drug treatment workers who have referred parents to S&amp;L said the firm  charges a fee based on driving distance and time involved in locating and  transporting each teen-ager. One treatment worker said the fee averages $600  per case.  </P> <P> Brent Lamb, administrator of Anacapa Adventist Hospital, a 48-bed juvenile  psychiatric hospital in Port Hueneme that uses S&amp;L "a couple times a  month," said S&amp;L's fee is not covered by patients' medical insurance. He  said Anacapa, the facility to which S&amp;L took Jane Soeder, pays the  transport fees for the teen-agers it receives from S&amp;L, and does not pass  those fees on to the youths' parents.  </P> <P> There is no law prohibiting private citizens from helping parents find and  retrieve a runaway child, even if the effort requires them to use "reasonable  force," said Dallas Binger, a consultant to the Los Angeles Police Department's  juvenile narcotics unit. But anyone who does so as a business must be licensed  for the task, Binger said.  </P> <P> Past S&amp;L customers said the firm's workers do not carry weapons, and that  when they suspect they may confront violence in retrieving a teen-ager they  contact police for backup help. But neither Binger nor the police departments  reported by customers to have helped S&amp;L in individual cases said they had  heard of the shuttle company.  </P> <P> Customers and treatment centers who have used the firm said they knew of no  instance in which S&amp;L injured a teen-ager under its care. Many praised the  company as acting professionally and compassionately in an obscure and poorly  regulated field where the potential for abuse is great.  </P> <P> "You've got to know what you're doing," said Dan Leon, program coordinator for  the Avalon adolescent drug treatment program at Coldwater Canyon Hospital in  North Hollywood, a 30-bed facility that receives approximately 25% of its  patients from S&amp;L. "You've got to know how to deal with the kid. That's why  we use them. We know they're not going to rough the kid up unnecessarily."  </P> <P> But several people who work in the adolescent drug treatment field, including  some who said they have referred parents to S&amp;L, said they objected to the  company's tactics.  </P> <P> "It sounds like somebody else trying to exploit the drug problem," said Scott  Lewis, a spokesman for the California Department of Health Services, who said  he had not heard of S&amp;L. "You know what it reminds me of? The old  deprogramming days," he said, referring to firms hired by parents to retrieve  teen-agers who ran away from home to join cults.  </P> <P> Some drug treatment experts took issue with the concept of forcing teen-agers  to enter drug treatment centers against their will.  </P> <P> "When kids come to programs like this, the more you strong-arm them into the  program the less they'll work in the program," said Chris Layton, clinical  supervisor of Renew Life, a 23-bed, nonprofit facility for teens with drug or  behavioral problems located at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank.  </P> <P> "Often these shuttle services are hired to force a person into a situation they  don't want to be in," said Layton, who said he referred parents to S&amp;L in  the past. "In that case, you end up spending the first few weeks just working  on that issue."  </P> <P> Others who work with adolescent drug abusers, however, argued that forced entry  into a treatment program is sometimes necessary.  </P> <P> "It's not as simple as, 'They have to want the help to get it,' " said Jay  Cavanaugh, president of the board of directors of Interagency Alcohol and Drug  Rehabilitation Programs, a nonprofit group that runs four non-residential  adolescent drug treatment centers in the Los Angeles area and that has used  S&amp;L in the past. "There are a lot of times when the kids are very ill."  </P> <P> "It is definitely the last of the last resorts," said Cindy Hobbs, intake  coordinator for the Life Plus Treatment Center in Panorama City, a private  adolescent program that uses S&amp;L about twice a month, usually to retrieve  runaway teens. But, Hobbs stressed, "I would rather see a kid in a hospital  safe than out on the streets and using. If that's what needs to be done to get  the child in, then that's what needs to happen."  </P></p>

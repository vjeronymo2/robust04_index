			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Airbus Finance in Dollars 1bn loan launch Airbus Finance, the sales finance company recently established by Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft-building consortium, yesterday publicly launched a Dollars 1bn syndicated loan, its debut transaction. The seven-year revolving credit facility carries an interest rate of 30 basis points above Libor for the first four years of the loan and 35 basis points over Libor for the remaining three years. The loan is guaranteed by Airbus Industrie's four shareholders, Aerospatiale, Daimler-Benz, British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas. Eventually it is hoped that AFC, which will provide finance to Airbus Industrie's customers for the purchase of aircraft, will become a separately-rated stand alone company. The company intends to return to the syndicated loans market and also to eventually tap the international capital markets, J. P. Morgan said. J. P. Morgan is AFC's financial adviser and has played a key role in the design of the loan. The loan is being placed among selected relationship banks of Airbus Industrie and banks of Airbus' four shareholders. Banks are being invited to participate at levels of either Dollars 60m or Dollars 30m with participation fees of 12.5 basis points or 6.25 basis points respectively. On the undrawn part of the facility, AFC will pay a commitment fee payable quarterly in arrears at 12.5 basis points in the first three years and 15 basis points thereafter. Additionally, there will be a fee of 2.5 basis points per annum if the use of the facility exceeds 50 per cent and a fee of 5 basis points if use exceeds 75 per cent.</p>

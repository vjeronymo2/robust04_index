			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Crisis fears over Pounds 50bn PSBR played down THE government's forecast of a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement for this financial year does not spell crisis for Britain's public finances, a leading UK economic research body reported yesterday. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said in its latest quarterly economic review that current fiscal policy was sustainable. It said that recent government actions would tend to stabilise the PSBR at about 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product by the late 1990s, compared with the 8 per cent of GDP officially envisaged for 1993-94. The institute, in its forecast for the UK economy, assumes that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will announce a further Pounds 2.5bn of tax increases in the November Budget on top of the Pounds 6.7bn of tax increases for 1994-95 and the Pounds 10.3bn for 1995-96 introduced in the March Budget. It said that the government's case for fiscal tightening in November should not rest on 'such insecure foundations' as fears about future debt levels. 'The need to raise tax rates to stabilise the debt stock has been greatly exaggerated,' the institute commented. It said tax increases in November would be more justifiable as part of a policy switch in which taxes were raised and interest rates cut to maintain demand. Such a policy change might be advisable if interest rates were to fall sharply elsewhere in Europe or the pound were to rise strongly, undermining the competitiveness of UK exports. The institute's analysis suggests that the ratio of general government gross debt to GDP will stay well within the Maastricht treaty criterion of 60 per cent of GDP in the years ahead. While the ratio will rise from an estimated 40.4 per cent last year, it should stabilise a little below 50 per cent by the end of the decade, it said. The institute is more optimistic than the government about current borrowing trends. It expects a 1993-94 PSBR of Pounds 46bn, equivalent to 7 per cent of GDP. The institute, which advocates a Keynesian approach to economic policy, said the present level of government borrowing was not excessive in the context of the recent recession. Although it argues that only about 2.5 percentage points of the 9 per cent deterioration in the PSBR/GDP ratio since 1988-89 can be directly attributed to the recession, the institute expects that public finances will benefit from enhanced revenue and less need for social security spending as the economy recovers. Its main forecasts assume that UK short-term interest rates remain in a 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent range during the next two years before rising again. The institute sticks by the forecast of 2 per cent GDP growth for this year which it first made last November. It has revised downwards its earlier expectations of end-1993 retail prices inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, to about 3.5 per cent. Looking ahead to next year, the institute expects consumer demand to accelerate in spite of the prospect of higher taxes. The growth would be based on a fall in unemployment from 2.91m at present to an average of 2.84m in the fourth quarter of this year and 2.8m next year, an improved housing market and increased personal wealth.

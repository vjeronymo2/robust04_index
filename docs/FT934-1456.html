			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): News and comment spice senior bourses News and comment continued to spice the technical preoccupations of the Paris and Frankfurt bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was led higher by futures buying, particularly by domestic investors, the cash market responding with a gain of 36.18, or 1.7 per cent in the CAC-40 index to 2,196.44. This left it just 0.1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of FFr5bn. Michelin was one of the best performers of the day, rising FFr6, or more than 3 per cent to FFr199. Mr Christopher Will, of Lehman Brothers in London, said that the shares of Michelin and other European tyremakers were responding to Thursday night's US news of a Goodyear increase of 3 per cent in downmarket replacement tyres - long awaited, and following price weakness in a very soft US replacement market in the second and third quarters of 1993. On the downgrade, Euro Disney fell 85 centimes to FFr34.55 after a report said that its banks had rejected a solution to its financing problems from its parent, Walt Disney, until an audit was carried out. FRANKFURT fielded the expiry of DTB monthly and quarterly futures and options contracts with little pain for share prices, the DAX index closing 13.54 higher on the session at 2,151.02, 0.5 per cent lower on the week, and recovering a little more in the post bourse where it finished at 2,154.76. Turnover, inflated by the options expiry, rose from DM9.2bn to DM17.5bn. In a news-led gain, Metallgesellschaft climbed on the departure of its chairman and its chief financial officer, rising DM16.30 to DM309.30 in floor trading; but it fell back to trade at DM298 late in the post-bourse as analysts worried that the company might need a rights issue. Metallgesellschaft's new chairman is to be Mr Kajo Neukirchen, currently supervisory board chairman at the ball bearing manufacturer, Kugelfischer, which itself rose DM8.50, or more than 5 per cent to DM173.50 on a brokers' recommendation citing its loss elimination potential. Schering recovered DM28 to DM1,056.50 as a number of brokers said that its multiple sclerosis drug, Betaseron, had timing on its side. In the automotive sector, the tyremaker, Continental, climbed DM5.50 to DM265.50 on the American pricing news from Goodyear. ZURICH returned to record levels, led by a good performance by some of the chemicals issues, and the SMI index added 21.8 to 2,889.5, for a weekly rise of 1.0 per cent. Mr Daniel Brupbacher at Bank Vontobel in Zurich sees room for further advances next week, with the domestic interest rate trend continuing down and in the absence of developments abroad to disrupt the market. Ciba-Geigy, a recent laggard, rose strongly with its registered shares SFr12 higher at SFr844 and the bearers SFr28 up at SFr878. Sandoz bearers rose SFr40 to SFr4,140. Nestle continued to be heavily traded, adding SFr14 to SFr1,254. Banks mostly edged lower, failing to derive benefit from Thursday's 25 basis point cut in the discount rate. A SFr35 rise to SFr3,570 in CS Holding was attributed to the expiry of a warrant issue in connection with a capital increase, which was taking pressure off the share. Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, picked up SFr20 to SFr970 as the market assessed the change in shareholder structure announced late on Thursday. AMSTERDAM was driven higher by short-covering and options-related buying, with the publishing sector at the centre of attention. The CBS Tendency index added 1.7 to 143.1 for a 2.2 per cent rise over the week. Elsevier rose Fl 2.50 to Fl 168.30, VNU added Fl 3.50 to Fl 157.50 and Wolters Kluwer advanced Fl 2.80 to Fl 117.00. A 30 cent dip to Fl 180.50 in Akzo was attributed to news that the industry's European federation saw no sign of recovery. In the same sector, DSM closed 0.80 cents higher at Fl 107.50, but off a Fl 108.00 high. Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium producer, was lifted Fl 1.40 to Fl47.30 on foreign demand and rising aluminium prices. Hunter Douglas climbed climbed Fl 5.00 to 83.50. MILAN was steady as the lower house of parliament approved measures to cut next year's deficit and the Comit index eased 0.15 to 602.40, for a 4 per cent rise on the week. Olivetti added L106 to L2,117 on expectations that it would be awarded Italy's second mobile telephone operator license next year. Credito Italiano shed L22 to L2,228 amid renewed heavy foreign selling. Ferruzzi rose L400 to L27,400 and Montedison L50 to L585 ahead of their capital raising operations next week. MADRID featured a further Pta21 gain in Iberdrola to Pta969 on the potential Standard &amp; Poors upgrade of its debt rating. The general index rose 1.10 to 308.61, fractionally up on the week, in turnover of Pta28bn.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan on Monday renewed a  call for North Korea to take measures to allay international  suspicions that it is secretly developing a nuclear weapons  capability.    "We are concerned that North Korea may not have understood  very well the U.N. Security Council statement urging Pyongyang  to comply with international nuclear safeguards," Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We want  to urge North Korea again to take the statement seriously and  actively take steps to resolve the issue," the top government  spokesman said.    The Security Council statement calls for efforts to help  allay concerns that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons  through dialogue, he said.    Takemura's comment followed North Korea's accusation that  the  United Nations is "applying double standards" in issuing the  statement last week.    According to the (North) KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA)  monitored in Tokyo, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman  said pressure from the United States has forced Pyongyang to  "normalize our peaceful nuclear activities unilaterally frozen"  for North Korean-U.S. talks.    Warning against any escalation of pressure, the spokesman  said North Korea's policy is to answer "strength with strength,  dialogue with dialogue."    Last Thursday, the U.N. Security Council issued a statement  urging Pyongyang to allow full inspections of its nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of the capital,  by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    North Korea has insisted the nuclear issue is not an  international issue, but a problem to be worked out with the U.S.    Japan's Foreign Ministry reacted calmly to North Korea's  denunciation of the U.N. statement. Vice Foreign Minister  Kunihiko Saito described Pyongyang's statement as "not alarming"  because it did not completely block room for negotiations to  solve the problem of North Korea's alleged nuclear arms  development.    He noted that North Korea's statement said Pyongyang is  still  prepared to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem.    "The international community will continue to expect North  Korea to change its mind through dialogue," Saito told a news  conference. He said the international community will continue  to urge China to play an expanded role in solving the problem.    He denied that Japan had asked Indonesia to mediate in  solving the crisis or received requests from Indonesia to play a  mediation role.    Saito said the government is investigating the reported use  of Japanese materials for stainless steel tanks that were  installed at North Korea's new facility. THE WASHINGTON POST  reported Saturday that an IAEA inspection team obtained evidence  that high-quality materials imported from Japan were used for  stainless steel tanks.</p>

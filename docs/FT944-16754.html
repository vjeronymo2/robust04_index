			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Truck and van sales show ninth successive rise Commercial vehicle registrations rose for the ninth successive month in September, providing only tentative signs that a slowdown in the rate of recovery of the new-car market might be spreading to parts of the van and truck market. Registrations of trucks over 3.5 tonnes did fall in September - by 12.2 per cent to 4,443 from 5,059 in the same period a year ago. But this was attributable entirely to sales during the previous September being inflated by a rush to register vehicles which would not have met new emissions regulations introduced on October 1 last year. In contrast, registrations of light vans last month jumped by 40.6 per cent, to 5,230 from 3,719, while those of panel vans such as the Ford Transit were 12.3 per cent higher at 8,464 compared with the previous September's 7,537. Registrations of light four-wheel-drive utility vehicles also fell slightly last month, to 1,210 from 1,322 a year ago, although for the first three quarters of the year as a whole they were half a percentage point higher at 10,775. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that the bus and coach market was static last month compared with levels achieved a year ago at 235 against 234, but this sector is also up - by 18.1 per cent at 2,145 for the first nine months as a whole. The share of the total commercial vehicle market taken by imports rose last month to 45.4 per cent compared with 43.8 per cent a year ago, lifting the year-to-date level to 43.6 per cent from the 41.13 of the first nine months of last year. However, the figure conceals a very sharp rise in the penetration of the truck market by importers anxious to compensate for the steep recession in Continental truck markets. Their share jumped to more than 58 per cent last month compared with just over 47 per cent a year ago. Among those making the biggest gains in the month were Scania, with registrations up 22.8 per cent, Renault up 44.3, and Mercedes-Benz up 12.7. All the UK-based truck manufacturers saw their registrations slip back with the sole exception of ERF, the UK's last independent publicly quoted truckmaker. It achieved a 3.8 per cent rise in registrations. In the vans sector LDV, the former Leyland DAF operation rescued from receivership last year, continued its own recovery - registrations last month rose 50 per cent to 1,450 from 967 a year ago.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS                        JANUARY-SEPTEMBER 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Volume     Share (%)  Share (%)                                 Volume   Change    Jan-Sept'   Jan-Sept'                                 (Units)    (%)        94          93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                   176,950   +15.5      100.0      100.0 Imports                          77,097   +22.3       43.6       41.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                            54,846   +22.0      100.0      100.0 Imports                          21,846   +33.3       39.8       36.5 Ford                             24,354   +22.7       44.4       44.1 Vauxhall (General Motors)        15,740   +13.4       28.7       30.9 Renault                           3,824   +39.4        7.0        6.1 PSA Peugeot Citroen               3,244   +12.2        5.9        6.4 Rover (BMW)                       2,398    +1.0        4.4        5.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium vans &amp; pick-ups (1.81 - 3.5 tonnes) Total                            77,161   +13.0      100.0      100.0 Imports                          30,295   +16.9       39.3       39.4 Ford                             35,600    +6.0       46.1       49.2 LDV                               9,267   +28.0       12.0       10.6 Volkswagen                        6,217   +29.9        8.1        7.0 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)      6,324   +58.6        8.2        5.8 Renault                           4,316   +10.7        5.6        5.7 Nissan                            3,336   +22.2        4.3        4.0 Vauxhall (GM)                     3,097   +11.8        4.0        4.0 PSA Peugeot Citroen               2,998   -16.1        3.9        5.2 Toyota                            2,851    -4.8        3.7        4.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks (over 3.5 tonnes) Total                            32,033   +16.3      100.0      100.0 Imports                          18,708   +43.2       58.4       47.4 Iveco group** (Fiat)              7,309    +5.7       22.8       25.1 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)          5,727    +8.9       17.9       19.2 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)      5,714   +23.3       17.8       16.8 Volvo                             4,342   +18.1       13.6       13.4 Scania (Investor)                 2,630   +30.7        8.2        7.3 MAN                               1,955   +34.4        6.1        5.3 ERF                               1,720   +22.6        5.4        5.1 Renault                           1,311   +39.8        4.1        3.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes) Total                            18,898   +23.8      100.0      100.0 Volvo                             3,963   +21.9       21.0       21.9 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)          2,957   +42.9       15.7       13.6 Scania (Investor)                 2,630   +30.7       13.9       13.2 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)      2,203   +22.6       11.7       11.8 Iveco group** (Fiat)              1,884    +7.5       10.0       11.5 ERF                               1,720   +22.6        9.1        9.2 MAN                               1,096   +21.4        5.8        5.9 Renault                             737  +103.6        3.9        2.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (names in brackets indicate ownership)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles. **includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and industry estimates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

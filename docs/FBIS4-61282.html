			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Shokhin, leader of Russian delegation </F> at talks with IMF and World Bank in Washington, under the  "Dangerous Version" rubric: "West's Financial Circles Support  Russian Course. Meetings in Washington Inspire Feeling of  Optimism"]    [Text] I have already had occasion in Washington to answer  questions from representatives of the press on the results of  our delegation's participation in the work of the session of the  leading organs of the IMF and the World Bank, as well as the  conference of finance ministers and heads of the central banks  of G-7 countries which was held at the same time. The results  of our trip could be briefly reduced to the points listed below.    But I would like first of all to explain the reasons for  Russia's presence at these important international financial  forums. The lessons of recent years demonstrate that the  transitional economies' need for bilateral and multilateral  financial assistance is far more considerable than previously  thought. That is why close cooperation with the IMF and the use  of its resources remain critically important not just in the  short term but also in the medium term. The systemic  transformations fund created a year ago for the purpose of  assisting structural reforms has proven its effectiveness in  this regard. Nevertheless, broader use must be made of the  IMF's existing instruments.    We stated all of that frankly at the session of the Interim  Committee of the IMF Board of Governors. The foreign debt  problem, for example, is very topical today for states with a  transitional economy. In 1993 the easing of the debt burden  which we inherited from the former Union formed the major part  of the West's official assistance to Russia. We appreciate our  creditors' understanding of our temporary difficulties. It will  take great effort to support Russia's balance of payments both  this year and in the next few years. Because in these years the  debt servicing payments are due to reach their peak. We have no  other option but to ask our creditors for a new rescheduling of  the debt repayment.    Our delegation described the Russian Government's rigorous  but very realistic program of economic reforms. In our view,  Russia, in cooperation with the multinational financial  organizations, will be able to achieve a breakthrough and begin  moving toward stabilization and economic recovery in 1994. All  the conditions are in place for this: Inflation has begun to be  curbed, an extremely realistic draft federal budget has been  approved, the government intends to adhere resolutely to a  policy of financial stabilization and systemic transformations  and not make changes to the currency exchange system, and the  Central Bank will not undertake any measures to maintain the  ruble exchange rate artificially.    On the basis of all that we raised a whole series of major  problems of concern to us at the meetings which we attended.  The essential nature of the agenda lent itself to that: Unlike  previous years, the discussions which were held were not on the  question of whether our government intends to continue the  course of reforms but on the question of building a foundation  for their implementation and, specifically, of creating  conditions conducive to attracting foreign investments into  Russia, introducing a tax regime to aid that process, and  insuring such capital investments against political risks.    At the meeting with the G-7 ministers we raised the  question of the discriminatory approach against Russia in the  international markets in aluminum, uranium, and space technology  among others. We support the creation of a social and legal  base whereby Russia would be regarded as a country with a  transitional economy, not as a state with a centralized trading  system. In that connection we stressed once more the need to  abolish the Jackson-Vanik amendment insofar as it applies to the  Russian Federation, an amendment which, as is well known, linked  the granting to the former USSR of most-favored nation status in  trade with the United States to the USSR's "conduct" in the  human rights sphere, above all Jewish emigration.    There was another set of questions on reorienting the  previously announced package support for the Russian reforms to  projects in the social sphere. Finally we examined problems  pertaining to Russia's mutual relationship with the creditors of  the Paris Club. We stated bluntly that this year our potential  for servicing the foreign debt will be even more limited than it  was last year. And we found understanding. By all accounts the  Paris Club and the Russian Government will reach agreement on  changing the structure of our foreign debt payments by the end  of May or the start of June. We are looking forward to more  favorable conditions for settling the debt than the deferral  granted by the club last year of a payment of $15 billion out of  the total of $18 billion.    We also put forward an initiative on Russia's possible  membership of the Paris Club as a creditor. The fact is that  many developing countries owe large amounts to Russia as the  successor in law to the USSR. Furthermore, in our relations  with international financial organizations and the G-7, we have  always stressed that we are not only asking for support for our  course of reforms but are also acting as a donor toward former  Soviet republics and are bearing enormous costs as a result. We  are not insisting on permanent membership of the Paris Club but  a mechanism for our participation at least as an observer must  be created.    With the representatives of the World Bank we discussed the  possibility of Russia's obtaining several major credits in the  coming months for various economic reform programs, including a  second loan for the modernization of the oil industry ($500  million), two credits for the reform of the agricultural sector  ($325 million), the modernization of financial institutions  ($200 million), and the reform of entrepreneurial structures  ($200 million). We hope that the World Bank will be able to  allocate a large part of these credits as early as the end of  the current financial year (which expires 30 June). The  agreement to grant a loan for the development of an employment  and social protection service has already been signed with the  World Bank: We will receive $70 million from it for that  purpose.    Thus it may be said that Russia's problems and our relations  with the leading international financial organizations were at  the center of attention of these meetings. The Russian  Federation Government's present course found understanding and  support. For my part I can say that the results of the meetings  in Washington left us with a sense of satisfaction.</p>

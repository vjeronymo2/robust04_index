			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Domestic fears depress Paris, Madrid Bourses were weakened in the morning by overnight losses on Wall Street and, in the afternoon, as the dollar and US bonds took over. However, the French and Spanish markets had their own problems at the end of the day, as actions designed to release fiscal and political tension had the reverse effect, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS opened to a Bank of France offer of overnight money, aimed to reduce tension in the money markets. However, financials continued to lead the equity market down, said Mr Frederick Sauvegrain at Ferri, and the weakness in the sector over the past two days was justified at the close as commercial banks increased their base lending rates from 7.95 to 8.25 per cent. The CAC-40 index dropped 33.68, or 1.75 per cent, to 1,894.15 in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Falls were widespread; but in financials Axa was down FFr8.10 to FFr250.80, BNP by another FFr4.70 to FFr249 and UAP by FFr4.30 more at FFr139.50. Mr Sauvegrain conceded that there were other reasons for the day's fall: US influences; fears on the Algerian crisis; and a window dressing movement involving the selling of underperformers to leave the remainder of a given portfolio looking in better condition. MADRID hit its third consecutive closing low, the general index ending 3.26 lower at 280.33, after 279.00. Bond markets dropped and the peseta hit a new low against the D-Mark. Prior to this the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, rejected either calling early elections or resigning, saying that this would weaken Spain's financial markets. Turnover was strong at Pta45.31bn. One exception to the day's equity retreat was Banesto, suspended for a time before the sale of its 50 per cent stake in the Portuguese bank, Banco Totta y Acores, was confirmed, but requoted later to close Pta34 higher on the day at Pta949 in volume of 1m shares. FRANKFURT ignored comforting corporate and industrial news. The Dax index extended Wednesday's post bourse losses, ending with a session fall of 31.98 to 2,077.03 as turnover rose from DM3.5bn to DM3.9bn. The bourse did not like the weak dollar, or the fall in US bonds which followed a higher than expected rise in November leading indicators. Bunds and bund futures followed their US counterparts down, and the Ibis-indicated Dax closed the afternoon at 2,074.68. Carmakers dropped, Daimler by DM10.40 to DM752.10 and Volkswagen by DM10.30 to DM420, although VW produced a 7.9 per cent rise in car deliveries for November. The worst fall in the Dax 30 was reserved for Karstadt, the department stores group, which shed DM21.50 at DM550. Analysts said that it was still priced at a strong premium to Kaufhof, with German consumption, weak in 1994, facing further erosion from the solidarity income tax surcharge starting next week. AMSTERDAM dipped in response to lower bonds and the AEX index eased 0.34 to 414.47 in very thin trading. Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, took an early 14 per cent tumble in response to news of a management consultants report which concluded that the company might not survive unless it cut costs drastically. Later the shares picked up to finish 30 cents or 2.5 per cent down at FL 11.80 on speculative buying by individual domestic investors. Polygram gained 70 cents to Fl 80.70 on heavy US buying. ZURICH was lower as bonds weakened and with the day's economic data from the US triggering further late losses. The SMI index lost 27.4 to 2,628.8. Among the financials, UBS bearers dropped SFr28 to SFr1,068 amid large sell orders, especially from foreign investors, on worries about an investigation into the price of packets of shares which changed hands in October. Zurich Insurance was SFr10 down at SFr1,245 as the group said it was confident that its agreement with Sweden's Trygg-Hansa, to bail out Trygg's US subsidiary, Home Holdings, would stand, in spite of reports of revised offers from a group of US investors. Holderbank lost another SFr15 to SFr991 on continued concern over the impact of the company's exposure in Mexico. A SFr2,500 or 7.3 per cent rise in Kuoni to SFr36,500 was attributed to speculation that there may be a change in the holding of the largest shareholder. MILAN, with politics on the backburner, carried its correction into a second session after the strong run of the previous week, and the Comit index finished 9.09, or 1.4 per cent lower, at 625.00. Ferruzzi lost L41 to L1,235 as speculation faded that it would announce the expected sale of Fondiaria by the end of the year. Against the trend, Credito Romagnolo picked up L15 to L19,200 as the Bank of Italy gave the go-ahead to Cariplo's bid. STOCKHOLM was lower, the Affarsvarlden index losing 3.1 to 1,460.0 in quiet, holiday conditions. Trygg-Hansa, however, rose SKr2 to SKr82 as the insurer said that it had no comment on reports that US investors were planning revised offers for its Home Holdings subsidiary.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Democrats Predicts Difficulty in </F> Forming `Purple' Government"]    [Text] D66 [Democrats 66] leader Van Mierlo predicted that  the creation of a "purple" government comprising the D66, the  PvdA [Labor Party], and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] will be "an extremely delicate and difficult  operation, full of difficulties." Van Mierlo said this Thursday  [5 May] following the first meeting in Amsterdam of the new  24-member group.    The D66 had already made it clear during the election  campaign that it would try to put together a "purple" coalition.  However, now that the party has become the fourth largest,  behind the VVD, it is more difficult for the D66 to serve as a  bridge between the PvdA and the VVD. "It is easier to build a  bridge between the PvdA and the VVD if you are in between," Van  Mierlo said.    The D66 leader, who yesterday was provisionally elected  floor  leader, did not want to reveal anything about the way in which  the D66 aims to achieve its goal. "The D66's scenario is to  serve the achievement of the goal: A `purple' coalition. I am  not holding anything back as far as that is concerned. However,  if you want to know about strategy, how we are going to get  where we want to go, then I would say this: That is rather  delicate, and will have to remain secret for now."</p>

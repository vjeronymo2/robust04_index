			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90  </P> <P> Highlights of Los Angeles Festival's films and videos focusing on 25 Pacific  Rim countries are reviewed here:  </P> <P> The Principal Enemy  </P> <P> Bolivia  </P> <P>  Sunday at 3 p.m. at Melnitz Theater, UCLA  </P> <P>  Shot while Bolivian director Jorge Sanjines was in political exile in Peru,  and set in a mountain Indian community, this is a fierce mixture of balladlike  epic and Marxist agitprop. The story is fairly simple-minded, rolling along in  classic action-reaction structure.  </P> <P> A vile landowner and his brutal overseer steal a peasant's only cow and then  behead him; the peasantry rise up and arrest the landowner; a corrupt  magistrate frees him and throws the peasantry in jail; saintly guerrillas bring  the killers before a revolutionary tribunal, etc. etc., right up to the  entrance of American military advisers. (The Principal Enemy?) The characters  are stock villains and mass heroes, the dialogue almost wholly stiff and  expository. Yet Sanjines is a poet of sorts. His monochrome landscapes have raw  beauty; his violently moralistic tale is done without apology or compromise. It  packs a punch. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

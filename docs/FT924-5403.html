			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Bonds: UK bank's Tier 2 capital issue meets strong demand NATIONAL Westminster Bank enjoyed a big success yesterday with the first issue of Tier 2 capital by a UK bank which is convertible into Tier 1 or 'core', capital at the bank's option. The bank issued 11 1/2 per cent undated subordinated notes, convertible into non-cumulative preference shares at any time. Following strong demand, the amount was quickly increased to Pounds 200m from the original Pounds 150m. NatWest Capital Markets and Salomon Brothers International jointly arranged the issue. Salomon said it was the largest issue of undated fixed-rate sterling securities in the UK by a bank. The structure will give NatWest undated bonds in Eurobond form, paying interest gross. All previous issues of bank preference shares or building society permanent interesting bearing shares have been structured as domestic placings, paying dividends net of advance corporation tax or interest net of withholding tax. Advantages to the bank of this structure are that while upper Tier 2 capital is acceptable to meet the capital adequacy requirements of the Bank for International Settlements, it is difficult to raise. Previously it was met by issuing perpetual floating-rate notes, a market which collapsed in 1987. 'This instrument gives us great flexibility in terms of tax and capital planning,' said Mr Richard Goeltz, NatWest's group chief financial officer, who believes that capital should be raised strategically, when it is available, rather than when it is needed. 'There is a tactical aspect too; at some point we will look back on this period as being a very attractive time to have raised long-term fixed-rate funding.' Other advantages to the bank are that interest payments are deductible for tax purposes; only if the issue is converted into Tier I capital will the sums paid count as dividends to be paid from net income. Further, the bank does not have to pay a premium on conversion. In the meantime, investors get the same yield as if they had bought preference shares. While they are notes, if the bank misses an interest payment the interest missed is cumulative. Preference shares have to be non-cumulative to qualify as Tier I capital. In the event of liquidation, the notes will rank alongside other preference shares. If they are converted into preference shares they will pay interest at 8.392 per cent a year. NatWest said the issue was well taken up with the core going to UK investors. Although the launch spread of 235 basis points over comparable gilts gives a handsome yield, it represents a total cost of 90 to 100 basis points less than NatWest's last preference share issue, says Mr Goeltz. That offered a launch spread of 250 over and is currently trading at around 185. Elsewhere, sterling continued to be the most popular currency for borrowing in the international bonds market yesterday. This owed less, however, to overwhelming demand from investors than to the unhappy state of other markets, said traders. Three sterling deals tapped slightly different areas of demand, limiting any adverse effect they might have had on each other. The consensus was that all the issues were priced to sell quickly, particularly to UK investors. Kyushu Electric Power's Pounds 150m five-year issue was said to have gone extremely well. Lead-manager SG Warburg said it was trying to establish the issue firmly as a liquid Eurobond issue, and had sold most of the paper to UK investors. This is in contrast with past experience which has seen the bulk of such issues placed in Japan, hitting their liquidity. The new-look Lasmo, making its first appearance on the international capital markets since its acquisition of Ultramar last year, issued Pounds 100m of bonds maturing in mid-1999, to refinance existing debt. One trader said it was priced to get the support of the investment community in the UK. Another said it was priced to appeal to people greedy for yield. One trader noted that a triple-B rating from Moody's is somewhat lower than one would normally expect to see in the Eurosterling markets. The bonds were priced to yield 155 basis points over the comparable gilts. Baring Brothers said it continued to make sales of the World Bank's Pounds 200m six-year bonds at or inside the launch spread of 20 basis points. The Colombian government is likely to lead Colombia's entry into international bond markets next year, raising Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m to open the way for other state-owned and private companies, Reuter reports from Bogota. Mr Juan Fernando Ocampo, sub-director of public credit planning at the Finance Ministry, said the government was working on a sovereign bond issue for next year. 'What will very probably happen is that the Republic will open the way and set the benchmark so that afterwards other public and private entities can follow,' he said. Carbocol, the state-owned coal mining company, is in preliminary discussions about the possibility of placing a Dollars 650m bond next year to refinance existing commercial debt.</p>

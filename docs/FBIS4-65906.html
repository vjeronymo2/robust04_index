			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes </F> by Juan Tapia and Enric Tintore -- place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LA VANGUARDIA] Public  distrust as a result of the recent corruption cases should not  affect the economic recovery process now under way. This was  stated this week by IMF Director General Michel Camdessus during  his visit to Spain. Do you agree with this analysis?    [Solbes] Political uncertainty always affects the economy.  It is absurd to deny it. The financial markets -- especially  the stock exchange and the peseta -- have reacted badly at some  junctures when it seemed that political stability in Spain could  not be guaranteed. Right now, that danger of political  instability has been completely surmounted, and the financial  markets are behaving well again.    [LA VANGUARDIA] But do you not believe that business  investment could reflect adversely the current atmosphere of  political uncertainty?    [Solbes] Investment by large enterprises is planned well in  advance and is normally of a long-term nature. Investment by  small and medium enterprises may perhaps have been delayed  somewhat. But there is no doubt that political tension adversely  affects the economy. Therefore, each political force must face  up to its responsibilities, and the public must know how to  assess the conduct of each of them.    [LA VANGUARDIA] So do you believe there will be no further  scandals to complicate matters again?    [Solbes] I cannot swear to it, but I believe that yes, there  will be calm and confidence will be recovered. The government  has made very important decisions to increase oversight and has  accepted its political responsibilities, and I hope that no  further problems will arise.    [LA VANGUARDIA] Have you noted any sign of an economic  stoppage during May?    [Solbes] No, so far we have no information that permits us  to believe that this has occurred.    [LA VANGUARDIA] Has investment now finally taken off as you  have hinted?    [Solbes] Investment in capital goods is beginning to take  off, judging by the good performance of imports. Investment in  housing shows good prospects in light of cement consumption. On  the other hand, investment in public works is performing more  sluggishly than expected.    [LA VANGUARDIA] The Bank of Spain lowered interest rates by  0.25 percent Friday [13 May], after the Bundesbank had done so  by 0.50 percent Wednesday. Is there scope left for further  falls in the short or medium term?    [Solbes] The key to further falls in interest rates lies in  two things -- the other European countries lowering them and our  being able to reduce inflation and the public deficit. But the  remaining scope is very small, both for ourselves and for the  countries around us. In general, the big cuts in the price of  money have already been made.    [LA VANGUARDIA] Do you believe the peseta's current exchange  rate is at the right level?    [Solbes] The peseta's exchange rate against the [German]  mark  has performed rather worse over the past few days. A few weeks  ago, we were at 81 pesetas to the mark. I accept that we could  reach 82 pesetas to the mark, but I do not believe the peseta's  depreciation beyond that to be justified.    [LA VANGUARDIA] But a cheap peseta is what enterprises are  demanding. The outcome of the devaluation has been very good  for the economy, so far.    [Solbes] The peseta exchange rate must reflect the objective  state of the Spanish economy, and, from that viewpoint,  exceeding the current levels would place us on an unrealistic  exchange rate.    [LA VANGUARDIA] What do you have to say about the fact that  wages are increasing by 3.8 percent on average, in light of the  few agreements that have been signed, whereas you advised a wage  freeze?    [Solbes] I would have preferred agreements more in keeping  with the difficult economic situation in which we find  ourselves. However, if that percentage of increase is confirmed,  wage increases will be less than they were last year, but with  insufficient restraint to be able to create jobs. If there is  no wage restraint, the danger that jobs will be lost is real. I  deem it a good thing for everybody to realize this and behave  reasonably.    [LA VANGUARDIA] Do you not believe that these 3.8-percent  increases could jeopardize the inflation target for this year,  especially since we still have an annual rate of around 5  percent?    [Solbes] If in 1993, with high wage increases, we had an  annual inflation rate of 4.9 percent, things should go better  this year. The increase in wages is more moderate, and this  must be acknowledged.    Inflation will perform better this year than last year, and  I  still expect to end it at 3.5 percent, because the wage  increases are more moderate than in 1993; there has been no tax  increase, and the impact of devaluation has been assimilated in  almost all sectors except food.    According to the figures published Friday, underlying  inflation went very well in April. It is true that overall  inflation has improved by just 0.1 percent, but that was mainly  as a result of food prices, which still show the increase caused  by the impact of the devaluation of the peseta. We will begin  to see an improvement in food prices from June onward, and this  will bring inflation down to more appropriate levels. That is  where we have the greatest scope to improve prices.    [LA VANGUARDIA] What is your opinion of the trade unions'  conduct? Do you not believe that if they accept wage restraint,  it will be in return for blocking the implementation of the  labor reform in enterprises?    [Solbes] They may try to do so, but it would be a mistake.  The country needs the reform, and not implementing it means  opting for not creating jobs, which is an aim that the trade  unions should share.    [LA VANGUARDIA] It seems that the government -- and, more  specifically, yourself -- has lost much of the enthusiasm for  the EC that used to characterize it years ago. Is it true that  you now deem it impossible for Spain to adopt the European top  speed toward a single currency?    [Solbes] The Community's decision on the European top speed  will be taken in 1996. To speak now of the prospects that there  will be at that time is premature. The European Commission's  latest report states that only three countries fulfill the  conditions laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. Over the past  few years, not only has there not been greater convergence, but  divergence between the Community's economies has increased.    In 1996, there will also be an additional problem --  deciding  how the European Union [EU] is to proceed from the broad  fluctuation band of the European Monetary System to the narrow  band and the single currency. And in the face of this  challenge, I personally, like many other European economy  ministers, will never propose that Spain proceed to this third  stage of monetary union if we are not really ready.    The third stage requires not only a healthy and sound  economic discipline, but also entails restrictions that can only  be satisfied if some minimum conditions are fulfilled. To  believe that we could have an absolutely stable currency  situation and maintain a significant inflation differential  would be absurd. However, the decisions in 1996 will not depend  on us alone. They will require a new reflection on the state of  the European project.    [LA VANGUARDIA] So must we forgo the European top speed?    [Solbes] Despite all the European project's problems, what  seems to me really important is that we make every possible  effort to ensure that the Spanish economy's real conditions  approach those of the other member countries. So if we achieve  this, we will be in a better position to make the leap to the  third stage of European Monetary Union [EMU], which is the stage  leading to the single currency, when the time comes. Otherwise,  if we are unable to achieve this, I would advise not entering  this third stage.    [LA VANGUARDIA] In giving up, as it has done, the idea of  reducing the public deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 1997, the  government has also now given up the idea of adopting the top  speed in EMU. Is this not so?    [Solbes] Not at all. Our public deficit clearly worsened  with the crisis. We are not the only country in Europe -- far  from it -- that has had this problem. The Community's average  public deficit is 5.1 percent of GDP. Therefore there are  several European countries with budgetary difficulties similar  to ours. We plan to end this year with a state public deficit  of 5.7 percent of GDP, plus the 1 percent of the deficit created  in the autonomous communities and local administrations. The  important thing is to change the trend in the deficit and  continue to reduce it.    [LA VANGUARDIA] What is the government's aim with respect to  next year's budget?    [Solbes] We have outlined the budgetary scenario for the  next three years, and it is extremely restrictive. All the  government ministers now have information about the future  financial framework within which they will have to operate.  Despite this, it is a difficult endeavor to reduce the public  deficit from 6.7 percent to 3 percent of GDP in virtually three  years. We seek to achieve 3 percent of GDP in 1997 but, if this  is not possible, we will try to come as close to it as possible.    [LA VANGUARDIA] In that atmosphere of budgetary restriction,  how can aid for Seat or Suzuki be found?    [Solbes] I see great difficulties in finding public aid for  Volkswagen or Suzuki. The EU strictly limits direct aid. There  is greater scope for aid for design, research, and technological  development. The government will help as far as possible within  the established rules.    [LA VANGUARDIA] The government's plan to reduce the deficit  is very little known. What are that plan's main guidelines?    [Solbes] The guidelines proceed from three major assumptions  -- keeping the broad outlines of 1994, with some corrections,  mainly linked to wage reviews. In the public sector, officials  will have a pay rise in 1995 that will coincide with the  inflation forecast for that year. In 1993, officials' wages  increased by 1.8 percent, with an inflation rate of 4.9 percent.  This year, the rise in officials' pay has been zero, with an  inflation rate of 3.5 percent. So public officials have already  made a very considerable pay effort. However, in the case of  personnel costs, we wish to continue to maintain the restrictive  policy on hiring new personnel. We will also maintain a  restrictive policy on expenditure on goods and services, as well  as on transfers to public enterprises and other bodies. From  the viewpoint of revenue, the basic idea is to keep the  currently existing level of taxation as the average. However,  maintaining the tax burden does not mean not making some changes.    [LA VANGUARDIA] How much will public expenditure increase  next year?    [Solbes] I wish you had asked me how much the public deficit  will be reduced next year, but, joking apart, my intention is  for it to increase in nominal terms, although it should reduce  its share in GDP.

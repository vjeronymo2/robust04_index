			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Half-time surge for Microsoft MICROSOFT'S sales and earnings soared in the second quarter as the US personal computers software company's 'Windows' operating system program continued to be in demand. Net income for the quarter to end-December was Dollars 175m, an increase of 55 per cent over the Dollars 136m in the corresponding period a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 90 cents from 61 cents. Revenues of Dollars 682m for the second quarter were up 48 per cent on the Dollars 461m in the same period of fiscal 1991. Strong demand for the Windows operating system and applications programs for Windows, drove second-quarter sales, Microsoft said. Since the launch of Windows in May 1990, more than 9m copies have been sold, the company said. The program provides a graphical interface for users of IBM-compatible personal computers, making the computers easier to use. For the six-month period, revenues were Dollars 1.3bn, a 52 per cent increase over the Dollars 830m recorded for the same period of fiscal 1991. Net income for the half year rose 59 per cent to Dollars 319m from Dollars 201m in fiscal 1991. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.65 for the six-month period, up from Dollars 1.08. Microsoft's sales grew, despite a downturn in the personal computer market. According to a study published today by Dataquest, the US market research group, personal computer sales revenues fell by almost 8 per cent in 1991 from the previous year. However, while the value of personal computer sales has declined, unit sales continue to grow, expanding the market for Microsoft's widely used software programs.</p>

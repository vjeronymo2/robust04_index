			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Store sales highlight declining consumption DEPARTMENT store sales in Tokyo fell by a record 13.4 per cent in June, against a year earlier, highlighting the continuing decline in personal consumption that is dragging down the Japanese economy. The fall was the largest since the Japan Department Stores' Association began compiling monthly figures. It partly reflected cost-cutting at Japanese companies, which traditionally buy presents for clients at this time of year. Clothing sales were down 11.6 per cent, while household goods slipped by 14.7 per cent, personal accessories by 9.4 per cent, and food by 8.1 per cent. The decline in personal spending has prompted calls from business leaders for a cut in official interest rates or income tax. Japanese companies are still under pressure. Corporate bankruptcies rose 3.7 per cent in the first half, with bankruptcies linked to the eco-nomic downturn rising 40 per cent during the period, according to Teikoku Data Bank, a credit research agency. Failures linked to speculative excess during the late 1980s are in decline, which is one reason for an 11.1 per cent fall in the amount of liabilities left by bankrupt companies. In June the number of failures fell 2.6 per cent to 1,140, while liabilities rose 23.8 per cent. Wholesale prices in June were 0.5 per cent lower than in the previous month, with import prices down 2.4 per cent. The Bank of Japan said this was a direct result of the yen's appreciation in recent months. The wholesale price index was 3.2 per cent lower, compared to a year earlier. The export price index fell 10.6 per cent and the import price index was down 10.5 per cent.</p>

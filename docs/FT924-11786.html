			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: End to regulation by a nod and a wink - John Gapper finds that the Bank of England's lot as policeman of the banking system is not a happy one AS IT steadied itself this summer for the publication of the Bingham report, the Bank of England offered an elegant defence of its chequered history of bank supervision. Mr Eddie George, the deputy governor, made a speech in which he praised the 'very profound truth' of the observation in the Pirates of Penzance that 'a policeman's lot is not a happy one'. When regulatory duty is to be done, the Bank has certainly had a miserable time over the past 20 years. Starting with the secondary banking crisis of the 1970s, and continuing through episodes such as the rescue of Johnson Matthey Bankers in 1984, it has suffered a series of embarrassments in its efforts to maintain a well-ordered banking system. The BCCI debacle yesterday provoked the most stinging criticism of its supervision since the JMB rescue, when Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, was heavily criticised in parliament. Lord Justice Bingham's report depicts the Bank as a cautious and bureaucratic regulator lacking the vision and decisiveness to move briskly against BCCI. The publication of the report comes at a sensitive time. Although BCCI was in many respects a unique mishap, supervisors are faced by many other challenges. The weaknesses of large banks exposed to bad loans in a recession mean that the Bank holds the reins in one of the most awkward periods for bank supervision in two decades. Perhaps inevitably, there is little consensus within the banking industry on the appropriate balance between regulation and laissez-faire. Some bankers grumble that politicians are in danger of providing excessive protection to consumers by over-protective regulation. If consumers come to believe that a bank can never fail they will not discriminate between good banks and bad banks when choosing where to place funds. However, other bankers say the supervisors are occasionally too complacent and that their institutions could benefit if their business decisions were challenged more rigorously by the Bank. The part of the Bank surrounded by this controversy barely existed before 1974. There were 13 officials in the discount office, which supervised discount houses (the intermediaries between the Bank and the money markets). They largely operated by 'gossip' with bankers. Although lighter supervision could hardly be imagined, this worked well enough. The insularity of the financial system made regulation a simple matter. The first changes were forced by a liquidity crisis among the unregulated secondary banks in 1973, which compelled the Bank to organise a Pounds 1.2bn 'lifeboat' with clearers. The crisis showed the importance of financial institutions that could not be controlled as easily as the first tier of banks. Five significant aspects of the Bank's supervisory style were formed in the mid 1970s: Its primary aim was to establish confidence in the banking system. Banks accepted regulation in the early 1970s 'because we convinced them it would be good for them,' says one official. It opted to rely on banks' accounts rather than carrying out its own audits. This is now defended by Bank officials as a matter of principle, but it started for mundane reasons. It had too little time to train inspectors in the rush to start regulation, and it feared competent ones would be recruited by the banks they inspected. It took the view that there were two sorts of banks: solid ones that did not need much supervision; and less trustworthy ones that had to be watched carefully. The 1979 Banking Act enshrined this by allowing the Bank to grant two forms of licence: a full banking licence and a limited 'deposit taker' licence. It was forced to accept the unwelcome notion that it might be wrong. In spite of pressure from Bank officials to be allowed to remain the sole arbiters of good banking practice, the 1979 act set up an appeal mechanism. The Bank has not been defeated on appeal since, but it remains wary about risking such a blow to its authority. It started to set formal requirements for banks' exposure to risk. The Bank established a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent. Those it felt unhappy about could be asked to ensure that capital comprised 15 per cent of assets, which are principally loans. From these foundations, the supervision department has grown to the point where it employs 190 officials. As markets have been deregulated, political and consumer pressures have grown. This growth in staff has been accompanied by a rise in formal regulatory requirements. The drafting of the 1979 act was largely in the hands of the Bank, and it preserved much of its preferred freedom of manoeuvre behind the scenes. But the JMB rescue brought fierce criticism of the Bank, and a stiffening of its duties. JMB was a supposedly competent fully licensed bank, yet it lent 115 per cent of its capital to two borrowers. It evaded the net of regulation by making late and inaccurate returns to Bank supervisors. The Bank was forced to take it over, and went on to make a tactical error by transferring Pounds 100m of capital to JMB without telling the government. The ensuing 1987 act also changed some founding principles of regulation. It ended the divide between first-tier and second-tier banks, and put the focus of regulation on protecting depositors. A consequence was that BCCI was upgraded to full banking status automatically. Since then the Bank has settled into an uneasy compromise between comfortable tradition and the new formality. It has resigned itself to regulating according to the book, while trying to preserve some of its old freedom of manoeuvre. This compromise means the banking establishment and the Bank's critics tend to draw contrasting morals from BCCI. Many of the critics blame the Bank's fondness for 'working with the grain of the market' for upsets such as BCCI. They say the delay in shutting BCCI, in spite of intimations of trouble as far back as the 1970s, is symptomatic of a cautious establishment culture. Ms Shelagh Heffernan, a senior lecturer in international finance at City University Business School, says the Bank should exploit the element of surprise. 'If British banks conduct their own branch audits without warning, why does the Bank let them know when it is coming?' she says. Yesterday's announcement of a new investigations unit may go some way to satisfy such criticism. Another policy cited as a symptom of attachment to the past is the Bank's reluctance to act until it is utterly sure something is wrong. It values its air of infallibility too highly to risk it on appeal. According to a senior banker: 'There is still a large element of nods and winks in the system, and the Bank would not want to lose that.' The result in the BCCI case was that a bank many people had suspected since was founded was only closed 20 years on. Even within the Bank there is a recognition that the BCCI affair will have to lead to a greater willingness to risk its rulings being overturned on appeal. Even some bank chairmen have recently said in private that they would support a move towards more adversarial supervision. They say that it could be a useful discipline. Some say they might have lent less to the property sector in the 1980s - now the cause of big losses - if supervisors had challenged their lending policies more forcefully. Yet others in the banking establishment tend to view BCCI as holding the opposite lesson. Clearing banks were not happy at first about being regulated at all, and some bankers have become more uneasy as supervision has become more onerous. Some bankers chafe at inquiries from, as one puts it, 'really quite junior Bank people who seem to get intoxicated with their power, and constantly try to second-guess you'. Such griping does not unduly dismay the Bank. Officials are happy to have some evidence of tension between banks and the Bank as they are often accused of having too cosy a relationship. Yet the Bank feels sympathy with the idea that regulation has become too inflexible. It would like back the freedom to act informally against problem banks without having to stick to rigid rules. There is also a fear in banking circles that the Bank is slowly being pushed into removing all the risk from making deposits at banks. 'The essence of good regulation is that when there is a choice between protecting the integrity of the system and protecting every single depositor, the system should come first,' says a bank official. Such an argument does not impress many politicians or depositors. Most observers agree that BCCI is likely to shift regulation further towards formality and aggression. 'The Bank will inevitably have to become more sceptical, and less chummy,' says Mr Richard Dale, professor of banking at Southampton University. Thus the BCCI scandal is likely to mark a further step away from nods and winks, and towards rules and regulations. The question for the Bank is whether it can finally shed nostalgia for the past. The banks' policeman has not yet finished agonising.</p>

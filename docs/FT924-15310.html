			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Iraq to pursue plan for oil sales IRAQ yesterday dismissed as illegal a UN Security Council resolution to seize frozen Iraqi oil assets and said it was determined to press on with negotiations over a partial resumption of Iraqi oil exports, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Finance Minister Ahmed Hussein al-Samaraei said Iraq would pursue its plan to seek UN permission to export oil worth Dollars 4bn over six months. This could be extended for six months more to help provide food, medicine and humanitarian needs for Iraqis, he said. The Iraqi news agency INA quoted him as saying that UN acceptance of the plan would 'help provide the source of living for the Iraqi people from the north to the south'.</p>

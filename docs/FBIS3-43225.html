Military officials said the clashes overnight Friday broke out  after armed opposition rebels, identified as "ninjas," attacked  an army camp at Bacongo. The army used heavy weapons to repel  the submachine-gun toting rebels.    But opposition spokesman Laurent Mann accused the members of  the national police's ministerial reserve of attacking the  opposition militia and "shooting at passers-by at close range."  Mann said the number of casualties was much higher and five  bodies had still not been retrieved from Bacongo as no Red Cross  workers had been allowed in.    The worst violence ended Saturday afternoon but witnesses  said shots could still be heard at Bacongo Sunday morning.    At least 93 people have died since new violence erupted in  the southern neighborhoods of the Congolese capital between  supporters of the government and the opposition in early  December, according to a hospital tally.</p>

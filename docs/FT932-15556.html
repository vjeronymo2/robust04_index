			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Steel output forecast cut Meps (Europe), the Sheffield-based steel consultancy, is reducing its forecast for European crude steel production this year by 1.5m tonnes, to 129m tonnes, due to substantial weakening of demand in Germany, writes Andrew Baxter. The consultancy had originally forecast output this year of 130.5m tonnes, against 132m in 1992. In its latest quarterly outlook, Meps forecasts that German crude output will fall from 39.7m tonnes in 1992 to 37m tonnes this year. However, steel demand in the UK is forecast to increase, with production rising from 16m tons last year to 16.7m. On the export front, Meps notes that European output of semi-finished products, such as billets, for the US market have been increasing in the past few months.</p>

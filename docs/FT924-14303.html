			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies A sea change in sentiment seems to have swept through the foreign exchanges. The Federal Reserve's postponement of a rate cut and easier conditions in the German money market have sparked a dollar rally, easing pressure in the ERM. Perhaps the franc's survival should be no surprise, given there was little economic need for a devaluation. But lesser currencies are not out of the woods. The Irish punt and the Swedish krona have held up against the D-Mark, but that leaves them looking overvalued against their trading neighbours, Britain and Finland, which have both had substantial devaluations. Besides it is open to question whether the dollar has finally turned. There is a risk of the market getting ahead of itself in the short term. The Bundesbank may be slow to ease further and the Fed may yet cut rates in the aftermath of the election. A Clinton victory might also provoke knee-jerk dollar sales. Then again, a loose Democrat fiscal policy might provoke the Fed to tighten later, producing a policy mix similar to the early Reagan years. However, comparisons with the economic growth and strong dollar of that time must be set against falling US asset prices and the Dollars 4,000bn Federal debt.</p>

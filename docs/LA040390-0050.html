			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROSTERS GO BACK TO 27 PLAYERS FOR THREE WEEKS  </P> <P> Baseball teams and players reversed course again Monday and decided to expand  rosters to 27 players for the first three weeks of the season.  </P> <P> The sides reached a verbal agreement to expand rosters on March 19, the day  they agreed to a new four-year labor contract. But the roster deal collapsed  last week when they couldn't agree on how it would affect outright assignments.  </P> <P> Teams will have to reduce to the normal minimum of 24 players and maximum of 25  on May 1. A proposed change that would have lowered the five-inning requirement  for starters to get a victory was dropped.  </P> <P> "This is going to take a big load off, not just the pitchers, but the whole  team. I'm extremely happy," Dodger reliever Jim Gott said.  </P> <P> Said Boston Manager Joe Morgan: "I think we should have left it at 27 in the  first place. It's going to help the nameless three."  </P> <P> Michael Weiner, an attorney for the union, said the outline for the agreement  was made over the weekend in telephone conversations between union executive  director Donald Fehr and Deputy Commissioner Stephen Greenberg.  </P> <P> "Don Fehr and I are pleased that both sides could reach an agreement on an  issue of such significance to the players, managers and fans," Chuck O'Connor,  the owners' chief negotiator, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Said Fehr: "Just look at it as the aftermath of a long negotiation. Thankfully  it was straightened out reasonably quickly."  </P> <P> "This is the best way to do it," Dodger infielder Mickey Hatcher said. "We were  looking at a situation where the risk of injury would be very serious. This  takes a lot of the pressure off. We can save a lot of wear and tear on the  pitching staff."  </P> <P> Teams will designate up to three additional players to management's Player  Relations Committee, which will inform the union of the names. The identity of  those players will not be made known to players, agents or other teams.  </P> <P> Normally, players sent outright to the minors for a second time, or players  with more than three years of major league service sent outright for the first  time, can elect to become free agents.  </P> <P> Under Monday's agreement, the union will allow teams to request advance waivers  through Sunday and ask additional players to agree to waive their right to free  agency if sent to the minors outright.  </P> <P> "If this is the first outright, it still counts as the first outright," Weiner  said. "The theory is that extra players designated as additional players should  be no better or worse off than they would have been at the end of spring  training, except for the obvious fact that they're going to be better off in  that they're going to get major league service and major league salary for this  expansion period."  </P> <P> Fehr was disappointed the proposed change about innings for starting pitchers  was dropped.  </P> <P> "That's too bad," he said. "It was meant to keep pitchers from trying too hard  early in the season to go any kind of distance."  </P> <P> Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson wasn't surprised.  </P> <P> "We've kind of anticipated it for a week or so," Alderson said. "The clubs were  for it. The player agents were for it. There didn't seem to be any reason the  PRC and the players' association ought to be against it."  </P></p>

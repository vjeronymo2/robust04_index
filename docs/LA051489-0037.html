			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL R. KRUGMAN: WARNING FROM THE MONETARY FUND  </P> <P> Every April, the International Monetary Fund issues its World Economic Outlook  -- a book-length compendium of analysis, data, and forecasts. Despite the  leaden prose that is unavoidable in such a bureaucratic production,  international economists prize these volumes. They are extremely useful sources  of data. The topical analysis is usually sharp and even provocative, reflecting  the high quality of the IMF's staff, and there is a kind of pleasure in reading  between the discreetly euphemistic lines to figure out what the IMF really  thinks.  </P> <P> This year's report is a particularly interesting specimen. It comes at a time  when the markets appear to be fairly optimistic about the international  monetary system: The dollar is rising, bank stocks and the secondary prices of  Latin American debt have risen on hopes that the plan by Treasury Secretary  Nicholas F. Brady will offer a solution, fears of inflation are subsiding. It  is therefore a bit of a shock to read the IMF's outlook and discover a  cautiously worded but nonetheless ominous warning. In effect, the theme of this  year's report is that things are not under control -- that the current  stability in the world economy is the calm before the storm.  </P> <P> Now of course the IMF never says this in any such forthright terms. The warning  must be extracted from mind-numbing references to "the 'tensions' in the  'reference scenario'." Nonetheless, the gloominess of the IMF staff is apparent  to anyone accustomed to reading this kind of document.  </P> <P> At the heart of the IMF's concern is its conclusion that the balance of  payments deficit of the United States and the corresponding balance of payments  surpluses of Japan and West Germany are all going to get wider, not narrower,  from now on. This may come as a surprise to many people -- weren't we talking  about a U.S. export boom just a few months ago? But the IMF thinks that the  export boom, sparked by the fall in the dollar in 1985 and 1986, has now run  its course. With the boom played out, longer-term forces will cause our  deficit, and the West German and Japanese surpluses, to start growing again.  </P> <P> Why this pessimism? The basic point is that unless something -- such as the  exchange rate -- changes, a position of massive U.S. deficit and equally  massive West German and Japanese surplus is virtually bound to get worse over  time. For one thing, there is what some people call the "gap factor": Inflation  and economic growth tend to raise the dollar value of everything, including  deficits and surpluses. So if you start with a big deficit or surplus, you can  expect to see it get even bigger.  </P> <P> For example, over the next five years it is a good guess that Japan will  increase the dollar value of both its exports and its imports by something like  60% -- and therefore increase its trade surplus by around 60%, too. The  converse is true for the United States. Since this country is so deep in the  red to start with, and West Germany and Japan so far in the black, the "gap  factor" implies a persistent trend toward worsening imbalances unless there are  strong countervailing forces.  </P> <P> Instead of being offset, however, the gap factor will be reinforced by a second  factor: the growing foreign debt of the United States and the growing foreign  assets of West Germany and Japan. Increasingly, the U.S. deficit will be  swollen by the interest we pay to foreign creditors and the dividends that U.S.  subsidiaries of foreign firms pay to their owners. West Germany and Japan, as  the world's main creditor nations, will correspondingly find their surpluses  magnified.  </P> <P> As the IMF sees it, then, the period of international optimism in 1987 and  1988, when the U.S. trade deficit finally seemed to be coming down, is going to  turn out to have been a false dawn. From now on, we will be back in a world of  seemingly inexorable growth in the U.S. deficit. The economic dangers inherent  in such a world are obvious enough. The IMF's guardedly described "market  reaction scenario" is one in which the dollar crashes, leading to inflation in  the United States and recession in the rest of the world, and precipitating a  debt service crisis in the already troubled Third World. In the report, this  scenario is presented only vaguely so that we have no idea quite what the  potential fall in the dollar is likely to be.  </P> <P> But we can look at other estimates. A new book by William Cline of the  Institute for International Economics carries out an analysis that looks very  similar to that of the IMF and arrives at the conclusion that even in a  favorable adjustment scenario the mark and the yen will need to rise 23% and  28% respectively against the dollar. In the disorderly run on the dollar that  the IMF evidently regards as a serious possibility the numbers would be larger:  A dollar-yen rate of 100 or even 90, compared to the current rate of about 135,  is far from impossible.  </P> <P> The political dangers of a world where deficits start growing again are also  obvious. What will even the most internationally minded members of Congress say  to constituents demanding protectionist measures? What will the political  reaction be as the pace of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms accelerates, with  accusations that the weak dollar is leading to a "fire sale" of our assets?  What will be the consequences of worsening imbalances for our relations with  West Germany and Japan, which are already strained for other reasons? Warnings  about "hard landings" are nothing new in international economics. What makes  this warning interesting is the source and the timing. The IMF, a supremely  cautious institution, is interrupting us in a moment of apparent calm to tell  us that things cannot go on as they have, that something fairly drastic has to  be done.  </P> <P> But a call for effective action from the Big Three economies seems almost pure  fantasy. In the United States, the Bush Administration evidently feels no  urgency about economic policy (or much else). Meanwhile, both West Germany and  Japan are ruled by weak governments whose popularity has been undermined by  non-economic issues. No matter how certain the prospect that a crisis is  developing, nothing is going to be done until it actually hits. When the IMF  talks, nobody listens.  </P></p>

The two sides  exchanged views on economic cooperation between Hainan and the  ROK and some other issues.    When giving an account of Hainan's achievements over the  past  six years since the Hainan Special Economic Region was  established, Chairman Du Qinglin noted: There are now more than  5,000 foreign- funded enterprises in Hainan, 13 of which are  ROK-funded enterprises, ranking 14th in numerical order among  all the foreign investors in Hainan. Many ROK conglomerates  have expressed an interest in investing in Hainan. We welcome  all of them to come and invest here.    Mr. Hwang In-chong said: Though relatively backward with  regards to its level of development, Hainan is more advanced in  urban management in comparison to the ROK. The 100,000  qualified personnel Hainan has invited from other Chinese  provinces and regions have now become your biggest asset. I am  convinced that Hainan's numerous preferential policies are bound  to attract more investment from the ROK and other foreign  countries.</p>

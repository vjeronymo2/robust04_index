			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (5): Leading the field with its captives  -Guernsey is the largest centre in Europe and one of the biggest in the world after locations such as Bermuda and the Caymans / Insurance IF there is one category of financial services in which Guernsey has out-performed its rival offshore centres, it is in the cultivation of captive insurance companies. Banks and other institutions have gained a foothold as in many offshore centres. But few can compete with Guernsey's status on captives, and certainly not Jersey, its most obvious rival, which only recently offered rapprochement to insurance companies. 'We had a captive market for captives,' says Mr Bruce Riley, industry supervisor during the 1970s and early 1980s when much of the growth took place and who is now managing director of Guinness Flight Fund Managers in Guernsey. The total number of captives is now 230 - making Guernsey the largest centre in Europe and one of the biggest in the world, after locations such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Guernsey had the largest number of net new captives last year. Much of the expansion came in the early 1970s. The contraction of the sterling area left the Channel Islands in a privileged position within the boundaries, at a time when the insurance market was hardening. As the reputation built up, new captives arrived. 'It's really taken off in the last 15 years,' says Mr Nick Wild, director and general manager of International Risk Management, which now manages some 17 captives on the island. Until 1986, there was no insurance law in Guernsey. That changed with the impetus given by the creation of the Financial Services Commission and the appointment of Mr Steve Butterworth as superintendent of insurance. The legislation did not help the industry. Insurance companies which had been resident offshore from Guernsey were required to come onshore, partly so that they could be effectively regulated. But the effect was also to remove their tax-exempt status, at a time when the Isle of Man was beginning to be aggressive in courting insurance business. As a result, the number of new captives remained stable at about 18 a year. More recent modifications in response mean that insurance companies have the option of paying no tax, tax on a sliding scale between 0.5 per cent and 30 per cent, or paying 20 per cent. In 1992, the number of new captives rose correspondingly to 27. That change in policy reflects the flexibility shown by the authorities in encouraging offshore business. The Financial Services Commission plays a dual role, both regulating and marketing the industry. This is borne out by Mr Butterworth's recent help in lobbying for Guernsey captives to be included in Pool Re, the reinsurance pool being designed to underwrite UK terrorist damage. 'If we have a problem, I can call Steve Butterworth and chat it through,' says Mr Wild. 'With the Department of Trade and Industry you would have to wait six months for an appointment to speak to somebody.' He adds that the DTI also requires substantial capitalisation which is geared far more to third-party insurers than it is to captives. Accessibility is one reason why captives are tempted to offshore centres such as Guernsey, Mr Wild says. To the Inland Revenue, companies with captives are almost inevitably a subject for investigation. 'People don't understand how captives work,' he says. He stresses that captives are created for commercial rather than tax reasons  -although tax rates become important once the decision has been made to form one. Guernsey has succeeded, Mr Wild says, because of the infrastructure of sympathetic regulators, insurance managers and bankers, accountants and lawyers who understand the industry. '1992 was a very good year and 1993 is already very good,' he says. 'The traditional UK insurance market is in disarray and premiums are rising. 'Companies are seeking greater flexibility and are more interested in forming captives to have better control over their own destiny. They are dusting off their feasibility studies.' That is a view shared by Mr Granville de Cruz, managing director of Sedgwick. 'We continue to see growth,' he says. Regulation of captives appears to be low-key. Mr Butterworth reflects the FSC's line of keeping out undesirable companies in the first place. One company is currently under investigation, while he rejected six captives last year. Mr Butterworth is more active in other areas. He is drafting a new insurance law. He wants new powers, including the ability to freeze assets. For dealing with a wide variety of everyday complaints from the public, he would like to see the creation of a financial services ombudsman. And to deal with the sale of offshore insurance products, he is considering a regulatory system that would require Guernsey insurers to supervise their intermediaries and de-license any which fail to perform satisfactorily.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (5): Operations to be combined - The regional electricity companies All 14 electricity distribution companies on mainland Britain and PowerGen and National Power, the generation companies, proudly boast their own gas supply arms. Some will undoubtedly make a success of them. But it is highly unlikely that all 16 companies will still be involved in what is certain to be a fiercely competitive market by the end of the decade. A few are expected to withdraw within the next year or so, particularly if the government delays full competition in gas beyond 1998. Few, if any, companies are likely to lose large sums of money since setting up gas trading teams, often of half a dozen people or less, has not entailed significant investment. But companies which withdraw will have to explain why a diversification that seemed too attractive to miss two years ago has failed to deliver its promise. The initial attractions were plain enough. The recent regulatory review of the regional companies distribution businesses underlined the perceived need from the City and elsewhere for power companies to develop a range of businesses which can make money in competitive and therefore unregulated markets. The companies certainly have the means to be able to diversify. All the regional distributors and the generators either have cash surpluses or low borrowings. The problem for them is to do so without arousing doubts among investors about whether they are capable of managing the non-power businesses they grow or acquire. The gas supply business has proved a lure because of its similarities and potential synergies with electricity. The regional companies have long experience of operating in a low margin trading business and have developed energy trading expertise which can be used in supplying gas. In many cases, the customers to whom they sell gas will be the same as those who buy their power. Electricity companies can make use of their brand name and the knowledge they have of the customers to improve their marketing. Some have merged their gas and electricity sales teams. Billing systems can be merged and, as technology develops, metering equipment can be shared. There are also synergies with companies' generation arms. SG Warburg Securities regional electricity companies with gas-fired generation - that is all of them except Manweb - should be able to 'swing' between gas generation and gas supply. This, it says, should reduce the risk of over-contracting and potentially increase operating margins as a result of seasonal demand. Kleinwort Benson makes a similar point about National Power and PowerGen in a recent research document. 'By developing a gas marketing business and a combined heat and power operations, which uses gas to drive operations, a generator has three alternative sources for any gas it buys including its own gas-fired power stations. This enables it selectively to target its supplies of gas, attaining the highest margins possible.' PowerGen was one of the first electricity companies to enter the competitive gas market after setting up a joint venture, Kinetica, with Conoco in 1990. In 1993-4, Kinetica, contributed Pounds 8m to PowerGen's pre-tax profits on sales of Pounds 130m. Among the distribution companies, Midlands Electricity was the first to move into gas marketing in August 1991. It has a 75:25 joint venture, Midlands Gas, with Utilicorp and is generally considered to be one of the strongest emerging players in the market. Utilicorp also has joint ventures with Norweb, Scottish Power, Seeboard, Sweb and Eastern. Northern Gas, the Norweb joint venture, recently announced plans to set up a national gas marketing company. Total is among other overseas companies involved with regional electricity companies; it has joint ventures with London and Yorkshire. Marathon Oil &amp; Gas has a joint venture with Hydro-Electric. The companies with most commitment to gas are those which have gone upstream. This summer Eastern Electricity bought a 6 per cent stake in the Johnson North Sea oil field, having previously agreed to buy its entire output. Northern Electric, the last regional electricity company to move into gas supply, created an upstream gas venture with Neste of Finland and has a stake in the Victor field. Yorkshire has 7 per cent of the Armada gas field, which it bought for Pounds 27m from Amerada Hess. The aim of those companies moving upstream is to develop integrated gas businesses. Analysts believe that if the going gets tough these companies will be the last to pull out of gas supply simply because they will have to find other markets in which to sell the gas they are producing. Most believe that the going will get tough. Kevin Lapwood, analyst at Smith New Court, says the regional electricity companies' gas businesses have not lived up to expectations. 'When the market first opened up it was money for old rope, because British Gas was under pressure to give up market share,' says Mr Lapwood. 'But as the market opened up further the competition got tougher. Nobody is losing much money yet but, with margins so thin, there are quite a few companies who are unlikely to make much.' SG Warburg believes that margins could be as low as 1 per cent when the market is opened up fully. 'This could threaten some regional electric companies' continued involvement in gas, given the long wait for deregulation, of the high margin domestic market,' says analyst Nick Pink. The two main risks, says Warburg , are bad debts and failing to sell all the gas bought from a supplier to an end-user. That, in turn, could result in a distressed sale.</p>

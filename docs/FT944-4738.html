			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: National Theatre announces 1995 programme Richard Eyre confirmed yesterday that he was quitting as director of the Royal National Theatre in 1997. He described his years there as 'the time of my life'. If there was a downside it was the 'blocked lavatory syndrome': being responsible for holes in the carpet as well as artistic excellence. 'Running the National is like grief - you can never shake it off'. He looks forward to directing films as well as plays, and to writing. There is always the possibility of another big job - like chairing the Arts Council for a Labour government? Meantime, he announced the 1995 programme. Former RSC director Terry Hands' makes his debut at the National, with Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, with Dennis Quilley as Falstaff. Then comes Richard Wilson and John Alderton in Joe Orton's What the Butler Saw. Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood appears, and there is a return to the bigger Lyttelton stage from the Cottesloe of Peter Brook's production of The Man Who. In May David Hare's new play, a three hander with Michael Gambon, opens at the Cottesloe while at the Lyttelton Rodney Ackland's 1945 play Absolute Hell is revived, with Judi Dench repeating her 1992 television success. The summer sees Eduardo de Filippo's La Grande Magia, directed by Eyre, and Volpone with Michael Gambon. The year's musical, subsidised by Cameron Mackintosh, is Sondheim's A Little Night Music. The year ends with Fiona Shaw in Congreve's The Way of the World and a co-production with Tara Arts of Cyrano de Bergerac.</p>

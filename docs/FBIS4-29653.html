			<p>BFN     [Text] The Malaysian economy grew at a robust 8.6 percent  in the first quarter of this year against 7.6 percent for the  same period in 1993. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister  Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said the stronger growth was driven by  firmer export growth and higher domestic demand, particularly  investment. He said this in Kuala Lumpur last night. He also  said that inflation remains stable at 4.3 percent during the  first four months of the year, similar to the rate recorded in  the same period of 1993. The government is confident that  inflation will be kept at about four percent this year compared  with a month-to-month basis.    He added that the consumer price index, which measures the  rate of inflation, had in fact dropped marginally. Datuk Sri  Anwar said the manufacturing sector, which expanded by 13.7  percent, led the first quarter gross domestic product growth  followed by the construction sector with a 12 percent expansion,  services 9.6 percent, and agriculture 2.2 percent.    Speaking in Serdang today, Datuk Sri Anwar said the  government has never neglected rural development and its record  in striking a balance between the interest of the rural and  urban community is the best in the region. He said the  contention of the country's development programs were not  comprehensive was mere empty talk which the opposition indulged  in because they refused to acknowledge the government's  achievements. He said the government's development (?democracy)  was to develop the people in all aspects of life to ensure no  one was left behind.    The deputy prime minister said not many countries have  achieved a high rate of development and none can match  Malaysia's record in rural development.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rescue agreed for Nippon Housing THE NINE financial institutions which back Nippon Housing Loan have agreed a rescue plan for the deeply-troubled lending institution which faces mounting bad debts from the collapse of the Japanese property market. The banks which back Nippon Housing Loan, led by Sanwa Bank and Sakura Bank, have agreed to forego interest of loans for up to 10 years. The group will also require substantial new loans to pay off mortgage-backed securities which fall due within the next two years. Agricultural banks, which were also heavy lenders to Nippon Housing in the 1980s, have agreed to reduce the interest rate on their loans to 2.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent. Nippon Housing Loan was set up in the 1970s by a group of commercial banks to provide housing finance. It is thought to have bad loans of about Y1,300bn out of a total loan book of about Y2,200bn. The president of Kawasho, a Japanese steel trader, is resigning after disclosing a huge loss at a financial subsidiary. Mr Kinji Ibaraki said he would be tending his resignation at the end of June to take responsibility for a Y4bn (Dollars 34m) net loss in the year to March 1993, forced by a Y19.5bn charge for an investment loss at a financial subsidiary. Kawasho said Captain, the wholly-owned Osaka financial subsidiary, would be liquidated after making a net loss of Y12bn and with unrealised losses of Y7.5bn on failed investments. Kawasho said it would make a loss despite selling more than Y13bn of securities.</p>

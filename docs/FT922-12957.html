			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan submits copyright proposals Taiwan, in an attempt to prevent trade retaliation from the US, has submitted to the US trade representative a plan that will tighten the island's resolve against copyright piracy, officials said, AP-DJ reports from Taipei. The move came after the breakdown of talks last week between the countries on the issue of protection for intellectual property. The US demanded Taiwan check all computer software and hardware before it is shipped from the island. However, Taiwan rejected the request, claiming 'technical difficulties' would hinder compliance. Tsai Lien-sheng, department chief with the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT), said Taiwan aimed to make the US government understand Taiwan's determination to protect the copyrights.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Accounting review brings mixed results: The first company-by-company analysis of the impact of the forthcoming changes A bright red document three inches thick has been causing a loud thump as it landed on the desks of investment institutions throughout the City over the past few days. 'Accounting Matters', a guide to the work of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB), has emerged after six months of drafting in the London headquarters of James Capel, the investment house. In 26 sections it contains the first comprehensive attempt to quantify the effect of changes in the financial reporting requirements being introduced for the accounts of the leading 200 British quoted companies. The analysis shows a picture of widespread change. It illustrates a substantial alteration to cashflow multiples and reported earnings figures generated by the new requirements. It also highlights the possible effects of a number of other issues on the agenda of the ASB. Capel's analysis emphasises the impact of the ASB's first financial reporting exposure draft (Fred 1), likely to come into effect later this year. The draft will require companies to split out results of companies acquired during the year, separate continuing and discontinuing activities, all but abolish extraordinary items and show more clearly the profit or loss generated by the disposal of revalued fixed assets. One of the most important effects will be to increase sharply the volatility of earnings, the firm argues. With extraordinary items all but abolished, and those remaining included in earnings calculations, the figure will become far more 'lumpy'. It shows that at George Wimpey, for example, the 1991 reported loss per share of 7.5p would be increased to 11.7p under Fred 1. At Ranks Hovis McDougall, the inclusion as required by Fred 1 of the Pounds 65m extraordinary charge shown in the 1991 results would have reduced earnings per share from 34p to 16.9p. The change reflects the ASB's desire to move the attention of readers of accounts away from a single number - earnings - towards a wider range of indicators of a company's performance. But the firm suggests that readers will still want to refer to earnings, and the new standard will generate a confusingly wide range of alternative figures: the existing reported earnings; the new Fred 1 version; one produced by the company smoothed over five years; and others generated by different City analysts. Capel itself will be publishing its version of the earnings figure, which will use the Fred 1 method, but exclude costs of withdrawal from a business segment, gains or losses from disposal of properties, and some other 'unusual items'. The aggregate price earnings ratio for the FT-Actuaries industrial sector, excluding oil, in 1991 would be 16.6 using Fred 1, 15.1 with the Capel figure, compared with 15.7 using existing reported earnings. Capel also says that while Fred 1 requires companies to separate the profits generated during the year internally from those contributed by acquisitions, analysts will still need to strip out organic growth for acquisitive companies over a longer period. Cashflow multiples are changing substantially as a result of the first financial reporting standard on the cashflow statement, which became mandatory for year-ends after March 23 this year. Capel says its old cashflow per share figure based on the source and application of funds statement no longer works. For example, over the period 1990-92, the difference between the old calculation and a new one based on the cashflow statement is as high as a fall of 49 per cent in the case of BICC. Looking forward, the firm comments on a number of future standards. It warns that proposals to amortise goodwill and to revalue regularly fixed assets which are depreciated will be highly contentious. In contrast to some recent attempts to make overall judgments on the state of company accounts - notably Mr Terry Smith's book 'Accounting for Growth' which caused considerable anger among some of the companies cited - the Capel team says no general message emerged. 'This is not a scorecard,' said Mr David Gray, deputy head of research, who admits that companies were sensitive about the firm's purpose in re-casting the numbers. 'We tried to find some way of projecting our findings (into a general set of rules) but we couldn't do it.' The firm is generally positive about the work of the ASB, although it does highlight several problems. 'The changes should give analysts more reliable numbers and more background detail to work with and should ease the interpretation of company accounts,' the document says. Reaction to Capel's document has so far been muted. Mr Ronald Henderson, finance director of BICC, said: 'The size of the tome put me off. So much of what might change is still speculative. Most of the issues highlighted could be established with a little research, but anything that improves the clarity of accounts for readers is helpful.' He stressed that he was 'broadly supportive' of the work of the ASB, but did not believe it represented as much of a revolution as some commentators were suggesting. 'I have to confess I haven't read it all,' said Mr Roger Woods, finance director of George Wimpey. 'But it does show the need to focus on cashflow per share and place less sole emphasis on earnings.'

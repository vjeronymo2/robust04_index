			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Rises in fuel and excise duties hit motorists hard MOTORISTS were hit yesterday by increases in both fuel duty and vehicle excise duty, while the taxation of the private use of company cars will also rise significantly in the next financial year. The company car taxation system will be drastically reformed with effect from 1994-95 with the move to a system based on car list prices rather than on engine size. Some 700,000 drivers will face increases in their company car tax benefit bills under the new system, in a few cases of up to 60 per cent, but the majority of the 2m drivers who pay tax on company cars will benefit from the reform, which will favour cheaper, smaller cars. The government warned yesterday that the cost of motoring is set to rise in real terms every year. It announced the intention to raise road fuel duties on average by at least 3 per cent a year in real terms in all future Budgets. Mr Lamont said that this should provide an incentive for motorists to buy smaller more fuel-efficient vehicles. With immediate effect the price of a gallon of unleaded petrol was raised by 12p to around Pounds 2.29. The price of a gallon of 4-star petrol was up 15p to around Pounds 2.52. Duties on all road fuels, including diesel, were raised by 10 per cent. At the same time the vehicle excise duty on cars was raised by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125, an increase of 13.6 per cent. These increases mean that the average cost of motoring, for a driver covering around 10,000 miles a year, will rise by around Pounds 50 a year. The chancellor said that the latest duty increases - combined with the abolition last year of special car tax - would continue the shift of taxation from car purchase towards taxation of car use. The government was determined to raise fuel duties every year in real terms in order to encourage fuel economy and to reduce the impact of the car on the environment. The transport sector accounted for the largest contribution to the growth in carbon dioxide emissions, said Mr Lamont. The size of future increases in fuel duty would also take account of other factors, such as the possible introduction of charges for motorways and urban roads and the overall level of taxes and charges paid by road users. Company car users face a further 8 per cent increase this year in tax scale charges, which the chancellor claimed would finally raise company car taxation 'to a level which fully reflects the true value of the benefit of a company car.' The average driver of a company Ford Sierra or Vauxhall Cavalier would pay Pounds 1.06 a week more in tax. More importantly for the long-term the whole system for taxing the private use of a company car will be reformed with effect from 1994/95 with the move to a system that determines taxable benefits by the price of a car rather than the size of its engine. The annual car benefit will be valued at a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's list price. Company car users will then pay income tax at their marginal rate on that amount. The benefit level will be set at 35 per cent of the list price with the aim of making the reform neutral in terms of total company car tax revenues.</p>

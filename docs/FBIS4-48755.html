			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] supported Mr Nelson Mandela as president of South  Africa, PAC leader Mr Clarence Makwetu said in debate on the  president's speech. "It is an important milestone in our march  to liberation to have an indigenous African as president after  centuries of racist, colonial rule," Mr Makwetu said.    The events of the past few weeks had been breathtaking. The  huge voter turnout at elections had demonstrated "a deep hunger  for democracy among our people".    The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's wide-ranging and balanced  state  of the nation address.    It also supported Mr Mandela's intention to subscribe to the  United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights, and asked that  detention without trial not be used again. People who had  committed offences in the struggle against apartheid should be  released unconditionally. Other offenders should be released at  the discretion of the government of the day.    The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's emphasis on development and  empowerment. Housing and job creation were important in a  society where 8-million people lived in shacks. However, the  government had to resist the temptation to borrow money and had  to keep inflation in check.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Italy still without a government PROSPECTS for quick agreement on the formation of Italy's 51st post-war government faded yesterday when it was announced that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would need more consultations with political leaders, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Mr Scalfaro began consultations last Thursday, hoping to be in a position to ask someone to form a government by the end of this week. However, he has found the parties in an unprecedented state of disarray, with none of their leaders offering guidelines acceptable to others. The president has to nominate a politician capable of mustering a parliamentary majority in the unprecedented fragmentation of the legislature following the April 5 general elections. Political commentators yesterday said the field of potential candidates for the premiership remained wide open.</p>

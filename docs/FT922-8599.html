			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Observer: Side order Carlo De Benedetti's enemies, not least TV magnate Silvio Berlusconi, are revelling in the latest spicy story at Olivetti, the troubled computer group he controls. Having announced a Dollars 300m order last week to supply computers to over 8,000 McDonald's outlets in the US, it now turns out the company has merely been selected as one of two approved suppliers. It is not quite the 'gaffe' Berlusconi's news magazine Panorama proclaims it to be in its latest issue; Olivetti may still end up selling McDonald's plenty of PCs. But coming just before today's likely announcement of a L400bn (Pounds 181m) loss for 1991, Olivetti may have been a bit too enthusiastic in claiming its bite of the burger.</p>

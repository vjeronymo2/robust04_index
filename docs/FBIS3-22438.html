			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Oleksiy Breus report: "The 'Greens' Come in Different </F> Shades"]    [Text] At the end of February, at a news conference held  in the building of the ecological association "Green World,"  Ukraine's Green Party disseminated a statement in support of the  decision adopted by the Ukrainian president and Supreme Council  on renouncing nuclear weapons and demanded that Minister of  Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko be dismissed from his  post because he, allegedly, spoke against nuclear disarmament.  The first deputy chairman of the "Green World," Yuriy  Samoylenko, said on that occasion that the association supported  the statement and told HOLOS UKRAYINY about it on 24 February.    However, a few days later, chairman of the "Green World"  Mykola Korobko stated that his association did not and does not  support anybody's demands for Yu. Kostenko's resignation. As  regards Yu. Samoylenko, it appears that the Association's Green  Council expressed no-confidence in him as far back as October  1993. However, that move did not receive much publicity.    Another deputy chairman of the "Green World" Anatoliy  Zolotukhin reported by telegram from Nikolayev, where he heads  the association's oblast organization, about business relations  with Yu. Kostenko and changes for the better at the Ministry of  Environmental Protection. At the same time, he supported the  renunciation of nuclear weapons.    Minister Yu. Kostenko himself further specified that he  never  was against nuclear disarmament, but that it should not be  detrimental to Ukraine. For example, if Russia takes the  [nuclear] warheads, it should not leave behind the poisonous  heptyl that is used as fuel for missiles. He also added that,  today, concrete ecological deeds on the part of the "Greens"  would be more useful than their opportunist political chatter.</p>

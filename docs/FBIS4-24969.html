			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Puquan (0491 3184 3123)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, state councillor,  and minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring  Commission, and Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing municipal party  committee, today visited some enterprises in Beijing to  investigate and study the means of establishing a modern  enterprise system.    Full of zest, Li Tieying and Chen Xitong viewed the progress  made by the Beijing Department Store (Group) Limited Company in  Wangfujing, the Beijing Tongrentang Group Company, the Beijing  Chemical Industry Group Company, and the Beijing Peony Electric  Group Company in establishing a modern enterprise system. They  also held informal discussions with Zheng Wanhe, Tian Yumin, Sun  Zhenyan, and Chen Jie, the general managers of the four  enterprises, regarding the establishment of a modern enterprise  system.    In recent years, the four enterprises carried out plenty of  preparatory work as they explored the means of establishing a  modern enterprise system. Li Tieying fully affirmed their  efforts.    Li Tieying said emphatically: A fundamental way to lift  state-owned enterprises out of their predicament is to establish  a modern enterprise system. He hoped that enterprises in  Beijing would keep exploring boldly, intensify research,  constantly sum up experience, and explore a microeconomic course  for organically combining public ownership with the market  economy while bearing in mind the need to solve their existing  practical problems.    The Beijing Department Store has evolved into a limited  company engaged in 10 major lines of business, including  commerce, production, processing, advertising, and stock  business. Grouping scientific, industrial, trading, production,  supply, and marketing operations, the Beijing Tongrentang Group  Company sells its products nationwide, as well as to more than  40 countries and regions. The Beijing Peony Electric Group  Company has joined the nationwide ranks of electronic  industries, acquiring a capacity to produce 1 million color  television sets, its leading product. Last year, the Beijing  Chemical Industry Group Company achieved 5.28 billion yuan in  total industrial output value, posted 500 million yuan in  profits and taxes, and took in $40.50 million in  export-generated foreign exchange, ranking second in the  country's 100 large chemical groups in terms of composite  economic efficiency.</p>

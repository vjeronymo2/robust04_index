He captured the  attention of political representatives and the media who were  standing outside the funeral home.    Camacho Solis was asked about the incidents of violence in  Tijuana, Baja California. He gave a brief message to the public.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I wanted to be present here  publicly because my position has always been an open one. The  things I have always wanted to do have always been open. I  deeply regret what has happened. It is something very serious  for the country's life. Before the eyes of the nation I want to  make the following statement: Two days ago I said I did not seek  to be president of the republic. After the incidents that have  taken place, after this tremendous attack on the nation, I  reiterate what I have already said. I do not aspire to be  president of the republic. The fatherland is above everything  and above everyone.

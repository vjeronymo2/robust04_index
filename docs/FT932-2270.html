			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eagle Trust cuts losses to Pounds 7.6m EAGLE TRUST, the mini con-glomerate, reduced its pre-tax loss from Pounds 12m to Pounds 7.59m in 1992. Of that, interest acc-ounted for Pounds 7.42m reflecting the high bank debt outstanding as a result of former losses in the parent company. The group is engaged in merchanting and distribution and in film, television and lighting. Turnover rose to Pounds 84.4m (Pounds 82.7m) and generated a gross operating profit of Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 21.9m). Losses per share worked through at 0.9p (1.4p). The directors considered the group was making good progress. Apart from maintaining and developing the value of remaining investments, the primary object was the successful completion of the litigation programme seeking recovery for past losses from certain former professional advisers. The action with SBS Securities would start next May, and the case against the former auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, was expected to commence in January 1995.</p>

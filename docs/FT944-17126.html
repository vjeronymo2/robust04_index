			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fund to invest in Bulgaria Kerin Hope in Athens Global Finance, the Greek venture capital company associated with Baring of the UK, is to launch a Dollars 30m venture capital fund in Bulgaria next month. The International Finance Corporation fund, the World Bank's private sector financing arm, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are together contributing 50 per cent of the capital. The remainder is being provided by Euromerchant Bank, the private Greek bank controlled by the Latsis shipping group which is sponsoring the fund, and a group of Greek and international investors. Euromerchant Balkan Fund will take minority stakes in private companies based in Bulgaria, including ventures launched by northern European concerns. It will focus on companies serving the local market in food processing and retailing and those that export to the former Soviet Union. It plans to help finance acquisitions of companies under Bulgaria's privatisation programme, which is expected to speed up as a voucher scheme gets under way, and Mr Angelos Plakopittas, managing director of Global Finance, said it would help 'mobilise capital for larger projects that could be backed by the IFC and the EBRD'. Bulgaria has attracted only about Dollars 100m in foreign investment since 1990, of which some Dollars 40m has come from Greece.</p>

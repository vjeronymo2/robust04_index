			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI CLINCHES BIG WEST CELLAR WITH LOSS  </P> <P> Mediocrity reigned supreme as UC Irvine and San Jose State met to decide last  place in the Big West Conference Thursday night.  </P> <P> And with an 84-78 loss in front of 1,686 at San Jose's Recreation and Events  Center, Irvine kept its stranglehold on last place secure.  </P> <P> For weeks, it has almost been a foregone conclusion that Irvine would finish in  last place. It finally happened Thursday; the Anteaters clinched the bottom  spot.  </P> <P> When Irvine's Ricky Butler was called for charging with 25 seconds left and the  Anteaters trailing, 80-78, things looked grim.  </P> <P> San Jose guard Tom Desiano made four for four free throws to seal the  Anteaters' fate.  </P> <P> And Desiano's free throws saved the Spartans the distinction of blowing an  11-point lead with 10:34 left.  </P> <P> Irvine rallied as first Dylan Rigdon, then Justin Anderson made three-point  baskets, cutting the Spartans' lead to 68-63.  </P> <P> Later, Butler made two free throws and a layup, and Irvine trailed, 73-70, with  4:59 left.  </P> <P> Finally, Craig Marshall's free throw with 2:17 left tied it at 75.  </P> <P> San Jose's Andre Brooks and Rigdon matched three-pointers. Kevin Logan then  gave the Spartans the lead for good with a 10-foot jumper with 1:14 left.  </P> <P> After a timeout, Irvine worked the ball inside to Butler, who slipped the ball  outside to Rigdon for an open three-pointer. The ball went in and out, but  Irvine's Rob Doktorczyk rebounded.  </P> <P> The Anteaters worked it inside to Butler again. He crashed into three Spartans  as he tossed in an off-balance, five-foot shot along the baseline.  </P> <P> Butler was called for charging, wiping out the basket and giving San Jose the  ball.  </P> <P> "I'm not coaching that well, how the hell can I ref?" Irvine Coach Bill  Mulligan said when asked about the call.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I (charged)," said Butler, who had a game-high 19 points. "I  was trying to catch my balance and I dipped my shoulder. I don't think it was a  charge."  </P> <P> Rigdon added 18 points, but was only three of 11 from the field. He also had  seven assists. Jeff Von Lutzow added 14 points.  </P> <P> Kenne Young led San Jose with 18 points. Terry Cannon, a freshman who led  Crenshaw High School to the state Division I championship last season, added  15.  </P> <P> San Jose improved to 8-18, 5-12 in the Big West. Irvine (4-22, 2-15) ends the  regular season at Utah State Saturday.  </P> <P> "We lost it by not defending all night," Mulligan said. "We just decided we  weren't going to defend anybody."  </P> <P> He paused a moment, then said, "I could have put more shooters into the game at  the end, but I was afraid they were going to give up layups all night."  </P> <P> San Jose's quickness, notably Cannon and Troy Batiste, made it difficult for  Irvine.  </P> <P> Cannon swept by the defense repeatedly, freeing himself for layups and short  jumpers.  </P> <P> But speed had nothing to do with one easy layup Cannon got early in the second  half.  </P> <P> After an Irvine turnover, Cannon slipped behind the Anteaters, who seemed  frozen at midcourt for no apparent reason. No one was within 25 feet as he  dropped the ball into the basket.  </P> <P> Mulligan signaled for time and ripped into his team.  </P> <P> "Just a bad game," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> Guard Dylan Rigdon caught an elbow from Tom Desiano late in the game and was  taken to San Jose Hospital for X-rays. "He got me right where the jaw bone  starts (near the ear)," Rigdon said. "My teeth were chattering and I couldn't  stop it. I can't bite down." That didn't stop Rigdon from carting off with a  slice of pepperoni pizza as he headed for the team bus.  </P> <P> The victory gave San Jose State a sweep of Irvine for the first time since the  1982-83 season. . . . Irvine's record dropped to 1-11 on the road.  </P> <P> Irvine shot 46.7% from the field to San Jose's 54.1%.  </P></p>

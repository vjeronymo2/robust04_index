			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Commerzbank postpones rights issue because of weak bourse COMMERZBANK said that it had decided to postpone its planned rights issue from this month because of the weak state of the German stock market. The bank had planned to raise up to DM600m (Dollars 428m), assuming a price of around DM200 a share. The shares closed at DM218 compared with a year's high of DM274. The bank did not say when it was likely to make the issue - it actually has shareholder's approval to issue 8m new shares, but is expected to limit the rights issue to around 3m - which could now occur at the end of this year or in 1993, depending on the state of the market. Mr Friedrich von Metzler, a partner in the Metzler private bank, is resigning as chairman of the Frankfurt stock exchange to pave the way for a successor from one of the big German banks as part of the restructuring of the German bourse system. With the setting up of Deutsche Borse AG to run Germany's eight stock markets on a more centralised basis, Mr Metzler said the position should be held by a market participant represented on all of the bourses. He proposed that Mr Rolf Breuer, a director of Deutsche Bank, be elected next January as chairman of both the Frankfurt stock exchange and the supervisory board of Deutsche Borse. Mr von Metzler said the formation of Deutsche Borse would raise the financial scene to a new level of quality, with all bourses co-operating to modernise the German securities market. Frankfurt is by far the largest of the eight stock markets, with Dusseldorf in second place.</p>

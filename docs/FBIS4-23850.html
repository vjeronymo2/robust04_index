			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 16 Jun (AFP) -- Nigeria's powerful trade  union federation, the Nigeria Labor Congress [NLC], this evening  called on the military government of General Sani Abacha to  "withdraw totally from the running of the country's affairs in  the interest of democracy."    In a statement issued at the end of a meeting of its central  committee, the NLC said in view of "the persistent political  instability," the aspiration to immediate democracy, and "the  very difficult economic situation" of the country, it has noted  that "the military cannot resolve these problems."</p>

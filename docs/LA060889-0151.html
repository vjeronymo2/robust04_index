Half said they plan to maintain  their current staff size. The results were part of a nationwide poll by  Management Recruiters International, the nation's largest search firm.  Nationwide, 39.1% of the hiring officers said they planned to expand their  staffs, compared to 37.4% on the West Coast. David Reiss, head of Management  Recruiters in Beverly Hills, said the region was slightly behind the national  average because of a big increase in hiring last year.  </P></p>

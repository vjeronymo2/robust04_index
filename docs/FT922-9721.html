			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / US stance rattles Asian Development Bank consensus THE Asian Development Bank, with its president and many senior officials coming from Japan, is traditionally run by consensus and without open confrontation. These qualities were difficult to find yesterday, however, with officials of shareholding countries, speaking at the bank's annual meeting in Hong Kong, advancing deeply contrasting views of the bank's future role as a regional development institution. Mr Olin L. Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs in the US Treasury, said bluntly that the US, as equal largest shareholder with Japan, would not countenance a replenishment of the ADB's capital resources until it had radically altered its lending policies. The opposing view was provided by Mr J B Sumarlin, finance minister of Indonesia, by far the largest borrower from the ADB. He urged rapid approval of the bank's request for a capital increase, arguing that its loans 'represent the most cost-effective way of delivering development financing'. The ADB will not in fact need new money  - it is seeking a 110 per cent capital increase representing new commitments of Dollars 25bn  - (Pounds 14bn) until 1994 and the approval process is likely to take at least a year. However, the opening arguments appeared to signal a fundamental debate about the role of development institutions in fostering growth, and about the role of the state, which remains significant in most Asian economies despite their dynamic growth and healthy private sectors. The ADB has begun to direct financing at the private sector and has carried out numerous studies on the issue. But the bulk of its lending continues to finance public sector works. The US has lost patience. 'Any new capital increase should await the formulation of a clear and effective strategy for encouraging private sector development,' Mr Wethington said. The US also wants: loans to be conditional on adherence to policy reforms, for example to support reforms which opened up financial markets; an end to co-financing deals with commercial banks which could threaten the ADB's credit standing; and a re-assessment of which countries should get loans. The arguments stem partly from Asia's remarkable growth, which has pushed the four 'dragons'  - Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea  - beyond the point where they can borrow from the ADB. Thailand and Malaysia are approaching that stage. This leaves a concentration of loans outstanding to a few countries: Indonesia (34 per cent), India (17), Philippines (14), Pakistan (14), Malaysia (6), China (5) and Thailand (4). A 46 per cent rise in new loans last year was largely because of increased borrowing by India and China. The US says, however, China's large current account surplus should enable it to borrow more from commercial sources and less from the ADB. The US attitude to the ADB is viewed as dogmatic and blinkered by many regional countries which see Washington as increasingly out of step with Asia and isolated on issues such as financing for Vietnam, which it blocks.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Saab halves deficit to SKr1.37bn Saab Automobile, the Swedish car maker 50 per cent owned by General Motors of the US, yesterday announced its fifth successive year of losses, posting a SKr1.37bn (Dollars 171m) loss before extraordinary items in 1993. But the result was a 49 per cent improvement on the 1992 loss of SKr2.68bn and included a one-off charge of SKr299m incurred during the start-up and launch of the new Saab 900 model which went on sale last autumn. Saab, which has talked of a possible return to profit in 1994 for some months, said yesterday the chances of reaching break-even were good. Sales rose to SKr16.12bn from SKr14.69bn, but this reflected the slide in the value of the Swedish krona during 1993. The number of vehicles sold was down sharply, also for the fifth year in succession, at 73,600, compared with 86,800 in 1992. Saab, jointly owned by GM and Sweden's Saab-Scania, has swallowed more than SKr8bn in new capital from its owners and accumulated losses of more than SKr11bn since GM bought into the company in 1989 seeking a prestige European marque to extend its range into an up-market niche. After a radical restructuring, during which it has almost halved it workforce to 7,900, it is pinning its hopes for recovery on the 900 model, coupled with improving conditions in its three main markets - Sweden, the US and Britain. Saab has set a tough target of selling 87,000 vehicles from its 9000 and 900 ranges this year but says this is realistic.</p>

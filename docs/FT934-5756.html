			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Hitting the right note to fill the seats - The marketing strategies of London's opera houses Not many people can whistle the airs from Smetana's opera The Two Widows. By all accounts it is a jolly, tuneful, light opera, ideal for the Christmas trade. But English National Opera knows it cannot fill the vast 2,358 seat Coliseum with such a little known work without a considerable marketing effort. It is contemplating playing the music down telephone lines so that anyone who needs convincing that they will enjoy it can get a taster. There will also be a special offer, four seats for the price of three, to encourage celebratory parties. The same deal will cover the other holiday production, Die Fledermaus. It is all part of the ENO's intensified effort to sell more seats. In recent years its audience has declined inexorably, to 63 per cent of capacity last season. As the London theatre belatedly feels the effects of the recession (West End ticket sales are down 1 per cent on last year), the two opera houses, the ENO and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, are looking towards imaginative marketing schemes to attract audiences and shore up revenue. They are well aware that declining attendances hardly help their case for more subsidy from the Arts Council. But while the two Houses consider plans to build audiences they are well aware of the pitfalls. Both have loyal, bedrock, supporters (who rarely overlap). They are terrified that embracing cut price promotions and special offers with too much enthusiasm will alienate their regular patrons and increase the current curse of the West End - last minute bookings. The Royal Opera House experienced the problem recently when, to fill some unsold capacity, it offered 13 seats for Eugene Onegin, ranging in price up to Pounds 85, for just Pounds 15 to members of its staff, and to the staff of the Royal Academy, with which it has friendly links. News of the promotion leaked out and the box office was busy placating opera lovers seeking similar treatment. The aim is to dispose of empty seats without upsetting traditional subscribers. At all costs the two Houses want to avoid introducing a bucket-shop image to a trip to the opera or ballet. ENO and Covent Garden are taking different approaches to the same end. Although the ENO does make 58 seats available on the day at discount prices (Pounds 18 for the stalls; Pounds 6 for the gallery), and carries special offers for less popular operas through commercial radio and magazines like Time Out, its ambition is to sell more seats through attracting new audiences rather than reducing seat prices to its existing one. It is working on a special promotion which will offer discounts to schools and to community groups. This has yet to be launched. In the meantime the ENO will continue to target certain markets for particular productions that need help at the box office. There is no need to cut prices on its new La Boheme, which the other Saturday played to 105 per cent capacity thanks to an influx of standing room only aficionados. But the juxtaposition in the repertory of Figaro's Wedding and The Barber of Seville, which share at least one character in common, made it seem natural to offer a discount on the Rossini opera to buyers of Figaro tickets. Another recent production, Street Scene, is virtually unknown despite its origin as a Broadway musical. The ENO took a mailing shot to First Call subscribers, pushing its history as a 20th century musical. It also made a media drive for radio producers, giving them complimentary seats in the hope that the tuneful songs would later feature on their play lists. But discounting is perilous. The ENO much prefers to encourage its core audience by offering a free 24 hour booking service and discounts in car parking until it gets the major promotion aimed at new audiences off the ground. The need to boost ENO attendances has been intensified by the success of Covent Garden. In September Covent Garden launched a guaranteed ticket for Pounds 10 in a promotion with the FT. This attracted 17,000 responses, and will dispose of most of the unsold seats in the current season. The first performance of a triple bill of three modern ballets, a notoriously difficult programme to sell, was packed, thanks to 200 FT readers in the audience. Covent Garden is less concerned to develop new audiences. It fulfils its commitment to access through broadcasting, and the Midland Bank Proms and simultaneous screenings on the piazza. With its average seat price much higher than that at the Coliseum it sees little potential in marketing itself to schools or community groups. It also has two advantages over its rival down the road. It has fewer empty seats to fill - last season its dance performances had a capacity of 87 per cent and opera 85 per cent. And it has more flexibility over its programming: ENO would find it financially counter-productive to cancel performances of an unpopular opera production but Covent Garden can switch its dance programmes, as it did last season when more offerings of Tales of Beatrix Potter were slotted in at the expense of the ailing Prince of the Pagodas. Covent Garden is also working on a long term solution to lifting audiences. It is based on the frequent flier schemes of airlines. As you buy tickets you acquire points, and points can be converted into seats. Of course certain, more challenging, productions earn more points than others. The aim is to deliver audiences of around 92 per cent of capacity, and the promotion is likely to come into force next season, building on the databank of potential new supporters that the Royal Opera gained through the FT promotion. Both Houses have improved their financial position in recent years by cutting costs. But they still have substantial deficits. With the near certainty that the Arts Council will have to reduce its subsidy by 2 per cent next year, it is more vital than ever that box office revenue is increased. The secret lies in finding an approach which boosts income without discounting the value of the product.</p>

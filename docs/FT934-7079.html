			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Chinese leader cuts a figure on the world stage China's President Jiang Zemin did not quite go to the extent of donning a ten-gallon hat - as did his patron, Mr Deng Xiaoping, when he visited the US in 1979. But the crusty Communist party general secretary went out of his way to make an impact as a world leader during the weekend summit in Seattle. Mr Jiang talked expansively but uncompromisingly in a 90-minute session with President Bill Clinton. He had individual meetings with leaders of Indonesia, Australia, South Korea, Canada, Japan and Thailand. He dropped in on a 'typical' middle-class American family, handed out a stuffed panda and a doll in exchange for cookies and a picture of Sleeping Beauty, and brandished pictures of his grandchildren. For Mr Jiang, the summit could not have been held in a more symbolic city than the home of Boeing, which dominates the local economy. China has bought more than 200 Boeing aircraft since the 1970s and is the company's biggest foreign customer. Thanks to the country's economic boom and renewal of its infrastructure, it promises to remain so. But if Mr Clinton removes China's most favoured nation trading status, as he threatens to do next year, Seattle would fear the consequences. Visiting Boeing's Everett plant, Mr Jiang pointedly thanked Mr Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, for the company's efforts to maintain China's MFN status. Chinese officials repeatedly pointed out the US would suffer if MFN is revoked. Mr Clinton, after several months of worsening relations, has embarked on a new policy of closer engagement with China, involving higher-level and more frequent discussions than had occurred since before the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989. However, he made clear to Mr Jiang this does not imply a lessening of US pressure on China for improvements in human rights, market access and nuclear non-proliferation - all conditions set by the US president for MFN renewal next June. On human rights, Mr Clinton spelled out specific demands for International Red Cross access to Chinese prisons; release of political prisoners particularly if they are ill; a dialogue by Beijing with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader; and access by US customs officials to ensure prison-made goods are not exported to the US. Mr Jiang delivered a 15-minute statement on the diversity of the world's nations and the need not to interfere in each other's affairs. But he did discuss the North Korean nuclear threat and indicated China was prepared to discuss the issues which were of concern to the US. Both men said the meeting was a 'good beginning'. Mr Clinton said it 'established our determination to build on the positive aspects of our existing relations, and to address far more candidly and personally than we have in the past the problems that remain'. China had not been expected to give ground in so public an arena as the first meeting between the two presidents. But Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, was encouraged that they had met, that Mr Jiang had not refused to 'engage', and that they had 'a vivid and animated discussion'. Despite China's rejection of US demands, stepped-up and forthright dialogue seems likely to continue, with end-year deadlines looming for resolution of market access and textile disputes and congressional hearings on the MFN issue due in January. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said Beijing's trade surplus with Washington could reach Dollars 23bn (Pounds 15.6bn) this year and described it as 'politically and economically unacceptable.' Ms Wu Yi, China's trade minister, responded that 'China has never been afraid of sanctions.'</p>

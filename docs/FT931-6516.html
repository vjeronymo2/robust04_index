			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Relisting expected following restructure at Fairbriar FAIRBRIAR, the insolvent south-east based property developer which had its shares suspended at 8p in September 1991, is likely to be relisted on the Stock Exchange in the next few weeks. The joint administrators from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, have applied to the High Court to be released from their appointment following the approval by creditors in late January of a company voluntary arrangement. That would pave the way for what is believed to be the first ever example of a British company being relisted intact since administration orders were first introduced in the 1986 Insolvency Act. Under a restructuring proposal accepted in late January, unsecured creditors have been offered Pounds 400,000 in cash and 3.45m new shares in exchange for outstanding debts. Preferential creditors will be paid in full at Pounds 200,000. An interim distribution is expected within four months. There will also be a subscription of 7.67m new shares at 1p. The Bank of Scotland will receive 4.13m ordinary shares, 8.82m convertible preference shares and up to Pounds 10.6m in zero coupon secured loan notes. It will extend a new working capital facility of Pounds 2.5m. Mr Terry Carter, one of the joint administrators, said the allocation of shares between the creditors was based on 'a horse trade'. He said Fairbriar showed that administrations to save a company could be made to work. He added that failure to achieve approval for the company voluntary arrangement would have led to liquidation, with the loss of tax credits worth tens of millions of pounds and little prospect of any dividend for creditors. The company's properties are valued in the balance sheet at Pounds 51.9m at March 31 1992, against borrowings of Pounds 81.9m. Contingent claims from unsecured creditors are believed to total about Pounds 25m. Under the proposed restructuring, debt would be reduced to Pounds 60.3m leaving the company with an accumulated deficit. No dividend will be paid until this is removed. The relisting follows approval at a series of creditors' meetings on January 22 for a company voluntary arrangement.</p>

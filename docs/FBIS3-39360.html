What has contributed  to it are the massive attempts by the Americans to threaten and  exert pressure on the Japanese in terms of economic and trade  policy. However, according to the result of a first examination  of the legal situation, the methods applied by the Americans  seem to be legal, even under the new accords of the Uruguay  Round and the rules of the new World Trade Organization, WTO.  Still, what is not unlawful may still be unwise. The U.S.  position might destroy the main illusion of the eight-year GATT  negotiations, namely that the law of the jungle will be replaced  by a proper law once the GATT agreement comes into force in 1995  and that a "peace order" will begin to rule trade policy.    Threats alone and evil words are not banned under the new  world trade order, not even in an extremely explicit form such  as the threat with a "trade war" and similar things. What might  be forbidden, however, could be putting the threat into  practice, that is to say the action itself.    Moreover, negotiators in Geneva were horrified to discover  that it was particularly the United States that did not accept  some fundamental former texts of international law on compliance  with treaties and arbitration decisions or accepted them only  with reservations. Hence, not even a GATT or WTO decision would  be absolutely binding or enforceable.    These weaknesses and loopholes of the treaty, of course, do  not mean that one could not act more reasonably and peacefully  in future practice. This was what everybody was hoping for.  However, the U.S. policy toward Japan is seen as trend-setting  and it is far from pointing to the desired direction but to the  opposite one. This is where the great danger lies.    Not enough was quite obviously done in the GATT negotiations  for conflict prevention and protection against emerging trade  conflicts. Proof of this lies in the fact that, in the current  stage of the Japanese-American conflict, the GATT has nothing to  say. Even the new WTO will not be better prepared. At the most  the new GATT head, Sutherland, could say a few words of warning  out of his own responsibility.    It is no wonder that Japan is seen as a William Tell by many  small GATT members, mainly from the Third World, who fights  against the evil governors. The small GATT countries are  automatically telling themselves: "What is being done to the  Japanese can be done to us much more easily. Therefore, we must  back the Japanese in this case, regardless of whether,  emotionally, we like it or not."    Washington has taken its own desire too much as reality,  namely that the Japanese are generally and universally seen as  troublemakers who have the sympathy of nobody and who can, thus,  be treated roughly. Europe should not make the same mistake.</p>

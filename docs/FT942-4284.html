			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Kenyan central bank used false account to hide fraud A UK subsidiary of Banque Indosuez, the Paris-based merchant bank, last year created an account for a fictitious Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) deposit for the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) which was used by the CBK to conceal a foreign exchange fraud from international creditors. The account was due to close six months later after the completion of an investigation into mismanagement at the central bank and a meeting of Kenya's aid donors chaired by the World Bank in November. However, Banque Indosuez insists that it was unaware of the CBK attempt to conceal the fraud. CBK closed the account once its existence had been uncovered by the International Monetary Fund, which had been examining Kenya's servicing of its foreign debt. A second account for a fictitious Dollars 110m, which also artificially inflated Kenya's foreign exchange reserves, was uncovered at a UK subsidiary of another international bank, and also closed. In June last year, Banque Indosuez Sogem Aval agreed to make a 'book entry' to the account of CBK for a 'notional deposit' of Dollars 100m although 'no transfer of funds was involved', according to a copy of the confidential contract obtained by the Financial Times. Mr Francois Vikar, communications director at Banque Indosuez in Paris, acknowledged that the CBK approached Indosuez Aval 'wanting to do window dressing before the visit of IMF officials'. He explained that in order 'to make things look absolutely normal', Indosuez Aval made interest payments on the fictitious deposits using moneys made available from a central bank advance. However, Mr Vikar says the CBK did not identify a fraud was being concealed. The creation of fictitious foreign exchange deposits was part of an exercise by CBK intended to mask funds missing after Exchange Bank, a Kenyan commercial bank, defaulted on a foreign exchange forward contract worth KSh9.9bn. Exchange Bank was closed by reformist finance minister Musalia Mudavadi in July last year. Exchange Bank's owner, Mr Kamlesh Pattni, a Kenyan entrepreneur, was arrested last week on 22 separate charges of stealing from the central bank. Four former senior CBK officials, of whom two were signatories to the Indosuez Aval contract, have also been arrested for alleged theft from the central bank. The new central bank governor, Mr Micah Cheserem, acknowledged a series of frauds earlier this year. and is trying to recover the funds that were lost in the Dollars 210m foreign exchange fraud.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Tretyakov: "Say No If You Cannot Say Yes. </F> What Is the Head of the Kremlin Thinking About?"    [Text] Nursultan Nazarbayev risked asking the president of  Russia a most difficult question for Boris Yeltsin regarding the  creation of a Eurasian Union, which undoubtedly in language more  understandable to all simply means the recreation of the USSR  (naturally--no irony intended--a democratic one, with a market  economy, and with realistic, in the sense of being realistically  measured out, sovereignty of the member states).    The president of Russia became very thoughtful.    Boris Yeltsin never liked to and does not know how to  respond  to direct questions (since the autumn of 1991). If he is forced  to do so he does it not even evasively (that is, in a Marxist  dialectic manner, as Gorbachev did) but simultaneously giving  two contradictory answers. With reference to the existing  well-known decree issued by Yeltsin, for instance, presidential  elections will take place in Russia in June 1994, whereas in  accordance with transitional articles of Yeltsin's  constitution--they are scheduled for June 1996.    Thus Yeltsin did not say yes to the president of Kazakhstan,  (and will not do so). He did not say no (and will not do so). He  will not say, "no, but..." either, or "yes". Sooner or later at  some point he will say: "The Eurasian Union must be created."  Somewhat later, at another point he will say: "By the will of  the people who elected me I am, above all, the guarantor of the  state sovereignty of Russia and therefore the Eurasian Union  must not be created."    Let all the voters and foreign politicians scratch their  heads in bewilderment: What could it mean? It means nothing.  There is simply no answer. After someone starts some kind of a  union--a Eurasian, a Soviet, or even a Euroafrican one, then we  will think of something. It appears that scientific terms this  is called a reactive policy.    Yeltsin rejected any policy based on his own initiative from  the time when he understood that the promised sovereignty (as  much as can be borne) was almost borne away.    The question concerning the Union, however, is a serious  one.  Nazarbayev, as undoubtedly one of the most sober-minded and  far-sighted politicians, raised it in a thought-out manner,  guided by many reasons four of which appear to be the most  important ones. First of all Mr. Nazarbayev understood that in  his lifetime he would not be able to raise Kazakhstan to a level  of material prosperity, and especially to any stellar levels,  without Russia (or some other superpower)--that is unrealistic.  Secondly the imperial memory of "democratic" Russia will not  dissipate very soon--it is best to reunite than to inevitably  drift toward an inevitable confrontation. Third, the "Russian  question" (especially with the inability of Russia to resolve it  not only in the near abroad but even on its own territory)  sooner or later will create an "explosion" in Kazakhstan within  its current artificial borders. Fourth, China is quite near to  it--a few more years and the Moscow suzerain will appear as a  kindly father compared to the Beijing uncle.    In other words Nursultan Nazarbayev feels something that  they  do not even suspect in the Kremlin, or rather, they do suspect  it but like a burnt child, dread the fire since it will be  necessary to do some work, bear responsibility, and share power.  Nursultan Nazarbayev realizes that in the next presidential  elections in Russia, in Ukraine, in Belarus, and in Kazakhstan  itself, and perhaps in a number of other republics of the former  USSR, there will be politicians running, and in some cases  winning, under the slogan of a peaceful recreation of the Union  within reasonable boundaries and in reasonable forms, who simply  cannot be classified as radicals, extremists, or even communists.    It is absolutely clear, and Nazarbayev knows it, that under  Yeltsin and Kravchuk in Ukraine no Union will be  created(Belovezhskaya Pushcha syndrome). But Nazarbayev looks  ahead, into the future not of specific presidents, but that of  Kazakhstan and Russia. In the latter case--beyond the Kremlin.  In addition to that, of course, Nazarbayev has good odds--he did  not take part in the liquidation of the USSR and the  proclamation of a sexless CIS out of its shapeless fragments and  Alma-Ata, naturally, does not have its West Ukraine as does  Kiev, nor a morbid thirst for power above which there is only  God (for atheistically raised Yeltsin, there is not even that),  as in the case of the president of Russia.    It is characteristic that the talkative Moscow press greeted  with virtually total silence a proposal by the president of a  country which was recently accused by it of infringing on the  rights of Russian voters in parliamentary elections in  Kazakhstan.    The silence of the Moscow press, just as the silence of the  head of the Kremlin and of practically the entire Russian  political Olympus, constitutes the inability and fear of  honestly and openly responding to an issue which is becoming the  main political issue for the country (which is becoming  increasingly more evident): What is to be done with the wounded  "affectionate and gentle beast"--the Union, still alive and  ensconced in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha? Is it to be nursed back  to health? Frankly finished off, or, whilst we bashfully look  the other way, allowed to expire while at the same time we  attempt to enter Europe. Perhaps directly into Western Europe?    It is not necessary to answer that question, while limiting  oneself to a secret strategy (for fools, which rather resembles  a tactic) of chopping pieces off property of "fraternal  republics" weakened more than Russia. Even the Bolsheviks did  not conduct such a cynical policy--they were perhaps more  aggressive, but also more honest: Whatever they could not  swallow, whatever they could not claim on the basis of serious  historical tradition of a state (Poland, Finland, Baltic  states), they let go.    There are two questions, however, which cannot be ignored:  Russians outside the borders of current Russia and Russian  soldiers perishing in the pacification of warring sides on  foreign territories. Sooner or later these questions will have  to be faced.    The Kremlin remains silent. It is afraid to say yes. It is  afraid to say no. It does not want to bring the Russians home  (the economic indices are deteriorating) and cannot do so (it  does not know how to achieve economic success even without  them). But it will help support the increasingly nationalized  organs of power of the sovereign nations, theatrically lamenting  that there are few Russians over there and that everyone is  compelled to speak the national language there. What language  should the British parliament use--Japanese? Why then should the  Ukrainian one use Russian?    It is too bad that the Kremlin wall was not built by the  ancestors along administrative borders of the RSFSR. It would  have been simpler just to sit behind it.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / EC laws 'causing big water bills' ENVIRONMENTAL legislation by the EC has caused water bills across Europe to soar and most Europeans now pay more for water than North Americans, according to a report published yesterday. The survey of 1992 water prices in 12 countries by National Utility Services (NUS), a consultancy firm, comes after months of debate between the UK water industry and its regulators over rises in water bills. European water companies are now facing the burden of complying with EC environmental legislation on drinking and bathing water standards passed in the 1980s, and in many cases part of the costs has been passed to households. The highest jump in 1992 water prices was in Belgium, according to the report, which calculates that the price of water rose by 48 per cent. That outstripped increases in the Netherlands and Norway of 22 per cent, and of 12 per cent in the UK. In that year, Canada and the US saw rises of only 8 per cent. Increases in France, Finland, Germany, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland were even lower, and Australia saw a rise of only 0.3 per cent. However, countries which have suffered high price rises do not always have the most expensive water, says NUS. Of the countries surveyed, Germany has the highest prices at just over 78 pence per cubic metre. The report comments that 'the modernisation of eastern Germany has contributed to the high prices and it is likely that water prices will continue to rise sharply'. Germany ranked ahead of Australia at 72 pence, Belgium at 67 pence, France and the Netherlands at around 60 pence, and the UK at 54 pence. The US, Norway and Canada, with prices between 19 pence and 25 pence, were the cheapest.</p>

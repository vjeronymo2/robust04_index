			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu and visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry on  Wednesday agreed on the importance of additional nuclear  inspection of North Korea. Ministers Han and Perry shared the  view that what is most important at this stage is for North  Korea to accept additional inspection of their nuclear  facilities, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said.    Chang said the two ministers agreed that only after North  Korea underwent additional inspection can third-round U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks be held to discuss comprehensively the  nuclear question and the issue of improving Washington-Pyongyang  relations.    During the meeting, Perry stressed the importance of  resolving the nuclear issue through diplomatic efforts as far as  possible, the spokesman said.    The two ministers also observed that if North Korea fails to  accept additional inspections within a given period, it would be  unavoidable to promote a sanction against Pyongyang by the U.N.  Security Council. In this connection, the spokesman said, Han  and Perry decided to build up the joint defense ability of South  Korea and the United States to prepare against any contingency.    The two ministers, however, ruled that the Korean peninsula  is not in a critical state at the moment because there is no  unusual military movement on the part of North Korea. They  further reaffirmed the principle that the inter-Korean dialogue  and U.S.-North Korea talks should be promoted in a complementary  way, spokesman Chang said.</p>

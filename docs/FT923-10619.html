			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Allianz shares slip 3% on flat results SHARES in Allianz, Germany's largest insurance group, fell 3 per cent yesterday after the Munich-based group reported flat net profits for last year and its first loss on its mainstream underwriting business. Group net profits rose 4 per cent to DM1.05bn (Pounds 360m) on premium income up 27 per cent to DM48.7bn. The underwriting result - the net of premium income and claims paid before investment income - fell from a profit of DM182m in 1990 to a loss of DM1.78bn. Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive, explained that the poor underwriting performance was due to losses at Fireman's Fund, the large US insurance company bought in 1990, and at Deutsche Versicherungs, the former east German state insurance monopoly acquired for DM711m. Another factor was the poor state of world insurance markets. Mr Schulte-Noelle predicted that conditions would not improve substantially during the current year. Premium income would rise to more than DM50bn, he said, but underwriting profits would be hit by poor claims experience and the effect of intense competition on premium income. Deutsche Versicherungs and Fireman's Fund were consolidated for the first time last year. This helped to boost group turnover but both made underwriting losses of DM625m. The underwriting figures were offset by a near-doubling in other income to DM3.56bn, The main factors behind this were a DM929m contribution from Fireman's Fund and extraordinary income of DM484m arising from the restructuring of interests in Austria. The shares fell by DM62 to close at DM1955. The dividend is to be maintained at DM13.50 per share. Lex, Page 18</p>

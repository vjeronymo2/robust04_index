			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the CONTACT news agency, Georgian head  of state Eduard Shevardnadze met Muhammad Valavi, the head of  the International Monetary Fund mission, and experts of the  mission today, 8 April. The meeting was attended by Deputy  Prime Minister Teimuraz Bassilia, Finance Minister Davit  Iakobidze and National Bank President Nodar Javakhishvili.    In a way it was a summing-up meeting because the mission has  completed the first, initial stage of its work in Georgia.  Mission members have had meetings with members of the Georgian  Government and representatives of various spheres. They have  familiarized themselves with the economic situation in the  country.    The head of the IMF mission said that the situation in  Georgia is far more complicated than he had expected. He  emphasized difficulties in the financial and credit spheres,  difficulties due to the local and national budget deficit, and  impetuous devaluation of coupons. In his opinion, steps to make  the credit system stricter and to privatize the agricultural  sector should be considered of primary importance because these  are areas that are capable of creating the most positive effect.    There have been a lot of cases of hyperinflation in the  world  but the people have regarded this rationally. Normally, the  population understands the difficulties of the country and makes  them part of their life. The head of state said that we [the  Georgian population] are well aware of the difficult situation  in the country. The country's economy is paralyzed, and because  of the combat operations carried out during the past two years  transport is virtually useless. The Georgian head of state said  that the Georgian party would certainly implement  recommendations suggested by the IMF.    In conclusion, the head of the mission said that the current  situation in Georgia is not hopeless and it is necessary that  the first steps be taken. He also said he was happy that  progress had been achieved at the Abkhazian-Georgian  negotiations and hoped this would become a basis for the  stabilization of the economic and political situation in Georgia.</p>

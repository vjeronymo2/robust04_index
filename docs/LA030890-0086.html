Torres had  rejected the agency's offer of $210,000 for her 8,000-square-foot lot on  Wheeler Avenue. Wingard, who was asking $800,000 for his 7,500-square-foot  property on Second Avenue, had rejected the agency's latest offer of about  $265,000.  </P> <P> The agency, which has condemned three other properties west of Second Avenue  since December, plans to develop a commercial center at the site.  </P></p>

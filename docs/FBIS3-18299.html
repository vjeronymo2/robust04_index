			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "The Framework Drawn Up by Ciller </F> and Denktas"--punctuation as published]    [Text] TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President  Rauf Denktas received us yesterday morning. He seemed rather  pleased with the outcome of his visit to Ankara. It was obvious  that Prime Minister Ciller's statement to the True Path Party  parliamentary group meeting two days ago that "the principle of  the TRNC's political equality and sovereignty will not be  abandoned" came as a relief to Denktas. He said: "Prime  Minister Ciller's statement has given us courage." Making no  effort to conceal his admiration, Denktas added: "I have  observed that Prime Minister Ciller maintains a very positive  approach to the Cyprus problem. She has taken up the issue  seriously and she knows the content of her file on the problem."    Denktas is convinced that he has removed Ankara's anxiety  about his approach.... He said: "We have ascertained that we  are no longer regarded as officials who want to create  difficulties. Officials in Ankara are now far more aware of our  difficulties in the negotiating process."    Those remarks highlighted the most important outcome of  Denktas' visit to Ankara. Let us explain: The visit removed  the mutual anxiety of the two sides and renewed the confidence  between them for the future... Within that framework, Ankara  received a guarantee from Denktas that "he will remain at the  negotiating table and not abandon the talks" despite his anxiety  and his not trusting the new process. In return, Denktas  received a guarantee from Turkey that Ankara would maintain a  "steadfast approach" and support him on the problems he may  encounter when the talks begin.    Denktas explained the possible problems during the meeting  called by President Suleyman Demirel in the presidential palace  on Monday evening [21 February]. Each time he mentioned a  problem, he asked whether Ankara would support him if he adopted  this or that approach. For example, he asked: "Will Ankara  support me in having a particular number of TRNC citizens settle  in Maras [Varosha] when that area is transferred to the Greek  Cypriots?"    Denktas received a "yes" to all his questions.    The "yes" given to Denktas' question on the transfer of  Maras  within the framework of the UN package on confidence-building  measures was the most important of all. Denktas' question was  related to the UN view that "the opening of Nicosia Airport will  take time. So let us not delay the transfer of Maras until  Nicosia Airport can be opened. Transfer Maras to the UN  officials and issues relating to the airport can be resolved  later."    Denktas was relieved when Ankara promised to maintain a  "steadfast approach" toward the simultaneous settlement of the  two issues.    Denktas' visit to Ankara has revealed a striking reality:  Each and every technical issue in the package of  confidence-building measures is directly linked with the two  sides' basic views on the essence of the problem. Therefore,  they must unavoidably move out of the framework of the  minipackage and take up the main problem.    Considering that, Denktas outlined his anxiety and asked  several questions in Ankara, questions that may create a  deadlock in the negotiating process at any time. They are as  follows:    a. What will be the nature of the administration established  in Maras when it is placed under UN jurisdiction?    b. How will the sides share authority in the law courts that  will be established?    c. What will the TRNC citizens use as passports or travel  documents when they wish to fly out from Nicosia Airport, that  is, when the airport is opened for the use of the two sides?    Denktas' questions enabled the officials in Ankara to better  understand his problems in the negotiating process. He made an  important request in connection with the possibility that the UN  officials might adopt an approach in favor of the Greek Cypriot  side when the talks begin. He asked that Ankara should move to  contact the countries concerned, the United States in  particular, to establish a balance.    What remains to be done is for Prime Minister Ciller to move  to effectively explain to the high-level officials in the United  States every issue on which she and Denktas have agreed.</p>

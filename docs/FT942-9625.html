			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney hopes to seal debt shake-up next week Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, hopes next week to call an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to approve the terms of its FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn) emergency financial restructuring package. The meeting, which is expected to be held in a month's time, will mark the start of the final stage of completing the complex rescue deal. Euro Disney's shareholders will be asked to endorse proposals to stage a FFr6bn rights issue, which forms the core of the restructuring package. If all goes well the details of the rights issue will be announced a few days after the meeting. The issue is scheduled for completion in mid-July, enabling Euro Disney to complete its restructuring before the French summer holiday in August. Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, has promised to take up its full entitlement of the rights issue. A number of the banks in Euro Disney's 61-strong loan syndicates have agreed to underwrite the remaining 51 per cent of the shares. Euro Disney last week took the tactical step of extending to shareholders an offer of warrants to buy shares at FFr40.00 for 10 years. The offer was initially available only to Walt Disney and the banks. The extension was interpreted by analysts as an attempt to placate the ordinary shareholders. However, the group announced it was reducing the par value of its shares to FFr5.00 from FFr10.00. This sparked speculation that the rights issue would be deeply discounted, raising the risk that ordinary shareholders (many of whom have incurred heavy losses on their Euro Disney shares) would face heavy dilution because of the issue. Euro Disney, which is advised by S G Warburg in London, had hoped to hold the EGM at an earlier date and to complete the rights issue by the end of June. However, persuading all its banks to agree to the restructuring took longer than expected. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez, joint leaders of the syndicates, have for months been in negotiations with the other lenders. Some of the smaller banks have taken an unexpectedly tough stance causing a delay in the completion of the deal.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Temporary reprieve for sterling CALM RETURNED to the financial markets yesterday as the pound enjoyed a temporary respite and a survey provided a glimmer of hope for economic recovery. A survey of almost 9,000 companies by the British Chambers of Commerce found that the economic trend 'remained towards a slow and lasting recovery' although the BCC warned that it would take little to knock the upturn off course. Sterling finished half a pfennig higher at DM2.8375 in London - boosted mainly by technical factors but buoyed also by the government's announcement on Wednesday of tighter controls on spending - while in New York it closed at DM2.8426. However, a rise in Spain's key interest rate yesterday to 13 per cent from 12.4 per cent means that sterling's woes may not be over. The move by the Bank of Spain leaves Britain as one of the few members of the European monetary system which has not tightened monetary policy in the wake of last week's rise in the German discount rate. Labour stepped up its criticism on the planned changes to the public spending round, accusing the government of trying to use them to distract from the impact on spending of continuing economic stagnation. Opposition spokesmen promised a detailed and sustained attack as they warned that, despite Tory election pledges, public services would be 'sacrificed on the altar of their own economic incompetence'. The Engineering Employers Federation revised downwards sharply its forecasts for UK growth this year and 1993 amid reduced expectations for UK and world recovery. An update to the EEF's engineering economic trends series confirmed that engineering output had stopped falling but pushed back by about six months the expected start of its recovery. However, share prices closed firmer with Boots' price rising 4 per cent after an optimistic trading statement from Sir Christopher Benson, chairman of the diversified retailing group.

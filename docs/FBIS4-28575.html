			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Facing the Events That Flare Up To Turn Into </F> Issues"]    [Text] In the remaining years of the first 25-year  long-term development master plan (PJP I) it was predicted that  the challenges and dynamics that Indonesia faces under the  second 25-year long term development plan (PJP II) will not be  totally the same as those it encountered under PJP I. The  people's aspirations also will change. The prediction proved to  be quite true because we recently saw the emergence of several  events on the national scene.    To cite an example, a series of events took place over the  last two months. These events, which eventually turned into  national issues, were putting us under a kind of pressure and  were also worrisome. As a matter of fact, they can disrupt  national unity and cohesion. Nobody seemed to know the  perpetrators of the events or what their objectives were.  However, it is apparent that these events are destructive to  the people, the public order, and the country if they are not  completely prevented from turning into sensitive issues.    The allegation that the government was planning to shorten  the retirement age for civil servants and to replace the  leadership of the Functional Group faction in the House of  Representatives were among the several issues that cropped up.  The government formally had put an end to such rumors. The  other issues concerned the liquidation of the Summa Bank's  assets, the unpaid bank loans by 50 conglomerate companies, and  the wish by professionals to create the ICKI [Association of  Indonesian Nationalist Intellectuals]. The people who were  involved in these issues were clamoring for support from  President Suharto. The ICKI was dissolved even before it  materialized.    Prior to the press briefing by Murdiono, minister/state  secretary, on the extension of General Feisal Tanjung's service  as the commander of the Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces  [ABRI], all sorts of speculation about the armed forces' top  leadership were made by ABRI personnel at headquarters in  Cilangkap. The unpleasant issue spreading at that time was that  the ABRI is divided into factions. This is a very dangerous  issue.    The above-mentioned issues were only those that the public  could gain access to through mass media reports. These did not  include the rumors and gossip that spread nationwide about the  mass protests and demonstrations taking place here and there in  the country. Such issues are worrisome. If they are not  immediately resolved, they can disrupt the national stability  that we thus far have struggled very hard to achieve.    It is not easy to know for sure the causes that led to the  recent flare up of issues in the country. A special in-depth  study of events is required to determine the causes. If we base  our theory on the experience of several developing countries,  such issues normally flare up when several existing institutions  remain frozen, their functions are reduced, or they become  defunct. Some institutions were granted a status quo position.  As a matter of fact, all kinds of gossip and rumors became the  daily menu [preceding word in English] while politicians were  still facing obstacles in their efforts to reach a consensus to  resolve the issues constitutionally.    It is possible for issues to develop when the bureaucracy is  obviously inefficient and is bogged down with the inability to  make collective decisions on state matters. In a situation  where there is no full guarantee for human rights protection and  when economic disparity is widening, there will be more  opportunities for the people to spread rumors about anything and  everything.    Generally, such a situation only will benefit a group of  people such as those with a specific political ideology, "the  annoyed people's front", and other movements that reject  establishment.    On the other hand, the rapid social development and the  advancement of modern science and technology, which is affected  by the currents of globalization, will add greater dynamism to  the unsteady situation. We will see the emergence of a period  of transition or national instability in this situation.  Usually such a period also will provide the opportunity for  several issues to develop. Ironically, they attract the  people's attention.    As we already know, our entry into the PJP II simultaneously  marked the beginning of the take-off process in our efforts to  upgrade the quality of our people from a developing agrarian  society to a modern and industrialized society. The process of  ugrading our society can also be called the transitional period.  Several kinds of issues always spread in a transitional period.    The matter to be decided now is, on one hand, the effort to  create concrete measures to be taken to prevent the conflicting  issues from spreading; and, on the other, to prevent the people  from being trapped by such issues.    Edi Sudrajat, minister of defense and security, has stressed  repeatedly the significance of upholding the very foundation of  the unitary republic and the need for the people to fully  understand nationalism in the Republic of Indonesia, which has  been handed down by the founders of the republic. This is  important regarding the idea that Indonesia will be a strong  country if all the various components that make up the nation  are strong. The modernization trend can cause a nation that is  not very strong to stumble into the process of disintegration  and it finally will divide the nation and create disunity among  the people.</p>

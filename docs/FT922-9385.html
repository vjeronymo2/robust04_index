			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Followers of Nasser form new party: Surprise as Egyptian 'opposition' party is sanctioned by court WITHOUT any fanfare, a political party bearing the name of Egypt's late President Gamal Abdel Nasser has been quietly reconstituted in Egypt, but commentators doubt it will become a force in the land. Mohammed Sayed Ahmed, a columnist for the daily Al Ahram, said the decision of an Egyptian court to sanction a Nasserite party after years of rebuffs, reflected a desire by the government to extend Egypt's democratic base in the almost certain knowledge that the new party would not pose a serious challenge to the established order. 'The authorities no longer see it as a liability to have Nasserism as a symbol of opposition,' said Mr Sayed Ahmed. 'Rather, they view the secular Nasserites as a potential asset at a time when the religious trend is gaining momentum.' While the memory of Egypt's late president, who became a towering figure in the Arab and developing world until he was diminished by the Arabs' calamitous defeat in the 1967 war with Israel, remains strong at home, his socialist-era rule from 1952-1970 is generally regarded to have been deeply flawed, and to have contributed to many of Egypt's present ills. Mona Makram Ebeid, an independent member of Egypt's parliament and a sociology professor at the American University in Cairo, said the Nasserites, to be known as the Arab Democratic Nasserist party (ADN), may attract a 'nostalgia' vote, but doubted the party would become a rallying point for disaffection. 'They have yet to put their house in order,' she said. 'They don't have a charismatic leader, and their programme is still nebulous. One gets the impression that they were surprised that they were accepted by the court.' The Nasserites may, however, emerge as the main opposition bloc in Egypt's parliament, the 454-seat People's Assembly, dominated by the National Democratic Party with 348 seats. At present the leftist Tugammu, or National Unionist Progressive Party, with just six seats constitutes the only organised opposition. The remainder are independents, some of whom might join the Nasserites. Egypt's November, 1990, elections were boycotted by established organisations such as the nationalist Wafd party, the Moslem Brotherhood, the Socialist Labour Party and the Liberals. The main opposition groupings said they boycotted the poll because they could not be sure it would be free and fair. Mohammed Faik, a former information minister under Nasser and one of the leaders of the ADN, insisted this week that the party did not represent an 'idolisation' of Nasser. Rather, it wanted to use his legacy to promote Arab unity and the 'excellent ideal of independent development. 'Nasserism is not a reactionary movement, it's not a theory, nor does it mean a hero-worshipping,' he declared. 'It's just an experience affiliated to Nasser ..'</p>

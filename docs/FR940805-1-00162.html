			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA has ad authority, under a demonstration program that has been extended several times, to assess civil penalties not to exceed $50,000 for certain violations of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. App. 1301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (FAAct), the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Parts 1&hyph;199), and other statutes and orders. Before August 26, 1992, the procedures for adjudicating such civil penalties were the same for all persons charged with violations. This authority, for the most part, was temporary and finally expired on July 31, 1992. (Section 905 of the FAAct in effect on July 31, 1992, 49 U.S.C. App. 1475.) The FAA rules adopted to carry out this authority, found in &sect;13.16 and Part 13, Subpart G (14 CFR 13.16 and Part 13 Subpart G), provide an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Department of Transportation (DOT) and for further appeal to the FAA Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 26, 1992, the FAA Civil Penalty Administrative Assessment Act of 1992 (CPAA Act) was enacted (Pub. L. 102&hyph;345, 106 Stat. 923), amending the FAAct. The CPAA Act made permanent the FAA's authority to assess civil penalties in these cases. For violations of the FAR and other provisions occurring on or after the date of enactment, the CPAA Act changed the procedures by which persons acting in the capacity of pilots, flight engineers, mechanics, and repairmen may seek review of civil penalties sought by the FAA. These changes include a hearing before a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ALJ and an appeal to the full NTSB, in place of hearing before a DOT ALJ and an ultimate administrative appeal to the Administrator. In addition, some changes were made to the procedures for assessing civil penalties in cases against other persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A technical amendment to the CPAA Act was enacted on October 31, 1992, by section 208 of the Airport and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement, and Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;581, 106 Stat. 4872). The authority of the FAA to assess civil penalties for violations of sections 901(c) (relating to imparting or conveying false information, generally involving alleged aircraft piracy or other criminal acts) and 901(d) (regarding carriage of weapons) of the FAAact inadvertently was omitted from the CPAA Act. The technical amendment returned this authority to the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At present, the procedures for civil penalty assessment actions are contained in &sect;13.16 and Part 13, Subpart G. To carry out the CPAA Act, a new &sect;13.18 is proposed. That section would set forth new procedures for civil penalty actions against persons acting in the capacity of pilots, flights engineers, mechanics and repairmen. In addition, the FAA proposes to modify current &sect;13.16 to exclude the actions covered under proposed &sect;13.18, and to make other clarifying changes to Part 13. Unless otherwise noted below, all references to the FAAact include the amendments made by the CPAA Act and the technical amendment noted above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the FAA is initiating civil penalty actions against persons acting in the capacity of pilots, flights engineers, mechanics, and repairmen simply by informing the persons charged of the procedures to be used, this notice informs the public generally of how the FAA proposes to implement portions of the CPAA Act. This information will be helpful to the public, particularly to airmen, attorneys who handle these types of cases, and others who may be affected by the revised procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=1 --> DISCUSSION OF PROPOSED RULE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Topic-by-Topic Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Penalty Assessments Against a Person Acting in the Capacity of a Pilot, Flight Engineer, Mechanic, or Repairman <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;13.18(a) would state the statutory authority for assessing a civil penalty against a person acting in the capacity of a pilot, flight engineer, mechanic, or repairman. This authority is discussed further in this preamble under discussion of proposed &sect;13.16(a). Under section 2(c) of the CPAA Act, the revised procedures apply only to violations occurring on or after the date of enactment, August 26, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Interpretation of ``Person Acting in the Capacity'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

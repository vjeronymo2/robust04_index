			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Albania jails five ethnic Greeks for spying Five ethnic Greeks were yesterday jailed for between six and eight years by an Albanian court after being found guilty of spying for Greece and illegal possession of arms. The verdict follows a highly charged trial that has raised tensions between Albania and Greece and will bring a further deterioration in relations between the two countries. However, Greek officials made clear there were no immediate plans to close the border or impose a trade blockade against Albania similar to that in force against Macedonia. The five men are all leading members of Omonia, an Albanian political movement which campaigns for the rights of the country's ethnic minority and has close links to Greece, from where it receives funds. The five were convicted of collaboration with the Greek intelligence service and encouraging secessionist activities among the Greek minority in southern Albania. They were arrested in April following a border raid from Greece in which two Albanian conscripts were killed. Their arrest opened up long-running tensions between the two countries and revived claims by Tirana that Greece had territorial designs in south Albania and by Athens that Albania is persecuting its Greek minority. The five were described by the judge as 'dangerous men who have worked against this country'. Greece tried unsuccessfully to block the trial, claiming it was politically motivated and aimed at discrediting Greek links with the minority. In Athens, the government spokesman, Mr Evangelos Venizelos, called the verdict 'a very strong provocation, outside the bounds of international legal practice and human rights', but said Greece would react 'coolly, decisively and with foresight'. The Greek ambassador to Tirana has been recalled for consultations, and the government will make a formal protest to the United Nations. However, no further measures against Albania were announced, although the spokesman said those already in force - mass expulsions of illegal Albanian immigrants and tighter security along the border - would be 'intensified'. Since the case began on August 15, Greece has targeted Albania's fragile economy, which is the poorest in Europe, in an attempt to have the trial stopped. More than 40,000 illegal Albanian immigrants have been expelled over the past few weeks. Officials in Athens said Greece would also maintain its veto over Ecu35m (Pounds 27.5m) in European Union economic aid to Albania. Wages earned by Albanian workers in Greece are a main source of hard currency to many of the country's households. Last year, total remittances from Albanian emigres was more than Dollars 330m (Pounds 213m) compared with Dollars 125m in visible export earnings. The Greek government is under pressure to take a strong line against Albania ahead of next month's local government elections, which will be the first serious test of the socialist government's popularity since it came to power last October. However, it is reluctant to raise the stakes in the dispute, fearing that the Albanian authorities could retaliate harshly against the ethnic Greek minority.</p>

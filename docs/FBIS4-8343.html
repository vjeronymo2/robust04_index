			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- "If the government  treats us correctly we will never betray it," Stefan Harna, a  deputy from Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority  movement in Slovakia, told journalists today.    Duka-Zolyomi, chairman of the Egyutteles deputies' group,  added that the movement's cooperation with the new government  had been good thus far. Hungarian minority parties had had an  opportunity to participate in the coalition council's talks when  the government's programme was drafted and Hungarian deputies  would therefore support the programme, Harna said.    Harna was reacting to information that some Hungarian  deputies would allegedly not support the programme. Deputy Erno  Rozsa condemned efforts to place Hungarian parties once more in  the role of enemy.    Harna said Hungarian parties, through no fault of their own,  had found themselves in a position in which their votes would  decide the future of the current Slovak Government.    Rozsa noted that the current election law was adequate as it  ensured calling early elections and that there was in fact  nothing to change in it. The law guarantees the right of ethnic  minorities' representatives to enter parliament and defend their  rights.</p>

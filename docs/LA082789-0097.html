			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW PANELS FOR LOCAL CAMPAIGN REFORMS URGED  </P> <P> A bipartisan research group, charging Los Angeles area enforcement officials  with neglect of campaign financing laws, has called for creation of independent  commissions to clean up local politics in "a system drunk with cash."  </P> <P> The California Commission on Campaign Financing proposed separate fair  political practices commissions for Los Angeles County and for many of the 86  cities within its boundaries. And, it said in a report made public today, the  commissions should be given stronger contribution-regulation laws to enforce.  </P> <P> The commission also recommended limiting campaign contributions and  expenditures and providing partial public financing of political campaigns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Study in Extremes'  </P> <P> In an overview, the study concluded, "Local elections in the Los Angeles  metropolitan area are a study in extremes. . . . A wide-ranging mixture of the  exemplary and the excessive, the picture of money and politics in the Los  Angeles area illustrates the best and the worst in local campaign financing."  </P> <P> In some smaller cities, the commission said, candidates raise money from  friends and neighbors, walk precincts, spend minimal amounts and personally  meet many voters.  </P> <P> "But in other Los Angeles area communities, candidates exhibit the worst  excesses of a system drunk with cash," the report said. "They isolate  themselves from the voters, rely on phalanxes of paid political advisers, raise  contributions around the clock, accumulate huge war chests in non-election  years, scare off challengers, solicit contributions from persons with financial  interests pending before them, spend large sums on entertainment, fund raising  and travel and communicate with the public through orchestrated media  campaigns."  </P> <P> The panel, composed mainly of business and legal leaders, compiled a 373-page  report that says "enforcing campaign laws has not been a priority at any level  of government."  </P> <P> At present, local officials are in charge of implementing local laws. The  state's political watchdog agency, the Fair Political Practices Commission,  moves against local officials only when they are suspected of violating state  laws but is powerless to enforce local regulations. District attorneys, city  attorneys and election officials -- those in charge of enforcing local campaign  financing laws -- are reluctant to do so because mayors, city councils and the  Board of Supervisors control their budgets and sometimes hire them, the study  commission said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Same Elected Fraternity'  </P> <P> And even when district and city attorneys are elected, and presumably  independent, they are reluctant to enforce laws because they "are also  politicians, subject to the same restrictions as council members or  supervisors," the report said. "They all belong to the same elected  fraternity."  </P> <P> In particular, the report criticized Los Angeles' elected city attorney, James  K. Hahn, for being "reluctant" to enforce the city's campaign financing law,  especially in the case of campaign finance law and conflict-of-interest  violations by City Councilman Richard Alatorre. Hahn filed a civil suit against  Alatorre only after the political watchdog group Common Cause threatened to go  to court. Hahn's suit resulted in Alatorre paying the largest fine paid for  such a violation in California history -- almost $150,000, which came from his  campaign fund.  </P> <P> Hahn said he disagrees with the commission characterizing him as "reluctant."  </P> <P> He said he first referred the Alatorre matter to Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner because  he feared "a perception" of conflict, since the city attorney is legal adviser  to the council. When Reiner did not take the case, Hahn said his office moved  ahead with it.  </P> <P> And the commission said Los Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez, appointed by  Mayor Tom Bradley and confirmed by the City Council, delayed investigating  allegations of violations against Councilman Robert Farrell and  then-Councilwoman Pat Russell until the statute of limitations had run out.  </P> <P> Martinez said his office was hampered in pursuing the two cases because of a  shortage of auditors and because the statute of limitations for the offense was  too short -- just one year. The commission recommended that the statute of  limitations be extended for such offenses to four years.  </P> <P> The criticism of Hahn came as the city attorney is investigating  conflict-of-interest allegations against the mayor. Some council members have  questioned the intensity of Hahn's investigation of a man who has been an old  political friend, although the city attorney has pledged a tough and impartial  investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Criticized  </P> <P> In addition to Los Angeles, the commission studied Agoura Hills, Gardena,  Pasadena, Santa Monica, Signal Hill and West Covina, as well as Los Angeles  County. It reserved some of its toughest words for the Los Angeles County Board  of Supervisors, saying:  </P> <P> "Nowhere in California does campaign reform appear to be more necessary than in  Los Angeles County. There is, however, little likelihood that the members of  the board will change a campaign financing system that today gives them  political power. Under the circumstances, a constituent-driven ballot  initiative could be an alternative means of implementing campaign finance  reform. Proponents of such an initiative would have to expect, however, that  incumbent supervisors are likely to use their tremendous financial resources to  oppose such reform."  </P> <P> The commission said "one Los Angeles-based lobbyist who regularly appears  before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles City  Council told the commission 'if we did in the smaller cities what we do in the  larger jurisdictions, the officials in the smaller cities would call it  bribery.' "  </P> <P> It added that "the flood of money from business interests to incumbent mayors,  city council members and county supervisors has given many members of the  public the impression that campaign contributions improperly influence votes.  This perception is particularly prevalent concerning developer contributions  and local land use decisions."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County government was cited as an example of that sort of  government.  </P> <P> The county has no laws governing campaign contributions, the report noted,  although its officials are covered by state laws, including Proposition 73 --  which limits contributions and bans transferring funds from one candidate to  another.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incumbent Dominance  </P> <P> "Year-round fund raising and enormous campaign war chests have eliminated  nearly all serious challenges to incumbents, resulting in incumbent dominance  that protects supervisors from criticism and controversy," the report said.  </P> <P> "Supervisors have the resources to spend tremendous sums of money during  elections if necessary; when not challenged, they freely use those resources to  build their political power bases, secure in the knowledge that their campaign  coffers will be refilled when they next appear on the ballot."  </P> <P> Specifically, the commission criticized the big campaign treasury accumulated  by Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who has had no serious opposition. He uses the  money to assist other campaigns.  </P> <P> In a reference to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), a master at  raising money for candidates and causes favorable to him, the report said  Schabarum, "seemingly playing the role of the Willie Brown of local  politicians, has raised the practice of candidate transfers to highly  sophisticated levels, using several political committees to redistribute  thousands of dollars yearly to increase his political clout throughout the  state."  </P> <P> Schabarum press aide Judy Hammond said the supervisor would not comment on the  report until he had a chance to read it.  </P> <P> Supervisors Kenneth Hahn, Deane Dana and Ed Edelman have also accumulated large  sums of money despite little opposition, using it to help other candidates or  to ward off challengers, the report said.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich had to spend his sizable campaign funds in a 1988  reelection campaign against challenger Baxter Ward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influence Issue  </P> <P> The report said that both supervisors and staff members insisted in interviews  that the contributions -- most of them from business -- do not influence  supervisorial decisions.  </P> <P> But the commission said that contributors, insisting on anonymity, told the  commission staff they fear that "they must make contributions if they want  approval for ventures that may require clearance by the Board of Supervisors."  </P> <P> "Those involved in particularly lucrative projects look on their political  contributions as an investment," the report said. "As one contributor  explained, 'They (supervisors) can get you through the internal fiefdoms and  infighting. This can save a developer an incredible amount of money."  </P> <P> As examples of instances where campaign contributions helped, the report cited  supervisorial approval of a huge proposed development started by the late  Howard Hughes' Summa Corp. south of Marina del Rey and expansion of development  in Malibu.  </P> <P> In past news reports of those controversies, supervisors and their aides have  denied contributor influence.  </P> <P> The commission also blamed contributions to incumbents, and the one-sided  politics produced by such a system, for low voter interest in no-contest races.  </P> <P> "Fund raising and spending of this magnitude has suppressed electoral  competition, enhanced the appearance of corruption and left many voters  disinterested and apathetic," the report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loopholes in Law  </P> <P> For Los Angeles city, the commission noted that voters had passed a strong  campaign financing law, limiting contributions, in 1985, but "loopholes and  other problems have compromised the law's effectiveness."  </P> <P> The report also noted that the law has not prevented the influence of big  business givers because of the practice known as "bundling."  </P> <P> "Former large contributors can still solicit contributions from others and then  convey them to the candidate in a 'bundle,' thereby retaining the appearance of  special interest influence despite the new law," the report said.  </P> <P> The report also noted that several employees of companies doing business with  the city join in supporting a candidate, providing a bundle of money from a  single company.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Clerk Martinez said he supports the recommendation to put  enforcement of local laws into the hands of an independent commission.  </P> <P> "It is very difficult for the city clerk to enforce these laws," he said. "The  city clerks are put in a tough position when they have to fine council members.  I fined a couple of council members and those kinds of things do not endear you  to council members who determine your pay. It definitely impacted on me on my  merit pay. . . . I would not miss being the enforcement officer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hahn Backs Idea  </P> <P> City Atty. Hahn also backed the idea of an independent commission. "The key is  adequate staffing (for the commission)," Hahn said. "It is an expense. The  taxpayers will not be thrilled. But it is an expense that has to be paid."  </P> <P> The commission that completed the report was founded in 1984 to study and make  recommendations on California's campaign financing system. This study was  funded by the John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation.  </P> <P> The panel's co-chairmen are Cornell Maier, retired chairman and chief executive  officer of Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp.; Rocco Siciliano, retired  chairman of Ticor, Los Angeles, and Francis Wheat, former commissioner of the  Securities and Exchange Commission. The executive director is Tracy Westen and  the co-director and general counsel is Robert M. Stern.  </P> <P> Commission members include former Rep. Clair W. Burgener, a member of the UC  Board of Regents; former Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, chairman  of the Los Angeles law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers; Robert R. Dockson,  chairman of California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn.; Walter B. Gerken,  chairman of the executive committee of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.;  former Caltech President Marvin L. Goldberger, director of the Institute for  Advanced Study at Princeton University; Stafford R. Grady, retired chairman of  Lloyds Bank of California; Neil E. Harlan, retired chairman of the McKesson  Corp.; Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.; Aileen C.  Hernandez, former member of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;  Ivan J. Houston, chairman of Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Co.; Los  Angeles attorney Michael Kantor; Stanford University President Donald Kennedy;  Sunset magazine Publisher Melvin B. Lane; former Assembly Speaker Robert T.  Monagan; Luis Nogales, former chairman of the Mexican American Legal Defense  and Educational Fund, Los Angeles; UCLA Law School dean Susan Westerberg  Prager; retired California Supreme Court Justice Frank K. Richardson; William  R. Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County  Federation of Labor; Cal State Los Angeles President James M. Rosser;  California Chamber of Commerce President Peter F. Scott; Jean R. Wente,  chairman of Wente Bros. Winery, and former state Bar President Samuel L.  Williams.  </P> <P> The report notes that Burgener, Hawley, Hernandez, Nogales, Richardson and  Rosser joined the commission after the current study was substantially  completed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SPENDING BY JURISDICTION  </P> <P> The average and total candidate expenditures for selected Los Angeles-area  jurisdictions.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hiroshima, April 13 KYODO -- The Japan Atomic  Industrial Forum began its annual meeting Wednesday [13 April]  in Hiroshima, the first time it has been held in the world's  first atomic-bombed city.    The three-day meeting has as its theme "toward a world free  of nuclear weapons, the role of peaceful use." It will feature  addresses on Wednesday by Hans Blix, director general of the  International Atomic Energy Agency, and Pulitzer Prize-winning  author Richard Rhodes.    This year for the first time, at a Wednesday panel  discussion, the meeting will deal with the problems of  dismantling nuclear weapons.    On Thursday, atomic power advocates are scheduled to meet  with citizens of Hiroshima and victims of the 1945 atomic  bombing, including the head of an association of Korean victims  of the nuclear holocaust, Yi Sil-gun [name as received], for an  exchange of opinions.    Some 1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad  are  expected to take part in the symposium, which has been held  annually since 1968.</p>

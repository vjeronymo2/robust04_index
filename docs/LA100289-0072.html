			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BILL SEEN AS REDUNDANT;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF UTILITY MERGER VETOED  </P> <P> A bill that would require the state Public Utilities Commission to perform an  environmental impact report on the proposed merger of Southern California  Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric was vetoed Sunday by Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he was killing the measure by Sen. Wadie A. Deddeh (D-Bonita)  because it was unnecessary. He said the PUC has already recognized that the  merger needs to be subject to an environmental study, and preparations are  under way for that review.  </P> <P> In addition, Deukmejian noted that the PUC has designated both the City and  County of San Diego, avowed opponents of the merger, as two of the governmental  agencies that will be asked to help draft the report.  </P> <P> Enacting Deddeh's bill, the governor said, would "introduce uncertainty and  confusion into the ongoing (environmental study) preparation process."  </P></p>

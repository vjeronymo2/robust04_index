			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HALF-CENT TRANSIT TAX BALLOT MEASURE OKD  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisors on Tuesday authorized a Nov. 6 ballot measure  that would raise the sales tax by a half-cent for public transit projects,  despite a measure seeking more money for jails.  </P> <P> If approved, the two measures would be in conflict because the sales tax would  exceed the 7 1/4% cap imposed by the Legislature.  </P> <P> The tax is now 6 3/4%, leaving only a half-cent increase available. To solve  the problem, the Legislature last week approved a measure allowing the jails  and the transit sector to share the new revenue on a quarter-cent basis.  </P> <P> The transportation measure is known as the Anti-Gridlock Transit Improvement  Fund. It would raise about $400 million a year, which could be designated for  improved public transit. The competing measure would raise a similar sum for  construction and operation of jails.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Padraic Flanagan, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] A high-ranking Iranian diplomat has been ordered out  of Britain after a top-level meeting with the Foreign Office, it  was disclosed today. The expulsion order is the latest in a  series of rows between the two countries.    Iran's charge d'affaires Gholamreza Ansari was told of the  decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see  Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg, according to THE  GUARDIAN newspaper.    The Foreign Office refused to comment on the expulsion, but  officials confirmed the meeting took place.    The expulsion follows a row over British charges that the  Iranian intelligence services had been in contact with the IRA.  Tehran denied the charge and claimed that Britain had bugged  its London embassy.    Relations between Britain and Iran have been strained since  the Islamic revolution in 1979. Ties between the two countries  were severed in 1989 over the Salman Rushdie affair, when  Iranian religious leaders issued a fatwa [Islamic legal ruling]  calling for the killing of the author. But links were restored  the following year.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Narrow gain reflects grim jobless data Wall Street US STOCK markets struggled to stay in positive territory yesterday in the face of computer program selling and some bad news on the jobs market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.79 at 3,256.81. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.60 at 436.09, while the Amex composite was 0.78 higher at 406.36. The Nasdaq composite faltered after a strong morning session, and ended only 0.87 higher at 701.64, another record close. Trading volume on the New York SE was 294m shares. The day's economic news was, however, distinctly mixed. Jobless claims rose 17,000 in the first full week of January, a bigger increase than expected. It was the second big jump in claims in consecutive weeks, and an indication that the economic recovery is not feeding through into the still depressed labour market. On a brighter note, December housing starts rose 5.5 per cent. Analysts had forecast a much smaller rise. It was the largest monthly increase in housing starts in more than a year, and contributed to the market's early gains. Prices soon fell back, partly under pressure from mid-morning sell programs. The political background was gloomy. The news that President Clinton's choice for attorney general had been forced to withdraw her nomination meant that the new president's term had got off to a rocky start. Among individual stocks, steel companies were in strong demand on the news of industry-wide steel price rises. LTV was the most active stock, rising Dollars  7/16 to Dollars 1 1/8 in volume of 9m shares, followed by Bethlehem Steel, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 19 1/8 , Inland Steel, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 24 1/8 , USX, up Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 37 7/8 , and General Steel, Dollars 1 3/8 firmer at Dollars 13 3/4 . Motor stocks posted solid gains on active buying. Chrysler, the star performer of the sector in recent months, jumped another Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 , Ford added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 48 and General Motors firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 . Ralston Purina climbed Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 49 5/8 after the company reported fiscal first quarter operating income of Dollars 1.26 a share, up from Dollars 1.14 a share a year earlier. Investors were also cheered by the news that the company plans to spin-off its Continental Baking unit. On the Nasdaq market, Software Publishing jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 in volume of 3.4m shares after the company reported quarterly profits well in excess of market forecasts. Canada TORONTO stock prices ended mixed. The composite index was up 0.22 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 3275.97, declines topping advances 339 to 291. Volume climbed to 44,816,000 shares compared with Thursday's 41,707,000 shares. The index fell 30.6 points or 0.9 per cent on the week.</p>

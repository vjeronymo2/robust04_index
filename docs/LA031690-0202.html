			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FDA TO BAN SULFITES ON POTATOES, CITES 4 ALLERGY-RELATED DEATHS  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it will extend a ban on the use  of sulfites to include fresh potatoes because of severe allergic reactions to  the preservative, including four deaths.  </P> <P> The FDA banned use of sulfites on fruit and produce on salad bars in 1986, but  potatoes were excluded from the ban.  </P> <P> After strong industry lobbying, the FDA decided to study further whether the  ban should extend to potatoes.  </P> <P> An industry spokesman said the ban would have little impact on consumers but  would hurt many businesses that prepare potatoes for use in restaurants.  </P> <P> The agency said it has received nearly 1,000 complaints of adverse reactions to  sulfites since 1985.  </P> <P> Most of the reported reactions were mild, including dizziness, cramps or  wheezing. But, occasionally, reactions can cause breathing difficulty that can  lead to death.  </P> <P> Four deaths have been reported after consumption of sulfite-treated potatoes,  the FDA said.  </P> <P> Up to a million asthmatics may be sensitive to sulfites, the agency said.  </P> <P> The new ban, published in Thursday's Federal Register, will go into effect in  30 days.  </P> <P> Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest applauded  the ban on sulfite-treated potatoes, saying it was "long overdue and indicative  of a new outlook on these types of problems" by the federal government.  </P> <P> Sulfites are used on peeled potatoes to keep them white and firm. The  preservative usually is added after potatoes are cut up for distribution to  fast food and other restaurants.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OAK TREE;  </P> <P> TODAY'S CARD A MARATHON SESSION  </P> <P> Today isn't a day for faint-hearted horseplayers at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> There will be 14 races on which to wager, beginning with the seven Breeders'  Cup events at 10:55 a.m. After the Breeders' Cup Classic, there will be seven  races run locally.  </P> <P> The feature, which will be run as the 13th race, is the $84,600 Morvich  Handicap at 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf.  </P> <P> Oraibi is the probable favorite in the Morvich, which has attracted 10 other  starters.  </P> <P> Third in the Legend's Last Ride in February, Oraibi was injured in the race and  went to stud for a time at agent Tony Matos' farm in Llano. Oraibi, trained by  Richard Mandella, has won six of his 18 starts, but only one of his victories  has been on the turf.  </P> <P> Still, he has never been worse than third on the grass and he was second to  Shirkee in his comeback two weeks ago on the course. Julio Garcia will ride  Oraibi, who is the high weight at 118 pounds.  </P> <P> Other probable contenders in the Morvich include Frost Free, Snipledo, Robyn  Dancer, Doyouseewhatisee and Sam Who.  </P> <P> The beaten favorite in the Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap at Bay Meadows last  month, Frost Free will be looking for his second victory in three turf starts  for trainer John Sadler. The gelded son of It's Freezing worked six furlongs in  1:12 4/5 Sunday and Jorge Velasquez has the mount.  </P> <P> Snipledo's six-race winning streak ended when he ran fifth in the Ancient Title  Handicap and he will be making his grass debut. Robyn Dancer is a late threat  who was fourth behind Oraibi two Saturdays ago, Doyouseewhatisee handled a  lesser field on the layout Oct. 4 and Sam Who is trying to remember how he used  to do it. A starter in the Breeders' Cup Sprint last year, he is winless in  seven 1990 starts and has been the beaten choice four times.  </P> <P> Others scheduled to go include Go On In, Gallant Sailor, Yes I'm Blue, Sulaymi  and Waterscape.  </P> <P> Stylish Star, who won the Autumn Days Handicap on opening day, heads a field of  12 fillies and mares in Sunday's $114,600 Louis R. Rowan Handicap at a mile on  the turf.  </P> <P> Stylish Star, a four-year-old, ended a six-race losing streak with her  come-from-behind victory in the Autumn Days. Her last two successes have been  at 6 1/2 furlongs, but she has won around two turns. Eddie Delahoussaye rides  for trainer Dan Hendricks.  </P> <P> Oeilladine, who didn't have clear sailing when third behind Sweet Roberta and  Brown Bess in the California Jockey Club at Bay Meadows three weeks ago, is the  filly to beat. She has won two of four starts on the Santa Anita grass and is  reunited with Gary Stevens, who was aboard for both of those victories.  </P> <P> The other Rowan entrants are Baba Cool, who won the race last year, Polar Bird,  Estrella Fuega, Mystical Lass, Petalia, Spectacular Face, Kikala, Something  Comfy, Chispa Brava and Island Jamboree.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Gates will open at 8 a.m. at Santa Anita. . . . Favored Sexy Slew easily won  the $61,250 Dark Star Handicap Friday at Santa Anita. Ridden by Kent Desormeaux  and trained by David Hofmans, she defeated Tis Juliet and four other fillies  and mares, covering the seven furlongs in 1:21 2/5.  </P></p>

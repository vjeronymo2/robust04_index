			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Recommendations of the Public-Sector Pay Review Bodies: Award 'greater than contemplated' - Teachers A SUBSTANTIAL pay rise for teachers has been on the cards since Mr John Major appointed an independent review body to assess their pay shortly after becoming prime minister. It was a calculated attempt to raise teachers' morale - and with it the Tories' flagging support in the public sector. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, admitted yesterday that the 7.5 per cent award to the 420,000 teachers in England and Wales was 'greater than the government had contemplated'. But ministers had pledged to honour the review body's findings in full, and with the rise due to take effect on April 1 - a week before the most likely election date - staggering its implementation was not an option. The rise takes the low on the teachers' scale from Pounds 10,404 to Pounds 11,184, and the top point from Pounds 17,523 to Pounds 18,837 plus allowances. A good honours graduate will start on at least Pounds 12,300 - Pounds 14,200 in inner London. The top of the head-teachers' scale - for heads of large secondary schools - rises from Pounds 46,680 to Pounds 50,181. Primary teachers do best in the settlement. An additional 26,000 incentive allowances - more than one extra per school - will be available from September, worth between Pounds 1,296 and Pounds 4,000 each. By then, more than half of all teachers will be receiving an allowance. Incentive allowances are to be payable not only for special responsibility but for 'excellent classroom performance'. That apart, the review body, chaired by Sir Graham Day, chairman of British Aerospace, has refused to rush the creation of a full-blown performance-pay regime for teachers. However, with one in three teachers leaving the profession in their first five years, the review body said it was 'concerned to avert complacency on teacher quality', and it intends to work up a performance-pay scheme for introduction in 1993-94. The settlement will add 7.8 per cent to the teachers' pay bill, which local authorities will have to meet. The government announced yesterday that it would provide local government with an extra Pounds 60m to bridge the gap between the pay settlement and the government's 7.2 per cent allowance for extra education spending in the 1992-93 rate-support grant settlement. However, local authority leaders claimed that the 7.2 per cent allowed only for only 3.7 per cent of extra spending, once last year's pay award and demographic trends are accounted for. Most authorities - which have to set budgets before the end of this month. - have allowed only between 5 and 6 per cent in their provisional spending plans. Some county councils will make up the shortfall from reserves. But with average county council reserves projected at only 3.3 per cent of budgeted spending for the next financial year, many will be forced to seek savings elsewhere. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities claimed yesterday that the 'funding gap' amounted to Pounds 300m, and predicted cuts in teacher numbers and school budgets. Even with the pay rise, the review body concluded that 'teacher shortages are more likely than surpluses' in the next few years, and that high wastage rates were likely to result in 'serious teacher shortages in some areas.'

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Political asylum requests halved under tougher British controls THE number of people applying for political asylum in Britain has dropped by more than half this year as tougher Home Office screening controls start to bite. Officials believe that the latest statistics suggest a significant proportion of last year's record 44,743 applications for asylum may have reflected bogus requests. This is because people requesting asylum, most of whom are already in the country, have been required since the end of last year to go in person to the Home Office asylum division in Croydon, rather than apply by post. Potential asylum seekers may also have been deterred from applying by Britain's tougher public stance on the issue. The fall is to an average 1,730 applications a month in the first three months compared with an average 3,730 last year. It is in sharp contrast to the experience of other European countries such as Germany which are continuing to experience growing inflows. A total of 35,000 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany alone in March. Based on current trends, this is almost twice as many as are likely to register in the UK during the whole of this year. The Home Office figures are likely to take the heat out of the debate over immigration when the much-criticised Asylum Bill is re-introduced for parliamentary scrutiny after the Queen's Speech on May 6. The government postponed the bill by withdrawing it from the committee stage in the House of Lords two months ago. The legislation is due to be resubmitted to parliament either in the summer or in the autumn. It will embody amendments which were made during its passage through the Commons this year. The government and refugee organisations such as Amnesty International have been pointing for months to the problem of multiple applications. Individual foreigners have been completing several asylum forms in different names. Asylum seekers receive social security benefits as soon as their application form has been officially lodged, giving them the chance of fraudulently drawing extra benefits. The average time for an application to be processed has been 14 months, longer if appeals are involved. Amnesty International has criticised the government in the past for not channelling more resources towards processing asylum applications. The Home Office has responded by stepping up recruitment and training. The asylum division now has 550 staff, compared with just 50 in 1988. It now spends Pounds 10m a year on processing requests, against only Pounds 1.7m two years ago. Extra resources have allowed more rapid handling of outstanding applications. Decisions were taken on a total of 6,329 applications in the first three months of the year. The government, however, believes it will still take several years to clear the backlog of around 60,000 undecided asylum cases inherited from previous years. Editorial comment, Page 12</p>

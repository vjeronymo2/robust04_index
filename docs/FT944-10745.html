			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Anglian Water rises 20% but sector falls Anglian Water yesterday announced a 20 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 120.6m and declared a 9.6 per cent increase in its dividend from 7.3p to 8p. In spite of the announcement, water shares closed 2 per cent lower yesterday. This contrasts with the reaction last week when Thames Water's surprise 11 per cent dividend increase left the sector 2 per cent higher. The market interpreted Thames's action as a signal to increase dividend expectations for the sector. 'It is not surprising that the sector is now weak,' said Mr Bill Dale of SG Warburg. 'Expectations ran wild after Thames's results.' Anglian said it had increased the dividend in line with its underlying earnings improvement. The headline profits advance had been helped by a Pounds 10.3m reduction in the provision for water and sewerage pipeline maintenance to Pounds 9.8m. Turnover was 5 per cent higher at Pounds 358.3m, against Pounds 341.4m when pre-tax profits were Pounds 100.5m. Earnings per share for the half year to September 30 rose from 32.2p to 38.7p. Mr Alan Smith, managing director, said Anglian was confident it would be able to maintain real dividend growth under the new five-year pricing regime set by the industry regulator in July. Customers would also benefit, he said, with an extra Pounds 8m to be devoted to issues such as low water pressure, sewer flooding and cleaning up estuaries. This funding was in addition to the Pounds 154m invested in the first half and Pounds 170m already budgeted for the latter part of the year. Anglian said operating costs had been held at Pounds 174m (Pounds 173m) through tight spending controls and other efficiencies in the regulated business. The regulated business improved operating profits by 18 per cent to Pounds 139.5m (Pounds 118.7m) on sales 5.4 per cent higher at Pounds 315.5m (Pounds 299.3m). Losses in Anglian's two main non-regulated businesses rose from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 1.6m. Mr Smith said this was due to marketing and research and development costs. The process engineering business was expected to return to profit in the second half. COMMENT After the brief excitement sparked by Thames, the water sector has returned to earth with Anglian's results. The company's emphasis on a dividend increase backed by similar underlying growth could be seen as a warning not to expect too much under the new pricing regime, when earnings are expected to be flat. However, the company may not be as constrained as once thought. The substantial cut in the infrastructure renewals charge has enhanced its cover and its prospects for dividend growth. Anglian is also making noticeable progress on efficiency savings. Nevertheless, the non-core business remains disappointing, Forecasts are for about Pounds 225m this year, with a prospective p/e of 8. There is still little which sets Anglian apart, in a sector depressed by limited exposure to economic upturn and substantial political risk.</p>

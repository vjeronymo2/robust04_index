			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Northern Rock climbs 29% THE Newcastle-based Northern Rock Building Society yesterday announced record annual results with increases of 29 per cent, from Pounds 42.3m to Pounds 54.6m, in pre-tax profits, and from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 4.4bn, in assets. In 1991 the society boosted net profits by 33 per cent to Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 27.5m), and mortgage lending by 45 per cent to Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 814m). The results, which lift the society two places to 11th in the current building society league table, underlined the contrast between the 1991 housing markets in north-east England, the focus of half its business, and in the south-east. Of its 138,000 mortgages, fewer than one fifth are in the south-east, but that region accounted for nearly half of its 515 repossessions last year. The society said that its performance was enhanced both by the relatively low number of repossessions and the opportunity offered by rivals' cutbacks in lending to pick up good quality business. It also highlighted the success of its current and investment accounts, which attracted Pounds 442m (Pounds 237m) in retail receipts. Mr Chris Sharp, managing director, said that strong asset growth coupled to firm cost control had reduced unit costs by 12 per cent; the management/expense ratio fell by 0.21 percentage points to 1.4 per cent. The free capital ratio, at 5.25 per cent, was one of the strongest in the industry, he said. 'In just about the worst housing market since the war, we are reporting our best-ever financial results,' he said. 'While other societies have had to repair the damage being done, we've not been as badly affected, and we've been adroit in both the mortgage and savings markets.'</p>

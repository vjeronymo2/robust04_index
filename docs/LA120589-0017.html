			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY'S SUIT OVER SLAYING IS DISMISSED;  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS: THE CHILD WAS UNBORN WHEN POLICE KILLED HIS BANK-ROBBER FATHER  AND WOUNDED HIS MOTHER. THEREFORE, HE HAS NO LEGAL STANDING TO SUE, A JUDGE  RULES.  </P> <P> John Henry Crumpton IV was a fetus in his mother's womb in 1982 when undercover  Los Angeles police detectives wounded her and killed his father after watching  the couple rob a bank.  </P> <P> On Monday, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson dismissed a lawsuit brought  against the Los Angeles Police Department in behalf of John Crumpton, now 7,  concluding that the boy was unborn at the time of his father's death and thus  had no legal standing to later sue.  </P> <P> The $10-million lawsuit, filed by Crumpton's aunt, alleged that the officers  had violated the boy's civil rights by depriving him of his father.  </P> <P> Wilson, in essence, declined to challenge a narrow body of existing case law,  most notably Roe vs. Wade, in which various courts have held that a fetus is  not a person and, therefore, not entitled to protections under U.S. civil  rights laws. The issue has become a flash point in the national debate over  abortion.  </P> <P> "Whether (they) are correct or incorrect . . . those other cases are  well-reasoned," Wilson said in granting a motion by Assistant City Atty. Jack  L. Brown to throw out the Crumpton case.  </P> <P> The boy sued the Police Department in October, 1988, after The Times published  a series of articles revealing the little-known activities of the LAPD's  Special Investigations Section.  </P> <P> The Times found that teams of well-armed SIS detectives had, for years, tailed  career criminals but often ignored opportunities to prevent armed robberies and  burglaries by legitimately arresting suspects beforehand on lesser crimes or  outstanding warrants. Instead, records showed, the officers routinely stood by  until the suspects they were watching had committed violent crimes. Many  suspects were shot when they returned to their getaway cars.  </P> <P> One of those cases involved John Crumpton III and his wife, Jane Elizabeth  Berry. The couple, both paroled bank robbers, had been linked by witnesses to  five bank robberies and already were wanted on federal felony warrants for  parole violations.  </P> <P> Theoretically, they could have been arrested at any time on the federal  warrants, but because investigators said they could not conclusively link the  couple to the robberies, the SIS was assigned to shadow them. After 18 days of  intermittent surveillance, during which the suspects stole a car, the  detectives in September, 1982, watched Berry and Crumpton don masks and rob a  bank in Burbank.  </P> <P> The detectives confronted the couple at their getaway car. Police reports  contend that both bandits "whirled" toward the officers after being ordered to  put their hands up. Four SIS officers armed with shotguns fired a total of 18  times, striking both Crumpton and Berry repeatedly in the back, records show.  </P> <P> Crumpton was unarmed but was wearing a holster on his belt, which officers said  they mistook for a weapon. Berry had a semiautomatic pistol but it was not  fired.  </P> <P> Berry later pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to state prison. She  will be eligible for parole in 1993 but faces another 44 months in federal  custody for the parole violations.  </P> <P> On Monday, attorney Stephen Yagman, who is representing the Crumpton boy, said  he intends to appeal Wilson's ruling.  </P></p>

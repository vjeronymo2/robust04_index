			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / China spectre stalks HK vote: Simon Holberton previews debate on governor's franchise bill The vote today in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) on Governor Chris Patten's democracy legislation looks likely to be close and both the governor and his opponents will be lobbying undecided members right up to the end. The success or failure of Mr Patten's attempt to broaden the franchise for LegCo's 1995 elections will turn on the votes of one or two of the 60 legislators. 'Whatever the outcome it is not going to be good,' said one of the governor's opponents. The principal threat to Mr Patten's legislation comes from amendments proposed by the Liberal party, a 15-member conservative grouping of mainly appointed politicians, which wants to limit the franchise to Hong Kong's traditional plutocracy. They have attracted independent members of LegCo who point to strong support among the colony's business community. Where Mr Patten wants to enfranchise Hong Kong's 2.3m working population, the Liberals want to restrict the vote to 122,000 businessmen. And where Mr Patten wants an electoral college itself composed of 346 popularly-elected officials, the Liberals favour those elected by a restricted vote. The Liberals and their supporters believe that a bill amended along these lines has a better chance of surviving under Chinese rule than does Mr Patten's. This is in spite of China's threat to annul the result of the 1995 elections when it resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. 'There is no other viable choice,' says Mr Howard Young, the Liberal who will move the party's amendments today. For the governor's part, Mr Patten's advisers tell him that support for his legislation has improved from 26 votes to nearly a majority. 'Our assessment is that we have enough votes to win,' said one official. Mr Patten - who was described yesterday by an official as looking 'baggy-eyed and grim-faced' - has been criticised by some pro-democracy politicians for not trying hard enough to persuade wavering legislators. His aides deny this, pointing to a check list of meetings he has had with undecided LegCo members over the past weeks. 'We are lobbying hard for this bill,' said one aide. 'We are not agnostic about this process.' The outcome of the vote could be decided by a handful of Beijing's supporters in LegCo. In a week when China appears prepared to settle a long-running dispute with Britain about defence lands in Hong Kong and the financing of the colony's new airport, Beijing may just want to show Mr Patten who is boss. China's importance to today's deliberations arises because there is no system of pairing in LegCo. When votes are close, those who abstain have an important impact on the outcome. Beijing, which has three faithful supporters, usually abstains on constitutional matters. The current arithmetic is that if China's supporters do abstain, Mr Patten will win the vote. If they decided to support the Liberals' amendments then the vote could be tied or Mr Patten may lose. Articles in the pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao newspapers yesterday stressed that no matter what LegCo decided today, fresh elections would be held in 1997. Yet, according to Mr Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, voting for the Liberals' amendments was 'the only possible option - if the Liberals are defeated then most probably Mr Patten's bill will go through intact.' China's indirect participation in the vote would make it much more difficult for it to sustain opposition to what LegCo decides. Hitherto China has treated LegCo as an instrument of an illegitimate colonial regime - a mere advisory body, at best.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Conference at Hanminjon Mission in Cuba" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Havana, May 21 [dateline as received] (KCNA) -- A  press conference was held at the mission of the South Korean  National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in Cuba on May 18 on the  occasion of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising.    At the press conference Deputy Chief of the Mission Kim  Chang-su said that the Kwangju popular uprising was a heroic  resistance in which more than one million people fought,  controlling Kwangju city for ten days, and which developed the  anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle to a higher stage.    "Through the struggle the South Korean people clearly saw  the  true color of U.S. imperialism and began to direct the sharp  edge of their struggle to it," he noted, and said: "U.S.  imperialism is the very one trying to destroy our nation with a  nuclear war."    "The United States is driving the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war by continuously shipping Patriot  and other war equipment into South Korea and staging `Rimpac'  exercises. This is a challenge to our nation which loves peace,"  he stated.    He said that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is keeping the  "National Security Law" the abolition of which is demanded even  by the United States, is expanding the "Security Planning Board"  and getting frantic in suppression in order to block the road of  independence, democracy and reunification, and is defending the  traitors Chon Tu- hwan and No Tae-u, the real criminals in the  Kwangju massacre, thus making it plain that he is of the same  clan with the preceding military dictators.    "The entire people should unite as one, rise up in the  second  Kwangju resistance and build an independent, democratic new  society free from foreign forces and fascism and accelerate the  reunification of the country on all accounts," he said.</p>

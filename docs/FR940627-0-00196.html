			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) A manufacturer or group may be required to conduct biological and/or exposure studies at the Tier 3 level to evaluate directly the potential public welfare or environmental effects of the emissions of a fuel or additive, if significant concerns about such effects arise as a result of EPA's review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the literature search or emission characterization findings in Tier 1 or the results of the toxicological tests in Tier 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) With regard to group submittals, Tier 3 studies on a fuel or additive product(s) other than the originally specified group representative may be required if specific differences in the product's composition indicate that its emissions may have different toxicologic properties from those of the original group representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Additional emission characterization and/or toxicologic tests may be required to evaluate the impact of different vehicle, engine, or emission control technologies on the observed composition or health or welfare effects of the emissions of a fuel or additive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Toxicological tests on individual emission products may be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Upon review of information submitted for an aerosol product under &sect;79.58(e), emissions characterization, exposure, and/or toxicologic testing at a Tier 3 level may be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A manufacturer which qualifies for and has elected to use the special provisions for the products of small businesses (pursuant to &sect;79.58(d)) may be required to conduct emission characterization, exposure, and /or toxicologic studies at the Tier 3 level for such products, as specified in &sect;79.58(d)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) The examples of potential Tier 3 tests described in this section do not in any way limit EPA's broad discretion and authority under Tier 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;79.55  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Base fuel specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Characteristics. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The base fuel(s) in each fuel family shall serve as the group representative(s) for the baseline group(s) in each fuel family pursuant to &sect;79.56. Also, as specified in &sect;79.51(h)(1), for fuel additives undergoing testing, the designated base fuel for the respective fuel family shall serve as the substrate in which the additive shall be mixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the generation of emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Base fuels shall contain a limited complement of the additives which are essential for the fuel's production or distribution and/or for the successful operation of the test vehicle/engine throughout the mileage accumulation and emission generation periods. Such additives shall be used at the minimum effective concentration-in-use for the base fuel in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

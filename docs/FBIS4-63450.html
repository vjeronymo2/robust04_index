			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Federation troops will not be brought into  Azerbaijan, President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan has declared.  He denied opposition accusations that the country might lose  its sovereignty. According to Aliyev, political parties should  consult and interact with the official bodies instead of holding  rallies and mass protest actions. The Azerbaijani leader  reiterated that the authorities acted correctly in signing the  Bishkek protocol on a cease-fire.    Meanwhile, the situation in the conflict zone remains  relatively calm. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reports only  rare cases of shelling of its territory from Armenia.    The headquarters of the Azerbaijani National Independence  Party has been raided. The premises were blockaded by 200  policemen, who announced they intended to find weapons.  However, the press service of the republican Interior Ministry  refuses to comment on this report, saying it knows nothing about  the incident.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gordan Nuhanovic: "Messrs. and Comrade </F> Ministers"]    [Text] When we tried to learn from Minister Mudrinic  by fax whether it is true that his ministry bought him an  apartment in an elite Zagreb neighborhood for 570,000 German  marks [DM] and that he then purchased it for only DM43,000, we  received no response.    Do all the deviations at the top ranks of state  power--whether they relate to unconstitutional allotments of  apartments to officials, ownership transformation, "managerial  loans," smuggling under the auspices of the state, or similar  matters--find an alibi in the government's official  announcements? Although the demagogic nature of similar  government announcements in several former cases was utterly  obvious, the government flinched a little after HSLS [Croatian  Social-Liberal Party] deputy Mladen Vilfan repeated his question  at the relevant hour in the House of Deputies, whereby he  demanded an explanation from Valentic of the controversial 1986  decree on the basis of which around 140 mostly luxurious  apartments in Croatia were allocated "for use with the option to  buy" to state functionaries, i.e., high-ranking HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] officials. Specifically, Vilfan said that  five months ago Valentic only partially answered his question of  who received an apartment on the basis of the decree in  question, and in what manner, while in response to his related  question "how many apartments were distributed through public  enterprises and with whose money were they all bought?" the  prime minister said that that is a "delicate question that  demands serious study of the material and information-gathering"  and that he was not yet in a position to provide an answer. HSLS  sources talk about 40 apartments that were allocated through  public enterprises, and Vilfan considers it unacceptable that  the government and Prime Minister Valentic have been avoiding an  answer for nearly six months, but that very silence is itself  significant enough, Mladen Vilfan believes.  <H5>  Minister's Silence </H5>   At the same time, the silence of Minister Ivica Mudrinic  also  seems very significant. Checking on the statements made by  Mladen Vilfan and Boze Kovacevic in the House of Deputies, when  Mudrinic's 203-square-meter apartment in the elite Zagreb  neighborhood of Zelengaj was "pilloried," we tried to learn from  Minister Mudrinic by fax whether it is true that his ministry  bought him that apartment for DM570,000, only for him to then  purchase it for only DM43,000. However, we did not receive any  response from the ministry in Zagreb's "little cube."    Judging from the "minister's silence" and from the firm  guarantees expressed by the HSLS to the effect that they are in  possession of all the purchase and sales contracts relevant to  Mudrinic's apartment, the reasoning behind the issue is very  simple and in fact tragically clear--the state gave the minister  of trade and communication nearly half a million German marks.    No one from the cabinet was present at the HSLS  interpellation on rescinding the controversial decree on  functionary apartments in the House of Deputies.    Although that proposal was rejected, Marijan Prus, as the  government's representative and otherwise the head of the Office  for Legislation, acknowledged in a certain sense that the decree  in question is in conflict with the Croatian Constitution, which  does not recognize the institution of "social ownership." Using  hackneyed legal terms, Prus tried to explain to the deputies  that among the "resources in social ownership that have not been  transformed to state ownership there are apartments, so that  based on the Law on Housing, apartments can be turned over for  use by state officials," noting that the deadline for bringing  the law into line with the Constitution is 31 June [as  published]. One must not forget that that deadline has already  been extended twice thus far, so that Prus's reply prompted  uncertainty concerning whether the government can freely violate  the Croatian Constitution up to 31 June simply because the law  has not yet been fully brought into line with the Constitution.  <H5>  Unconstitutional Allocation </H5>   Despite public attempts by the political leadership to  minimize the affair surrounding functionaries' apartments in the  sense of "don't make waves," the manner in which apartments are  allocated to republican officials is completely transparent and  unconstitutional. Specifically, the notion of "tenant housing  rights" is in correlation with the notion of "social ownership,"  and since the 1986 decree on functionary apartments corresponds  directly with obsolete tenant housing rights, the  unconstitutional positions on the basis of which the government  housing commission has allocated 136 apartments to state  officials since 1990 are quite clear. Moreover, according to  reliable information that the HSLS intends to bring before the  Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia very soon, all  of those apartments were repurchased at extremely low prices, on  the average for around 5 percent of the actual market value of  such apartments. Vilfan says that in this regard he has concrete  data on the apartments of Gojko Susak (237 square meters),  Vladimir Seks (65 square meters), and former Minister Babac (151  square meters), while the most curious case is undoubtedly the  five-room residential apartment of Minister Mudrinic. Gojko  Susak's apartment on Torbareva Street was completely renovated  with money from the Ministry of Defense, and Branko Babac moved  into his spacious apartment a month before ceasing to perform  his ministerial duties.    Experts have also spoken up about the unconstitutional  character of the "allocation of apartments to state officials  for use with the option to buy." The editor of the specialist  journal INFORMATOR, jurist Ljerka Abramovic, concludes in one of  her expert commentaries that the allocation of "all 136  apartments to state officials is a violation of the Constitution  of the Republic of Croatia, which implies criminal  accountability, for which the public legal office and state  attorney are responsible." The same opinion is held by Dr.  Bojana Tomasevic, a professor at the School of Economics and  expert on the housing issue. In her opinion, "giving apartments  away for use free of charge is a practice adopted from Soviet  collective ownership, while here this right has been expanded to  privileged leaders and has become unlimited, permanent, and  transferrable to all family members. This has made it possible  to satisfy the private interests of beneficiaries of tenant  housing rights contrary to the interests of all `receivers' of  apartments and of personal funds-revenues with which the social  housing fund was created."  <H5>  Fox Hunt </H5>   In the hopes of finding legal "substantiation" to sanction  the unconstitutional decree on giving apartments to state  functionaries for their use, former state attorney Stjepan  Herceg secretly invited experts from the School of Law to a  consultation on the issue. However, all of that remained under a  veil of mystical silence. We were unable to learn any further  details even from the Office for Property Administration of the  Republic of Croatia, where we were told by the assistant  director of that office, Mr. Martinic, that after the prime  minister's response to the liberals in the Assembly "it would be  stupid for me to repeat or refute it because I am only a civil  servant, but from my perspective the liberal initiative looks  like a fox hunt, or rather an attempt to use those apartments  for political ends." Regardless of whether this was an  expression of awkwardness or, more likely, a lack of more  appropriate counterarguments, the liberals are inclined to  maintain that members of the Valentic cabinet simply lacked both  the professional and the moral justification that would have  allowed them to attend the HSLS's latest Assembly interpellation  on apartments for state officials.    In accordance with the logic of the voting machinery, the  House of Deputies flatly refused to accept a revision of either  the communist Law on Housing or the notorious decree on  apartments for state functionaries. The Valentic government,  which has passed more than 300 laws and decrees during its term,  has apparently not found "credible" reasons to intervene in the  area of functionary apartments. "And how could they," we were  told by one HDZ member who is regarded in the party as a  "Manolicist," "when all of them view their political position as  a privilege of the privileged and when they are directly  interested in seeing to it that the Croatia Constitution is not  fully respected." A flat calculation indicates nearly DM30  million that the state has benevolently given to the "lucky  recipients" of the 136 apartments in one way or another.  Although under the present-day circumstances in which the state  finds itself any moralizing about such actions by the state  leadership is utterly superfluous, the "political apartments" of  Minister Mudrinic, Minister Susak, and Vice President Seks are  only the tip of the iceberg of profound and significant  hypocrisy, in which the very people who should be most  interested in ethical practices by virtue of their position and  corresponding reputation are in fact becoming its generators  through their actions. What the 50,000 homeless people in Zagreb  alone would have to say about this is indeed a rhetorical  question.  <H5>  Rule of the Stronger </H5>   Comparing this with the fact that families whose houses were  completely destroyed by the war (category 3) have each received  DM6,000 is perhaps the best indication of the discriminatory  character of allocations of budgetary resources, in the  implementation of which all citizens of Croatia are equal  participants every day. In the Spanish political system at a  time of a pronounced increase in corruption in the mid-1970's,  the name "caudillism" took root among the public for this social  phenomenon, signifying the criminal coupling of political and  economic centers of power, among which the distribution of  public property was systematically carried out. This "alliance"  quickly broke up due to mutual discord, but the notion of  "caudillism" has remained as a real danger in the modern age. A  danger that threatens us like Damocles's sword in so-called  interim periods when the rule of law gives way to lavish  privileges, abuses, and plunder. Although it is not fair to link  the situation in Croatia to such extreme deviations, in any  emerging legal system, and thus in the Croatian one as well,  tolerance of any forms of corruption--beginning with "apartments  for functionaries" and including all other forms of societal  pathology--means that rule of the stronger is favored over the  rule of law.    Minister Mudrinic's reward for his work at the Ministry of  Trade and Communication, amounting to half a million German  marks, is greater than the annual income of the U.S. President,  some people have concluded. Various things from an older  Constitution, the U.S. one, have been incorporated into the  Croatian Constitution, but apparently it is very hard for one  old American rule to penetrate the consciousness of local  politicians, namely: If you enter the world of politics with one  dollar, you may not take a single cent more than that dollar  back out, only one cent less.</p>

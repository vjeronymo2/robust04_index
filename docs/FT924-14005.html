			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Technology: Tight squeeze putting desktops in a pocket - Technically Speaking Dozens of high-tech companies in the UK, Japan and the US are scrambling to produce hand-held computers, driven by a burning desire to put a 'computer in every palm'. Few of them, however, seem to have grasped the basic difference between designing a computer that will sit on your desk and one that will fit in your pocket. Most are climbing over one another to make hand-held computers that are as fast, powerful and easy to use as today's desktop systems. But in order to meet the size requirements of a hand-held computer, manufacturers are using miniaturised versions of old technologies. The problem is that yesterday's hardware - even when it is updated and shrunk until it fits into the palm of your hand - will not run the latest PC software. Rather than recognising this limitation - and rethinking their design strategy - many makers of pint-sized PCs are forcing users to accept these abbreviated versions of their desktop PC software. Even big companies such as Atari, Memorex and Fujitsu have gone this route. There are five big limitations that have prevented hand-held systems from achieving the same power as their desktop brethren: memory, storage space, processor speed, display quality and keyboard size. On most systems, memory and storage space are provided by 'solid state', battery-backed memory chips - and the restriction lies in the number of chips which can be squeezed into one tiny machine. This part of the equation may improve slightly with the advent of ultra-small, magnetic disk drives such as Hewlett-Packard's recently launched 1.8-inch diameter disk drive - but these also carry a price in terms of power consumption. Meanwhile, the processor speed of hand-held machines is increasing more quickly than in desktop systems. But these faster processors will take a few years before they can reach the power of today's desktops. And they will always lag behind due to the physical dimensions of hand-held machines. Display quality and keyboard size are also limited by the size of your wallet - and the size of your fingers. While there are some creative alternatives to the keyboard - such as voice or pen-based machines - these fall outside the mainstream PC world. And therein lies the problem. Although it may be technologically possible one day to fit a full-blown desktop PC into a computer small enough to fit in your pocket, this is not what most people want. Rather, they desire a tool which will help them access vital information that is needed when they are out of the office - and which carries with it the capability to send and retrieve information from that office or others. Some companies - such as HP's 95LX, Japanese electronics giant Sharp's popular 'IQ' or ' Wizard' range and Psion's 18-month old Series 3 hand-held computer - have recognised this and are reaping the benefits of having done so. Pocket-sized computers are simply a different kind of product. Unlike the general-purpose desktop PC they need to be geared to the special needs of certain users. We already have pocket-sized 'organisers' such as the Sharp Wizzard, and pocket-sized computer games such as the Nintendo Gameboy. What next? A word processor for those on the move or a facsimile machine that fits in your pocket are possibilities. The breakthrough in hand-held computing will, however, come with the ability to build wireless communications into a pocket-sized computer at a mass-market price. We already have cellular telephones that fit in your pocket and a few computers that are pocket sized. What we need is a single unit that combines both.</p>

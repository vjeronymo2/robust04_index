			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GRANT AWARDED FOR LEARNING STUDY  </P> <P> A professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson has been awarded a  three-year, $177,000 grant to study cooperative learning among college  students, a method that previous studies have found beneficial for younger  students, especially minorities.  </P> <P> James Cooper, a professor of graduate education, recently was awarded the grant  from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, which is  administered through the U.S. Department of Education, university officials  said.  </P> <P> Cooper said the grant will fund continued study of cooperative learning, which  places students in small groups and stresses dependence on one another as well  as individual accountability for assignments. The focus of classroom learning  is shifted from the teacher to the student.  </P> <P> Cooper said studies of students in cooperative learning classes, from  kindergarten through the 12th grade, indicate that they have a better  self-image than other students and tend to be more tolerant of people with a  different gender or ethnic background. In addition, Cooper said, research  indicated that minority students benefit the most from the cooperative  approach.  </P></p>

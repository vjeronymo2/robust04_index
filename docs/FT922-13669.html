			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / O&amp;Y poised to replace Johnson OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the financially stretched Canadian property group, is close to appointing a senior businessman to replace Mr Tom Johnson as president. Earlier this week, O&amp;Y was contemplating leaving the post of president empty after Mr Johnson's imminent departure, so that Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's founder, would be in complete control. However, yesterday it emerged a replacement is likely. Mr Johnson, the senior banker brought in as president only two weeks ago, returned to his home in New Jersey on Friday. He is in talks with O&amp;Y over whether he will have a continuing role at the company and whether he should be compensated for loss of office. Sources close to the negotiations between Mr Johnson and O&amp;Y said the rift between the two stemmed in part from a disagreement over the terms of Mr Johnson's contract, including how much and when he should be paid. Mr Steve Miller, a partner in James D Wolfensohn, the US investment bank, is expected to replace Mr Johnson as chairman of O&amp;Y's planning and finance committee, which is drafting the plan to restructure O&amp;Y's debt of more than Dollars 20bn. Mr Miller has been taking the lead in formulating the reconstruction plan. Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong magnate, will be in Toronto next Tuesday for talks with O&amp;Y and its bankers. Mr Li, who forged a partnership with O&amp;Y late last year in a New York office building, has expressed interest in buying some of the assets likely to be put up for sale. Besides property holdings, these include controlling interests in several large Canadian natural resource companies. An O&amp;Y spokesman said yesterday a separate meeting with representatives of about 100 of the company's bank lenders was scheduled to go ahead amid strict security in Toronto's Sheraton Centre on Monday. Between 200 to 300 people are expected to attend the meeting. Mr Johnson, who was formerly president of Manufacturers Hanover, was brought into O&amp;Y at the suggestion of the company's main lenders to support the two Reichmann brothers, Paul and Albert.</p>

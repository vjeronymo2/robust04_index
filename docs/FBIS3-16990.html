			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Japan will continue to make efforts to ensure a  resolution to the territorial dispute, the conclusion of a peace  agreement and complete normalization of relations with Russia,  director of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's international press  department Seiji Morimoto stated during a briefing in Moscow on  Monday.    He said that this position was set forth by Japanese Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata during his talks with Russia's Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday morning. To quote  Morimoto, the Japanese side emphasized that the declaration  signed in Tokyo last December by the Russian president and the  Japanese prime minister creates a basis for broadening political  dialogue between the two countries.    The Japanese diplomat also said that Japan would continue to  support the Russian reforms and coordinate its moves with the  G-7. During the talks Chernomyrdin and Hata stressed that Russia  and Japan could jointly tackle major international problems.    Morimoto also said that the talks with the Russian prime  minister had convinced Japan that relations with Japan were one  of the priority aspects of Russia's foreign policy. "Neighbors  are not chosen. As neighbors, Russia and Japan must cooperate,"  he said.    He pointed out that the Japanese foreign minister was  satisfied with the discussion of the territorial issue. The  Russian prime minister confirmed Russia's adherence to the Tokyo  declaration and stated that a time would come when the  territorial problems would be solved.    "This problem is very complicated and we are well aware that  it cannot be solved at one go," said Morimoto. He also  announced that Hata had invited Chernomyrdin to visit Japan this  year. In Chernomyrdin [as received] invited Hata to visit  Moscow. The dates of the visit will be coordinated through  diplomatic channels.    Russia's possible admission to the G-7 was not discussed in  detail, said Morimoto. Japan believes, however, that G-7 should  broaden cooperation with Russia. "Such an initiative must come  from Italy, because it currently chairs the G-7 and is the  organizer of the forthcoming summit in Naples. Let us hope that  this problem will be solved," he said.</p>

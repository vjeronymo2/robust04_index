			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Comment and Analysis of President Clinton's </F> Announcement on Renewing Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) Status to  Mainland China"]    [Text] President Clinton officially announced yesterday  that the U.S. Government would extend MFN trading status to  mainland China in order to comprehensively improve relations  with Communist China. Clinton conceded that Communist China had  made some progress in the human rights situation on the  mainland, but was still far behind Washington's demand for  overall significant progress; however, to develop "a larger and  more productive framework of relationship" with Communist China,  he decided to no longer "link" the human rights issue with trade  with the mainland. Hence, the long-clamored question of whether  the United States should continue MFN status to Mainland China  is now settled.    Though Clinton also announced, in passing, the decision to  ban imports of Mainland Chinese-made ammunitions, this cannot  serve a punitive or warning purpose for Communist China in view  of current U.S. public opinion's strong opposition to the  rampant privately-owned weapons in the country. Furthermore,  ammunitions accounted for only a tiny fraction of the mainland's  trade with the United States, which also bans imports of  ammunitions from European countries. Therefore, as a U.S.  congressman put it, Clinton's decision is tantamount to an  unconditional renewal of the MFN trading status for the mainland  as well as an open retreat from the human rights condition he  insisted on during his election campaign and in an executive  order last year. For this reason, though there had been signs  of the Clinton administration's pending renewal of MFN, people  were mildly surprised by the content of the announcement. No  wonder there have been wide-ranging reactions from the Capitol  Hill and mass media.    In fact, even though he was clearly aware of an inevitable  wave of uproar from the Congress, President Clinton still made  the decision, which cannot be easily justified. This indicates  that Washington, after a thorough assessment, ascertained that a  practical policy toward Mainland China would be more in line  with the U.S. national interests. Why? On the one hand, U.S.  entrepreneurs, having placed high expections on the mainland's  market potential, were strongly opposed to any government  measure that would undermine trade with Communist China. On the  other hand, the strategy to link trade with human rights was  obviously a self-contradictory one.    In countries entirely dependent on U.S. economic aid, this  strategy may yield some results. However, in those which have  developed mutually beneficial and interdependent trade and  economic relations with the United States, the strategy of  "carrot and stick" could easily be associated with and referred  to as an expression of U.S. hegemonism; and hence, can be devoid  of moral persuasive and practical deterrent powers. It goes  without saying that human rights symbolize "universal"  principles of values while bilateral trade and economic  relations concern each other's "specific" interests. These two  are not issues belonging to the same category. By forcibly  mixing them together, the consequences would be either a serious  collision between the two sides, or retreat from the strategy  and admission of its failure at an opportune time after the  other side responded in an appropriate manner.    The results are now barred. The Clinton administration opted  for the latter. From the perspective of idealism and  humantarianism, the decision on MFN renewal is indeed clear  proof of the failure on the part of the United States to live up  to its moral standards; however, based on the concepts of  peaceful coexistence, mutually beneficial trade and economic  relations, and the geo-economy -- ideas that have guided the  international situation in the post-Cold War era -- Washington's  decision is not at all difficult to understand. At any rate,  however, the announcement on MFN renewal is tantamount to  declaring that the Clinton administration has changed its "Cold  Peace" tactics of relaxing one minute and tightening up the next  and of interweaving with contradictions -- tactics which the  United States had at one point adopted in viewing Communist  China as its chief imaginary enemy since the disintegration of  the Soviet Union -- and has entered a pragmatic era of facing  Mainland China squarely as one of its important trading partners.    Washington's change of attitude was prompted primarily by  the  impressive progress in Mainland China's economic development in  the past nearly three years. Although the mainland will not  necessarily become the world's largest "unified market" at the  beginning of the next century as some authoritative economic  research institutes have predicted, its economic growth rate and  development potential cannot be ignored. U.S. State Department  officials repeatedly pointed out: While Germany, France, Japan,  and other economic powers are trying hard to gain market shares  in the mainland, and in the wake of numerous investment and  cooperation agreements signed after visits to Peking [Beijing]  by these countries' top-level economic delegations led by their  premiers, it was absolutely impossible for the United States,  for the sake of its economic and trade interests, to "exclude  itself from the mainland's markets." In this way, the State  Department officials simply pointed out the real reason behind  Washington's MFN renewal to the mainland. Moreover, as far as  strategy is concerned, the United States needed to prevent a  renewed alliance between Russia and Communist China as well as  to coordinate with Communist China to exert pressure on North  Korea to defuse the nuclear crisis in Northeast Asia. For this  reason, how could the United States continue to maintain its  tough posture?    It is noteworthy that originally the United States wanted  to maintain its "Cold Peace" tactics and to wait and see what  would happen in the "post-Teng Hsiao-ping [Deng Xiaoping]"  mainland. If, by that time, the mainland remained stable and  its economy developed smoothly, the United States, to take part  in and lead the Asian-Pacific economic rim to seek hefty  commercial interests, would definitely try harder to accommodate  Communist China. If the mainland were to become turbulent and  communist Chinese leaders lose the ability to control the  political situation, Washington would go all out to deal with  Mainland China as it had with Russia, by launching  "dismemberment" tactics to eliminate a potential rival of the  United States. Nevertheless, the Clinton administration, after  viewing comprehensive assessments prepared by the State  Department, the Pentagon, and the Central Intelligence Agency,  tended to believe that the "post-Teng" mainland would not  necessarily see turmoil; moreover, a stable mainland at that  time could be more useful to the United States. Therefore, the  decision on MFN renewal also vaguely contains the results of  Washington's study and assessment of the future situation on the  mainland as well as its policy based on the study and  assessment. In light of this, it is not difficult to understand  that immediately after Clinton announced the MFN decision,  Undersecretary of State Lord declared that the United States had  no intention whatsoever of "playing the Taiwan card" to contain  Communist China.    We believe that the U.S. MFN renewal for Mainland China is  conducive to the mainland's economic stability and improvement  of the people's livelihood, as well as to the prosperity of the  "Chinese economic sphere" of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and  Malaysia, which have closer economic exchanges with the  mainland; and therefore, the MFN renewal is a practical  decision. However, this does not mean that Communist China can  turn a deaf ear to improvement of the human rights situation in  the mainland. After all, this question has already attracted  the international community's keen attention and Communist China  has no reason to ignore this question even after obtaining MFN  status, because not only will the United States continue to  monitor closely the progress of human rights improvement, but  this is also a matter involving the values of civilization and  the dignity of the Chinese people.</p>

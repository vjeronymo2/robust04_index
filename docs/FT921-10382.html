			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Paris plans friendship pact with Yeltsin FRANCE and Russia plan to sign a friendship treaty to conclude a two-day state visit by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. The two governments are also expected to sign a number of co-operation deals, including an agreement to increase security surrounding the former Soviet nuclear arsenal. After a meeting between Mr Yeltsin and French President Francois Mitterrand yesterday, the first day of the Russian president's visit, a French official said Mr Yeltsin had made no specific request for a cut in French nuclear forces, despite earlier reports that he planned to do so. 'The most important element was the great convergence of views on the notion of defence sufficiency, of minimal deterrence,' the official said. Following last Friday's meeting of heads of state at the United Nations Security Council, the French government claims to have secured US agreement for a special meeting of nuclear powers, to discuss the security of such weapons in the former Soviet Union. Paris has not made clear when such a meeting would be held, or whether the former Soviet Union would be represented by Russia or by the four republics with nuclear weapons on their territory - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. France is according Mr Yeltsin high ceremonial honours during his visit. This is partly to make up for the cool reception Mr Yeltsin received when he last visited France, in April last year. AP adds: Russia intends to sell or lease 50 percent of its oil production and exploration to foreigners, a top foreign ministry official travelling with Mr Yeltsin announced yesterday. Mr Vladislav Sorokin, chief of the foreign ministry's economics department, said that two laws are currently being prepared that would allow foreign companies to take out large shareholdings in soon-to-be privatized oil companies, and to obtain 60-year leases on exploration sites. Royalties paid by the foreign companies will allow Russia to finance a substantial part of its economic modernization, he said. Alexander Mariachine, presidnet of the Neftgazstroibank, the Russian commercial bank charged with privatizing part of the petroleum industry, said that numerous private companies were being created to take over the state-run sector. The privatization process will take three to five years, he said.</p>

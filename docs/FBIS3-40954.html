			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's minister of </F> environmental protection, head of the deputies' working group  for issues of nuclear disarmament: "We Have Given Away $10  Billion to Russia; This Time, It Will Be Even More" -- first  paragraph published in boldface; passage between slantlines also  published in boldface]    [Text] On 12 January, U.S. president Bill Clinton's  aircraft touched down at Boryspil Airport. According to  numerous preliminary tatements by presidential aides and  advisers, as well as by the U.S. press, the visit had not been  planned. The press hailed Bill Clinton's intention to visit  Minsk and Moscow and asserted that he was not going to visit  Kiev because Ukraine was not behaving properly on the nuclear  issue. They said that Ukraine would later be summoned to Moscow  for negotiations. However, the boss of the White House changed  his decision -- Kiev's airport was the first of those of the  former Soviet republics to receive him. The president took a  step backward, but now he wants to take two, three, or four  steps forward.    Against the background of the victory of Zhirinovskiy's  party  in Russia, the sensational reports on the total elimination of  nuclear weapons in Ukraine do not only give rise to a series of  questions, but also to the feeling of anxiety and uncertainty  among the citizens of our, and not only our, state.    One cannot fail to see the perfectly obvious contradictions  between the decisions adopted by the Supreme Council on the  reduction of nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian land and some  statements in the agreement about to be signed by the presidents  of the three states. For example, in accordance with the  Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START-1, Ukraine  takes upon itself an obligation to destroy 42 percent of its  nuclear warheads over seven years. Before he arrived in Kiev,  Clinton declared in Brussels that all the warheads would be  removed from our territory in the coming two or three years.  Therefore, if such an agreement is signed, a quite logical  question arises: "Why should Ukraine fulfill all those  extremely unprofitable procedures for destroying strategic  offensive weapons as envisaged by START-1? It is known that its  theses were elaborated more than 10 years ago, when the USSR,  which manufactured nuclear weapons, was still in existence."    The absence at that time of the effective mechanisms for  control over the manufacture of nuclear warheads led to the  elaboration of such operations for destroying strategic nuclear  forces, which could be clearly pinpointed and controlled. It is  precisely for that reason that, in accordance with the  agreement, the account for destroyed strategic weapons is made  in terms of dismantled launch vehicles and destroyed launch  silos and not in terms of destroyed nuclear warheads.    Incidentally, with regard to the latter, the practice of  dismantling a training launch silo in Pervomaysk showed that the  real economic and ecological losses exceeded the worst  predictions. All those who saw the photographic illustration of  this barbaric action in IZVESTIYA of 11 January 1994 could judge  for themselves.    Well, in view of the fact that Ukraine does not manufacture  its own nuclear warheads, the removal of nuclear warheads from  our territory also automatically signifies the elimination of  the strategic offensive weapons. Even if entire strategic  missiles remained in complete launch silos, with such a missile  we would, perhaps, be able to launch, instead of a nuclear  warhead, nothing more than nuclear waste from the Chernobyl  sarcophagus.    However, here a clear position is necessary -- either we  pursue a stage-by-stage reduction of our nuclear arsenals in  accordance with previous terms, or destroy nuclear warheads  alone without ruining those things that may still serve our  state, namely the launch vehicles and the launch silos.  Yet another important issue with regard to new initiatives is  the problem of compensation for nuclear disarmament. The sum of  material assistance promised by Mr. Clinton cannot be compared  to the losses that Ukraine has sustained. I will analyze just  one aspect of this problem. The highly enriched uranium and  weapons-grade plutonium are the most valuable materials of the  nuclear warhead. It is impossible to determine the market price  of these materials, because their sale is forbidden by the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. At the same time, in  accordance with some estimates, the known expenditure on the  production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium are,  respectively, up to $100,000 and up to $1 million per kilogram.  Together with the tactical weapons, Ukraine has already handed  over to Russia more than 50 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium,  which, according to the minimum estimate, /is worth over $10  billion. This indebtedness of Russia to Ukraine would be enough  to compensate for the deliveries of energy resources to us for  more than a year./    As regards the new agreement, the proposals that the highly  enriched uranium from the strategic missile warheads be  processed at Russian enterprises and that Ukraine be repaid with  low-grade uranium in the form of fuel for nuclear power stations  are economically unprofitable for Ukraine. The low-grade  uranium is worth about a hundredth of the highly-enriched  uranium. On the other hand, in accordance with the concept of  the development of nuclear power engineering in Ukraine, it  would be economically expedient to manufacture our own fuel  cartridges for the nuclear power stations. It would, therefore,  be best to process highly enriched uranium in Ukraine. This is  corroborated by the proposals from the well-known U.S. General  Atomic Company, which proposed that a joint enterprise on  manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations be organized in  Ukraine.    The cost of such an enterprise would be just $30 million.  Besides, after completing the program for processing the highly-  enriched uranium into low-grade uranium, this enterprise might  be used within the technological cycle of our own capacities for  manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations. Unfortunately,  the leadership of our state ignored these proposals. It is  necessary to return to this issue.    One more commentary on the new initiatives. The fact that  Ukraine is presently in a certain degree of international  isolation is not due to nuclear weapons, as some people are  trying to prove, but to the absence of any reforms. That is  why, had there been conditions in Ukraine favorable for  efficient entrepreneur activity and not stagnation with  corruption and bribery, there would not have been such a thing  as the so-called "Ukrainian syndrome," which allegedly scares  away investors.    Speaking about the nuclear weapons of the former USSR,  Western entrepreneurs and politicians are not so much concerned  about the availability of nuclear weapons, as about the possible  coming to power in Russia of Mr. Zhirinovskiy.</p>

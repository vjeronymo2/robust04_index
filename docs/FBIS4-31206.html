			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "joe": "People Interested in the Modernization </F> of the Army of the Czech Republic Have to Wait"]    [Text] Prague--The Army is unable to secure a complex  modernization of its arsenal by its own manufacturing and repair  capacities. In view of the scope of the work on the  modernization projects, it will be impossible to announce the  future demands of the Army of the Czech Republic before the end  of July, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said at a news  conference yesterday. Priorities are already known, however.  They are computer systems, communications, the unification of  command, the modernization of T-72 and T-55 tanks, the  modernization of the MiG-21 plane, the development of a light  multipurpose plane, the L-159. Technical details have not been  specified as yet.    The minister strongly emphasizes the modernization of the  Army's technical equipment because the costs linked to  modernization amount to 25-30 percent of the costs for  developing or buying new technology. According to Baudys, all  top firms in the world that are engaged in transforming older  military technology into modernized versions or are  manufacturers of this equipment have shown an interest in  cooperation. When asked about the possibility of cooperation  with Israel, Baudys described Israel as a country that has  exceptional combat experience and whose philosophy of building  the army and weapon systems is very close to ours, but he  adopted a cautious stance on relations with Russia. "As regards  cooperation with Russia, we were offered the possibility of our  claims being compensated by arms deliveries. But, the Army and  its arsenal cannot become dependent on a country whose  development can be very complicated. Weapons systems, which are  acquired for decades, have to be bought in countries that  provide a guarantee of economic and political stability," the  minister said.</p>

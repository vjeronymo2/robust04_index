			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MILLER DEMONSTRATES THAT HE'S LEARNED A LOTT  </P> <P> What's good for the parts may ultimately prove to be better for the whole.  </P> <P> The matter at hand was a catch that could have serious repercussions not only  for the player who caught it and the one who threw it, but also for rest of the  team.  </P> <P> It happened in the second quarter at Jack Murphy Stadium. The Chargers were  trailing the San Francisco 49ers, 14-7.  </P> <P> On first and 10 at San Diego's 29, Billy Joe Tolliver threw low over the  middle, right into the waiting arms of 49er free safety Ronnie Lott, a man not  known for turning away gift interceptions. But wait. Somehow, Anthony Miller,  the man for whom the pass was intended all along, came up with the ball and a  41-yard reception.  </P> <P> While the Chargers had to settle for a 26-yard field goal on the drive, the  catch was, according to Charlie Joiner, the Chargers' receivers coach, the kind  that can turn a team around. And in this case, it is a team already headed in  the right direction.  </P> <P> "It's a breakthrough for him and a breakthrough for the quarterbacks," Joiner  said. "And when you can make those kind of plays, it's a breakthrough for the  team."  </P> <P> Joiner said Miller is beginning to learn how to read defenses, and for a player  who didn't play much before he joined the Chargers -- he divided his time  between football and track at Tennessee and missed five games his senior year  because of a knee injury -- he's a little bit ahead of where Joiner would  expect him to be at this point.  </P> <P> And Joiner said it was the first time Miller has battled for a ball.  </P> <P> "That's something he hasn't done, or hasn't had to do," Joiner said. "Go up and  fight for the ball. Now we see he can do that. Quarterbacks won't be afraid to  put the ball up to him, even when he's covered."  </P> <P> Miller said he just knew he had to try and prevent the interception.  </P> <P> "I know I had to go up and try to break it up at least," he said, "and then  when I felt I had a chance to get it, I just went for the ball."  </P> <P> Said Lott: "He's got a chance to be one of the best receivers in football. He  has speed, strength, runs good patterns, and he's very aggressive."  </P> <P> Miller, who finished with eight catches for 143 yards, downplayed any talk that  he was out to prove himself against a team that has Jerry Rice, considered by  many to be the league's best receiver, and Lott, a perennial Pro Bowl player.  </P> <P> "I just feel like I want people to see that I can compete with (Rice)," he  said. "Lott is a great defensive back, but I was just playing against him and  trying to come up with a good play."  </P> <P> Said Joiner: "He played with confidence. He was up for the challenge, being  across the field from Jerry Rice."  </P> <P> Most grateful to Miller was Tolliver, who was saved not once but twice from  having egg on his face for misthrown balls.  </P> <P> "He can play the game," Tolliver said of Miller. "He made two excellent catches  on passes that could have been intercepted."  </P></p>

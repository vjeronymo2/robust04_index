			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with IMP/DOI policy to enhance the professional capability of the BCU and to establish capability within the BCU to assess and monitor the effectiveness of control programs on target species, the Service has determined that the PA must fundamentally change the staff, functions and size of the existing BCU to insure that the BCU's capabilities and functions are improved prior to any application by the ADC or the PA for any permit for 1995. The Service has determined that the time frames set forth in Section 6.4.3.2 are inadequate. Therefore the Service has determined that the following measures shall be implemented by the dates set forth below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Enhance the professional capability of the BCU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PA will hire a person trained in ornithology, or wildlife biology, or in a related field as the supervisor for the BCU by August 1, 1994. This supervisor will be trained to the Master of Science level in either ornithology or wildlife biology and will be capable of developing and evaluating the bird hazard management program at JFKIA and developing monitoring programs for birds in the JFKIA area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PA must apply to the Service for the October 1994 BCU permit by September 15, 1994, and should indicate in its application how it has complied with hiring the BCU supervisory biologist ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 above) and the reorganization of the BHTF. With this application the PA may include its assessment of the BCU's personnel capabilities and expertise. This assessment, if provided, should address needs for increases in staff size, changes in professional capabilities of staff, and training. It should also identify BCU equipment and support requirements, as well as document how the BCU will conduct the collection of biological field data, surveys and monitoring programs described in the IMP/DOI and this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Reorganize the BHTF to assist as an independent review body. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PA will reorganize the BHTF to serve as an advisory committee to the Port Authority for the evaluation of the BCU program and the gull shooting program by August 1, 1994. The BHTF will suggest improvements to this program, recommend additional research and monitoring needs and establish criteria to be used for initiation of Category 2 measures. The agencies currently composing the BHTF would remain. The chairmanship would be rotated on an annual basis; however, the Service would chair the task force during this reorganization period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 17, 1994, the Port Authority provided the Service with a letter indicating significant disagreement concerning those measures needed to implement the IMP/DOI. The Service wants a competent, professional, fully-staffed BCU in place before the Spring of 1995. Based upon the Service's evaluation of the current capabilities of the BCU and the improvements required to implement the IMP/DOI, the Service has identified additional organizational improvements. The Service will evaluate subsequent requests for special permits in light of the PA's implementation of the tasks set forth above, the measures described below, advice from the BHTF, and any other information submitted by the PA. Additional measures to improve the capabilities of the BCU include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Additional enhancement of the professional capability of the BCU. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PA will increase staff size for the BCU to 10 permanent, full-time members by November 1, 1994. All BCU employees will be qualified to consistently and accurately collect biological field data and to conduct surveys and monitoring programs with the minimum professional training of a Bachelors of Science or equivalent substantive course work and field experience. The BCU will include at least one person trained in entomology and pesticides. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PA will provide sufficient equipment and vehicles to support the improved BCU by November 15, 1994. This includes equipment to disperse water following rain storms, pyrotechnics, speaker systems in all vehicles, firearms, and safety equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PA will train and authorize all BCU employees to conduct all harassment methods, including the firing of firearms for lethal and non-lethal harassment by November 15, 1994. This includes the development of a training plan for all employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

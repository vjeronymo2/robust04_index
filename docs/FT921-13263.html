			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Uncertainty hold back Midlands UNCERTAINTY over the outcome of the general election is depressing confidence and holding back a growth in demand, west Midlands business leaders warned yesterday. 'There is a certain amount of fear about what is going to happen. This is bound to create some degree of uncertainty,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity and vice-chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's west Midlands regional council. The council brings together the principal manufacturing and service companies in a region whose economy is more dependent than any other in the UK on the health of industry. Although believing that west Midlands industry is well-placed to profit 'once demands starts to grow', Mr Townsend added that such growth is a matter of confidence and 'there won't be that confidence while there are the uncertainties'. He was speaking in Birmingham after a meeting of the CBI's regional council, which expressed some optimism about an upturn in the economy during the second half of this year. With most plants in the west Midlands working at less than full capacity, as recent surveys have shown, Mr Townsend effectively ruled out an investment-led recovery. 'If you're working 20 to 30 per cent below capacity, new investment is difficult to justify,' he said.</p>

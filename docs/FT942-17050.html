			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Returns on commercial property rise to 27.4% The return on commercial property investments rose to 27.4 per cent in the 12 months to March, say chartered surveyors Richard Ellis. The figures underline the strength of the recent recovery in the commercial property market. The data show a continued improvement in the market since February, when annual total returns were 24.7 per cent. The last time commercial property produced returns above 27 per cent was in August 1989. The strong performance of the property sector has taken place despite continued weakness in the letting market. The Richard Ellis figures show rents have declined by 6.4 per cent in the year to March. Rents in the office sector have stabilised in the past two months, though over the past year they have fallen 9.4 per cent. Retail and industrial property recorded falls in rents in March of 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively, and falls of 3.4 per cent and 5.8 per cent over the year. The continued decline in rents could undermine the strength of the recovery of the commercial property market, said Mr Angus McIntosh, director of research at Richard Ellis. 'Investment yields are unlikely to continue to fall, and unless we see some rental growth soon, capital values will cease rising,' he said. The industrial sector produced the highest total return, at 29.8 per cent, compared with 28.8 per cent for the office sector and 24.8 per cent for the retail sector. Capital values rose by an average of 19.3 per cent for the year to March. In the year to March 1993, capital values fell by 10.9 per cent. The capital value of industrial properties surged in March with a month-on-month rise of 3.6 per cent. On an annual basis, industrial property recorded capital growth of 20.8 per cent, office property 20.4 per cent and retail property 17.5 per cent. Richard Ellis based its figures on a sample of 246 properties valued at about Pounds 1bn.</p>

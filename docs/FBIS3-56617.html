			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] Parliamentary Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich,  speaking on national television late on Monday, said he knew  that a group of deputies was planning to try to force his  resignation during a parliamentary session opening in Minsk on  Tuesday.    Shushkevich said he would have stepped down of his own  accord  if given assurances that the new Speaker would be able to get  the parliament to set the date for an early election.    For his part, coordinator of the large Belarus faction  uniting more than 120 deputies, Gennadiy Kozlov, told INTERFAX  that on a motion from regional groups, more than 100 signatures  were collected in support of demands for a no-confidence vote  against Shushkevich.    Kozlov says his faction is opposed to the Speaker's  "gambling  around the CIS collective security agreement or his  interpretation of a monetary union with Russia."    He said that despite his verbal declarations of support for  a  full scale economic union with Russia, Shushkevich "starts  raising concern about a possible loss of the country's  independence when it comes down to business."    In his words, the key issues facing the second round of the  parliamentary session include the ratification of the CIS  founding agreement until January 23, the adoption of a new  constitution and election law and a concept of the country's  foreign policy. If the session fails to adopt the new basic  law, says Kozlov, the Belarus faction will insist its main  provisions such as presidency and the status of the Russian  language be put for a nationwide referendum. The faction also  wants a national verdict on the legitimacy of the Belovezh  accords overhauling the former Soviet Union, which is a highly  sensitive issue on the ground, he said.    In the meantime, the morning session was focused on the  ratification of the CIS Charter. State Secretary for CIS  Affairs Vladimir Zalomay, presenting the paper, said its  ratification "will be of huge importance for shaping the  country's foreign policy and become one more step by Minsk on  the way towards beefing up the Commonwealth and raising its  efficiency."    For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, also  supporting the ratification of the document, spoke of the  prospects of relations with Russia and a monetary union with  Moscow. He said that despite all difficulties, Belarus had an  economic potential enabling it to negotiate with Russia on equal  terms.    He said "some of the Russian politicians who consider such a  union as a handout to Belarus are mistaken." Kebich said  Belarus had never lived at the cost of others. Although the  union will not solve all of the country's problems, it will help  create an economic environment clearing many of the stumbling  blocks on the way towards bilateral cooperation, he said.    The Prime Minister mounted strong criticism of opposition  leader Zenon Pozniak, who accused Russia of imperialism in an  article carried by the parliament-sponsored newspaper, NARODNAYA  GAZETA. Pozniak called Russia "a country of God's fools building  its relations with other states on the traditions of Mongol  hordes." For his part, Kebich said that an overwhelming majority  of Belarusians were opposed to the country's self-isolation  preferring a union with Russia instead.    Shushkevich himself in a televised interview on Monday said  that a monetary union with Moscow could help towards a dramatic  improvement in the country's economic plight. At the same time,  he warned that such a union should not be seen as a panacea  against all troubles.    "It is up to us, not Russia, to reform the country's  economy," Shushkevich said. In his view, to make the union  work, the two countries must establish equal prices for fuel and  raw materials and sign a custom union.    On the possibility of forming his own party, Shushkevich  made  it clear he had pondered over the problem but there was no need  for one at the moment. "Some politicians in Russia formed their  own parties, but they did so in the run up to general  elections," he said.    Shushkevich stressed that he would be "physically unable" to  lead a party because of the huge amount of work he was having to  cope with as Parliamentary Chairman.    It is now known that the Belarusian parliament has ratified  the CIS charter by a vote of 238 votes for and 7 against.  Opposition leader Zenon Pozniak said his faction had abstained.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by DP: "Walesa's Destruction"] </F>   [Text] On Tuesday [22 February], President Walesa decided  to withdraw his representative on the National Assembly  Constitutional Commission and the constitutional draft that had  been presented before the Commission earlier.    He affirmed his decision in a letter to Sejm speaker Jozef  Oleksy: "Because my constitutional initiative was rejected  already after its first reading without a serious discussion and  without so much as am examination, I have decided to withdraw my  representative from the Constitutional Commission. At the same  time, I withdraw my constitutional draft."    "One is surprised by the president's decision," says speaker  Oleksy. ``It is regrettable that he has withdrawn his candidate  because that narrows down the scope of consultations. In his  statements today, the president did not confine himself to  constitutional matters, but also referred to the entire  parliament. It is not quite clear what he had in mind when he  spoke of the need to suppress the postcommunists. After all, he  himself gave the postcommunists a chance. Well, that's it. The  Sejm majority rejected his constitutional draft.    "But what surprises me most of all is that the president  does  not know if he will hold talks with the Sejm on  nonconstitutional topics. I think he made a mistake or a slipup  when he said that there is a conflict between the president and  parliament in every single country, for example in Russia. That  possesses militant undertones, and is hardly an appropriate  thing to say.    "I have the impression that the president does not want to  see a constitution adopted in the nearest future. I fail to  understand what he means when he says `graveyard peace.'    "I will talk to the president and try to clarify with him  what the powers of the highest state bodies are. That is a  subject of my concern. Provided, of course, that it is still  possible to talk to him.    "I see no reason to make loud noises about a break of  relations between the president and parliament, even if the  president has suffered a defeat because of the rejection of his  legislative initiative. I would not like confusion and  political squabbling to be the only way to achieve objectives.''    Says Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of the Constitutional  Commission: "The president has commenced his election campaign  too early. He wants to use the constitution as his chief  political argument. We will support the constitution that has  been prepared by parliament, but the president, at the head of  nonparliamentary forces, will call on people to shun it."    Kwasniewski recalled that the Constitutional Commission has  not only the right but also the duty to fulfill the law on  preparing and adopting the constitution, whether or not the  president takes part in this work. But he fears that the  president is intent on deflecting the debate away from the  constitution toward politics in general and the subject of who  supports the president and who does not.    "We are approaching an absurd situation," Kwasniewski  continues. "Either we have democracy and parliamentarism, where  we respect the law, or we have a destabilization of the state  and the use of illegitimate legal methods. We are now dealing  with an offensive against parliament just because we won the  elections. That is a repetition of the old communist principle  whereby power lies wherever the communists happen to be, and  everything not connected with the communists has nothing to do  with authority, or parliamentarism, or democracy."</p>

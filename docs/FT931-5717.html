			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Investor declines to SKr1.48bn INVESTOR, the Swedish Wallenberg family's main holding company, saw income after financial items fall to SKr1.48bn (Dollars 191m) in 1992 from SKr2.16bn a year earlier. This follows a drop in capital gains and a worse performance from Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace unit. However, the group benefited from a 26 per cent increase in the value of its share portfolio to SKr23.3bn  - at a time when the Stockholm bourse fell 1 per cent  - and from a 22 per cent rise in net worth to SKr32.4bn. The dividend was held at SKr5.25 per share. Operating income after depreciation fell to SKr3.64bn from SKr5.05bn. This reflected a drop in dividends received to SKr546m from SKr685m and capital gains of SKr2.27bn against SKr2.61bn. Saab-Scania's operating income after depreciation also worsened to SKr1.23bn from SKr1.70bn, largely because of more difficult industry conditions for the company's trucks and buses unit. Sales at Saab-Scania fell 10 per cent to SKr27bn from SKr30bn and income after financial items dropped to SKr716m from SKr889m. Orders rose strongly to SKr36bn from SKr28bn, mainly due to JAS39 fighter aircraft orders. Scania Trucks and Buses posted an 8 per cent fall in sales to SKr16.55bn. The Saab-Scania figures reflect the financial integration of Saab-Scania Holdings and Saab-Scania AB. They no longer reflect the group's 50 per cent stake in Saab Automobile, which last week separately reported a SKr2.69bn 1992 loss, as this is no longer consolidated.</p>

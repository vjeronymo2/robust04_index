			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE FUSS; NOBODY SAID NOT TO GET GOLF BALL  </P> <P> When Cheryl Howard left home Sunday morning for the 45-mile drive to Riviera  Country Club, the last thing she envisioned was becoming a controversial but  humorous footnote to the Los Angeles Open.  </P> <P> Attending her first professional tournament, she and husband Richard took a  spot on the grass behind the ninth green to watch each threesome play through.  </P> <P> When Michael Allen's approach shot rolled over the green and died at her feet,  she did what she thought she was supposed to do.  </P> <P> She picked the ball up and tried to hand it to a nearby marshal. Her husband's  poker face could not hide his humiliation.  </P> <P> "It was embarrassing," Mrs. Howard, a student artist at Mount San Antonio  College, said as she put her hand over her blushing face for the umpteenth  time.  </P> <P> "My husband didn't tell me not to touch the ball."  </P> <P> After Allen and playing partners Hal Sutton and Hale Irwin reached the green,  the latter two finished up while Allen was forced to wait until a tournament  official could be summoned. Glenn Tait then watched as Allen took a drop.  </P> <P> "No matter where she goes, she always makes a splash," said Richard Howard, a  paperhanger from Walnut, Calif. "Allen was really nice about it. He even liked  the lie (where his wife dropped the ball after the marshal refused to take it.)  </P> <P> "He said, 'I hope I can keep it here."'  </P> <P> When Allen, the leader after the first two rounds, made a scrambling par four  on the hole, the loudest applause came from a relieved Cheryl Howard.  </P> <P> After Allen rolled in his short putt, he walked toward her and tossed her his  ball amid a few good-natured cries from the gallery of "Throw her out of here!"  </P> <P> Said Mrs. Howard: "When he got to his ball, he said: 'I suppose you want the  ball after I sink it in.' And I said, 'Yup.' I think he had second thoughts  about it coming back."  </P> <P> The last group of the day, Gil Morgan, Rocco Mediate and third-round leader  Fred Couples, were stranded midway down the ninth fairway during the 15-minute  delay. But they all parred the hole.  </P></p>

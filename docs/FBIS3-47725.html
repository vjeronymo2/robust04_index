"If he wants to speak, let him do so. But I believe in the  truth. The world knows it is not possible for us to still  support the guerrillas," Chettha said.    Spokesman Sieng Lapresse attacked Thai military recently in  the Phnom Penh press, which quoted him as saying that some Thai  military officers were against the government's stated policy  not to support the Khmer Rouge.    "They have a bad Thai military (element) in there that  supports the Khmer Rouge against Thai policy. Let's get the bad  seeds out of there," Sieng said.    Chettha said the government and the military have made it  clear that they stopped providing arms to the Khmer Rouge after  the Paris peace accords were signed in 1991.    Thailand, instead, had played a vital role in restoring  peace  to the beleaguered country.    "We always assist the legitimate government. But they still  dig up the past. We can't stop them from rnaking such  comments," he said.    Chettha expressed confidence that Cambodian criticism and  suspicions would cease as a result of Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai's current trip to Phnom Penh. He urged the public to  put its trust in the govemment.    He also called on the press to understand Thailand's  position  and help boost understanding. He said Thailand had made many  contributions to Cambodia, including building infrastructure and  schools.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan yesterday also  insisted that the Thai military had stopped providing assistance  to the Khmer Rouge.    "All branches of the armed forces have confirrned to me that  they no longer support the Khmer Rouge. Once such an assistance  was given. But now it is an old issue," said Banyat.

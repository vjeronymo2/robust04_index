			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WALL SAYS WEAK S&amp;LS MAY FACE FORCED MERGERS  </P> <P> Federal savings and loan regulator M. Danny Wall warned industry executives  today that an "arranged marriage" with a merger partner might be the only way  to prevent a weak institution from closing.  </P> <P> "Thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave jeopardy. Understand  that," Wall told 3,600 delegates at the 97th annual convention of the U.S.  League of Saving Institutions, the industry's largest trade group.  </P> <P> Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, didn't mention in his  speech the controversy swirling around his agency's handling of the failure of  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Irvine, expected to cost taxpayers as much  as $2 billion.  </P> <P> But, at a news conference, he defended his decision to delay seizure of Lincoln  by nearly two years, saying he understood he was legally required to keep it  open unless it was insolvent.  </P> <P> On Monday, Wall's agency issued new regulations requiring S&amp;L owners to  back their lending with more of their own capital.  </P> <P> The thrift office estimates that about 800 of the nation's 2,600 solvent  S&amp;Ls will fall nearly $20 billion short of the new standard. Regulators  have identified 223 of those S&amp;Ls as likely candidates for government  takeover. Many of the others will be able to meet the requirements by shrinking  their balance sheets or retaining profits, Wall said.  </P> <P> The rest, about 300, "must consider a merger or the reality of being acquired,"  Wall said, warning weak thrifts not to be too choosy about suitors.  </P> <P> Thrifts not meeting capital standards by the end of 1994 face closure. In the  meantime, the thrift office will launch a vigorous "matchmaker" program.  </P></p>

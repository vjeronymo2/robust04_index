			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Kohl seeks to smooth vote on enlargement Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday joined a last-minute push to ensure the European parliament today ratifies the treaty to bring Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the European Union. Ratification requires approval by at least 260 of the 518 MEPs, and party managers were yesterday making frenetic efforts to ensure enough Yes votes. According to an official, special travel arrangements were being made to ensure that several MEPs arrived in time. In letters to leaders of the main political groups in the Strasbourg assembly, Mr Kohl promised to ensure the parliament would get the top-table seat it wants in the run-up to the 1996 constitutional review of power-sharing in the EU and the Maastricht treaty. Apart from Mr Kohl's assurance, Mr Ruud Lubbers and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Dutch and Belgian premiers (and both candidates to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president) have also made similar pledges. Germany takes over the EU presidency at the end of next month when a high-level committee should be set up to prepare the 1996 inter-governmental conference. Mr Kohl reminded MEP leaders that he had long argued for strengthening the parliament as the basis for a more democratic and federal Union. The parliament has been making its mandatory ratification of the EU's biggest expansion conditional on a further enhancement of its own role. In March, it made clear it would not ratify if Britain had its way in the voting rights row, making it easier for a minority of member states in the larger Union to block decisions. Germany took the lead in ensuring Britain received only cosmetic concessions, but even these have provoked many MEPs into fighting for postponement of enlargement until the institutional and power balance in the EU is sorted out. At least 100 MEPs are today expected to press for a postponement. This motion will almost certainly be defeated. But the question is whether enough of the dissidents will then vote Yes on entry for the four newcomers. Mr Kohl's intervention will bolster arguments that the failure of the enlargement vote would create an institutional crisis that would hinder reform. But the British Conservative government faces further discomfort with its Euro-phobe faction if it backs the Chancellor's pledge to support a body which is markedly Socialist and federalist. Polls suggest that after next month's Euro-elections, the parliament will be even more dominated by Socialists than it is now. Officials in Strasbourg point out, moreover, that additional seats for Germany to reflect unification means that federalist Germans will occupy many of the key positions in the new assembly.</p>

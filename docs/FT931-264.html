			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK backs Iraqi opposition grouping BRITAIN yesterday threw its weight behind the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella body grouping a wide range of President Saddam Hussein's opponents. Three leaders of the Congress, representing the Kurdish, Sunni Arab and Shia Arab communities, called on the prime minister, Mr John Major, at Downing Street, and had talks with the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd. Although Mr Hurd was cautious about promising any material British aid to the group, he encouraged them to address themselves to 'interested parties in the region', meaning principally Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and offered British help in establishing such contacts. The meeting was intended as a signal to Britain's friends in the region that it regards the INC as the opposition grouping most worthy of support, both because of its broad base and because of its commitment to democracy and human rights. Among its affiliated groups are all the main Kurdish parties and the Islamic opposition based in Iran. Mr Saad Jabr, leader of a smaller group which claims Saudi support, also met foreign office officials yesterday, and was urged to work with the INC. The INC leaders told Mr Hurd they hoped to issue a statement reaffirming their respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and borders within the next few days. They also said the INC hoped soon to found a military wing, which could attract members of the Iraqi armed forces wishing to defect. Iraq would have to comply in full with United Nations resolutions, whoever was in power in Baghdad, Mr Hurd said. He made it clear that British policy towards Iraq remains unchanged - thus denying reports that Britain was no longer demanding that Mr Saddam relinquish power before international sanctions would be lifted. The UN sanctions committee agreed on Monday at its periodic review to maintain the sanctions against Iraq, imposed in August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 3 CHARGED IN KILLING OF SECURITY GUARD  </P> <P> Murder charges were filed Wednesday against three gang members suspected of  gunning down a security guard while trying to steal his gun behind a North  Hollywood movie theater in March.  </P> <P> Charles R. Doll, 51, died in a hail of gunfire on the top level of a parking  structure behind Century 7 Theatres in the 12800 block of Victory Boulevard on  March 11.  </P> <P> Nelson Castillo, 20, Juan Martinez, 19, and Jesse Tarver, 20, all of Los  Angeles, were identified through fingerprints found in a stolen car parked near  Doll's body, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said.  </P> <P> The three also were charged Wednesday with four counts of robbery stemming from  an incident the same night in West Hollywood. In addition, Nison said, the men  are suspected in several other robberies still under investigation.  </P> <P> Because Doll was killed during a robbery attempt, prosecutors have the option  of pursuing the death penalty.  </P> <P> Nison said the three men went to the theater to steal Doll's gun. Martinez  allegedly wrestled with the guard while trying to grab the gun. Nison said  Castillo and Tarver, each of whom was armed, shot Doll several times during the  struggle.  </P> <P> Doll, who was employed by a private security firm retained by the theater to  patrol the parking structure, was on his second day on the job when he was  killed. His body was found by theater patrons who heard shots about 11:45 p.m.  He had been shot at least six times and died at the scene, Nison said.  </P> <P> Castillo, Martinez and Tarver were identified through fingerprints found in a  silver 1984 Honda Prelude, which had been stolen about 90 minutes before the  shooting outside a West Hollywood nightclub, Nison said. In that incident, two  or three armed men demanded a car and money from four people in the 7900 block  of Santa Monica Boulevard, he said.  </P> <P> Castillo was arrested Friday in Sunland. Martinez and Tarver already were in  custody on other charges. Castillo and Martinez will be arraigned Jan. 3 in San  Fernando Municipal Court. An arraignment date had not been set for Tarver.  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Japan coalition allies consider party merger: Speculation grows of imminent cabinet reshuffle Two leading members of Japan's seven-party coalition yesterday proposed the formation of a new centre-right party, amid press speculation of an imminent cabinet reshuffle. The calls, from Mr Ichiro Ozawa, joint leader of the Japan Renewal party, and Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary-general of the Clean Government party, could be the first stage in another realignment of political parties in preparation for a general election sometime this year. Opinion polls show the coalition could only beat the opposition Liberal Democratic party under Japan's new electoral system if it fielded single joint candidates, unlikely in its increasingly fragmented state. Mr Ozawa, the coalition's backroom strategist, said Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should lead the new party, which would support free competition, a pacifist constitution and the United Nations as the guarantor of world security. Mr Hosokawa did not deny press reports he was planning cabinet changes in an effort to bolster his authority after the recent upheavals over political and tax reform. 'I won't think of it until the government finishes the draft budget,' he said. The cabinet is due to approve the budget today for parliamentary adoption in the spring. Mr Ozawa, architect of the present cabinet, said the prime minister 'has all the authority' for a reshuffle. But the possibility was denied by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, a former close ally of Mr Hosokawa, head of the small New Harbinger party and potential victim in a reshuffle. Considerable tension exists between Mr Takemura and Mr Ozawa, based on differences over foreign policy and relations with the LDP, their own former party. Mr Ozawa wants Japan to be an influential member of the world community with clear foreign policies, and wishes to split the LDP, the symbol of the old political order. Mr Takemura is inclined to a more modest world role for Japan and co-operation between the government and the LDP. The prime minister has tried, with diminishing success, to strike a balance between his two main allies. Mr Ozawa said a realignment of political parties would 'progress at considerable speed', once the revised versions of the government's political and electoral reform bills had passed parliament, possibly by the end of this month. He and his close ally, Mr Ichikawa of the Clean Government party, believe the new party would include most members of the ruling coalition, plus defectors from the LDP and minus the Socialist party's left wing. 'I don't think the present coalition members will all make the new team,' said Mr Ichikawa.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. F. Dotsenko, Academy of Sciences of the </F> Ukraine, Marine Hydrophysical Institute]    [Abstract] The author makes an anlaysis of free and forced  gyroscopic (inertial) waves in a continuously stratified ocean  of constant depth, using f-plane approximation.    The vertical structure of the waves is examined, and through  a series of formulae the long- and short-wave approximations of  their dispersive dependencies are obtained. A study is also made  of Airy wave packets, which are generated during the evolution  of initial disturbances in the ocean. The special features of  the generation of gyrsoscopic waves by periodic and by moving  disturbances are described, and a comparison is made of the  effectiveness of wave generation by surface and by bottom  disturbances.    On the basis of his investigation the author concludes that  gyroscopic waves possess properties which differentiate them  substantially from internal waves. The main differences lie in  the frequency range of their occurrence, in their vertical  structure, in the directions of their propagation in relation to  the generating sources, and in the spatial structure of fields  of gyroscopic waves behind moving disturbances. Effective  generation of gyroscopic waves can be expected in layers of  quasi-homogeneous depth during the flow of currents past  irregularities in the terrain of the ocean floor. The question  of experimental detection of gyroscopic waves in the world ocean  remains still to be explored.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Long View: Your A-Z of the D-word THERE IS much talk among pundits just now about devaluation. Here is an A to Z guide. Alternatives. Perhaps this is a misleading way to begin. In the terminology of currency politics there are no alternatives. There is only one possible strategy at any one time, although it might change abruptly one Friday night. Bundesbank. The German central bank does not believe in devaluation. The Bundesbank is selfish, ignorant, pig-headed, disruptive, old-fashioned, nationalistic and inflexible. In short, it sets the standard for what a good independent central bank should be like. Constant competitiveness. An economic concept designed to distract people's attention from the fact that the currency keeps going down in value. Devaluation. A complex foreign currency market adjustment mechanism which can be characterised as: 'I ain't askin' DM2.95 for this pound sterling, I ain't askin' DM2.83, I'm givin' it away for DM2.40. Cross my heart, in 1981 it was worth five. Yes, sold to the gent with the Reuters screen in Frankfurt.' ERM. The exchange rate mechanism is a baffling concoction of fluctuation bands, divergence indicators and intervention limits. Life is terrible within it but even worse outside: your currency might go up and down like the dollar. Floating currency. Sometimes known as a sinking currency. When politicians tire of fixing exchange rates, they sometimes choose to 'let the market decide.' Between 1972 and 1990, the market decided that the pound should float down from over DM8 to under DM3. Gold. Once, it set the standard for international monetary value. But gold is not what it used to be. In 1980, gold hit DM1,550 an ounce; it is now DM520. Hyperinflation. Ordinary inflation is what has happened in the UK, where the pound has lost 84 per cent of its purchasing power in the past 20 years. Hyperinflation is when that happens in one year. Independent central bank. After you devalue the currency, you might declare your intention to give independence to your central bank. You cannot do so beforehand because it might refuse to devalue and could raise interest rates instead. J-curve. The aim of devaluation is to improve the trade balance. Unfortunately, the immediate effect is to make it worse (because imports rise in price) and the chart goes down before it goes up again. This is the J-curve effect, although some economists believe the J stands for 'Jeepers]' Krona and krone. The Swedish krona has been devalued this year but the Norwegian krone has not, nor the Danish krone. So be careful when you go to Scandinavia and change currency. Lira. Well-known devaluation-prone Italian currency. But there were 2,100 to the pound in 1948 and 2,150 today, which is not a great change. Maastricht. Little Dutch town on the German border where it was decided by European heads of state last December to abolish the D-Mark by merging it into the Ecu which could then be devalued. The Bundesbank is, however, mounting an effective rearguard action. N is for nineteen thirty-one, nineteen forty-nine and nineteen sixty-seven, all famous occasions of sterling devaluations. But they were all odd-numbered years, so perhaps we are safe in 1992. Ouguiya. The Mauritanian currency has been devalued, but not recently. Pound in your pocket. Famous Harold Wilson observation in 1967 on devaluation. 'It does not mean, of course, that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or your purse, or in your bank, has been devalued.' Of course not. But since then, the pound has lost 89 per cent of its internal purchasing power. Quit. Often the fate of devaluing British chancellors of the exchequer. James Callaghan stood down in 1967. Philip Snowden and Sir Stafford Cripps did not last long, either, in 1931 and 1949 respectively. Realignment. Valuable euphemism for devaluation, used when countries in the European monetary system devalue against the D-Mark. If different countries move their central rates by different amounts and also change their fluctuation bands, it can be hard to see what is really going on. September. Historically, the autumn equinox marks the most dangerous season for the pound sterling, which left the gold standard on September 21 1931 and suffered a 30 per cent devaluation against the dollar on September 18 1949. Threadneedle Street. Home of the Bank of England, manager of the UK's currency, which is dignified, responsible, co-operative, deferential, technically ingenious and flexible. For these reasons, it is a rotten central bank. U-turn. The manoeuvre executed by a government when it devalues the currency after having dismissed the possibility fiercely for many months. V-turn. Like a U-turn, but even sharper. Weekend. Devaluations usually happen over a weekend. Governments have nearly two days, in which markets are closed, to put the arrangements into place. But, these days, there could be opposition from the Keep Sunday Special movement and from millions of tourists unable to change travellers cheques. Xenophobia. A common affliction of finance ministers trying to shore up sickly currencies. They are liable to lash out at 'gnomes of Zurich' and other symbolic speculators. Unfortunately, the foreign exchange markets are infested with foreigners. Yield differential. Weak currencies must reward investors with higher interest rates than strong ones to compensate for the extra risk. So why have US treasury bonds been yielding less than German bunds? Well, any theory can break down sometime. Zero inflation. A dream of monetarists and governments. Achieved only once in Britain - in 1959 - since the Second World War. Since 1970, the UK has failed to get closer than 3.7 per cent over a calendar year. Zero inflation could mean the end of annual wage increases; for some reason, voters are not as keen as politicians.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Growth falls give Singapore an attack of economic angst: The rising fear of missing out SINGAPOREANS have a word for it: Kiasu, a Hokkien Chinese term which describes a fear of missing out or failing to keep pace with the crowd. These days there is plenty of Kiasu in Singapore. The reason is the economy. In 1988, the economy grew by 11 per cent, in 1989 by 9.2 per cent, in 1990 by 8.3 per cent and last year by 6.7 per cent. In the first half of this year growth slid to 5 per cent. Singapore sets itself high economic standards, and the decline in growth has been enough to induce wholesale nervousness. Shops and restaurants are unusually quiet. Though there are more tourists arriving, the big spenders, notably the Japanese, are staying away. Hotels are in a price war for customers. Singaporeans watch as their old rival, Hong Kong, continues to grow rapidly. There is also political uncertainty, with the old captain of the SS Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, no longer at the helm. Singapore, it is felt, is failing to keep up. However, the picture is hardly all doom and gloom. Singapore's growth is largely dependent on its exports, and analysts point out that a 5 per cent rise in gross domestic product (GDP) is a significant achievement at a time when Singapore's main export markets - the US, the European Community and Japan - are simultaneously either in recession or showing only slight growth. Singaporeans might be full of economic angst, but investors are still bullish about the island republic's economic prospects. In the 1985 recession there was a sharp dip in foreign investment: new investment commitments in manufacturing in the first six months of this year were SDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 534m), a 6 per cent rise over the same period in 1991. The government says all is more or less on course: as the economy matures, slower economic growth rates are inevitable. Singapore, with its highly trained workforce, its well developed infrastructure and its Dollars 38bn foreign exchange reserves is poised to take advantage of opportunities in what is the world's fastest growing economic region. But there are problems. As in the mid-1980s, there are signs the government is pump-priming the economy by pouring money into the construction sector, which enjoyed a 20 per cent growth rate in the first half of the year, while manufacturing output continues to fall and the financial services sector - one of the star industries in recent years - achieves minimal growth. The GDP growth figures disguise an export performance which is sluggish in comparison with recent years. While Singapore retains a strong position in the electronics sector (it produces 50 per cent of the world's computer disk drives) further growth is largely dependent on an illusive US economic recovery. 'Singapore had grown complacent,' says one economist. 'It thought it had escaped the effects of the recession in the west. That's clearly not the case now.' Singapore is also faced with the erosion of its competitiveness. While wages are rising at a lower rate than in the mid-1980s, there are worries about a growing gap between wage rises and productivity. Singapore is an increasingly expensive place to do business: a 16 per cent rise of its currency against the US dollar since the end of 1989 has further blunted its export competitiveness. The government's answer is to encourage domestic manufacturers to automate; go into more high-tech industries; or move their labour-intensive industries offshore. But such moves are taking longer than expected. Government sensitivity to criticism of its management of the economy is partly due to political factors. In elections last year, the governing Peoples Action Party, in power since Singapore's independence, lost support. A number of by-elections pending will be a severe test for Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister. Mr Goh has recently warned against 'the democratic distemper which afflicts peoples whose economies have become sluggish because of subsidies'. But the government might find it dangerous to ignore pleas for greater health and education spending.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Tajiks search for words to market themselves: Gillian Tett on a republic determined to be heard FORMER Soviet Tajiks do not have a word for 'marketing' in their own language. In the coming months, though, they may acquire one. In this mountainous corner of the Soviet Union, the Tajik government has embarked on one of the most difficult marketing tasks of all - persuading the international community that remote and beautiful Tajikistan could be a profitable place for western investment and aid programmes. They have taken the innovative step of establishing their own western-based development agency - the first such agency to have been set up by a former Soviet republic. The Tajik Development Agency (TDA) is a joint venture between a Tajik commercial bank, a Finnish trade company and the European financial services firm EBC Amro. Based in London with a small, largely western, staff, its brief is twofold: to help the Tajik government identify its development priorities; and to attract, assist and co-ordinate the investors and aid agencies needed for this development. 'I think some western businesses think regions like Tajikistan might be interesting, but they just don't know where to begin. . . . We are trying to provide an accessible, London-based, structure for them to start with,' explains Mr Richard Wilkins, ex-accountant and now a director of TDA. He admits to considerable problems. The republic is virtually unknown in the west. During the Soviet period, its chief distinction was that its 5m population consistently ranked as the poorest in the Soviet Union. Since independence, it has become infamous as the first republic to have a visible Islamic opposition. With its leadership still perceived - perhaps incorrectly - as former hardline Communists, it has not appeared a prime candidate for foreign aid. Although, entrepreneurs from nearby Moslem countries are already apparent in the republic, western investment has so far been limited. According to Mr Wilkins and his colleagues, the opening of the agency has already triggered business interest, particularly among mining companies curious about Tajikistan's rich mineral deposits. The republic produces an estimated 2.5 tonnes of gold annually, has large lead, zinc and silver deposits, and huge hydroelectricity capacity. The management consultancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte has been contracted to prise aid out of the EC, the British 'know-how' fund and other sources. Meanwhile, lawyers from the London law firm Berwin Laighton will be going out to the republic to advise on development of a badly-needed western-style legal system. The first English Speaking Union in the former Soviet Union has been set up in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, to train English speakers. Although TDA strenuously denies that it is intending to set itself up with exclusive access to Tajikistan's minerals, its position as the official 'co-ordinator' of foreign investment to Tajikistan could place it in a controversially powerful position within the republic. And in an ex-Soviet Union where almost anything is now up for grabs - or dollars - the Tajiks may yet need a word for 'monopoly' in their language, as much as they need a word for 'marketing'.</p>

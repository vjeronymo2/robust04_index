			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by </F> Sebahattin Onkibar in Ankara on 11 February, from the "Politics  Diary" column]    [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin visited our paper's  Ankara office yesterday, and we had lunch together. This is how  Cetin summed up the latest situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina  issue: "The present stage has finally been reached at a bitter  price and 200,000 deaths. The present stage is close, even if  not completely the same, to what Turkey has been vociferously  proposing for the last two years. All the formalistic  initiatives by the West over the last two years have produced no  results and it eventually adopted our thesis. To say it openly,  the latest NATO decision falls short of our expectations, but  still it is of some importance."    I asked our foreign minister, whose wholehearted efforts on  the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue we have always applauded, if the  latest NATO decision is a farce.    Cetin replied: "No, it is not, it cannot be. If such a  thing happens, let me state openly that NATO will lose all its  credibility and reliability. NATO, which enjoys respect, will  find itself in a difficult situation in such a case."    After taking a deep breath, Cetin added: "Now look, the  issue here is definitely one of Christian fundamentalism. This  is basically why people have turned a blind eye to this problem  for so long. Had the West assumed its present position from the  very start vis-a-vis the Serbian leaders, who want to set up a  Great Serbian state, all these massacres would not have  happened."    We asked the foreign minister how the opposition by Britain,  Canada, and Greece against intervention was overcome. He  replied:    "Turkey exerted enormous efforts in this direction. The  extraordinary session was convened at our invitation. In  addition, it must be noted that the NATO secretary general also  made intensive efforts. During the latest meeting, Britain did  not put up too much resistance and we managed to overcome the  objections from Canada and Greece. They had no pretext left in  the name of humanity to put up resistance."    Here we immediately asked what Turkey's position would be on  a possible intervention. Could Turkey be the leading force in  such an intervention?    Cetin said: "Could be. Our 16 F-16 planes are waiting in  Italy. If need be we could increase this force. If NATO asks,  we are ready to undergo any sacrifice to fulfill our historic  responsibilities. We are hereby informing the public through  you: All our preparations in this regard have been completed.  We informed the UN of this in writing."    The foreign minister also provided information on the  developments that might lead to intervention. He said: "Now  there are ten very critical days before us. If, during this ten  days, the Serbs do not announce to the world that they have  stopped the massacres and pulled back their arms and militia as  demanded, then inevitably an intervention, that is, air  operations, will take place."    It is our greatest wish to see the implementation of these  declarations, which please us, albeit a bit too late. This  century's drama, which once again brought to our attention the  other unseen side of the West, that is, its ugly face, is a  great lesson for us.    We must give the Turkish Foreign Ministry and its leader  Hikmet Cetin the due they deserve. We can say without  exaggeration that, even if late, this point has been reached  thanks to the persistent efforts by the esteemed Mr. Cetin and  our Foreign Ministry. Valuable points have been added to the  personal record of Cetin. Even the opposition says that "he is  one minister with whom we have established the best of  dialogue." To state it openly, the solidarity between [Prime  Minister] Ciller, [Deputy Prime Minister] Karayalcin, and the  opposition on this issue deserves every praise. Neither should  one forget President Suleyman Demirel. We can state without  exaggeration that Turkey has done everything it could given the  current international situation.  <H5>  Aliyev's Visit and Armenia </H5>   Taking advantage of the opportunity, we also asked Foreign  Minister Cetin about the latest situation on Armenian  aggression. He said: "We have declared over and over again:  The Armenians must immediately withdraw from the territories  they have occupied. Either they will have to withdraw on their  own, or they will be made to withdraw; yes, they will be made to  withdraw."    Is this sentence "they will be made to withdraw" not  interesting, coming from Cetin, who is known to the public as a  person who keeps his opinions to himself and speaks in  diplomatic language?    We immediately asked who would force the Armenians out.  Would  it be Turkey?    Cetin hesitated to reply. It was obvious that he was having  trouble spelling out certain views. He said: "Let me say this  much: Azerbaijan and Turkey are one nation. They have the same  ethnic roots. Therefore, Turkey will do all it can."    What, for example? Will it send troops? Will it provide  arms?    At this point I asked him if logistical support was promised  to the Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who is still in  Turkey.    Cetin merely replied: "No comment."    It is clear what this means. Certainly, specific meanings  could be drawn when a foreign minister, who knows the  international law well, is not saying "no there is no such  support," and instead says "no comment."    Yes, with the changes in the international situation, a  tremendous dynamism is seen in the Foreign Ministry, which we  have been often criticizing only recently. And, Cetin's star is  shining to the maximum. And, no one should be uneasy at this.  After all, our foreign policy is above parties, that is, it is  national in character.    We advise Cetin to "keep" to his present course.</p>

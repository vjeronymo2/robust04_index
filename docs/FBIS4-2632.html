			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung] </F>   [Text] Local delegates to China's National People's  Congress (NPC) have fallen out over the text of a letter to  their chairman Qiao Shi, which requests a detailed explanation  of the verdict on jailed Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang. At least  one delegate has refused to sign an amended version of the  letter, on the grounds that it implied China mishandled the case.    Xi, a Chinese national resident in Hong Kong, was arrested  in  Beijing late last year on charges of espionage and stealing  state secrets. His trial was conducted in secret earlier this  year, and the verdict and 12-year sentence were announced last  week.    A special meeting of local NPC delegates was held last  Friday  to discuss the severity of Xi's case. But at least one of the  delegates who attended the meeting, surveyor Kan Fook-yee,  refused to sign an amended version of the letter, saying the  initial draft had taken a "more neutral" stance on Xi's case.    The letter, drafted by Cheng Yiu-tong, Ng Hong-man and Peter  Wong, was circulated among other local delegates. It had asked  the NPC Standing Committee to demand that the Beijing Municipal  People's Intermediate Court reveal the full text of the verdict  against Xi. It also urged that the hearing of Xi's appeal  against his sentence be conducted in full accordance with  Chinese law.    Mr Kan said the amended version, after other delegates had  added their opinions, insinuated that China had mishandled Xi's  case. He said he would not sign a letter which took a specific  stance on the case, before the Chinese government was given an  opportunity to provide a full explanation. Mr Kan argued it was  not proper to question the fairness of the Chinese judiciary  without being fully aware of the circumstances of Xi's case.    Another delegate and lawyer, Dorothy Liu, said she had  noticed differences between the two versions. But she did not  think the amended version contained any improper suggestions.  Miss Liu had already signed the amended letter which was  expected to reach the NPC chairman later this week.</p>

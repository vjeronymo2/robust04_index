			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (EFE0 -- Uruguayan President Luis  Alberto Lacalle, who was the spokesman for the Fifth Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] summit that ended today, Monday,  said that he is "pragmatically optimistic" that the common  market will finally be set in motion on 1 January 1995.    During a press conference, Lacalle denied that there are two  integration systems, a slow one and a fast one, "because we are  not like the European Community [EC], which has 12 members; we  are only four countries."    This idea was conveyed to observers by the speech by  Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who demanded sincerity  and who reported the series of problems that Mercosur is  confronting.    Lacalle, who supported Wasmosy's speech because of its  "frankness," explained that three years ago, when the Treaty of  Asuncion was signed with short terms for implementation, "we all  knew it would not be easy, because there are differences of  opinion in all systems, even in NAFTA or in the EC."    He said Mercosur is moving forward "with urgent  preestablished deadlines" that help expedite the process.    "One should be optimistic in all activities, and I am  optimistic about the possibility of achieving integration, but I  am also pragmatic, because we base our action on actual facts,"  Lacalle stressed.    Asked about what would happen if no agreement is reached  over  the single external tariff, which was not announced today --  especially because of the discrepancies between Brazil, which  strongly protects its industry, and the other countries, which  demand a low tariff to ensure the system's efficiency -- Lacalle  replied with doubts, saying that "a solution may or may not be  reached in June."    "We began a path toward integration which has gone through  various phases. It is a dynamic process with different steps and  stages, either under the name of common market or customs  union," he said in order to minimize the cricism over the  failure to reach an agreement to fully implement the system next  year.    Lacalle also addressed the labor centrals, which are  controlled by leftist groups, which were not granted an audience  at the summit, and which released a communique in Montevideo.    "This is a meeting of nations. We are not a corporation. The  presidents, who were democratically elected, represent their  countries," Lacalle said.    "We are ready to listen to all the proposals that are  consistent with the course that was agreed upon, and that are  submitted to the Mercosur secretariat, which should then  formulate them to be submitted to the presidents. We cannot  transform these meetings into sessions for sectorial demands,"  he added.    He lamented that the labor centrals of Mercosur countries  "do  no want to use this system, preferring public demonstrations."    He emphasized the presidential declaration's point on the  importance that matters dealing with employment, migration, the  protection of workers, and the coordination of the labor  legislation of member countries have for building the common  market.    "They are difficult matters that we have not yet formalized  but that we will jointly address in work groups," Lacalle said.</p>

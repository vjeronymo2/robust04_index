			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Researcher wins race bias case An Indian senior research chemist has won promotion and Pounds 15,000 in an out-of-court settlement over a case of unfair dismissal and racial discrimination. Mr Iqbal Khan, an MSF union member, was selected for redundancy and dismissed in 1992. He was later re-employed by the same company earning Pounds 6,000 a year less than his previous salary but then failed to gain promotion in more than a dozen internal job applications. Mr Khan went to an industrial tribunal claiming racial discrimination. The west Midlands company is not being named as part of the settlement. Mr Khan is being promoted by two grades and will receive a Pounds 2,400 salary increase.</p>

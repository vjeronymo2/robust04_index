			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Baris Selcuk and Kemal Saydamer: "Ciller </F> Guarantees Foreign Currency Accounts"]    [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has denied the rumors  that foreign currency deposit accounts will be converted into  Turkish lira and that exchange bureaus will be closed. Ciller  was shocked by reports published by Turkish newspapers yesterday  that the deposit accounts will be converted into Turkish lira  and that the exchange bureaus will be closed. She quickly  called Yaman Turuner, the head of the central bank, and Aykon  Dogan, minister of state responsible for economic affairs, from  Istanbul to instruct them to make a detailed statement.    Ciller answered a HURRIYET correspondent's question in  Eskisehir, saying: "That is out of the question. Who stands to  gain from such rumors? Even the military regimes would not put  that process into effect. I have already given an instruction  for an official statement on the affair."    Later, Aykon Dogan issued a written statement. He said:  "There is no need to intervene in foreign currency  transactions. Foreign currency is not in short supply on the  markets. No pending transfer in foreign currency exists in the  central bank or the other commercial banks."    The central bank also issued a statement. It said: "Our  people must ignore such rumors and maintain their deposits and  investments in any way they wish without anxiety."</p>

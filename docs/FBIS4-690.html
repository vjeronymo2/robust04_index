			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Police said on  Thursday [14 April] they fired rubber bullets and stun grenades  into a crowd of about 150 workers planning to stage a  demonstration in central Johannesburg, where a Zulu march last  month ended in a bloodbath.    Warrant Officer Andy Pieke said police had been sent to Park  Station to prevent crowds of marchers pouring into the city  centre, declared an unrest area after more than 50 people died  in gunbattles surrounding the Zulu march. The police spokesman  said one man fleeing the bullets on Thursday was injured when he  ran into a traffic light post and another when he smashed into a  shop window.    He said several people had been arrested and police were  still at the scene of the gathering two hours after the police  action, "monitoring" the situation. Police dispersed the group  minutes before 9AM.    W/O Pieke said the demonstrators were trade union members,  preparing for a protest march apparently connected to wage  demands.</p>

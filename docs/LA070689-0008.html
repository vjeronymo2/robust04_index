			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISA APPROVED FOR SANDINISTA AIDE TO ATTEND UCSD DESPITE U.S. BAN  </P> <P> Despite a policy barring Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista Party officials from the  United States, the State Department recently approved a visa for a Sandinista  foreign-policy expert enrolled in a UCSD summer course.  </P> <P> Ramon Meneses Martinez, director of the North American desk of the  International Relations Directorate of the Sandinista National Liberation  Front, arrived Sunday for a six-week seminar sponsored by the Center for  U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. The course is funded by a $575,000 grant  from the Ford Foundation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 25 From Latin America  </P> <P> Meneses is among 25 scholars and professionals from throughout Latin America  who are enrolled in the intensive course, which includes various U.S. topics,  including the Constitution, Congress, the presidency, mass media and political  parties. He missed the first week of the seminar while U.S. officials debated  his visa request.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Adam Shub denied Wednesday that U.S. officials are  softening their stance in a 9-month-old policy that bars most Cuban and  Nicaraguan government officials -- including members of Managua's ruling  Sandinista Party -- from this country. The ban has been in effect since  then-President Reagan issued a proclamation in October to limit the number of  Nicaraguan and Cuban officials allowed into the United States.  </P> <P> "The secretary of state is permitted to review cases on an individual basis and  allowed to grant waivers if he determines that granting a visa is in the best  interest of the United States," Shub said. "Apparently, he felt that issuing a  visa in this case was considered to be in the U.S. interest."  </P> <P> He declined to comment further and refused to say whether Meneses was issued a  visa in exchange for a similar visa for a U.S. official.  </P> <P> The visa war between the United States and Nicaragua heated up in May after the  expulsion of two diplomats from each country. Manuel Cordero, a Foreign  Ministry official in Managua, said Meneses is the first Sandinista official  allowed to travel to the United States since May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regular Contact With Embassy  </P> <P> Meneses did not return messages left for him with center officials.  </P> <P> A U.S. Embassy official in Managua said Meneses and Cordero are among the few  Sandinista officials who speak regularly with the embassy. This may explain why  the State Department relented and agreed to give Meneses a visa.  </P> <P> "We still occasionally give visas," the official said. "They asked us, and they  bugged us to let him have one, and we said OK. He's someone we talk to. We know  him. There's no earth-shaking significance to this, but maybe it will help  loosen things up a bit. Right now, their visa policy (toward the United States)  is in the deep freeze."  </P> <P> As a foreign-policy expert for the Sandinistas, Meneses has a voice in making  foreign policy and exerts influence over the Foreign Ministry, which is  officially responsible for formulating Nicaragua's foreign policy. His job also  includes monitoring U.S. newspapers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Educated in the States  </P> <P> Meneses has a BA from Cornell University and did graduate work in Hispanic  literature at Yale.  </P> <P> According to a written statement issued by the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies,  the seminar's objectives include the development of more Latin American  scholars and professionals to become specialists on the United States. UCSD  officials also hope that participants will return to their countries and help  establish U.S. studies and international studies programs at Latin American  universities.  </P> <P> Center officials said 88 people from 12 countries applied for the course's 25  positions.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux contributed to this story from Managua.  </P></p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / London's vacant office space falls CENTRAL London's empty office space fell by 7 per cent in the second half of last year, reversing a six-year trend that pushed vacancy rates up to record levels. Available office space in London, including developments due for completion within six months, peaked at 34.3m sq ft last June, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers. By the end of the year, it had fallen to 32m sq ft, equivalent to 17 per cent of the total office space in London. The main factor in reducing available space was the sharp drop in completion of new offices. The amount of new offices coming on to the market in the fourth quarter of last year fell to 2.9m sq ft, its lowest quarterly figure since 1987. In addition, the take-up of offices rose to 10.6m sq ft, an increase of 15 per cent on the previous year, but only about two-thirds of the peak annual level reached in 1989-90. DTZ Debenham Thorpe said the balance of supply and demand was likely to remain fundamentally different from that before 1987. It said total office stock in central London had increased by over a fifth since 1986 while employment levels in the financial and business services sector had dropped below 1986 levels. The oversupply of London office space has resulted in a fall in rent of about 30 per cent in the year to November 1992. In the same period, capital values have dropped by 24 per cent in the City and by 17 per cent in the West End. Central Offices Research - London, DTZ Debenham Thorpe, 44 Brook Street, London W1A 4AG.

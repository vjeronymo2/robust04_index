			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A San Diego police SWAT team was negotiating late Friday night with a man who  police said fired 30 to 40 shots at officers who had come to the hotel to  question him.  </P> <P> "He has made the statement that he's not going to be taken alive," said Officer  S. M. Lawford at the scene.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported by late Friday night, and police believed no hostages  are involved.  </P> <P> Police were planning to bring the man's girlfriend to the Western Shores Motel,  4345 Mission Bay Drive, to try to persuade the man to give up.  </P> <P> Lawford said officers went to the hotel about 8:20 p.m. Friday to question the  man, who is on parole from prison, about an attempted robbery or kidnaping. The  man opened fire, shooting 30 to 40 rounds from what is suspected to be a  semiautomatic weapon, pinning the officers down. The SWAT team arrived shortly  afterward to relieve the officers. The other rooms in the motel were cleared.  </P> <P> The motel is about a block from Mission Bay Hospital. The hospital's parking  lot was being used as a command center for the operation.  </P></p>

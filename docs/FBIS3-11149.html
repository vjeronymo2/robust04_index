			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] San Salvador Canal Doce Television in  Spanish at 1245 GMT on 16 March broadcasts live a 105-minute  debate on the topic of public security with Salvadoran  presidential candidates: Dr. Ruben Zamora, candidate for the  Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front-National Revolutionary Movement coalition; Dr. Rhina  Escalante de Rey Prendes, candidate for the Authentic Christian  Movement; Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, candidate for the Christian  Democratic Party; Edgardo Rodriguez Eigenhart, candidate for the  National Solidarity Movement; and Colonel Roberto Escobar  Garcia, candidate for the National Conciliation Party. Absent  from the debate were: Armando Calderon Sol, presidential  candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, and  Jorge Martinez Menendez, presidential candidate for the Unity  Movement. This is the second of three scheduled presidential  debates organized by Canal Doce Television in the 1994  Salvadoran presidential campaign and moderated by Mauricio Funes.    Based on a drawing, Chavez is the first to speak. When asked  what he would do to solve the problem of crime and provide  public security in El Salvador, Chavez says he has a five-point  plan to fight this problem. "We would first take security  measures to protect citizens, and secondly, we would take  judicial, corrective, and preventive measures. Finally, we  would take measures to compensate victims. As for the police  measures or measures to ensure the protection of citizens, a  very important aspect is the rescheduling of the peace  agreements in this area, which is so important for the peace  agreements. I would not like to list the other measures for  reasons of time and because I do not want to tire the television  viewer," he says. Chavez adds: "We have to increase the number  of policemen as a deterrent. Police presence is important  especially if it is strategically distributed among the  population. We have been pointing out since 1991, that there is  a need to deploy 10,000 policemen at this time. We currently  have nearly 6,000 civilian policemen, who graduated from the  Public Security Academy." Chavez ends by saying: "We have the  problem of private services to deal with, we have to fight  impunity and corruption, and we need resources to satisfy our  financial needs."    The next candidate to answer the same question is Rodriguez.  He says: "We believe the National Civilian Police, PNC, in  view of the urgent need to implement the peace agreement, has  been poorly trained. We believe the length of training was too  short. A good policeman needs approximately two years to be  well trained and he needs to be in a constant retraining stage  to have a better awareness of the laws, procedures,  investigative techniques, and human rights. We also believe  that since the deadline is rapidly approaching, the National  Police must hand over to the PNC all its equipment, weapons,  transportation and communications equipment, and all other  logistics supplies so as to immediately strengthen the PNC with  the resources already in the country without the need to incur  greater debts."    Presidential candidate Zamora, when explaining the steps he  would take to fight crime, says: "We must end the impunity  given to organized crime by the government in our country and we  must also draft judicial reforms." "We must support the  deployment and development of the PNC. Those are the three  major points of our public security policy." Zamora says that  during the first six months of his government, the following  measures would be taken: "We are going to completely review all  the irregularities in the fulfillment of the peace agreements  regarding the PNC. The UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal]  sent a letter to the UN secretary general pointing out all the  ways in which this government has failed to comply with the real  purpose of the PNC. Secondly, we also have to deploy the PNC  before September. The Police Academy says it should be ready by  September. We also have to completely reorganize the Interior  and Public Security Ministry because starting in July, the PNC  will be under the control of the Interior Ministry."    Zamora also lists his three great national campaigns. "Our  first campaign is against organized crime. Starting on 1 June  and running through 31 December we have to take exemplary  measures so that organized crime understands that if it violates  the law, it will pay for it in our government. Our second  campaign is the national disarmament campaign to collect all  weapons of war in private hands and to register weapons.  Remember that a law was passed in January to register all  weapons in private hands within a 90-day period. This government  has done nothing. An office to receive permit requests has not  even been set up. We will have to extend the 90- day grace  period and do it right so that our Armed Forces can really  conduct this campaign promptly. The third campaign is the  national campaign to clean up public administration. We are  going to fight government corruption and contraband beginning on  our first day in office."    Dr. Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, the only woman  candidate running for the Salvadoran Presidency, says she  disagrees with the dissolution of the security corps and that  "the logical thing would have been a gradual purge of the  Treasury Police and the National Guard." She adds that if she  wins the election she will review the peace agreements and  propose to the United Nations that "as long as we do not have a  well-equipped PNC with enough members, the present National  Police should continue to operate, forgetting about this year's  October deadline." She adds that "with an efficient police  force and good cooperation from citizens, we should be able to  improve justice administration to provide better guarantees to  witnesses and accelerate the proceedings to prevent bureaucracy  from discouraging citizens wishing to cooperate."    Finally, Roberto Escobar Garcia agrees with Rey Prendes and  says that "the sudden dissolution of the public security corps,  the National Guard, and the Treasury Police left a terrible void  in the country that has not been filled." He says that the PNC  should be trained to prevent crime rather than repress it and  that it must be turned into an auxiliary body within the  administration of justice.    Moderator Mauricio Funes then asks if the candidates think  the National Police can operate without the security corps and  if the current system should be kept. Chavez answers by saying  that despite the flaws the peace agreements should be observed.  "In this regard, the Armed Forces can help by conducting air  patrols. We must evidently extend the disarmament law," Chavez  says.    As for transferring resources from the National Police to  the  PNC, Rodriguez Eigenhart says: "Foreign assistance to strengthen  the PNC could be sought, but a greater budget for the PNC can be  allocated in the national budget. Every time we talk about  problems we only think about asking for foreign aid. Why not  think about curtailing public expenditures so that we do not  have to depend on what may or may not come from abroad?"    When asked about the lack of security in the streets because  of the absence of the security corps, presidential candidate  Escobar Garcia says: "We have to create a strong link between  the PNC and the Attorney General's Office. The former can  prevent crimes from being committed, and the latter can conduct  technical investigations after crimes have been committed." The  National Police has to be strengthened as much as possible even  though the foreign assistance that has been promised has not  arrived yet, Escobar Garcia says.    Chavez Mena talks about the importance of making deep  judicial, constitutional, and criminal code reforms. "We have  to classify the different types of criminals. We have to  implement new punishment alternatives and insist on solving the  impunity problem." He insists that the fundamental  responsibility for any of the mistakes that may have been  committed in the peace agreements lies with Arena's lack of  responsibility.    Finally, the candidates discuss problems of contraband,  corruption, and the breakdown of moral values in the country.</p>

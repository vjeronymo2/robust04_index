			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP PROTESTS DENIAL OF PROMOTION TO FEMINIST  </P> <P> More than 60 theologians and religious scholars have protested the decision of  Boston College to deny feminist theologian Mary Daly a promotion from associate  professor to full professor for the second time.  </P> <P> Daly, 60, has four degrees from the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and  graduate degrees from Catholic University of America and St. Mary's College in  South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> In 1966 she became the first woman to join the theology faculty at Jesuit-run  Boston College. Two years later she published her most influential work, "The  Church and the Second Sex," in which she declared that Catholic women "are  conditioned to believe that they have an irremediably inferior nature."  </P> <P> The next year the college told her they would be firing her, but following  protests from students and other faculty the university changed its mind and  granted her tenure. Her first bid for full professorship was denied without  explanation in 1975, and the university recently informed her that it has  denied her second petition for such status, which brings with it a greater  salary and increased academic prestige.  </P> <P> Father Robert Barth, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, told Daly that  the promotion committee denied her second request because of her lack of  articles in scholarly journals, "the questionable scholarliness of recent  books" she has written and her failure to take part in committee work.  </P> <P> At a recent meeting of the American Academy of Religion, 300 scholars signed a  petition that urged "the long overdue promotion of Mary Daly to full  professor." Her cause has also been taken up on campus by a group of students  and some staff who tried unsuccessfully to stage a sit-in at the residence of  Father J. Donald Monan, president of the school.  </P> <P> Among the theologians who have urged that Daly be given tenure are David Tracy,  distinguished service professor of the University of Chicago Divinity School,  who called her "one of those rare theologians whose work all theologians need  to read and respond critically to"; Harvey Cox of the Harvard Divinity School,  who said, "It is hard to imagine where the whole field of religious and  theological studies would be today were it not for the contributions she has  made"; and Margaret R. Miles of Harvard Divinity School, who described her as  "the most articulate and influential critic of religion, philosophy and society  of any person of our time."  </P> <P> Daly has described the second refusal of her application for promotion as an  example of "extreme bigotry and parochialness, as well as absolute hypocrisy  about academic freedom."  </P></p>

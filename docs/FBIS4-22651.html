			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Tishkov, director of the Institute of </F> Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences:  "The Eurasian Union As a New Symbiosis"]    [Text] Kazakhstan is an Eurasian country even though  created in its current form by the Soviet regime, it has the  required legitimacy and is going through a complicated process  of new nation building. The patrimony of the post-Soviet  space--the doctrine of ethnonationalism as the basis of  statehood--was manifested strongly in that country: half of the  population, consisting of ethnic Kazakhs, in the face of its  elite, formulated and in many ways realized the claim to  exclusive control of power, resources, and cultural space,  utilizing the thesis of "their own" statehood for "indigenous"  nations. But a multiethnic nation will be unable to function on  the basis of that doctrine since the other citizens under  conditions of even minimal democracy will not reconcile  themselves to that situation, and particularly such an ethnic  group as the Russians, which is almost as large as the Kazakh  group. Kazakh nationalism has already manifested its impatience  and intolerance in a provocative change of toponymy, language  policy, in the barring of non-Kazakhs from power, prestigious  occupations, and higher education, as well as in the immigration  policy. To some degree the manifested nationalism was explicable  as a form of therapy against the harm done to Kazakh people and  the destruction of their collective dignity by former state  regimes, as well as a means for eliminating unitary dependence  on the former center. But it is impossible to build new  statehood and a relationship with new fellow-citizens on the  basis of this doctrine and political practice, just as it is  impossible to preserve for long the contradiction in the  sovereignty of a "multinational nation" and a "Kazakh nation."  The time has arrived for making a choice, and that choice  exists, and it can also become a model for many other new states  of the former USSR.    President Nazarbayev was one of the first leaders to start  speaking about his citizens in terms of a nation state--as  Kazakhs, understanding both the real situation in the country,  and the imperatives of world norms of state building. Kazakhstan  can and must exist as a state representing the interests and  rights of all of its citizens, which is on a path toward the  creation of a multicultural civil nation. All who take part in  the socioeconomic and cultural life of the state and are loyal  to that state as their homeland, comprise the Kazakh nation. In  a cultural sense the make-up of that nation has a complex  character just as that of all other large nations of the world,  be they the Indian, British, Spanish, or the Russian nation.  Ethnic Kazakhs, as a nation, represent a competitive group in  the social and cultural aspects, capable of adopting a  nation-saving formula of "bilingualism on a multicultural basis"  and thereby providing equality for another equally strong  group--the Russians, while guaranteeing the preservation of  ethnic identity for numerous minorities. That formula, without  the reinforcing power of a special status, will grant benefits  to Kazakhs, most of whom are bilingual and have assimilated  numerous aspects of the Russian culture, which in turn promoted  their modernization. That formula will end the ambiguity of the  situation and compulsion with regard to those Kazakhs  themselves, who utilize components of the Russian culture (in  the linguistic aspect) and do not use the Kazakh language. What  is most important is that it will provide promise and faith in  their state for half of the population in the face of Russians  and Ukrainians, relieving them of false forms of solidarity of  the Cossack type and of the threat of becoming the objects of  geopolitical speculations by Russian nationalism.    Kazakh national radicals, many of whom are establishing  their  status and prosperity not through diligence and ability but  through ethnic affiliation, will not renounce their ideology  since it brings power and allows exploitation of  fellow-tribesmen as well as state resources as if on a "lawful"  basis ("this is my land"), which is no better than former  outrages. The country, however, has enough responsible and  intelligent politicians and intellectuals who could follow a  course toward creation of cross-ethnic social coalitions and a  policy of cultural pluralism instead of racing around with  ballot boxes over the territory of the former USSR collecting  votes of citizens of other countries (but with Kazakh blood) in  order to ensure a parliamentary majority. Ethnic nationalism is  myopic and primitive: its adherents do not care if one or  another force or group is deprived of the vote, it prefers "the  solution." That is an axiom of political science. Kazakhstan  society, which is characterized by a high level of tolerance,  has not yet been corroded that deeply by ethnonationalism which  still remains an exercise of the elite elements and some of the  youth. On the Russian side, most of its recruits are probably  veterans, but the younger elements are also now being heard. The  faster it is possible to replace it with civil nationalism, i.e.  all-Kazakh patriotism, the better the future faced by that  country.    The latest proposal by Nazarbayev concerning creation of the  Eurasian Union appears to be exceptionally important since the  powerful economic and socio-cultural symbiosis between  Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and a number of other post-Soviet  states is preserved, and it is wiser to utilize it for common  welfare of the people without its breakup by rigid borders  which, at least between these three states, the politicians of  our generation will not be able to impose on the population. It  will not harm either the sovereignty nor the culture of the  nations and may prevent some tragic errors. It is gratifying  that Nazarbayev's initiative received the support of many  important politicians, for example, that of Sergey Shakhray.</p>

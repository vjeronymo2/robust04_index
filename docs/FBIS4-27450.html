			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan by unidentified </F> station correspondent on 31 May; place not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] [Correspondent] My respects to His Excellency Mr.  Chairman. You just returned from the roundtable in Pyongyang.  How did this meeting proceed?    [Khieu Samphan] I thank you, who represent the Voice of the  Great National Union Front of Cambodia. The Party of Democratic  Kampuchea [PDK] was very glad that a roundtable was held among  all Cambodian parties, for it was the profound aspiration of our  entire nation and people. Our nation and people had called  repeatedly for such a roundtable, but it had not been possible  because of opposition.    I led a delegation of Democratic Kampuchea to the roundtable  with a profound desire for national reconciliation and peace so  that all our forces become reunified, our country can enjoy true  and lasting peace, and all our people both in the countryside  and in Phnom Penh who have been victims of the war and have  suffered for so many years get a chance to live and work in  peace and happiness. I joined the meeting with those wishes in  mind.    The PDK sought by all means to hold sincere discussions and  consultations so that the aspirations of our nation and people  for national reconciliation and peace can be achieved as soon as  possible.    [Correspondent] As a matter of fact, what proposals did the  PDK make so that national reconciliation and peace can be  achieved?    [Khieu Samphan] For national reconciliation, I proposed that  consultations be held to work out a formulation, that is, to  formulate a minimal policy program according to which all  parties would agree to set up a national government and national  army of which all Cambodian parties would be members. The  consultations should be made in the spirit of reconciliation and  all parties should make concessions to one another as suggested  all along by the king. We should look into possible ways to let  the PDK join a national government and a national army, ways to  bring all Cambodian parties into the national government and  national army, and ways for the PDK to transfer the zones that  it controls to the national government and for its army to be  integrated into the national army.    Most important of all, however, was the fact that we should  consult with one another so we can agree on a minimal policy  program first. Only after we have this minimal policy program  do we have a specific basis that all parties can accept and  follow, both now that we are working on national reconciliation  and in the future when the national government and national army  with all Cambodian parties as members will begin their  operations.    [Correspondent] What reaction did the two-headed government  have to your proposal?    [Khieu Samphan] Hun Sen was the one who talked on behalf of  the two-headed government. He only talked about a cease-fire.  He did not say anything about national reconciliation or how to  bring about lasting peace. He refused to talk about national  reconciliation and national concord. On the contrary, he put  forth three points which were conditions set by the communist  Vietnamese and the alliance to do away with the PDK and block  national reconciliation and peace.    In my opinion, the national forces of all parties should be  brought together on the basis of a clear-cut policy program  accepted by everybody to achieve national reconciliation. This  does not mean that a party should be integrated into another  party.    Up to the present, there has never been national  reconciliation; there has been only war. If we continue on the  old road, there will never be national reconciliation at all;  the foreigners will continue to interfere, to ignite the war.  For this reason, we should work for national reconciliation and  for a permanent end to the war. In order to achieve national  reconciliation and put a permanent end to the war, there should  be a minimal policy program that all parties agree to accept and  implement.    This minimal policy program is a commitment to be respected  by both Cambodians and foreigners in Cambodia alike. So far,  there has never been any national reconciliation or rallying of  the national forces. It is for this reason that the foreigners  -- be it the Vietnamese or the alliance -- have interfered in  our affairs and continued to ignite the war that lays waste to  our country. National reconciliation and the rallying of  national forces is more important than anything else. It is the  water that could put out the flames of war. It directly  concerns the life or death of our Cambodian nation and race.    [Correspondent] Why did Hun Sen refuse to talk about  national reconciliation and insist only on the cease-fire  without any specific supervision?    [Khieu Samphan] During the meeting, I repeatedly stressed  that the key to the problem is national reconciliation. All  Cambodian parties must do their best to forge national  reconciliation in order to end the war at its roots. The  cease-fire issue should be settled within the framework of a  solution on national reconciliation. We should not have a  cease-fire just in order to make preparations for further  fighting.    I recalled to mind some past experiences in the world. I  cited the example of the communist Vietnamese taking advantage  of the 1968 Tet cease-fire in order to prepare forces and send  arms to attack Saigon. I also recalled the experiences of our  own nation. The Paris agreement was a very important document.  It was a document of international stature. Its objective was  clear:    1. To supervise the withdrawal of all foreign forces from  Cambodia.    2. To secure a quadripartite national reconciliation in  the form of the Supreme National Council with the then head of  state Prince Norodom Sihanouk as chairman.    But the Paris agreement was torn to shreds and trampled  underfoot. There was no supervision to ascertain that the  foreign forces --namely, the aggressor communist Vietnamese  forces -- had completely withdrawn from Cambodia. The  quadripartite Supreme National Council was given no significant  role at all. The quadripartite national reconciliation was  aborted. Attempts were made to eliminate and destroy the PDK.  All these incidents were about foreigners opposing our national  reconciliation and continuing to ignite the flames of war. To  this day, everybody knows how badly the war has affected our  nation. Despite all of that, I informed the meeting  participants that so long as we Cambodians tried our best we  would succeed as we had all the capabilities and the support of  our nation and people in achieving national reconciliation and  true and lasting peace.    I repeatedly talked about it and yet the others insisted  they  did not hear, they did not understand, and they did not agree to  discuss the question of national reconciliation. To accept  national reconciliation means to stop seeking each other's  destruction, to stop fighting each other forever, and to join  hands in solving all problems, large or small, of the nation.  Why did they refuse to discuss national reconciliation? It was  known to all that before and during the roundtable the United  States, Australia, and France were very busy mustering arms for  the two-headed government. They talked outwardly about a  cease-fire, but in concrete actions they were preparing forces  and weapons to continue igniting the flames of war. In fact,  they needed the time to prepare forces, muster arms, and  transport them for stockpiling on each battlefield so they could  continue to ignite the war against their own nation and people.    [Correspondent] In your opinion, what will happen in the  future?    [Khieu Samphan] It is my prayer that there will be national  reconciliation and genuine peace so that our nation and people  can be happy and live their normal lives. The entire Democratic  Kampuchea, the entire Cambodian nation and people want national  reconciliation and peace. All of us want to continue the  consultations and discussions in order to find a way to solve  the national reconciliation problem. Our nation and people  clearly see who continues to ignite the war and cause them  suffering, deaths, separations, woes, and pains. They are:    1. The communist Vietnamese who continue to ignite their war  of aggression in Cambodia so they can take the opportunity to  send Vietnamese nationals into Cambodia as illegal immigrants in  accordance with their strategy of swallowing up Cambodia through  demographic warfare.    2. The Western alliance bad elements who join hands with the  communist Vietnamese in continuing to ignite the latter's war of  aggression so they can take the opportunity to interfere in  Cambodia's Internal affairs and push Cambodia into their sphere  of influence.    Our nation and people clearly know and see who are  continuing  to follow and abide by the orders of the foreigners who oppose  national reconciliation and continue igniting the flames of war.  Our people are opposed resolutely to these elements.    Our nation and people are well aware of the roots of their  sorrow and misery. National problems have not been solved nor  have we solved social problems. On the contrary, they have  steadily deteriorated and placed heavy pressure on the  livelihood of each family both in Phnom Penh and the  countryside. Therefore, the desire for national reconciliation,  the desire for a permanent end to the war has become the wishes,  the vital aspirations of each family of our people. It has  become an extraordinarily powerful force that calls for national  reconciliation, an end to the war, and peace -- a force opposed  to foreigners providing arms to the two-headed government to  enable it to continue igniting the war, opposed to forcible  recruitment, and opposed to forcing the people to serve as  militiamen and reserve forces for inter-Cambodia killings.    Our nation and people have seen through the ugly schemes of  the communist Vietnamese, alliance, and two-headed government.  Our nation and people, our entire nation is resolutely opposed  to all these dark designs. This is the invincible force driving  for national reconciliation.</p>

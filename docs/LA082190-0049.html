			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Airlines Will Meet to Discuss Fuel Costs: The world's major airlines will  convene in Geneva next week to discuss whether to charge more because of higher  fuel costs caused by the Persian Gulf crisis. The meeting, Aug. 29-31, was  called by the International Air Transport Assn, a group of 191 scheduled  airlines, to decide on a unified strategy as rising oil prices inflate fuel  bills that make up 15% of operating costs. Crude oil is trading above $27 a  barrel, compared to about $15 in June.  </P></p>

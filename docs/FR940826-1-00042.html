			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;413.180(g), we propose to codify in regulations section 1881(b)(7) of the Act by providing that unless HCFA disapproves a composite rate exception request within 60 working days after it is filed with its intermediary, the exception is deemed approved. We believe the Congress viewed the 60 days as beginning when we have a fully documented exception request. Therefore, the first day for counting the 60 working days is the date that the exception request is filed with all required documentation with the intermediary, not the date it was mailed nor the date postmarked on the package. For this reason, facilities are advised to send their requests by a method that documents the date of receipt during the intermediary's regular business hours. We would require that intermediaries review and process all exception requests within 15 working days, and we would process the exceptions within 45 working days. If we fail to process a composite rate exception request timely, we would deem the renal facility's rate request approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 413.182&blank;Criteria for Approval of Exception Requests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We propose to redesignate the content of &sect;413.170(g), criteria for approval of exception requests, as &sect;413.182. In this section we would list the criteria that may be the basis of a rate exception. These criteria are: Atypical service intensity (patient mix), as specified in a new &sect;413.184; Isolated essential facility (new &sect;413.186); Extraordinary circumstances (new &sect;413.188); Self-dialysis training costs (new &sect;413.190); or Frequency of dialysis (new &sect;413.192).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA occasionally receives one-month time studies from facilities attempting to show that they are entitled to an exception. HCFA does not require one-month time studies and has not considered a one-month time study as adequate documentation to justify an exception. In the event that a time study is used, an applicant should refer to the general Medicare principles regarding the adequacy of periodic time sampling described in chapter 23 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual (HCFA Publication 15&hyph;1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 413.184&blank;Payment Exception: Atypical Service Intensity (Patient Mix) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In new &sect;413.184, paragraph (a) would repeat the content of existing &sect;413.170(g)(1). We would specify in a new paragraph (b) the documentation required of a facility requesting a rate exception under this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would require that a facility submit a list of all outpatient dialysis patients (including all home patients) treated during the most recently completed fiscal or calendar year showing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients who received transplants, including the date of transplant;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients awaiting a transplant who are medically able, have given consent, and are on an active transplant list, and projected transplants;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Home patients;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Infacility patients, staff assisted or self-dialysis;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Individual patient diagnoses;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Diabetic patients;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients isolated because of a contagious disease;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Age of patients;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Mortality rate broken out by age and diagnosis;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Number of patient transfers, reasons for transfers and any related information; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Total number of hospital admissions for the facility's patients, reason for, and length of stay for, each admission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When adjudicating exception requests, to determine if a substantial proportion of the facility's outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments involve more intense dialysis services and special dialysis procedures, HCFA will compare the above data submitted by providers to data contained in HCFA's Patient Profile Tables. The information in the Tables is developed annually and represents information on persons with end-stage renal disease covered by Medicare. While the number of treatments is used when determining whether a facility furnishes a substantial proportion of treatments to atypical patients, it is the typical or the atypical patient mix that generates the total treatment count used in this determination. In determining whether a facility's patients are atypically sick, each patient category is individually compared to its corresponding specific norm (national average). Various combinations of factors might lead to a determination that a facility has an atypical patient mix. For example, a facility might qualify for an exception for atypical patient mix if the percentage of its diabetic patients, older patients, and mortality rate were significantly higher than the national averages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By its very nature, an exceptions process addresses situations that are not anticipated, and, because of the myriad combinations of factors that are possible, we cannot articulate a single specific standard that encompasses all of these situations. Instead, HCFA will evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis to determine if the characteristics of the patient population are such that it might be beyond the facility's control to incur higher costs. (Facilities will still have to demonstrate that the atypical patient mix, in fact, caused higher costs.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would also require that a facility submit the following documentation on nursing personnel (registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), technicians and aides) costs incurred during the most recently completed fiscal or calendar year cost report showing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amount of remuneration of each employee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Number of personnel;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amount of time spent in the dialysis unit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Staff to patient ratio based on total hours, with an analysis of productive and nonproductive hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facility must demonstrate that its nursing personnel costs have been allocated properly between each mode of care, and that the additional nursing hours per treatment are not the result of an excess number of employees in the outpatient maintenance renal dialysis department. Normally, when determining whether there is an excess number of employees assigned to a facility's dialysis department, HCFA uses staff to patient ratios. However, in addition to the staff to patient ratios, we might also consider staffing schedules, as previously discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When adjudicating exception requests, HCFA will utilize the above data to determine if the facility's patients received significantly more nursing hours per treatment than patients would receive in other facilities and whether the facility's higher per treatment costs were necessitated by the special needs of the patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would also require that a facility submit documentation on supply costs incurred during the most recently completed fiscal or calendar year cost report showing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;By modality, a complete list of supplies used routinely in a dialysis treatment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The make and model number of dialyzer and component cost of each dialyzer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facility must demonstrate that excess supply cost per treatment is caused by the special needs of the patients and is not the result of inefficiency. The facility must submit documentation to demonstrate that it prudently purchases items and services (for example, uses bulk purchase discounts when available).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

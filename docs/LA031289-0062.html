			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> President Bush continues to enjoy a large measure of public confidence. In a  recent Gallup Poll, more than six in 10 (63%) approve of Bush's performance in  office, while only 13% disapprove and 24% are undecided -- similar to the job  ratings given Bush's predecessors at comparable points in their tenure. In  Gallup's first assessment in late January, 51% approved and 6% disapproved of  Bush's job performance, with 43% undecided. Refuting criticism of the White  House as lacking a clear sense of purpose, Americans of all political stripes  commend Bush for the job he has done in communicating his policies and agenda.  And, although the public opposed Senate confirmation of former Sen. John Tower  as secretary of defense, a solid majority (55%) approves of Bush's Cabinet  appointments in general.  </P></p>

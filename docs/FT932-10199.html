			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Russians set date for Rbs1bn issue THE RUSSIAN authorities plan to press ahead with their often-postponed first Treasury bill issue on May 18. The issue will be for Rbs1bn worth of three-month Treasury bills to make a start in financing the country's enormous budget deficit without printing money. The Treasury bill market, however, will initially be closed to foreigners. Mr Andrei Kozlov, the central bank official handling the issue, said the bills would be sold at a discount likely to produce a 100 per cent annual yield, well below inflation currently running at 1,100 per cent a year. But he said that Russian commercial banks and exporters would have an incentive to buy the bills. It would be better than keeping huge amounts of vital cash to compensate for the fact that the Russian central bank can take weeks or months to transfer money through its rickety payments system. 'We are promising instant liquidity,' Mr Kozlov said The central bank also has a habit of hanging on to rapidly-depreciating roubles owed to exporters who have to sell 30 per cent of their hard currency earnings to it. Mr Alexei Kuznetsov, acting chairman of Incombank, one of 20 official dealers, said the issue would be attractive if banks could hold part of their reserves in the form of treasury bills. The current reserve requirement is 20 per cent. Mr Pavel Zhikharev, chairman of Sberbank, the country's nationwide savings bank, which until recently had its deposits simply appropriated by the government to help finance the budget deficit, said his bank was likely to buy the bills. He added that this was on condition that the bills would indeed yield 100 per cent and not be subject to tax, as promised by the authorities. Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, who has long insisted the authorities start to finance the budget deficit using 'civilised' methods such as treasury bills, complained recently that high inflation would make it difficult to 'sell a decent amount' of them. But Ms Bella Zlatkis, head of the finance ministry's securities department, said the government proposed to sell a total of Rbs1,000bn worth of Treasury bills this year - compared with an expected budget deficit of several thousand billion roubles. She said two experimental auctions had already shown there would be demand for the paper, but she was hoping the central bank would make it compulsory for commercial banks to hold some of their reserves in the form of Treasury bills. Mr Kozlov has so far resisted making this compulsory.</p>

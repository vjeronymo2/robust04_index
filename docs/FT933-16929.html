			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Letter: Political donation by consensus Sir, In decision taking regarding political donations, some directors of public companies may be unconsciously influenced by their personal political views rather than by any perception of commercial benefit to their companies. A number of leading companies do not, however, make political donations and it may be worth recalling the initiative taken by a highly regarded multinational, Unilever. It consulted all its shareholders on a 'one shareholder, one vote' basis, resulting in a narrow majority in favour of political donations. But, as the result was finely balanced, the board of Unilever decided not to go ahead. The steps taken by Unilever, perhaps carried out periodically, could provide the basis for reform to resolve this contentious issue of political donations to public companies.

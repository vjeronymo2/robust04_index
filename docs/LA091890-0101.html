			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: JOSH IRELAND  </P> <P> School: Santa Margarita High School  </P> <P> Sport: Football  </P> <P> Position: Running back/free safety  </P> <P> Class: Junior  </P> <P> Ireland's statistics -- 237 yards in 16 carries and four receptions for 70  yards and three touchdowns -- indicate he had an all-round performance in Santa  Margarita's game against University Friday. But those numbers don't show the  crucial plays Ireland made that made the Eagles' drive for a game-winning field  goal possible.  </P> <P> In the first half, Ireland had touchdown runs of 45 and 83 yards and caught an  eight-yard touchdown pass from Trevor Yankoff, which helped the Eagles take a  21-7 lead at halftime. University rallied to tie the score, 21-21, and with  less than two minutes remaining, Ireland returned the kickoff 30 yards to give  Santa Margarita to ball on its 40-yard line. A few plays later, Ireland caught  a 30-yard pass from Yankoff, putting the ball on the 7, from which Travis  Lucero kicked the game-winner field goal. Ireland, who was an all-Division IX  defensive back last season, also made three unassisted tackles and knocked down  a pass.  </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> Sean Saunders, who rushed 17 times for 203 yards and scored touchdowns on runs  of 60, 73 and 5 yards in Foothill's 28-23 victory over Woodbridge Friday.  </P> <P> Jason Johnson, who gained 207 yards in 29 carries and scored two touchdowns in  La Habra's 26-7 victory over Bolsa Grande Friday.  </P> <P> Kevin Eggert, who scored 27 goals in the Capistrano Valley water polo team's  five matches in the Millikan Tournament. Eggert scored six points in the  Cougars' 13-7 victory over Miraleste in the finals Saturday.  </P> <P> Mark Gonzales, who was named the athlete of the meet after running three miles  in 15 minutes 9 seconds, the fastest time of the meet, in the small-schools  race at the Woodbridge Invitational Saturday.  </P></p>

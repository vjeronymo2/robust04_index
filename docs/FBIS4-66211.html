			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Du Yong [2629 3144]: "What Do We Know About </F> Our Older Single Population?--China's Older Single Population  Between the Ages of 30 and 44 Has Reached 7.86 Million"]    [Text] The most recent data from the State Statistical  Bureau shows that by 1990, China's older unmarried [single]  population between the ages of 30 and 44 had reached 7.86  million, more than the population of Hainan Province (6.55  million), including 7.4072 million men and 454,600 women,  meaning that the men outnumbered the women by [nearly] 16.4 to 1.    As to the unmarried rate of this older population, the  single  rate in the 30-44 age group is 6.09 percent for men, but only  0.4 percent for women.    Of the older single population, 77 percent (over 6 million)  are aged 30-39, while only 23 percent are 40-44 years old.    The urban-rural distribution of China's older single  population contrasts sharply by sex: the men are located mainly  in rural areas, numbering 6.04 million, or about 81.62 percent  of the older single male population; the women are located  mostly in cities, numbering 300,000, or approximately 67 percent  of the older single female population.    As to the numbers of older single people living in urban and  rural areas, rural males (6.04 million) outnumber urban males  (1.36 million) by [nearly] 4.5 to 1, while urban females  (300,000) outnumber rural females by 2 to 1, leaving the sex  ratio for the rural single population even more glaringly  lopsided, with men outnumbering women by 40 to 1. Among the  older male population, the single rates are highest for  illiterates and semiliterates, reaching 22.02 percent and 21.65  percent for urban and rural areas respectively, meaning that 1  of 5 older illiterate and semiliterate [men] are unmarried; the  unmarried rates for men with grade school educations are  obviously lower, respectively at 5.05 percent and 7.73 percent;  the single rates for men with high school and technical  educations are lowest, respectively at 1.45 percent and 0.07  percent; the unmarried rate for college-educated men is about 3  percent. The impact of educational level on the single rate  for older women is: the unmarried rates are highest for  college educated women, at 2.07 percent in the rural areas and  4.98 percent in the cities, meaning that 1 of 20 older urban  women with college degrees are unmarried; the single rates for  older illiterate and semiliterate women are lower (0.29 percent  for the rural areas and 0.73 percent for cities); the unmarried  rates are lowest for women with grade school educations (0.09  percent for the rural areas and 0.31 percent for the cities). So  China's current 2.02 million older, single, illiterate and  semiliterate men (of whom 1.81 million live in rural areas), and  48,000 college-educated, older, single women (of whom 45,000  live in cities), have become the priority and difficulty of our  older single population.    While our older single population are generally manual  workers, this is not so by sex. Census data show the unmarried  rate to be high for older male manual workers, as well as for  older female mental workers. The unmarried rates for older  working men by occupation are: as high as 7.95 percent for  workers in farming, forestry, livestock raising, and fishery,  and 2 to 7 percent for other manual workers, but at only 0.33 to  1.37 percent for mental workers, such as all types of  specialized technicians, obviously lower than for manual  workers. But the single rate for older working women by  occupation is just the opposite, averaging the highest at 1.35  percent for all types of specialized technicians, office  workers, and related personnel, but lowest at only 0.31 percent  for workers in farming, forestry, livestock raising, and fishery.    Editor's postscript: This information tells us that  the crux of the difficulty in solving the spouse problem of the  older single population are the gaps in features, such as  numbers of men and women, distribution, and social, economic,  and educational level. If marriage perceptions continue to  follow the tradition of "men not marrying up and women not  marrying down," the problem will be even harder. Meanwhile,  under China's current socio-economic situation of still  incomplete social security and service systems, as time passes,  millions of older single people will gradually reach middle and  old age, with their health, feeding, and housing bringing  varying degrees of particular difficulties. So how to care for  and help them will be a crucial matter requiring the attention  of our whole society now and for a long time to come.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Bottom Line): T&amp;N changes gear as motor industry suffers T&amp;N's Pounds 119m rights issue, announced this week alongside 2,500 job cuts, epitomises the twin pressures on UK motor component companies. Their profits have been affected by falling vehicle production in almost every market except Germany, but they feel impelled to carry on investing in cost-saving machinery to stay internationally competitive, particularly against the Japanese. The first point is illustrated by some gloomy figures showing the downward slide of car sales. In the UK, the number sold fell from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 2m last year, with 1.6m to 1.7m forecast for 1991. France and Spain had first-quarter falls of more than 20 per cent, and US sales were nearly 20 per cent lower in the first two months. The urge to modernise can be easily understood in the light of a recent study for the European Commission by the Boston Consulting Group and PRS Consulting International. Called The Competitive Challenge Facing the European Automotive Components Industry, it says the Europeans lag behind the Japanese in terms of productivity, quality, speed of design and development, and product costs. Against this background, Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, explained the rights issue in this way: 'In weak international market conditions, we have not generated the cash flow to continue our investment programme with moderate gearing.' The Pounds 119m proceeds will help to relieve borrowings that had risen to Pounds 248m by December, giving debt-equity gearing of 49 per cent. Although 1990 also saw a rights issue - a one-for-three to raise Pounds 127m - it was absorbed by the Dollars 190m (Pounds 111m) purchase of JP Industries, a US motor parts maker. Meanwhile the capital spending programme goes on with Pounds 89m laid out last year and more than Pounds 80m budgeted for 1991. In the last five years, T&amp;N said Pounds 327m had been spent on modernising factories, developing products and rationalisation. A further Pounds 605m, net of disposals, had gone on acquisitions. The record is held by the Pounds 278m purchase of the engineering group AE, completed in early 1987. Leaving aside the reasons Hope volunteered for this week's issue, it is also significant that the dividend payment was one of the main points of the announcement. The board said it intended to maintain the total at 10.85p this year, a figure only 1.4 times covered by 1990 earnings per share of 15.45p. Earnings could decline by 30 per cent this year. So in addition to its high spending programme, T&amp;N continues as a high yield stock: 10.3 per cent on the issue price of 140p and 8.8 per cent on yesterday's close of 163p. This is some compensation for a share price that has not regained its July 1987 peak of 319p. Since 1986, it has underperformed the market by about 50 per cent. Its earnings record is a miserable minus 9.5 per cent a year compound as the pile of shares in issue has mounted. A glance at the group's history, however, helps explain why the group has expended such effort and shows that it is in radically better shape than during the 1981-82 recession. At the start of the last decade, the then Turner and Newall was the country's largest producer of asbestos-related products. The legacy of compensation claims has taken about 1 per cent of group sales each year, with occasional extra shocks. Turner and Newall's decline culminated in taxable losses of Pounds 19.3m in 1982 and the group was close to collapse. The Bank of England helped to arrange a stay of execution and Sir Francis Tombs was installed as chairman. Apart from completing a programme of cuts that saw the UK workforce fall from 22,500 in 1979 to 10,500 in 1983, the business changed direction. The dependence on asbestos was reduced, and automotive and industrial components were built up. Pre-tax profit reached a record level of Pounds 91m in 1988 on sales which toped Pounds 1bn for the first time. But T&amp;N faltered before some of its competitors. Although operating profit continued to grow in 1989 to Pounds 123m, a bulge in the asbestos-related liabilities and high interest costs reduced the pre-tax figure to Pounds 84m. Last year profits declined 16 per cent to Pounds 70.5m. Sharp falls were registered on the continent as well as in the UK. The fall in operating profit from automotive components, from Pounds 71.3m to Pounds 44.8m, was partly offset by an improvement in engineering and industrial. The latter division overtook motor, recording Pounds 61.8m of operating profits. Those figures included the effect of Pounds 14m of redundancy costs and the latest wave of job cuts, which will reduce the worldwide workforce to less than 40,000, will cost another Pounds 7m. Hope believes that the benefits of lower costs will coincide with an upturn in demand later this year to revive pre-tax profit. However, the benefits to shareholders when the recovery comes will be held up by the extra shares in issue.</p>

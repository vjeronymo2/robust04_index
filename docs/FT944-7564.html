			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Non-stop to the private sector: Why the route to stock market flotation is being speeded up for Railtrack The privatisation of Railtrack, the company which owns British Rail's track, signalling and stations, will be announced by Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, this afternoon. If leaked official documents obtained by Mr Michael Meacher, shadow transport secretary, are to be believed, the government has set a target date of the first three months of 1996 for the stock market flotation. Railtrack is the single largest element in the newly fragmented British railway network and a key to the success or failure of the privatisation programme. Its role is to rent its track and stations to the train operators. With a possible market value of about Pounds 4bn, the company's move to market will provide a significant boost to public funds and a considerable challenge for the City. Such a rapid move into the private sector did not feature in the government's original plans for the railway industry. The original intention was to keep Railtrack in the public sector while the passenger and freight train operations were franchised or sold off. But the government has been forced to make the timetable tighter because of its poor showing in the opinion polls. Labour has threatened to return the railway to public ownership if it wins a general election in late 1996 or early 1997, an objective which would be difficult to achieve if substantial parts of the network were functioning well in private hands. On top of the political constraints, the government has had to contend with delays in privatising the other parts of the network - compounded by a four-month signal workers' strike this summer. Reaching agreement on the hundreds of contracts required to regulate relations between the new players in the railway market is proving far more time-consuming than at first thought. Mr Robert Horton, the chairman of Railtrack, has characterised this process as being no different to retailer Marks and Spencer reaching agreement with suppliers. But for a centralised railway used to operating by memo and the rule book, ordering matters by commercial contract is a new experience. The pace of Railtrack's privatisation has also been driven by ambitions among the company's management. Mr Horton, a hard-driving, former chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum, is keen to take his company into the private sector as soon as possible. Endless meetings with civil servants are not to his taste, he says. For all the excitement generated by the prospect of the government's announcement, there is as yet very little information for the City to use in evaluating Railtrack. Investors are like commuters asked to buy a ticket for a revolutionary new train which is not due to come into service for at least 18 months. Among uncertainties over Railtrack are: The attitude of the rail regulator, Mr John Swift, to the charges Railtrack plans to levy on train operating companies. Mr Swift has expressed concerns about Railtrack's monopoly and the high level of returns on assets the Treasury expects the company to make. He could impose tight constraints on Railtrack's charges. The details of the access agreements being negotiated between Railtrack and the passenger train operators. These should be finalised within the next few months. Matters such as compensation arrangements in the event of the collapse of an embankment will affect Railtrack's profits. The extent to which the Treasury is prepared to maintain subsidies to the train operators. These will be passed on to Railtrack in the form of access payments. The franchising director, Mr Roger Salmon, believes he has firm commitments from the Treasury but private investors may not be reassured. The first exploratory analysis of Railtrack's prospects - published last week by Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank - estimated its market value at between Pounds 3.3bn and Pounds 4.3bn, considerably less than the notional Pounds 6.5bn Treasury valuation of its assets. It is perhaps fortunate that the City will have more than 12 months to refine its calculations and to reconcile the numbers.</p>

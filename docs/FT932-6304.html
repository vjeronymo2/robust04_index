			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US tax sellers hit ICI THE RAPIDLY approaching break-up of ICI saw the chemical giant's shares crank downwards against the market ahead of the key meeting today to give the final nod to demerger. On Tuesday, the chemical rump is set to begin trading as ICI and the bioscience side as Zeneca. Yesterday's slide was inspired by selling of ICI shares in the US, where funds currently holding a total of some 8 per cent of the outstanding equity face a tax charge. The new Zeneca shares are to be treated as income in the US and some investors are expected to sidestep the tax burden by selling ICI and using the cash raised to buy into ICI 'new' or Zeneca afterwards. The situation was the same in the UK but the company instigated a test case in April which ruled that Zeneca shares could be treated as capital. Existing ICI shares fell 12 1/2 to 1255p yesterday. ICI new lost 10 to 614p in spite of weighty research by Smith New Court, which expects the slimmed down company's earnings to treble between now and 1995. James Capel, however, feels that earnings recovery is already discounted by the current price and prefers Zeneca, which was marginally firmer yesterday at 640p ex-rights, and 3 ahead at 44p in the nil-paid stock.</p>

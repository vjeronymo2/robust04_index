			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Sweden to retain 25% of Celsius THE Swedish government will retain a minority stake of 25 per cent in Celsius Industries after this summer's privatisation of the country's leading defence group. A further 21 per cent of shares are to be taken up by four Swedish financial institutions, while 43 per cent will be offered to domestic and foreign investors, Celsius employees and the general public, according to the government. The remaining 11 per cent will be owned by Nobel Industries, which sold its defence electronics activities to Celsius for SKr1.55bn (Dollars 209m) in February. The shares have not been priced, but the group's value is estimated at SKr3bn. The new structure ensures Celsius remains in Swedish hands. There are no formal restrictions on foreign ownership but the state retains the right to block hostile foreign bids.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARPENTER AND GORSKI UPSTAGED BY CANADIAN  </P> <P> Curt Harnett of Thunder Bay, Canada, upstaged U.S. Olympians Ken Carpenter and  Mark Gorski Saturday to win the men's match sprints in the Sundance Grand Prix  of Cycling at the Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> Harnett, a former hockey player who originally took up cycling to keep in shape  in the summer, defeated Carpenter in the best-of-three final, overtaking the  reigning U.S. champion in the final 50 meters of the third race.  </P> <P> Carpenter set the pace in the decisive race, pulling ahead of the Canadian  champion with about 1 1/2 laps remaining in the three-lap race.  </P> <P> "I was attacking him from behind, trying to get underneath him and get in front  of him with about half a lap to go," Harnett said of Carpenter, who was  eliminated from the competition by Harnett last year at the Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> Harnett, who will be 24 today, never did get underneath Carpenter, instead  passing on the outside as the riders came off the last turn.  </P> <P> "I just had a little bit more than him," Harnett said.  </P> <P> Gorski, who was beaten by Carpenter in the semifinals, finished fourth, losing  in the third-place match to Paul Swift of Kenosha, Wis.  </P> <P> In other finals:  </P> <P>  -- Connie Paraskevin Young of Indianapolis, a three-time world champion in the  event and a bronze medalist last year in the Seoul Olympics, won the women's  match sprints, beating Carpenter's fiance, Renee Duprel of Bellevue, Wash., in  the best-of-three final, 2-0.  </P> <P>  -- Dan Frost of Denmark, gold medalist in the points race at Seoul, won the  men's individual pursuit, essentially a race against the clock in which the  competitors start at opposite ends of the track and attempt to catch one  another. Frost, 27, was the only track cycling gold medalist at Seoul who was  not from an Eastern-bloc country.  </P> <P>  -- Madonna Harris of Park City, Utah, who competed last year for her native  New Zealand in the women's road race at Seoul and in cross-country skiing at  the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, won the women's pursuit.  </P> <P>  -- Shaun Wallace of England, a former world-record holder in the flying  one-kilometer time trial, won the men's miss and out, a race of attrition in  which the last rider across the line at the end of each lap is eliminated from  the competition.  </P> <P>  -- Swift won the men's keirin, a six-lap race in which the riders are led  around the track for all but the last 400 meters of the competition by a pace  vehicle, in this case a motorcycle.  </P> <P> Swift finished about half a bike length in front of Nelson Vails, who was the  silver medalist in the match sprints at the 1984 Olympics.  </P> <P>  -- Duprel won the women's 10-kilometer points race.  </P> <P> Finishing second in the points race was Janie Eickhoff, 18, of Los Alamitos,  who was third in the sprints, third in the pursuit and, on Thursday night, won  the miss and out.  </P> <P> More than two hours after the event was completed Friday night, race officials  determined that Frost, who won the event at a longer distance at Seoul, was the  winner of the 30-kilometer men's point race.  </P></p>

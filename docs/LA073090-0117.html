			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPANESE PRESS FOR RICE IMPORT  </P> <P> Japan should offer to liberalize its closed rice market before the scheduled  end of global trade talks in December, a group of 20 top Japanese academics  said today.  </P> <P> "It's time to play our own card on reform, because if the current talks on  reforming farm trade fail to bear fruit, Japan's farm sector will receive a  major blow," Yujiro Hayami, professor of international economics at Aoyama  Gakuin University and chairman of the Forum for Policy Innovation, told  reporters.  </P> <P> Japan has come under heavy international criticism for its ban on all  commercial imports of rice, which it defends on the ground that it must remain  self-sufficient in the national staple grain for security reasons.  </P> <P> The academics proposed that Japan start liberalizing by importing 200,000 tons,  or 2% of its total annual demand, in 1992, and that this quota be increased by  10% a year to 300,000 tons.  </P></p>

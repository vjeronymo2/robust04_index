However, Section 106(b) prohibits a bank from engaging in these same activities on condition that the customer obtain any additional credit or services from any affiliate. The Board may, by regulation or order, grant exceptions that are not contrary to the purposes of the section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Citicorp contends that its request is consistent with the purposes of Section 106(b) because it is not anticompetitive. Citicorp argues that the market for mortgage loans is national in scope and highly competitive. In this regard, Citicorp asserts that it does not have sufficient market power in any relevant market to restrain competition and that the highly competitive mortgage lending market prevents any mortgage lender from having sufficient market power to restrain competition in the market or force a consumer to purchase a product on uncompetitive terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, Citicorp argues that its proposal is not anticompetitive because customers would not be required either directly or indirectly to accept one product in order to obtain another product. In this regard, Citicorp states that all products would be available separately at separate prices and the prices of products would be kept competitive through normal market forces. Citicorp also claims that customers would be free to choose to purchase combined or separate services from Citicorp affiliates or from competitors. Finally, Citicorp contends that the proposal would promote competition and provide public benefits in the form of reduced costs and better service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Citicorp's request is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the request and does not represent a determination by the Board that the request meets or is likely to meet the standards of Section 106(b). The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than July 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jennifer J.

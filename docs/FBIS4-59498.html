			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Weekly Events" review by Fu'ad Da'bul] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] As peace knocks on Lebanese and  Arab doors, the country's top three leaders [president, speaker  of the Chamber of Deputies, and prime minister] are in  disagreement. The only area of agreement left among the top  three officials is a common, but passive, desire to keep their  differences at a manageable level.    At last week's Lebanese-Syrian summit the three leaders  discussed the government situation and the need to maintain a  united front in the peace process. Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad said that this issue is up to them and that they should  do what they deem necessary and useful.    It seems that President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Speaker Nabih  Birri are in cahoots against Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.  The president and speaker believe that the cabinet needs to be  reshuffled to achieve political equilibrium in the country.  They base their judgment on the country's current needs, not  those of a time when a then-popular prime minister formed the  cabinet amid public support and hopes for change.    As soon as a reshuffle was proposed, President al-Hirawi  insisted that he should have a say in the new cabinet. Speaker  Birri requested that the Finance Ministry return to the Shiite  sect from al-Hariri's control. The prime minister, who kept the  finance portfolio for himself, is letting Minister of State  Fu'ad Sinyurah run the ministry.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister al-Hariri wants to address the  issue of Christian representation in the government. He seeks a  reshuffle that would satisfy Patriarch Sfayr and ensure the  participation of the National Bloc Party [led by Paris-based  politician Raymond Iddah]. A government blessed by Bkirki and  containing ministers hand picked by Raymond Iddah, al-Hariri  reasons, will end "dissatisfaction" among Christians. This view  contradicts President al-Hirawi's view. The latter sees himself  as the only person entitled to name Christian ministers.    Irked by a constant barrage of criticism from his own  ministers and a stream of leaks concerning a cabinet reshuffle,  Prime Minister al-Hariri went into "seclusion" [unofficial  discontinuation of public duties], leaving a question on all  lips: Where is the country heading? Will President al-Hirawi,  aided by Speaker Birri, gain the upper hand, or will al-Hariri  continue to fight for "survival?"    The answer is anybody's guess. However, according to  available information, al-Hariri is determined to go on fighting  for his government and own political future. The prime minister  has a moral weight to reckon with and is determined not to leave  an office he once walked into triumphantly without a fight. But  he is faced with a president who also has a strong hand to play.    According to our information, with al-Hariri facing a  government crisis with no end in sight, he may have to stick to  the "seclusion" tactic first invented by the late Prime Minister  Rashid Karami in 1969.    Sources close to al-Hariri say that the prime minister is  determined to continue his seclusion until the ministers who  attacked him back off. Al-Hariri plans to go on a hunting trip  to Zimbabwe on 18 May. He is intent to brandish the sword of  seclusion in the face of opponents who thought it would be easy  to run him out of office. These opponents recently claimed that  al-Hariri's star is waning and that his days in office are  numbered.    According to our information, al-Hariri has told his  visitors  that he refuses to be defeated by a "knockout," declaring that  he will take the blows and pay them back with interest.    President al-Hirawi, meanwhile, told B'abda's visitors that  he has a constitutional responsibility to bear and that he is  above petty calculations and is determined to uphold the  Constitution and promote a spirit of reconciliation. Lebanon  deserves to have durable reconciliation and lasting unity and  the president is determined to cement both as the country  buckles down for the task of making peace, al-Hirawi's visitors  say.    President al-Hirawi wants to keep his differences with prime  minister al-Hariri secret. His public position is that he is  above internal disputes and cares only for the country's unity  and safety. Unity and understanding among the three top  officials are needed for domestic as well as external peace,  al-Hirawi was cited as saying.    Knowledgeable observers say that Syria will not allow the  Lebanese temple to come tumbling down on its allies. It keeps a  bottle of "medicine" and a spoon at hand to treat the "second  republic" at the first sign of ailment.</p>

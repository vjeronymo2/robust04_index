			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Cofide seeks Dollars 100m from sale of shares in fund manager Cofide, the holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, is seeking to raise Dollars 100m through the sale of around 24m shares in Finanza &amp; Futuro, one of the leading mutual fund management groups in Italy. The offering, via Lehman Brothers, is equivalent to around 39 per cent of the company, which is 96.93 per cent owned by Cofide. The sale will be made up of an international and domestic institutional offering of 17m shares and an Italian public offering of 7m shares. An over-allotment option of around 3.6m shares could also be made available in the event of strong demand. A further 1m shares will be offered to employees but this tranche will not be underwritten. Finanza &amp; Futuro's mutual funds under management increased by 14 per cent from the end of 1993 to L9,485bn at the end of April, making the group the fourth-largest mutual fund group in Italy with a market share of 7 per cent. The institutional offering will close on June 17 and the shares will be priced the day after. The retail offering will open on June 20 and is expected to close within one day. The shares will be allocated on June 27 and Consob, Italy's stock market regulator, is keen for the shares to start trading on Milan's Telematico screen-based system on the same day. In past offerings, there was usually a grey market in the new shares for several days before they started trading officially on the Milan bourse. Lehman Brothers expects the offer to appeal to investors keen to have an exposure to Italy's fast-growing mutual fund industry.</p>

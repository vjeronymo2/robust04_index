This is the central topic of the  regional planning work conference held on 26 January. Qian  Fenyong, Liu Zhen, and Song Zhimin attended the conference.  Song Zhimin, vice chairman of the region, made a speech at the  conference, urging for efforts to appropriately handle the  relations in the following five aspects in terms of  macroeconomic control.    The relations among reform, development, and stability.  Development constitutes the foundation of social stability,  reform instills vitality to development, and only by maintaining  a stable social environment can we concentrate our energy on  pressing forward reform, opening up, and economic development.  When making arrangements for economic work, all leagues,  cities, and departments should pay attention to the linking of  the relations between reform and stability and relations between  reform and development.    The relations between speed and efficiency. The rapid  development of the economy must be founded on the basis of  having a good sale and efficiency and being permitted by  financial and material resources. Both when initiating new  projects and renovating old enterprises, we should give top  priority to good market and efficiency. If successfully  transformed, the natural resources advantages may be turned into  economic advantages; and if poorly transformed, the natural  resources advantages may become burdens. In addition, we should  also correctly handle the relations between the newly initiated  projects and the endeavor of tapping the potential of existing  projects. We should pay attention to the major projects that  exert great influence on economic development, and should,  moreover, pay attention to the projects that consume less  investment, need short construction period, and yield quick  results. This year, the capital construction investment can  only be made in the projects that are at the winding-up stage  and will soon be put into production in the right order of  importance and urgency.    The relations between the whole and the part. The  enhancement of the macroeconomic control capacity of the state  is conducive to the minority nationalities areas in the region,  and, similarly, the enhancement of the macroeconomic control  capacity of our region is also conducive to various leagues,  cities, banners, and counties. Therefore, we hope that all  localities and all departments will take the overall situation  into account and will subject themselves to the overall  situation when their partial interests are contradictory to the  overall interest.    The relations between economic development and social  development. In the course of accelerating the region's  economic development, we must make overall arrangements for and  give all-round consideration to the development of such social  undertakings as education, culture, and social security.    The relations between economic construction and people's  livelihood. On the basis of developing the economy and  increasing labor productivity, we should continuously increase  the income of urban and rural residents. This is the only way  to better mobilize the initiative of the numerous people in  production, to reinforce the unity among the people of all  nationalities, to enhance the cohesive force to develop the  economy, and to effect an even faster and better development of  the economy. In particular, we should show concern for the  lives of the masses in the localities and units that have  difficulties and should work out methods to solve problems for  them.    Song Zhimin stressed: We should re-fix the position of  planning work, readjust functions of planning work, shift work  priorities, improve planning forms and methods, and enable  planning work to play an even important, positive, and effective  role. First, we should actually attend to the reform of  planning and investment structures. We should shift, as quickly  as possible, the plan management functions to researching  strategies, formulating plans, exercising macroeconomic control,  maintaining the aggregate economic balance, working out  industrial policies, cultivating markets, building key projects,  and giving coordinated service. With market as the foundation,  we should give full play to the fundamental role of the market  in allocating natural resources, strengthen the research and  comprehensive coordination of the macroeconomic policies, give  full play to the important role of the planning means in the  macroeconomic control, emancipate the mind to broaden the field  of vision, positively pioneer the new sphere of the planning  work that is commensurate with the development of market  economy, and establish scientific planning system. Second, we  should rapidly draw up the medium- and long-term plan for  development of the region in line with the regional party  committee's strategic demand for "joining the country's  forefront." This year, planning commissions at all levels,  together with departments concerned, should concentrate their  energy on researching and drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan,  the medium- and long-term plan for the region's economic and  social development in 2010, the plan for making the people  relatively better-off, the plan for supporting and developing  the poor areas, the plan on development of guiding industries,  the plan on development of regional economy, and the plan on  conservation of national territories. Third, we should pay  attention to the work concerning the aggregate economic balance.  We should emphatically arrange for the production and supply of  means of agricultural production, for the linking of the growing  scale of major cash crops with the production ability of light  industrial enterprises, and for the balance between railway  transportation and power supply capacities and the demands of  the production of various trades. Fourth, we should  successfully control and guide the key links of economic  development and make good pre-phase preparations for major  projects in order to promote the smooth construction of key  projects.</p>

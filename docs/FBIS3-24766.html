Launching the manifesto at Nasrec outside Soweto, ANC President  Nelson Mandela said the future government billed increased jobs  with higher incomes, housing with electricity and water,  education and health care as priorities.    The theme of the ANC's election manifesto is "a better life  for all". Apart from promising to uphold all the basic  conditions experienced in an ideal democratic society, the ANC  have an ambitious reconstruction and development programme. An  ANC government hopes to be successful in stopping the violence,  which will encourage foreign investment. Thus with expectations  of a dynamic and growing economy, the ANC plans to address the  high unemployment.    Their national public works programme alone promises  training  and jobs for about 2.5 million people over the next 10 years,  building roads and much-needed facilities.    Education was also a top priority and the ANC plan to use  the  R[Rand]23 billion already set aside for education to give, among  other education programmes, all youths 10 years of free and  compulsory education and double the number of free text books    The ANC promise to focus on the seven million squatters and  homeless by tackling the housing crisis. They promise that  within the next five years, an ANC government could build over  one million new homes, provide running water and flush toilet to  more than one million families and electrify 2.5 million rural  and urban homes.    As for land reform, the ANC government will guarantee  victims  of forced removals restitution, to be carried out fairly through  a land claims court. State land will be used to implement land  reform. Health will become more affordable under an ANC  government with cheaper treatment and medicines and free health  care for children under five years old    Overall, the ANC plans to increase public expenditure  without  raising taxes on ordinary people. The ANC will end vat on basic  foods like flour, milk and sugar, reduce income taxes on those  earning under R4,000 a month and end unfair taxation of women,  married and single. But they will make sure every business pays  its fair share.    By investing in jobs, housing and education, the ANC believe  the economy will grow and bring in more revenue. They are also  relying on beneficial international aid and loans. Plus, their  objective is to carefully use money available carefully without  squandering funds to corruption and bureaucracy, as in the past.    All security forces will be reformed to reflect the national  character and a new volunteer army will deal with the defence of  the country without being involved in political matters.    Detention without trial will be done away with and the  system  of justice will be made more accessible, cheap and fair to  everyone.    In foreign affairs, the ANC government will become a full  member of the Organisation of African Unity, United Nations,  non-aligned movement, the Commonwealth and other international  bodies.    The question is: Can Mr Mandela fulfill these extravagant  campaign promises? Criticism has already begun.    Vague on many vital question like taxation and land reform,  it could give masses the impression they will be all be enjoying  the living standards of the white middle class.    Critics say the manifesto was irresponsible and could create  problems. Should the sad reality not meet their expectations,  there are fears their disillusionment could turn to violence.    So far, Mr Mandela has been careful to avoid making wild  promises. He has been reported as saying it could take "some  years" for a government to respond fully to the need of black  people after 300 years of white supremacy.    As the ANC stressed in their manifesto, only if everyone  works together in an environment of peace and stability, can  their plans succeed.</p>

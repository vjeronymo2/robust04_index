			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Private vices and publication: The fashion for posthumous attacks on public figures The debunking biography is high fashion. Publishers now love nothing more than a book which will prove that cherished public idols have not only feet of clay, but are brittle through and through. Or rather, were brittle. Such biographies could never survive the English laws on defamation, were it not for the fact that dead men cannot sue. This week Sir Stephen Spender, happily still with us, managed, through legal action, to cause the pulping of an ostensible work of fiction which appeared to be based on alleged homosexual relationships in his youth. But it must irk Sir Stephen that he cannot guarantee his posthumous reputation. I am prepared to bet that the temporarily stymied publisher of the fiction will gleefully reprint the book immediately upon the poet's death, with a slogan such as 'The book Sir Stephen Spender banned]' This week two further examples of the genre have been serialised in the newspapers. One is Roald Dahl, by Jeremy Treglown, to be published by Faber and Faber in March. The other is John Arlott, a Memoir, by Timothy Arlott, published by Andre Deutsch next Tuesday. Dahl, whose books for children give more pleasure to their young readers than almost any other such writer since the days of the Brothers Grimm, is portrayed by Jeremy Treglown as selfish, ruthless and heartless. In one episode Dahl is said to have fed his daughter a sleeping pill, apparently so that he would be safe to have a telephone conversation with one of his mistresses. Unfortunately for Dahl, the potion did not take effect, his daughter overheard the conversation, and challenged her father. The author, according to his biographer then addressed his daughter thus: 'You've always been trouble, you've always been a nosy little bitch. I want you to get out of this house now.' I am certainly not going to fault Treglown's research, still less his motives. But will Willy Wonka's chocolate factory ever seem the same? At the least, the product might taste a little more bitter. The case of the Arlott biography is more poignant. The subject was one of Britain's best loved broadcasters. His reputation was of a kind gentle and generous man. The author who manages to drill a few holes in this picture is John Arlott's son. Tim Arlott gives credit to his father where he believes credit is due, but is ruthlessly honest about the great cricket commentator's late years, describing him as: 'a selfish, demanding, limited and impossible old man.' I suspect that the majority of men become selfish, demanding and impossible in their old age, unless they have managed to do so earlier. But some of the stories that Timothy tells about his father are chilling nonetheless. Perhaps there are some who will read Arlott junior's book and not be able to recall the old boy's wonderfully generous commentaries. But I imagine that for most of us, the revelations will seem insignificant compared to the pleasure we gained from the outward manifestation of John Arlott's character. Above all, none of it means that he was one whit a lesser man as a professional; he managed never to inflict the darker side of his character on to the public who adored him. While I am sure that this will be the common reaction to young Arlott's revelations, it is strange that such licence is not now being given to our politicians. Most people seem to believe that Stephen Milligan's strange and entirely solitary sexual practices would have rendered him unsuitable for high office. Few people have said that it is an absurdity beyond measure that another Conservative MP should have felt compelled to resign junior office because he sent love poems to an assistant. If we approved of what a politician did before we knew of his private vices, we should continue to vote for him and his policies. If we did not like his policies then we should never give our support, no matter how saintly his private life. As has been said before, civilised society cannot survive without a certain amount of hypocrisy. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

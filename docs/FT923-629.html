			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Time flies for 90-minute patriots: The Scottish National party remains optimistic FIVE MONTHS after coming down to earth with a very hard bump, the Scottish National party's bruises have almost healed. With an eye to the general election, last year's conference slogan promised Scotland would be 'Free by '93'. In the event, it won two seats fewer than its tally before the election - in spite of increasing its share of the vote. At this year's conference in Perth, the SNP is gearing up for a long, hard slog to 1996 or beyond, but it is still looking forward to eventual success. 'I think the party has drawn a line on the election,' says Mr John Swinney, one of the main authors of the four-year plan presented to the conference yesterday. A full post mortem was carried out immediately after the election, and its findings have been incorporated into the plan. The chief goal is to win a mandate for independence at the next general election, but there are interim goals, such as pushing for a referendum between now and the EC summit in Edinburgh in December, and making a strong showing in the European elections of June 1994. The message of the plan, and of many of this week's speeches, is that the party cannot afford to waste any time. 'We misjudged how much we would have to do to reassure the public to go with us,' says Mr Swinney. 'We started campaigning too late in the day on independence, we didn't cultivate the ground as well as we should have to make people either believe us or understand what we were talking about. 'We need to build confidence, build an independence lobby, build discontent with the union, build far greater motivation among the electorate to vote for the SNP and to vote for independence.' The plan concentrates on organisational and financial strategies, not policy issues. In all the post mortems since April, there appear to have been no admissions that SNP policies may have had some part in their electoral defeat. The poor showing is blamed on lack of money and organisational skills - and, in some cases, on the voters. Some senior members have been unable to hide their frustration with the apparent fickleness of the electorate. High ratings in the polls before the election translated into only three parliamentary seats. Mr Jim Sillars, the former deputy leader, earlier this year called Scots '90-minute patriots'. At the conference his words were echoed by Mr Iain Lawson, SNP industry spokesman, who called Scotland a 'numpty' (stupid) nation and said that maybe Mr Sillars had credited Scots with 89 minutes of patriotism too many. Such anger is understandable after the disappointment of the election result, but the headlines after Mr Lawson's speech are not going to win many votes. The other message of the plan is that the party has woken up to the importance of money. The SNP is at a severe disadvantage to the Labour and Conservative parties in that it has no traditional financial base of business or union donations. So far it has looked to its members, relying on many gifts of small sums. The four-year plan makes tapping of new sources of funding both the target and fuel of a sustained public-relations offensive. In spite of the relentless optimism and forward-looking stance of most of the speeches, there is an unmistakable feeling at the conference that the party still needs to take stock and decide on its political orientation. Tension between moderate left-of-centre and harder-left factions of the party was revealed during Thursday's debate on whether the SNP should define itself as a party 'in the mainstream of the European social democratic tradition'. In one sense, all SNP policies apart from independence will be irrelevant and potentially divisive for the foreseeable future. If the SNP ever gets the chance to negotiate independence, it would immediately resign and call a general election in which it would be one of several parties competing to govern Scotland. But much as the SNP would like to turn every election into an independence referendum, the public has shown itself unwilling to vote on single issues. The mood of delegates at Perth is remarkably cheerful given the outcome of the election, for their party, but conference delegates are dedicated, committed activists rather than average members. The SNP has promised to take its message to the people with an autumn of street campaigns in favour of a referendum and against water privatisation. The level of enthusiasm shown on wet November days in Glasgow shopping centres will be a better indicator of whether the party has the stamina to carry it through the next few years than anything seen in Perth City Hall this week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Mauro Anselmo; place and date not given: "We Shall Have Another  Great Victory"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Anselmo] How did you feel  when [Prime Minister] Berlusconi read out the list of ministers  and it included men from the former MSI [Italian Social  Movement]?    [Fini] I was satisfied. I was satisfied, but I had my feet  firmly on the ground.    [Anselmo] Did you think that it would be difficult for the  Right to govern because they have never governed?    [Fini] No. Because I am a realist. I do not hide from  difficulties. However, at the same time I am also convinced of  one thing. It will be useful to govern, because the Right will  put itself to the test in government and it will get rid of a  lot of commonplaces.    [Anselmo] What commonplaces?    [Fini] That only the Left is sensitive to problems like the  environment, work, our cultural heritage, and schools.    [Anselmo] Mr. Fini, is the accusation that this government  has fascist ministers also a commonplace?    [Fini] It is the chorus of those who do not want to  understand. Fascism ended in 1945 but the story continues.  [passage omitted]    [Anselmo] How were the ministers chosen?    [Fini] I put forward the names of men who were sufficiently  competent to handle some of the ministries well. Then I left it  to the prime minister-designate.    [Anselmo] Are you sorry that Tremaglia was not included?    [Fini] I am very pleased that there is a Ministry for the  Italians in the World. It is a battle that we have fought, and  Tremaglia in particular, and we have obtained a result anyway.    [Anselmo] Have you heard the joke going around the house?  The right-wing Communists were in government first.    [Fini] It is not a joke. It is the truth.    [Anselmo] And do you take the merit for the Right getting  into government, Mr. Fini?    [Fini] I know my defects, and being presumptuous is not one  of them. I do not need to reply.    [Anselmo] What does the Right want to do in government?    [Fini] We shall do something that is very simple with our  five ministers. We shall guarantee the values of honesty,  efficiency, and cleanliness.    [Anselmo] When will you cast off the nostalgic pure  hardliners, and take the rebirth of the Right to be a fact?    [Fini] It is contradictory for people to tell me that I must  be democratic, and I am, respectful of pluralism (and I  certainly am), and sensitive to dialogue, and then to add that I  must get rid of this person and that person. Oh no gentlemen, be  a little coherent. Only dictators throw people out, and I am not  a dictator.    [Anselmo] Then how will you deal with right-wing members of  your party when they challenge you?    [Fini] I am going my own way, and you can be sure that I  will  go ahead.    [Anselmo] Do you mean that you will not throw anybody out  but  that somebody should leave of his own accord?    [Fini] The problem belongs to those who risk not being able  to associate themselves with what I say and do. They will tell  me and then we will see.    [Anselmo] It was a businessman, Silvio Berlusconi, who  pulled  the MSI out of the refrigerator. Why?    [Fini] Because only a man who was outside politics and its  games could break the hard skin of ostracism that has kept the  Right isolated for 50 years.    [Anselmo] What did you find most disturbing about that  ostracism?    [Fini] The absolute lack of desire to try to understand us.  One of the things that I found most entertaining and infuriating  happened during the election campaign for the Rome City Council.  For seven days the television transmitted my face-to-face  meetings with Rutelli. And what did you hear going around?  That Fini is saying things that are right too. However, I had  not invented anything. I was there before, too. I had not done  my makeup to go on television. However, people did not know us,  because the television had ignored us and the doors had been  barred. [passage omitted]</p>

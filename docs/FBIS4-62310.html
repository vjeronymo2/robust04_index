			<p>BFN     [Textt] Turkmenistan will most likely deny Occidental  Petroleum participation in a project to develop one of the  Central Asian republic's oil and gas fields, said a senior  official at Turkmenistan's Petroleum and Gas Ministry.    The refusal would come very shortly, the official told the  Oil Information Agency.    He said the American corporation, which had won the right to  work the Burun oil and gas field in western Turkmenistan in an  international tender last November, was, under the terms of the  tender, to form a joint venture with the Turkmen concern  Balkanneftekhimprom, but had still not signed an agreement to  that effect, "from time to time notifying its Turkmen partner  about the dwindling interest in oil in the world market and  about the difficulties of transportation of crude oil from  Turkmenistan," while not having withdrawn from the project  officially.    For this reason, Turkmenistan will most likely choose  another  foreign partner. A source told the Oil Information Agency that  after preliminary negotiations, the Turkish national petroleum  company had stated its willingness to form a project to develop  the Burun and Barsa-Gelmez oil and gas deposits.    Turkmenistan is expected to make the final decision before  the end of May. The Turkish company would be offered the same  terms as Occidental Petroleum, namely it would have to pay a  $20-million bonus, invest $50 million in the project within the  next five years and receive 25 pct of the profit, the Turkmen  partner appropriating the other 75 pct.    The reserves of Burun are estimated at 35 million tonnes of  oil, those of Barsa-Gelmez at 31 million tonnes. Today the two  fields annually yield 207,000 tonnes and 1.2 million tonnes of  oil respectively.</p>

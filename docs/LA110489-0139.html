			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR STANDS FAST ON 1/4-CENT;  </P> <P> QUAKE RELIEF: AN ATTEMPT TO BROADEN THE SPECIAL SESSION IS SQUASHED. THE STAGE  IS SET FOR QUICK LEGISLATIVE ACTION.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders Friday squashed attempts to  broaden a special session of the Legislature beyond plans to raise the sales  tax by a quarter-cent for 13 months and pass a dozen bills directly related to  the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake.  </P> <P> The governor and legislators met privately at midday and then put an end to  efforts by some lawmakers to raise the sales tax by at least half a cent and  pass nearly 100 quake-related measures not considered crucial at this time. The  action prompted one senator to angrily resign his chairmanship of an  influential committee.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he is prepared to raise more taxes later if needed. But he said  such talk now is "premature."  </P> <P> "What we are doing now is what is needed at this time," the governor told  reporters.  </P> <P> Administration officials confirmed Friday, however, that Deukmejian plans to  take as much as $197 million from other state programs to help fund the  earthquake relief effort. Some of the money now targeted for quake victims had  been destined for other housing programs unrelated to the temblor. One  Democratic lawmaker, Assemblywoman Jackie Speier of South San Francisco,  denounced the Administration's move as a "shell game."  </P> <P> But the signal having been given by Deukmejian and legislative leaders,  committees in each house quickly approved separate versions of the sales tax  measure, setting the stage for the Senate and Assembly to complete the special  session as soon as today. But the action did not come without rancor.  </P> <P> In the Senate, there were fireworks when Senate President Pro Tem David A.  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) told members of the Revenue and Taxation Committee not  to bother pushing a half-cent sales tax increase because Deukmejian would not  accept it.  </P> <P> Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) dramatically resigned his coveted  chairmanship of the Revenue and Taxation Committee when it became clear that  the panel would not pass a tax increase greater than a quarter-cent on the  dollar.  </P> <P> "The only thing that precludes us from doing what is right is our own lack of  courage," Garamendi said as he relinquished the gavel.  </P> <P> The committee then voted 7 to 1, with Garamendi the only dissenter, to pass the  quarter-cent increase.  </P> <P> The Assembly Ways and Means Committee, meanwhile, passed its own version of the  tax measure on a strictly partisan 12-5 vote.  </P> <P> The vote came shortly after Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco)  entered the Ways and Means hearing room and told the committee chairman,  Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), that he wanted the tax bill  approved.  </P> <P> "Send it out. I want it out," Brown asserted loudly enough to be heard beyond  the railing that separates the committee members from the public gallery.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) led the GOP opposition. "I don't understand  the rush," Nolan said. He called the earthquake relief legislation "a cynical  manipulation to raise taxes."  </P> <P> Nolan argued that the state, with at least $674 million in reserve, had enough  to finance short-term earthquake aid through January, when lawmakers return for  their regular session.  </P> <P> But the Democratic author of the tax bill, Assemblyman Rusty Areias of Los  Banos, pointed out that the proposal came from Deukmejian, the ranking  Republican in the state and a longtime opponent of tax increase measures.  </P> <P> "George Deukmejian has never been known as a big spender," Areias said. "This  proposal was crafted between the Administration and the leadership of the  Legislature. We need to get about the process of rebuilding. This is a first  step."  </P> <P> Orange County legislators offered mixed views on the need for the quarter-cent  sales tax.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) called the rush to pass the measure  "political posturing."  </P> <P> "No one knows what the cost figure (for repairs) is, we don't yet know what  funds are going to be forthcoming from the federal government," he said. "I  believe this is not the kind of problem that requires urgent attention in 24  hours or 48 hours. There is plenty of time to address the problem."  </P> <P> Ferguson endorsed a proposal by Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks)  that the state freeze spending for the first 12 weeks of the next fiscal year,  which begins in July. The move would produce a savings of nearly $800 million,  the same amount that would be collected by the proposed sales tax, Ferguson  said.  </P> <P> Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) suggested that the Legislature hold off on the  sales tax vote until January or February, when more accurate quake damage  estimates are made.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid we are being placed in a position of voting for something with  incomplete data and information," he said.  </P> <P> However, Senator William Campbell (R-Haciena Heights), said he supports the  proposed tax increase "because I believe it is necessary to provide funds  immediately. . . . We may come back in January and say we need more or less,  but it is a reasonable amount to ask for at this point."  </P> <P> In testimony to the committee, state Finance Director Jesse R. Huff said the  state needs to spend just over $1 billion to match federal grants and provide  financial assistance to local governments. He said the governor's plan is to  use roughly $800 million from the sales tax increase. Huff said another $245  million would come from the budget reserve.  </P> <P> But the sales tax revenue and emergency reserve will not be the only source of  money for earthquake repairs and relief. As part of its program, the Deukmejian  Administration plans to use as much as $177.5 million from two bond measures  approved by voters last year to help the homeless and to quake-proof buildings.  </P> <P> One measure is Proposition 77, a $150-million seismic safety bond issue that  provides $80 million to upgrade masonry buildings considered unsafe in  earthquakes and another $70 million for rehabilitating low-income housing.  </P> <P> The second measure is Proposition 84, a $300-million bond issue aimed at  providing housing for the homeless. Up to $27.5 million would come from this  measure, including $25 million earmarked for upgrading residential hotels used  by people with very low incomes and another $2.5 million destined for emergency  shelters.  </P> <P> The amount of bond money actually spent on earthquake relief will depend on how  much is sought by local governments and property owners, said Maureen Higgins,  director of the state Department of Housing and Community Development. "We  picked the programs that would be most relevant at this time for earthquake  relief," she said.  </P> <P> Advocates of the homeless in Southern California are concerned that using the  bond money for earthquake relief would deplete resources for people who lost  their homes long before the quake hit.  </P> <P> But Administration officials said Deukmejian has expressed a willingness to  replace the money by increasing the amount of a $150-million bond measure  planned for next year's ballot.  </P> <P> In addition to the bond money, Deukmejian's Finance Department has put on hold  another $20 million needed to fund legislation previously passed by lawmakers  and signed by the governor. Assemblywoman Speier released an internal  Administration memo showing the intention to withhold the money from programs  for AIDS victims, pregnant mothers and pesticide detection.  </P> <P> "I think this is becoming pretty transparent," Speier said in an interview.  "There is an effort under way to use existing general fund money and money  appropriated for other state purposes to respond to the earthquake issues. It  is a ripple effect from the earthquake."  </P> <P> Deukmejian spokesman Kevin Brett acknowledged that these funds might go to the  earthquake relief effort.  </P> <P> "The reserve and the funds that will be received from the sales tax increase  are the primary methods of funding the earthquake relief," he said. "But that  does not mean we aren't going to explore other methods as well. The bottom line  is that we want to do whatever we possibly can to help the victims as quickly  as we possibly can."  </P> <P> The tax increase, as now proposed, would cost Californians an extra 25 cents on  every $100 of purchases -- or a nickel for every $20 spent. The statewide sales  tax now stands at 6%. The increase would be in effect from Dec. 1, 1989, until  Dec. 31, 1990.  </P> <P> The decision by the governor and legislative leaders to stick to their script  -- a modest quarter-cent sales tax hike and a tightly written relief package --  left dozens of measures proposed by rank-and-file lawmakers on the cutting-room  floor. It was not clear Friday whether those bills would be taken up even in  January.  </P> <P> One proposed bill, by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), would hold  up work on double-decking the Harbor Freeway in Los Angeles until the  Legislature receives assurances from Caltrans that the structure could  withstand an 8.3-magnitude earthquake. Waters said she wants to avoid a  calamity comparable to the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.  </P> <P> Waters also made an effort to use the gathering of lawmakers to win back $24  million cut by Deukmejian from family planning programs. Roberti and Brown  agreed to Waters' request to convene a regular session of the Legislature  concurrent with the special session. But it was unclear when that session would  begin. It appeared, in any case, that Waters lacked the votes late Friday to  restore the family planning money.  </P> <P> In addition to the battles over the sales tax measure, political skirmishes  erupted on other parts of the leadership package Friday.  </P> <P> One major battle involved the question of whether private, nonprofit  institutions, including Stanford University, should be eligible for grants of  taxpayer dollars to repair earthquake damage. A proposal moving through the  Senate would give the private groups the same eligibility for funding that  local public agencies have under current law.  </P> <P> The proposal drew fire in the Senate Toxics and Public Safety Management  Committee from Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who said there is so little money  available that Stanford "shouldn't even be standing in line."  </P> <P> Added Sen. Art Torres: "The quake has created a lifeboat situation. Right now,  we have to serve as the captain in deciding who stays on and who gets off."  Stanford and other private institutions, he said, would have to be left behind.  </P> <P> In the end, the committee voted to give private agencies a chance to obtain  state aid only after public agencies have received all they needed. The  committee also put private universities behind private hospitals on the  priority list and established a $1-million cap on public aid to private  organizations.  </P> <P> COUNTY TAX LEVELS  </P> <P> The California sales tax now stands at 6% on each dollar of sales, but voters  in 13 of the state's 58 counties have voted additional levies for local  projects.  </P> <P> Eight counties have added an additional half cent, bringing them to 6 1/2%.  They are Fresno, Inyo, Los Angeles, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San  Francisco and Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> Five other counties have added a full cent, bringing their sales tax to 7%.  They are Alameda, Contra Costa, San Diego, San Mateo and Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Voters in six counties will decide Tuesday whether to add half-cent sales tax  increases for transportation projects: Monterey, Nevada, Orange, San  Bernardino, San Francisco and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Source: State Board of Equalization  </P> <P> Times staff writers Carl Ingram, Paul Jacobs, Richard C.

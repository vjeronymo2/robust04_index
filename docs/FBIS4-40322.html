			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian oil and gas will be supplied to Belarus  duty free. This is the essence of a resolution, which has been  adopted by the Government of the Russian Federation. The  document, signed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, determines the  mechanism for facilitating oil supplies, including condensed gas  [hazavy kandensat] and products of oil refining, to Belarus. An  assent was granted to the proposal of our Republic to extend  Russian pricing policies to cover energy resources and raw  materials to Belarusian economic bodies beginning from the  moment the two countries' monetary systems are unified.  Appropriate ministries and committees of the Russian Federation  have been instructed to safeguard organizational measures for  implementing this resolution, which is one of the first concrete  steps toward the accomplishment of the agreement -- signed by  Vyachaslaw Kebich and Viktor Chernomyrdin -- on the unification  of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems.</p>

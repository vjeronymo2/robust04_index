			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Bush responds to pressure on Bosnia: Thatcher joins US calls for threat of military action against Serbia PRESIDENT George Bush's latest initiative on Bosnia - calling for a UN resolution authorising the use of force to ensure humanitarian aid gets through - was hurriedly issued in the midst of a campaign swing through Colorado, in answer to intensified domestic and foreign pressure for some form of US action. Conspicuous among these have been the statements of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, a column in the New York Times by Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister, and a vote earlier yesterday by the Senate foreign relations committee calling on the United Nations to authorise the use of military force if necessary. All the above interventions were themselves a response to a flood of media reports about Serbian 'death camps' and graphic pictures and accounts of the latest bombing in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Earlier in the week the administration had appeared caught flat-footed, with the president concentrating on his struggling re-election campaign and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, on holiday in Wyoming. Sensing administration paralysis as well as a political opportunity, Mr Clinton again called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council and has warned that force may have to be used against Serbia. 'History has shown you can't just allow the mass extermination of people based on their ethnic origin and just sit by and watch it happen,' he told a campaign rally in Missouri. A foreign contribution came from Lady Thatcher, who said Serbia must be threatened with military action, if it does not comply with western demands. These should include an end to Belgrade's economic support for the war in Bosnia, its recognition of Bosnian independence and territorial integrity, the demilitarisation of Bosnia within a broader regional demilitarisation, access for humanitarian teams, and the promise of co-operation in the return of refugees to Bosnia. 'American leadership in this endeavour is indispensable, as the EC's paralysis has shown, but America cannot be expected to act alone,' she wrote. Before yesterday the only positive initiative this week came late on Wednesday, when the US called for an extraordinary session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. On Monday the State Department had appeared to suggest the US had evidence confirming media reports of Serbian 'death camps', but this was withdrawn on Tuesday. But on Wednesday Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state, issued a statement saying such reports were 'profoundly disturbing'. Yesterday, the New York Times quoted an unidentified senior official as saying: 'We are at the point now where there may well be greater danger in not taking risks than in taking risks, and I think the president may have to roll the dice if things don't improve.' However, the US military has consistently advised that any operation in the Balkans would be fraught with risk. Mr Bush's political advisers are also concerned that any US military involvement might backfire, with the election less than three months away.</p>

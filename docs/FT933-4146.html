			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and Palestinians End Hostility: Dusty outpost prepares to receive Arafat's cabinet - PLO could set up offices in former British prison building / Jericho and the West Bank THE DUSTY, palm-fringed town of Jericho, in the barren Jordan Valley, seems an unlikely choice for a Palestinian administrative capital. It is small, dry and baking in summer. It lacks telephone lines, roads and power. The biblical town's population is a mere 16,000 and its biggest building the shabby, two-storey, 70-roomed Hisham Palace hotel. Yesterday workers were busy plastering over cracks and painting the walls in anticipation that the hotel will become the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Residents are convinced Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, will move into a luxurious white-washed villa trimmed with green window frames and ample lush gardens on the outskirts of the city. They also say the PLO could take over the offices of the Israeli military run administration which was once a British prison and the headquarters of the Jordanian government until 1967. But Palestinian officials, who are negotiating to have Israeli troops withdraw from a 100 sq km area around Jericho, say the PLO will keep its political and administrative headquarters in occupied Arab East Jerusalem. Although a cabinet headed by Mr Arafat might meet in Jericho, the town will, in essence, be an outpost for the administration of interim self-rule over the whole West Bank. Palestinians know it is the West Bank, with its more fertile and abundant agricultural land and better natural and human resources, which could lay the basis for real economic growth. The West Bank economy is dominated by agriculture and tourism which contribute about 80 per cent of gross domestic product. The 5,500 sq km of the West Bank have many similar infrastructural needs to those of the Gaza Strip, especially in sewage and solid waste management. But it is considerably better off, largely as a result of Jordanian administration until 1967 and a deeper integration with the Israeli economy since. In 1991, the last reliable figures available, the 1.1m residents of the West Bank had gross national product per head of Dollars 2,000, compared with Gazans' Dollars 1,230. Its physical and social infrastructure is less dilapidated, it has fewer refugees in squalid camps, a lower dependence on Israel and direct access to the Jordan market over the Allenby bridge. Furthermore, a Palestinian authority will inherit considerable potential assets in the West Bank, particularly in its better education system and tourist resources. According to the World Bank, a greater proportion of Palestinians complete higher education than in neighbouring Arab states - 18 college graduates per thousand people. Two of the universities in the West Bank - Bir Zeit, near Ramallah and An-Najar in Nablus - are counted among the five most distinguished higher education institutions in the Arab world. At Bir Zeit's new campus young men in sneakers, sunglasses and baseball caps wander past laboratories with high-tech equipment. The West Bank universities are also famed in the Arab world for their unparalleled freedom of speech. However, since the financial crisis in the PLO, the eight universities have had difficulty raising the Dollars 25m needed to run them and some salaries have not been paid for months. For tourism the West Bank is well endowed. There is the old city of Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock mosque, the old walls of Jericho, the Mount of Temptation, the Jordan River, the shrines of Bethlehem, souks, castles and a strong craft industry. With two power companies which buy power from Israel, the West Bank also has the rudiments of an independent power industry. Mr Hisham Awartani, an economics professor at An-Najar University, says the greatest challenge for an incoming Palestinian administration will be making the right policy choices and creating the appropriate institutions. The PLO, he warns, must recast itself to face the challenge; first, it must resist socialist voices calling for a state-controlled economy, and nationalist voices demanding economic isolation from Israel. 'If the PLO creates a state-controlled economy we are doomed,' he said. 'Much will depend on how vulnerable the PLO is to trade unions, labour groups and old-time socialists.' It must also move swiftly to create transitional institutions of professionals and technocrats capable of tackling the problems and streamlining a co-ordinated strategy. International technical assistance will be vital to plug the management gap of the PLO. 'Palestinians have great experience in democratic building of institutions, and the PLO must realise this before they succumb to appointing their own people to the administration.' Other policy challenges will be to introduce, nearly from scratch, a financial system after years when the only licensed bank has been the Cairo-Amman bank. This will entail creation of a new legal and administrative framework of commercial and property law providing for a mechanism for enforcement on loan defaulters. A new investment and licensing code will also have to devised. Taxation will also have to be increased to sustain the administrative structures - even given Israel's undertaking to return tax revenues presently collected from the territories - and a new trade policy must focus on boosting exports to other destinations than Israel to reduce a big trade deficit.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Economic comparisons 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------                   GNP          GNP         Exports     Imports                (Dollars m)  (Dollars m)    /GNP         /GNP                                             (%)          (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------- West Bank*        2,134       2,175         10.5         29.3 Gaza*               864       1,310         13.3         34.8 Combined*         2,998       1,800         11.3         30.9 Israel           58,989      10,878         30.6         46.2 Jordan            3,764         968         29.8         66.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------- *Average of 1990 and 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------- In 1991 almost a third of the GNP of the West Bank and Gaza derived from employment in Israel of residents of the occupied territories.  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

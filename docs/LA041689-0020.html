			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LOS ANGELES BRAND OF BIRACIAL COALITION POLITICS  </P> <P> Los Angeles voters last Tuesday wrote a surprising new chapter in the  remarkable story of the city's biracial coalition -- which rather narrowly came  together once again to reelect Mayor Tom Bradley to a fifth term.  </P> <P> The way Bradley's coalition was created and maintained tells us something about  what is possible in the city's future. We might also be able to avoid the fate  of cities like New York and Chicago, where the failure to build progressive  coalitions led to electoral defeats.  </P> <P> Los Angeles politics is, by necessity, coalition politics. No single group has  the numbers to win power by itself. Blacks constitute less than 17% of the  city's population. While Latinos have increased, their low voter registration  has made it hard to translate numbers into power. Jews, the most liberal white  group in the city, do not exceed 7% of the population. There are even fewer  Asian-Americans.  </P> <P> The Bradley coalition grew out of two enduring Los Angeles realities. First,  the black community is the most unified and consistently liberal in the city.  Second, the white community is severely split along ideological lines.  </P> <P> The two poles of Los Angeles politics have been the black community on the left  and the conservative white community on the right. The fundamental differences  between these two worlds constitute the roots of major city conflict.  </P> <P> In each city election between 1965 and 1985, black districts and conservative  San Fernando Valley districts have been on opposite sides. In Bradley's mayoral  campaigns, and in his two races for governor, he attained his highest vote in  the black community and his lowest in the northwest and central valley.  </P> <P> The 5th Council District, now represented by Zev Yaroslavsky and about  one-third Jewish, has been the home of white liberalism. It differs profoundly  from conservative Valley districts in political choices. On the average,  Yaroslavsky's district and the valley regions have been 20-30 percentage points  apart on city, state and national elections; these differences have marked  Bradley's mayoral and gubernatorial races.  </P> <P> The key to the Bradley coalition has been the linkage between two liberalisms,  black and white. The coalition that eventually took city hall away from Sam  Yorty in 1973 had its roots in the 1963 campaign to elect Bradley as 10th  District councilman. In that multiracial district with large black and Jewish  communities, black activists joined forces with Jewish liberal reformers.  Bradley's biracial organization, led by black and Jewish activists, provided  the model and key personnel for the government to come. Ten years later, blacks  and white liberals, long shut out of citywide power, gained control of city  hall.  </P> <P> What held this part of the coalition together? We have heard much about  Bradley's personality and symbolic appeals. Both are important, but it should  also be understood that Bradley and his black and liberal allies have used  specific coalition techniques. Black activists led by Bradley openly rejected  anti-Semitism, and white liberal activists paid respect to the independent  political role of the black community. When conflicts arose between blacks and  Jews, Bradley associates often called closed-door meetings to air differences  and forge unity. It was no accident at all, but rather the careful application  of such coalition techniques, that allowed Los Angeles to avoid the interracial  tensions devastating to coalitions in New York City.  </P> <P> Beyond this biracial base, the coalition expanded to incorporate downtown  business and the Latino community. Latinos joined late, having backed Yorty in  1969. But in successive elections, their support for the liberal regime  increased steadily. Bradley's downtown redevelopment programs brought him  unswerving business support and established a key role for business in the  regime. Thus a black-Jewish alliance expanded into a minority- liberal-business  coalition.  </P> <P> This center-left coalition has pursued policies of moderate liberalism,  including affirmative action in city hiring, greater civilian control over the  police, extensive federal aid (before the onset of the Reagan presidency) and  downtown redevelopment.  </P> <P> In 1977, 1981 and 1985 liberal politicians calculated the odds of facing  Bradley and decided not to run. So did the strongest conservatives. Bradley  then faced and outgunned weaker conservative opponents and won easily. But the  same script did not play all the way out this year. For the first time since  Jesse Unruh ran in the 1973 mayoral primary, Bradley faced direct competition  for his liberal base. He lost votes not just on the right, which was normal,  but in the liberal Westside and in the Central City, while being hurt by the  apathy of his own supporters.  </P> <P> City Councilman Nate Holden and former Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter  Ward together exceeded Bradley's vote in the conservative white Valley  districts. Bradley's base was the same as usual: minority districts added to  the white liberal 5th District. The 5th was the only white majority district  where Bradley exceeded 50%. Fortunately for the mayor, a contested council race  in the 5th brought a comparatively massive turnout. But, like Unruh in 1973,  Holden cut into Bradley's support in each of these areas. Bradley's normal  85%-90% range in the three main black districts fell toward 70%; his usual  65%-70% in the 5th dropped to 51.4%.  </P> <P> Clearly all is not well in the dominant coalition. Bradley's 52% showing  certainly was a major shock. But in terms of coalition evolution, the shifting  pattern is not unexpected. A majority coalition of the center and the left is  likely to be highly popular with the majority of voters, but over time will  have growing problems with the activists who provide the energy and sharp edge  to politics. When a coalition becomes too big and cautious, it becomes an  inviting target for dissension from within.  </P> <P> The problem for progressives in Los Angeles today is quite different from that  facing Bradley and his allies in 1973. Liberalism was newly emergent then and  had just barely won over a long-dominant conservatism. Now, liberalism is a  stable regime, whose power is taken for granted. But the examples of Chicago  and New York City tell us that liberal power can collapse, and when it does, it  will happen from within. If a center-left coalition divides down the middle,  the winner will be a resurgent conservatism.  </P> <P> The air is filled with new ideas, and we see new activists everywhere. Many  groups now seek a greater role in the city's progressive politics: blacks,  Westside liberals, Latinos, Asians and women. Seeking to establish new city  policies, they may be less interested in building coalitions. On the other  hand, those who seek to maintain existing coalitions may have difficulty  creating new policies. The future of progressive politics in Los Angeles can  only be assured if one of two things happens: new activists learn to build  coalitions, or existing leaders develop new policies.  </P> <P> It is not necessary to agree with all of Bradley's policies in order to see the  necessity of learning from the model of coalition politics his experience  offers. It is only necessary to be concerned about the future of progressive  politics in the city. While new sorts of policies may be desirable, it will be  impossible to implement any of them without a successful strategy for winning  and holding power.  </P> <P> Once lost, power is hard to recover. Coalitions succeed when leaders hold the  loyalty of their own group while reaching out to others. The reward is  electoral victory, and the opportunity to bring about social change.  </P></p>

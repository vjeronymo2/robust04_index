			<p>CSO     [Text] Informed sources have told AL-SHARQ that there is a  dispute between the Yemeni president, Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, the secretary general of the General People's  Congress, and a member of the Presidential Council, Shaykh  'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, the leading member in the Higher Body  of the Yemeni Grouping for Reform, concerning participation of  the military attaches in the U.S. and French Embassies in the  Joint Military Committee. The Joint Military Committee includes  a group of Yemeni, Jordanian, and Omani officers, in addition to  the U.S. and French attaches. It is working on separating the  northern and southern forces in the areas that have been the  scene of some military tension.    These sources said that Shaykh al-Zandani opposes bringing  the U.S. and French attaches into this committee, whereas  President Salih welcomes their participation.    It should be mentioned that the committee has already  visited  a number of military locations and succeeded in defusing  tensions and dispersing troop concentrations from some points,  especially in the Mudiyah area of the province of Abyan, which  had been the scene of a military confrontation after northern  forces had come to give their support to citizens of the area  who opposed the southern forces from the al-Wahdah Brigade that  had come from the province of Hadramawt. The committee also  managed to remove the northern forces, that were near the former  border areas, from the southern side. The troops that were  headquartered in the al-Rahidah area, south of Ta'izz, were  withdrawn to the Janad area, east of Ta'izz. Also, the troops  along the line between Ma'rib and Bayhan were separated.    In addition to this, a military delegation from the Arab  League continued its visit to Yemen in order to investigate the  military situation that nearly exploded during the last two  days. Sources said that the [Yemeni] Socialist Party is  demanding that the military committee be expanded and that Arab  forces be created.    In addition to this, it was announced in Sanaa that that a  preparatory committee had been formed in order to create a  higher council for Yemen's tribes, and that this committee met  the day before yesterday in the residence of Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the "chief of the Hashid tribal leaders."  It was decided to announce the formation of this council during  the next two days.</p>

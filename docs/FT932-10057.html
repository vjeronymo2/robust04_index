			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Assessment of Italian economy is detached from reality Sir, I read with interest and a little apprehension Franco Modigliani's personal view on things Italian ('The year of the great opportunity', May 5) and I believe a few of his statements cannot rest unchallenged. Mr Modigliani is one of the brand-name economists that established governments in Italy regularly call up to back up their assertions that Italy is well on its way to recovery (economically, politically, morally or whatever is trendy at the time). The idea that the creation of more secure jobs will follow from developments on the further ratification of agreements on the labour-cost front is nice, but a little detached from reality. As Mr Modigliani himself points out later in his article, deficit reduction comes from urgent cuts in public expenditure and revenues from privatisations. Both these measures, if implemented, require substantial restructuring of the inefficient public sector where some estimates put the dimension of 'overstaffing' at some 300,000. The role of the unions will now become closely intertwined with the new political reality that has emerged and that will dominate the scene whatever future political developments are likely to be: the role of the PDS (the former Communist party) as a balancing force in coalitions (a role formerly assigned to the now disgraced Socialist party). To draw any conclusions without highlighting this would mean over-simplifying the picture beyond reason. A final consideration on interest rates: the very fabric of the Italian economy rests upon the key assumption that taxpayers remain happy with their returns and are willing to subsidise the gargantuan debt mountain. This in itself distorts the picture versus its neighbours greatly and provides an automatic downside. I disagree with the statement that Italy is engaged in a rebellion against the Bundesbank in that the way events, both at the time of devaluation and ever since were handled, indicate precisely the opposite - a repetition of the old game with the added spice of great political uncertainty.

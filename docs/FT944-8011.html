			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Goals for ABSA winners Leyton Orient are not winning many soccer matches this season but they scored at the annual prize giving of the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts yesterday, the jolly when corporate sponsors are rewarded for their commitment to the arts. The 'O's won the award for increasing access to the arts. The club commissioned Arc Theatre to write a play about racism and tour local schools with it. The aim was to attract more young blacks and Asians to its matches. The ABSA winners were the usual mix of the imaginative and the predictable. The Royal Bank of Scotland deserved recognition for its corporate programme which has kept the arts afloat in Scotland, most notably the Edinburgh Festival and Scottish Opera, and Lloyds Bank won again, this time for youth sponsorship through its Film Challenge. Other deserving cases were Manchester Airport, which took the International Sponsorship prize for taking Contact Theatre and Tara Arts abroad, and Ernst &amp; Young, which, as a first time sponsor, committed a great deal of cash to the Picasso show at the Tate. Underlining that sponsorship now positively embraces the avant-garde were the prizes for Beck's Beer, which preserved Rachel Whiteread's concrete 'House' beyond its demolition date, and Ibstock, which took the new category of sponsorship in kind by providing the 50 tonnes of clay sculptor Antony Gormley needed for the 43,000 figures in his work 'Field for the British Isles.' Dartington Crystal won the Long Term Commitment award; Allied Domecq the Single Project, for its Pounds 3m support for the RSC; and Barefoot Books was the small business winner for helping Polka Theatre. The Guinness Award went to the Grand Theatre, Blackpool, which has acquired 12 new sponsors in the past year, while the Business in the Arts Adviser for 1994 is Mike Stallard of London Underground. Arthur Andersen sponsored the Awards along with The Times, whose critics' award went to the New Contemporaries touring arts exhibition. After five years BT has done its bit and this annual show, which lifted the careers of David Hockney and Damien Hirst, needs a new backer.</p>

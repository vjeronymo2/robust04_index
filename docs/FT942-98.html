			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Float values Exco at Pounds 215m Exco, the money broking group, will be valued at Pounds 215.5m at the flotation price of 175p announced yesterday. The price has been set at 9.5 times last year's earnings with a notional historic dividend yield of 6 per cent. Mr Ron Sandler, chief executive, said that despite difficult conditions in the new issue market the response from institutions had been good. 'We had to spend more time than most companies explaining the business but everyone wanted to see us.' About 43 per cent of Exco's shares are being sold with the administrator of British &amp; Commonwealth disposing of its final 40 per cent holding. Funds by Gartmore and Robert Fleming are releasing about a quarter of their holdings and a few shares are being sold by staff. There is no new money being raised by the company. Just over 53m shares are being placed with investors by NM Rothschild. COMMENT Exco has forecast a jump in profits to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 21.4m) for the six months to June prompting analysts to predict up to Pounds 49m for the full year. That puts the shares at the issue price on a multiple of just 8. Exco has clearly failed completely to change the idea that money brokers are highly cyclical businesses, with a reputation for corporate disasters whose assets can walk out the door. Yet the geographic and product diversity of the big four has improved the quality of earnings while the increasing importance of global operations has raised the barriers to entry. Securities broking may go through a sticky patch in the short-term and there are longer term pressures in foreign exchange. But there are enough new opportunities in areas such as derivatives to compensate. Exco looks set for its second successful flotation.</p>

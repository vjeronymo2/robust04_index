			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BETTY FORD FORMS ABORTION PAC  </P> <P> Former First Lady Betty Ford and several other Republicans announced today that  they have formed a new political action committee to support GOP candidates who  oppose President Bush's anti-abortion stance.  </P> <P> The committee, calling itself Pro-Choice America, said it has "only one purpose  -- to support courageous pro-choice Republicans who face anti-choice  opponents."  </P> <P> Jayne Hart, a spokeswoman for the group, said the PAC will concentrate only on  races in which a Republican who favor abortion rights is opposed by another  Republican or a Democrat who is opposed to abortion.  </P> <P> While the PAC plans to contribute to both state and federal races, Hart said it  will probably stay out of contests in which both candidates hold the same  abortion position, or where the Democrat favors abortion rights and the  Republican opposes abortion.  </P> <P> In addition to Ford, other founding members of the PAC included: Rep. Connie  Morella (R-Md.), former Republican Chair Mary Louise Smith and former Rep.  Millicent Fenwick (R-N.J.).  </P> <P> Also among the founders was Rep. Claudine Schneider (R-R.I.), who is  challenging Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.). Both Schneider and Pell favor  abortion rights. In addition, there were several Republican men among the  founders, including Rep. Bill Green (R-N.Y.).  </P></p>

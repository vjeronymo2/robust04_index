			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: How to crack the code-sharing deals - The pros and cons of buying just one ticket for a complicated series of flights Moscow to Des Moines, Iowa, in the farming heartland of the US, may not seem the most conventional airline route. You might imagine that such a journey involves four aircraft changes, three tickets, the risk of lost luggage, long walks across airport terminals and frazzled nerves. But with just one ticket and one boarding pass, you can travel all the way. Or, for that matter, from Kuwait City to Phoenix, Arizona; from Copenhagen to Grand Rapids, Michigan; or any number of other improbable routes. Your baggage will be checked all the way from your starting point to your final destination, and flight changes should be co-ordinated with connecting flights, on aircraft parked in nearby bays within the same terminal if possible. These are the benefits of code-sharing, an increasingly popular arrangement which allows airlines to book passengers on each others' flights. It means that on United Airlines' Moscow-Des Moines flight, you fly by Lufthansa, the German carrier, to Frankfurt; change to another Lufthansa flight to Chicago; and finally board a United aircraft to Des Moines. Most large airlines have made alliances with others around the world: there have been about 120 liaisons, covering roughly 5,000 routes. Code-sharing partners include United and Lufthansa, British Airways and USAir, KLM of the Netherlands and Northwest of the US, and the multiple alliance of British Midlands with American Airlines and United. Delta of the US and Virgin Atlantic of the UK are still awaiting approval for their proposed agreement. Airlines trumpet the benefits of such arrangements to their customers, but some consumer groups are concerned that they are not always in the interests of air travellers. The US Department of Transportation discovered that 30 per cent of all US passengers booking international reservations on code-sharing flights do not know which airline they are flying when they purchase their tickets. Last month the department proposed new rules to require airlines and travel agents to disclose all code-sharing arrangements at the time a passenger books a flight. No such ruling exists or is proposed in the UK. Consumer groups claim that passengers may end up on inferior carriers. 'The pitfall is if the partner with which an airline ties up is not in the same league in terms of quality of the service or safety levels,' says Richard Smithies, assistant director for government affairs at the International Air Transport Association. Large airlines say they would never go into a deal without conducting extensive safety and service checks on potential partners. 'We have something like a Bible of requirements that a code-sharing partner has to adhere to,' says Delta. Most of the big airlines have internal policies requiring reservation officers to inform passengers of any code-sharing arrangements. But consumer groups say this is not effective. According to Tony Hockley, economic adviser to the Air Transport Users Committee: 'Airlines can insist that passengers are told about code-sharing, but whether that actually happens depends on the point of sale. We are not convinced that all travel agents are trained in the use of code-share flights.' 'We would expect our members to be as transparent as possible,' says the Association of British Travel Agents. 'But there is not a requirement about code-sharing in our code of practice.' The European Commission and the European Civil Aviation Commission have agreed that airlines may list a single flight no more than twice in computer reservation systems. Code-sharing makes multiple listings fairly easy, because each airline can list the flight under its own code. In the US, the American Society of Travel Agents, the Association of Retail Travel Agents, American Airlines and Trans World Airlines are petitioning the US Department of Transportation to ban multiple listings of code-share flights in computer reservation systems. They believe such practices deceive consumers and push flights run by single carriers further down computer screens, causing travel agents to book the code-share flights rather than routes that could be more direct. So if you want to know exactly which airlines you will be flying and where you will be changing, make sure to ask when you book the flight. And find out whether you will get frequent-flyer points for the entire trip.</p>

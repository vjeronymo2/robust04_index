			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The Group of Seven (G-7)  industrialized nations are considering proposing more than 1.5  billion dollars in aid for Ukraine as a way to ensure the safety  of its outmoded nuclear power plants, a Japanese Government  official said Friday [24 June].    The sum, which would be proposed during the coming annual  summit, would partly finance a plan to solidify safety shields  of the exploded reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,  the official said.    The remainder would be used to remodel several other  reactors  currently under construction in the former Soviet republic, the  official said, noting that these reactors, basically identical  in design to the exploded reactor, must be reconstructed with  Western technology.    France and Germany recently proposed the aid program.    In April 1986, one of four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear  power plant exploded, resulting in the worst nuclear accident in  history.    Of the three reactors left, two are still in operation,  causing global concern over a possible repeat of the Chernobyl  disaster.    During the Naples summit in July, the G-7 nations are  expected to press for closure of the two reactors, which Ukraine  claims are necessary as major power sources for the economically  ailing country, the government official said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Gypylov report: "Herds Being Rustled From Across </F> the Border"]    [Text] Ulan-Ude -- A mixed commission on border issues is  now working along the Russian-Mongolian state border which is  more than 3,000 km in length. Immediately rumors started:  There are disputed sectors. Even the press has divulged this.    "Mongolia and Russia recognize the inviolability of the  existing borders," J. Choynhor, Mongolian deputy minister of  foreign relations, was forced to state in the government  newspaper ARDYN ERH. The present commission's cochairman, N.  Pavlov, explained that "a planned verification is in progress  which is stipulated under the treaty on friendly relations and  cooperation between the two countries. Neither of us have any  territorial claims toward each other." The inspection is not of  a political nature. Nevertheless, there is disquiet. Especially  in the area of Tuva.    The inhabitants of the border regions of Tuva and Mongolia  have the same attitude toward the striped border posts as to a  telegraph pole. They simply cross the border at any time and  steal each other's cows, horses, and sheep. At times they they  set fire to yurts, brawl, and when sorting out their differences  go for their knives and rifles. Recently, Major General A.  Kochetov, deputy commander of the Transbaykal Border District's  forces, visited this area. He ordered the homeland's sentries  to*strengthen their combat training. As soon as he had left, a  herd of cows was rustled from beside the Shara-Suorata border  post. But later Tuvinian shepherds crossed over, killed some  Mongolians, and seized some horses. The guerrilla war in the  Eastern Sayan Mountains continues.</p>

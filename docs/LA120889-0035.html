			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> In Eastern Europe, news of contemporary Western art generally comes  second-hand, via illustrations in books and magazines. So perhaps it isn't  surprising that Bulgarian artist Tzveti Kirov's figurative paintings -- with  titles like "Treadmill to Oblivion" and "Blind Ambition" -- have a dated  quality. Most of Kirov's works -- shown for the first time in the United States  -- feature a blurred, fragmentary male figure rushing blindly to some unknown  destination. His face and body are twisted and compacted, and empty space  whistles through his torso.  </P> <P> Colorful arrows, "twinkling" hatch marks borrowed from commercial illustration  and the curving lines cartoonists use to show movement dance ironically around  these hollow men. Some have companions: impassive women with apple cheeks and  ample figures, nude or clothed, who cohabit interiors liable to funnel backward  suddenly or flip around in a maniacal curve.  </P> <P> Kirov's combination of '50s-style Angst and '60s-style commercial art  borrowings doesn't quite come off, at least in the context of contemporary  Western art. But it does have the authentic tang of ironic commentary on a  muddled and frantic society that wants answers as simple and easy to follow as  the arrows on a diagram. It's a pity the gallery sees fit to prop up paintings  on silly gilt easels, which make even serious, intelligently conceived art look  like kitsch. (Gene Sinser Gallery, 331 N. Larchmont Blvd., to Dec. 23.) CATHY  CURTIS  </P></p>

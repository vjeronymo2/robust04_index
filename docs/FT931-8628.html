			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Oil prices It seems that Opec's feet were not sufficiently close to the fire when the cartel met in Vienna last weekend. The rebound in the oil price since Christmas reduced pressure on producers to announce convincing cuts. Four days of discussion to patch up an agreement will hardly persuade the market that the cartel really intends to make cuts. Indeed, with Saudi Arabia's production 45 per cent higher than before the Gulf War, its apparent reluctance to trim gives a poor lead. Perhaps most Opec members are maintaining their market share against the day that Iraq is re-admitted to the world market. But unless attitudes change and quotas are more strictly enforced, crude prices are likely to languish. That gives little support to the big oil companies who have also seen their refining and marketing operations squeezed by the world recession. With revenues under pressure, US companies have switched to cost cutting as a way of boosting earnings, and the habit is spreading. It will be interesting to see how much of these savings the oil majors can hang on to, and how much leaks away in competitive market pressures. Given the overcapacity in refining and chemicals, the omens are not good. Highly geared companies are thus exposed. They may have better recovery prospects once growth resumes, but with Europe and Japan in recession and the US recovery hesitant, the likes of BP face an endless climb without fresh equity.</p>

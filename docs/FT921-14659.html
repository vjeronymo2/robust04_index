			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / IG Metall calls steel strike ballot LEADERS of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering and metal workers' union, yesterday backed away from the double-digit pay rise demands which have been a significant factor behind the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy. However, the union also called a strike ballot among its 135,000 steel industry members, whose 10.5 per cent claim has been rejected by employers. 'We deliberately want to refrain from putting in double-figure claims,' said Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the engineers' leader, who announced a 9.5 per cent ceiling for regional pay claims this spring by the 4m-strong union. The recommendation demonstrates IG Metall's awareness that public opinion is swinging in favour of wage restraint, but the claim is still more than twice the inflation rate and is almost certain to be rejected by employers, swamped recently by gloomy forecasts. The union's engineering branches are due to put in claims in March, when most forecasters expect Germany's economic downturn to be accelerating. Gross national product figures, due tomorrow, are expected to show nil or negligible growth in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter. The union recognised Germany's economic difficulties, Mr Steinkuhler said, and its 'recommendation' took account of what was socially desirable and economically possible and necessary. In spite of its apparently conciliatory tone, however, IG Metall decided to go ahead with a strike ballot among its steel industry members. Mr Klaus Zwickel, deputy head of IG Metall, said steel employers had shown an unyielding attitude. As a result the steel talks had assumed 'a significance way beyond that of the sector', but added that the union would still negotiate. The talks are deadlocked with an offer of just over 5 per cent tabled by employers and proposals for more than 6 per cent from the union side. The strike ballot is due to be held on January 26 when a 75 per cent majority would be needed to call the workforce out. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman of the country's largest steelmaker, Thyssen Stahl, claimed that a settlement of the dispute with steelworkers was possible, but he insisted it had to be less than 6 per cent. He underlined his message by revealing a 42 per cent drop in profits, and announced 2,000 steel job losses at the company this year. Speeding in the slow lane Page 2</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Yeltsin aide wants pledges to the IMF relaxed President Boris Yeltsin's chief aide on the economy said yesterday that Russia could not fulfil International Monetary Fund conditions agreed for a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan in March and that higher inflation was the only way to save the Russian economy from collapse. Mr Alexander Livshits, who heads the group of economists on whom the Russian president relies for much of his advice, said in an interview that the reduction in inflation to between 7 and 8 per cent a month had been achieved too soon. 'It is one thing to have it as a target for December, but to have it in March-April is destroying our economy.' The IMF agreed the systemic transformation facility on condition that the government increased revenues this year and kept expenditure at a target of Rbs183,000bn (Pounds 65.8bn). But Mr Livshits said the bulk of expenditure had been absorbed by the energy andagricultural sectors, 'the two most powerful lobbies in this country by far,' and the rest was grossly inadequate for the needs of the economy. 'The IMF must learn the reality of the situation and see what is happening,' he said. 'You can of course continue with the policy of tight money, but it will mean that industry collapses. The policy must be loosened.' Mr Livshits, a former economics professor, said the government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin appeared to lack the political will to undertake economic reforms or industrial restructuring beyond tightly controlling credit and money supply. He agreed the political impetus should come from Mr Yeltsin, but said: 'We have a separation of powers here and the president doesn't want to issue orders - do this or do that in the economy.' Steep falls in production of around 25 per cent in the first quarter of this year continued in April, he said. The fall in production last month was 29 per cent, compared to 28 per cent in March. 'April is usually not a bad month for production because there are no holidays, but May is bad (there are three days of public holidays and many take more) and so we can expect terrible figures for this month.' Mr Livshits admitted the official statistics for the economy were unreliable because they omitted or under-counted the private sector. But they gave an indication of what was happening in the state sector where, he said, 'factories are just at a standstill'. Even in growing industries such as consumer electronics and white goods, production has plummeted this year, he said. Part of the problem was the huge level of inter-enterprise debts and the refusal of most concerns to supply parts or goods without pre-payment. Mr Livshits called for a series of reforms to break up state enterprises and to end supply monopolies. He also proposed creation of a new commission, headed by a first deputy prime minister, to deal with strategic economic issues - paralleling the work of Mr Oleg Soskovets, at present the only first deputy premier, who heads a committee on operational issues. 'If we had had such a commission, we wouldn't have had the budget we now have.' The struggle over the budget has only just begun. It has been passed 'in principle' by parliament, which is still demanding fundamental changes, including an increase in expenditure of the kind Mr Livshits is proposing. But he said the budget might yet be passed because the powerful agrarian lobby was satisfied with the support it gave.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Service sector figures plug information gap: Advertising, accountancy and consultancy growing fastest; Architects and estate agencies stagnant Advertising agencies, accountants, business consultants and sanitary services have been among the fastest-growing areas of the service sector this year. Architects and estate agents have been stagnant, while turnover at hairdressers remains barely changed on the levels seen in 1992, in the depth of the recession. These are some of the details to have emerged from a new publication by the Central Statistical Office on the service sector. The publication marks an attempt by the CSO to expand coverage of this sector, with senior officials increasingly acknowledging that it is one of the largest statistical weaknesses. Although the service sector employs 15m people and accounts for about 60 per cent of gross domestic product, official government information on it has been patchier and appeared later than other economic information. By contrast, data on manufacturing, which accounts for only about a fifth of GDP and employs only 4.2m, has been considerably more extensive and appears more rapidly. CSO officials point out that one reason for the relative weakness of the data is that information on the sector is extremely difficult to collect, particularly for areas such as business services. Many City economists believe this lack of timely service-sector information represents one of the biggest shortcomings of British statistics, not least because it implies that the government statistical base is failing to adjust sufficiently rapidly to the broader change in the nature of the economy. As Mr David Mackie, economist at US investment bank JP Morgan points out, the service sector component of the GDP figures has been more prone to revision than many other elements of the GDP data in recent years. But Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce said the problem was not simply confined to government statistics. In spite of the fact that groups such as like the Confederation of British Industry provide detailed surveys on the manufacturing sector, comparable surveys on the service sector remain fairly limited, with the chambers of commerce providing one of the few surveys on the area. The latest service sector data, published by the CSO yesterday, remains distinctly patchy, with some information only available after a two-year time lag. Nevertheless the figures reveal some interesting trends. Business and financial services, for example, has been one of the fastest growing areas this year. The quarterly turnover of computer service groups rose from Pounds 2.9bn in the second quarter of last year to Pounds 3.4bn, at current prices, in the second quarter of this year. Employment agencies have also seen a rapid rise in business, with turnover rising from Pounds 1bn in the second quarter of last year to Pounds 1.4bn in the second quarter this year. The turnover of management consultants rose to Pounds 874m in the second quarter of this year, compared with Pounds 793m in the second quarter of last year. Advertisers and market researchers have also seen fast growth, with turnover rising from Pounds 671m in the second quarter of last year to Pounds 770m in the second quarter of this year. Accountancy service turnover was Pounds 1.7bn in the third quarter of this year , compared with Pounds 1.6bn in the third quarter last year, and Pounds 1.4bn in the same period in 1991. Legal services have seen their turnover rise from Pounds 1.9bn in the third quarter of last year to Pounds 2.1bn in the third quarter of this year. Growth in financial and business services, however, has been offset by a decline in other areas. Although distribution, hotels and catering is the largest component of the service sector, many retailing and catering sectors have seen little growth this year. The turnover of architects in the third quarter of this year was significantly lower than in 1991, while hairdressers, funeral directors and photographers saw little change in business levels over this period. Sanitary services have expanded rapidly, almost doubling in business over the last three years. However the turnover of research chemists and consulting engineers fell over the last year. The data suggests that the number of employees employed by the service sector has remained relatively constant in recent years. Employment has dropped sharply in the last three years in the postal and communications sector and railways, falling to 361,000 and 119,000 respectively. Meanwhile, the number of people employed by estate agents has dropped from 112,000 in 1989 to 101,000 now. The recreational, sport and cultural sectors have seen a rapid rise in employment levels and business services and banking areas have also grown significantly, with about 1.6m people now employed in business services.</p>

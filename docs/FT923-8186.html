			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: More scope for exporting from US to Mexico - Automobiles THE agreement in the car sector is intended to increase car companies' ability to export from the US and Canada to the rapidly growing Mexican market, while committing those companies to raise production in Mexico, write Damian Fraser and Bernard Simon. The agreement also makes it harder for non-Nafta car companies to operate in the North American market. The regional content rule, which car makers will have to meet to avoid tariffs or fines, has increased from 50 per cent in the US-Canada agreement to 62.5 per cent for cars and 60 per cent for components in the new accord. The 62.5 per cent content rule will be phased in over eight years. If manufacturers fail to meet the 62.5 per cent origin rule, they will have to pay tariffs. Nissan, which has a large plant in Mexico, will find it harder to meet this rule of origin; Volkswagen, also with a significant Mexican plant, is aiming to meet this requirement within a few years. Of some relief to foreign car makers, and an achievement for Canada in the Nafta deal, appears to be a new set of rules for calculating local content in the auto industry. Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's international trade minister, said yesterday that the Nafta rules would retroactively settle the high-profile dispute over exports of Ontario-built Honda cars to the US. The US Customs Service had alleged this year that, according to its method of calculating local content, the Honda plant failed to meet the 50 per cent local content required under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement for duty-free access. According to an official of the Canadian Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, the Nafta rules will in general adopt the 'all or nothing' approach by which, if individual parts of a car meet the 62.5 per cent threshold, they will be counted as wholly manufactured in North America. Mexico's decision to bow to US pressure for a higher local content rule was made in return for being able to phase out, rather than abolish, its own decree on the matter. In return, the US has agreed to reduce the 'chicken tax' on vans imported from Mexico, from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in the first year. After five years, the tax will be eliminated. Also, after three years, Mexico will be considered North American under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Act (Cafe), which now present discourages US manufacturers from importing small cars from Mexico. The result, within 10 years, will be free trade in cars in the Nafta region, and discrimination against non-Nafta producers.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Council offers deal for pay freeze A LOCAL authority is offering its town hall staff of nearly 1,400 a guarantee against compulsory redundancies if they accept a pay freeze next year. Walsall Council is believed to be the first authority to have made such an offer. The move is surprising because Walsall is not one of the few local authorities to have opted out of the national bargaining machinery. Local-authority analysts said such moves by councils might become more frequent as the predicted tight public-sector pay round next financial year curbs budgets. About 500 members of the Nalgo public-sector union have rejected the offer. Nupe, another public-sector union, and the GMB and TGWU general unions have yet to respond. Nalgo said: 'We are still at the very early stage of the budget-making process. We cannot be certain the guarantee could be delivered.' If members gave up next year's increase, they would be outside national pay bargaining machinery and would find it difficult to catch up with staff at other local authorities. Mr Mike Bird, council leader, said: 'The council is facing financial problems and needs to make cuts of about 20 per cent. We are offering employees the chance to safeguard their jobs.' If the deal is accepted it will save the council Pounds 3.5m of the Pounds 14m it needs to save.</p>

Kwasniewski said that "there are serious problems which  should not be underrated," but declined to give a clear cut  answer to reporters' questions about the possible resignation of  Vice-Premier and Finance Minister Marek Borowski.    The leader of SLD declared that "it would certainly be the  worst way out if we provoked a major rift within the ruling  coalition or a political conflict on a national scale" and added  that there were numerous possibilities of avoiding such a  scenario.    According to Kwasniewski, neither his alliance nor the  Polish  Peasant Party (PSL) of Prime Minister pawlak had at the present  time any alternative to the current coalition arrangment. What  was needed was a better coordination of their activities.    Referring to the expected topics of his Thursday night  meeting with Pawlak, Kwasniewski said he wanted to discuss not  only the style and manners of making politics but a few  fundamental questions as well. They were the mode of operation  of the government and economic concepts.    In this connection Kwasniewski spoke critically about  opinions on economic issues voiced recently by PSL politicians  such as the minister for foreign economic cooperation, the  chairman of the Sejm Privatization Committee and the prime  minister.</p>

The prime minister reviewed  the results of the recent visit to Jordan by Dennis Ross, the  U.S. Middle East peace coordinator.    Following the meeting, Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state  for  cabinet affairs and minister of information, told the Jordanian  News Agency that the prime minister explained the most important  points raised during his meeting with Mr. Dennis Ross. Ross  expressed his optimism about the possibility of reaching an  agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides on the issue  of security arrangements in Hebron, in addition to immediate  steps to take measures ensuring the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement. He pointed out that the Israeli  side agreed to a Palestinian police force in Gaza, Jericho, and  Hebron even before an agreement on the final arrangements has  been reached.    The minister said the prime minister noted his meeting with  Ross touched on the issue of the powers that will be transferred  from the Israelis to the transitional Palestinian authority in  various West Bank and Gaza Strip areas, with the exception of  Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, and Israeli military bases,  as well as matters pertaining to expanding the scale of these  powers.    Al-'Anani said the cabinet reviewed discussions with the  U.S.  side on bilateral relations, with a clear emphasis on the  methods used to inspect ships in the Red Sea by warships  stationed there, most of which are American. During his meeting  with Ross, al-Majali noted that recently a noticeable increase  has occurred in the number of ships turned back for unacceptable  excuses. Jordan strongly protested this in view of its immense  negative effects on the Jordanian economy. The number of ships  inspected since 1991 has reached 1,700. The international  inspecting forces have not been able to find a single violation.  Therefore, Jordan rejects the continuation of this method and  thinks the inspection should be transferred from the Red Sea to  the Port of al-'Aqabah and that inpsections should be done by a  neutral, nonmilitary side. Jordan proposed this just before his  majesty's recent visit to the United States. It was discussed  during his majesty's visit. The American side promised to look  into this matter seriously at the time. A breakthrough is  expected in this issue within a short time.    Al-'Anani added that the third point al-Majali put to the  cabinet, and which was discussed during Mr. Ross's visit, is  Jordan's emphasis on the need for practical progress in the  peace process. The Israeli side has been sticking to its  position, refusing to broach substantive issues, and has even  resisted the implementation of agreements already reached.  Without substantive progress in the near future, the peace  process will be subject to great doubts.    Dr. al-'Anani explained that the fourth point discussed was  the return to the bilateral negotiation rounds in Washington in  April. The Jordanian side had announced that the agreement to  return to negotiations should be an Arab decision, particularly  by the cordon states. This issue may be discussed as part of  the Arab foreign ministers meetings that began today.    Al-'Anani pointed to the possibility that U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher may visit the region to discuss the  return to the negotiation rounds in Washington and to agree on  arrangements that would secure a positive development in the  negotiations.    The information minister said Dr. al-Majali briefed the  cabinet on the fact that Ross and his delegation said a tangible  and clear breakthrough will be achieved on some negotiating  tracks in 1994.    Dr. al-'Anani said the cabinet session touched on the  campaigns external parties have begun to launch against Jordan.  The cabinet quickly reviewed an Amnesty International statement  that included praise of Jordan's important political  developments and democratic march. This statement, however,  criticized some formal restrictions mentioned in the new press  and publications law and the execution of some civil criminals  tried by civil Jordanian courts.    The cabinet listened to an explanation of this issue,  presented by the information and interior ministers. The  cabinet noted that Israeli media are launching campaigns that  cast doubt on the Jordanian democratic march. It is clear that  this campaign has certain objectives and is in harmony with  current pressures on Jordan, in order to affect Jordan's  political and negotiating position.    The prime minister said the constants of the Jordanian  position are clear, that Jordan seeks a comprehensive, just, and  lasting peace on all fronts, and that Jordan adheres to the  joint agenda calling for discussion of all issues on the agenda,  particularly occupied Jordanian territory, Jordan's water  rights, and the refugees and displaced persons issue. The prime  minister said unless satisfactory solutions to these points are  reached, Jordan will not sign any peace agreement with Israel.  Jordan has shown a real desire for peace since the Madrid  negotiations began. Jordan's position has always supported real  peace and the negotiations process. Therefore, the government  rejects tendentious campaigns that cast doubt on Jordan's  democracy and democratic institutions.</p>

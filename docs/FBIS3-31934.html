			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the Guatemalan people from President Ramiro de </F> Leon Carpio; issued in Guatemala City on 28 January; broadcast  in progress -- read by presidential spokesman Felix Loarta  Guzman]    [Text] ...very similar to the various proposals made by the  Guatemalan Government.    The new Honduran president talked about his firm commitment  in favor of a moral revolution, and he spoke about his  determination to fight corruption and impunity. He also  outlined the basic principles of the new Honduran Government,  such as austerity, honesty, and integrity, and the decision to  initiate a great crusade against poverty.    The multitude that gathered at the stadium in Honduras --  the  people of our sister nation -- showed their friendliness to the  Guatemalan president with an enthusiastic ovation at his  entrance and departure.    This afternoon, President de Leon Carpio returned from  Tegucigalpa very grateful for the expressions of affection and  solidarity he received from the Honduran people and government.  The changeover of presidents in a democratic manner in our  region is one of the most important factors to gradually  consolidating the process of integration in Central America.    In Honduras, the president also had the opportunity to meet  with several heads of state and government representatives from  friendly nations who expressed their support for the efforts  conducted by the Guatemalan people in favor of democracy.    The U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American  affairs met this morning with President de Leon Carpio in  Tegucigalpa, and he expressed the firm support from the  government of President Bill Clinton for the aspirations of  peace, development, and democracy in Guatemala. He received the  same expressions of support from the prime minister of the  Republic of China, Venezuelan officials, and from the Spanish  justice minister. The entire international community is  supporting the achievements made in Guatemala to consolidate the  government within the framework of legality.    Therefore, upon returning to Guatemala and learning about  the  unfortunate incidents, particularly about the cowardly actions  carried out by terrorist groups trying to create unrest among  the Guatemalan people, the president condemned these actions.  He also noted that both our people and the people of the world  condemn these actions, because they represent an attack against  democracy.    The Guatemalan president is a man who respects the laws and  Constitution. Therefore, he immediately issued instructions to  the state security agencies to fight terrorist groups according  to the law. Nevertheless, President de Leon feels the best way  to counter those who are acting against democracy is by working  together -- the people and the government -- and report those  who are planting the bombs.    The sense of awareness and repudiation of terrorism is very  high. Thanks to the cooperation of many people of goodwill, we  have managed to deactivate several bombs.    As a democratic president, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio  is  issuing a call to all of the people of Guatemala to defend the  institutions and to reject provocations by those who, while  hiding behind anonymity, are trying to make the country return  to the sad disgraceful days of abuse against fundamental rights.  The truth is that people no longer want to return to the past.  Guatemalans want to live in peace, and therefore they reject  violence.    The president was very sad to learn about the victims of the  terrorist actions. All of this must come to an end in Guatemala.    The president has instructed the civilian forces, with the  Army's support, to reinforce all measures to ensure every  citizen's safety. The government will act firmly, yet within the  Constitution's framework.    The president of the Republic also wants to take this  opportunity to congratulate the state workers for their profound  common sense in ignoring the leaders' unauthorized call to  declare a general strike in the public administration. The state  workers did not comply with the agitators and kept on working as  normal. This shows we are maturing. The Guatemalan people want  peace. All Guatemalans reject the attempts to destabilize the  country.    Finally, the president of the Republic appeals to the people  who are being used to plant terrorist bombs. The president wants  to tell them they are causing great damage. They have left a  trail of victims and damage. Power outages have irritated the  population. Also, the damage caused on the electric  infrastructure is considerable. The terrorists are hurting the  people. This is why the people reject them.    The president hereby asks the Guatemalan people to turn a  deaf ear on reports of bridges being blown up and bombs being  planted. He also asks bus and truck drivers to be sensible, to  keep talking with the government delegates, and to forget the  idea of striking next week. The possibility of reaching an  agreement through talks should be explored to its fullest. He  also asks the Guatemalan people to remain firm and move the  country forward. The only way to rebuild a Guatemala with social  justice is with the Constitution and democracy. Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yegor Gaydar: "Will Zhirinovskiy Avoid Public </F> Trial?"]    [Text] In December last year I said publicly that Mr.  Zhirinovskiy reminds me of Hitler in 1929. Zhirinovskiy took  offense and sued me.    Explaining and developing my metaphor, I published an  article  in IZVESTIYA under what seemed to me the quite expressive  headline "Gambling on Scoundrels." The main content of the  article came down to the idea that Zhirinovskiy's political  activity was ideally suited to the definition of "fascist" and  that he himself in terms of some of his personal features could  serve as a graphic illustration in a museum on the history of  fascism.    This article seems to have made a powerful impression on  Zhirinovskiy. As far as I can judge (I express myself so  cautiously because information on his behavior is never  accurate) he did two things. First he withdrew his lawsuit,  explaining he was satisfied with the explanations I gave in my  article. That is, this can be assessed as meaning that  previously Zhirinovskiy did not guess he was a fascist but now  that he has read the article and thought about it he has  realized that yes, he is a fascist. Which satisfied him, and  there he stopped. But there immediately followed a second  action: Zhirinovskiy is suing me again, for the same article!    I admit that from my viewpoint there is a certain  contradiction between these two actions. I adhere to  old-fashioned logic in which there is no third option. Either  something is or it is not. Either he is satisfied with the  article or he is not.    But obviously Zhirinovskiy's logic is different. I cannot  say it surprises me, it is in fact a pure example of the logic  and conduct of a fascist politician. A small example of how  demagoguery and lies are promoted as an example and taken to the  limit, to the absurd.    Therefore as long as a fascist is not in power his words and  actions cause tittering and are declared a farce. As soon as he  comes to power the titters turn to groans and farce to tragedy.    It is not the pleasantest task to rake over piles of absurd,  fantastic lies which he scatters at every step with unusual ease  and shamelessness, trapping the credulous with this bait. It is  simpler to keep quiet or to turn away squeamishly. But in the  case of fascists keeping quiet means indulging them. So I shall  unconditionally do everything in my power to ensure that there  is a public trial of Zhirinovskiy, a public trial of fascist  ideology and propaganda in our country.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Management: Advice one can take to heart - A look at a new guide to executive health PEOPLE with demanding occupations rarely spare a thought for health when things are going well. Life is busy, health is largely a matter of luck and, besides, isn't everything bad for you these days? Faced with confusion and tight schedules, it is little wonder executives are apt to throw their hands up in self-defeat, go for another three-course lunch and carry on exactly as before. The dietary fat theory - that lowering cholesterol levels is associated with an excess of violent deaths - received a sizeable knock when it was mooted a few years ago There are various reasons why results of such studies could be a statistical quirk. Nonetheless, they gave some people the idea that most health interventions were in vain, since whatever might be gained on the swings would be promptly lost on the roundabouts. This is not so and precise authoritative advice is needed. The 12-Week Executive Health Plan* by David Ashton concentrates on the prevention of coronary heart disease and some of the common cancers and gets down to specifics. Its approach involves a numerical self-appraisal of health risk, which executives will find more compelling than vague unquantified exhortations to lose weight, eat better and take more exercise. As a cardiologist, Ashton has worked for more than five years with this type of health risk appraisal (HRA), which incorporates blood pressure, smoking, drinking, diet, stress and exercise (or lack of it). Companies which provide medicals are already asking similar questions, so some staff may be familiar with the concept. However, they are not always motivated to heed the warnings they receive from employers. Cholesterol is one of the variables taken into account in the calculation, since it is an independent risk factor, as was realised about 30 years ago. Recent studies show that lowering cholesterol can improve blood flow in the coronary arteries, at least in men. Data on coronary artery disease in women are scanty, though there is no reason to think that the effects should be different. As this book explains, however, it is naive to believe that a raised cholesterol level is in itself a cause of heart disease. Cholesterol exists in two forms: LDL which is harmful and HDL which is beneficial. It is a little-known fact that some cholesterol is essential to life. There is also a popular misconception about the role of diet. It is saturated fat rather than cholesterol which raises blood cholesterol, hence a cholesterol-lowering diet is not the same as a low-cholesterol diet. It will not always be easy to have business lunches and eat healthily, but it is feasible to follow most of the advice in the book; despite its title, this is not a detailed scheme of how to spend the next 12 weeks down to the last Ryvita, but an explanation of scientific principles which are not, alas, always obvious from what is reported in the press. There are plenty of data aimed at intelligent readers who ask questions and want to be able to act on the answers. The HRA score should change for the better within a mere 12 weeks of doing the right things. As Ashton puts it: 'You can train for a marathon in 12 weeks.' The best news of all is that you do not have to. Exercising seven times a week is not significantly better for the heart than a brisk walk three or four times a week. Within the pages of this book, there are more snippets of good news besides. For example, anti-oxidants, the naturally occuring substances, may help prevent cancer and heart disease and the fact that giving up smoking produces benefits for the heart within hours of stopping. To some extent one can, after all, make one's own luck. The author is a London general practitioner. *The 12-Week Executive Health Plan, by David Ashton. Published by Kogan Page, Pounds 9.99.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Let us go back to a report by Ivan Gerasyuk and the  explanation by Stanislav Shushkevich, who proposed to hear Major  General Konstantin Platonov, deputy interior minister and the  commander of Interior Ministry troops, today at a  behind-closed-doors meeting. In spite of the proposal,  Konstantin Platonov gave no official response.    Here is what Deputy Aleksandr Lukashenko, who had a phone  conversation with Konstantin Platonov, told a BELINFORM  correspondent. The general said that he received an anonymous  phone call on Thursday [20 January]. An identified person  threatened to apply terrorist acts against people's deputies if  Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and KGB Chief Eduard  Shirkovskiy did not resign. This is the reason Konstantin  Platonov assumed responsibility and issued an order to put an  Interior Ministry detachment on alert and move it, unarmed,  closer to the Government House. When the call proved to be a  hoax, the detachment was sent back to its permanent quarters.    Thus, the presence of an Interior Ministry battalion near  the  Music Comedy Theater is a true fact. However, there is still no  official version on the incident.    There remain questions instead: Why was such an important  decision adopted at the level of deputy minister? Why were  Stanislav Shushkevich, head of the Security Council, and other  decisionmaking officials, such as the interior minister and the  KGB chief, not informed about the threat hanging over the  deputies?</p>

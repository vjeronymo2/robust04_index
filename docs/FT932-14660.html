			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: HTV plans sale of Cordmate Inv As part of its strategy of concentrating on its core activities, HTV, the independent television company for Wales and the west country, has reached conditional agreement to dispose of Cordmate Investments, poster planning and buying agency. Alban Securities, which has been formed by a management team supported by an institutional investor, will pay Pounds 2.2m cash on completion of the sale. However, HTV is required to repay certain inter-company balances which will reduce the sale proceeds to about Pounds 500,000. In 1992 Cordmate, which is a holding company for three subsidiaries: Concord, Alban and Cordmate, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 426,000. At the end of December net assets amounted to Pounds 1.9m. An extraordinary general meeting is to take place on May 4 to seek shareholder approval.</p>

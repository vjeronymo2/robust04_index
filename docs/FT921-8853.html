			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis resist pressure for deep cuts at Opec talks MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were in intense talks last night as Saudi Arabia resisted pressure for deep production cuts. The kingdom was being pressed to accept a production level of 7.7m to 7.8m barrels a day as part of an overall ceiling of between 22.5m and 22.8m b/d. Mr Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister and current Opec president, said ministers remained 300,000 b/d apart in on the ceiling. And they are still uncertain as to how the cut will be shared. Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister is reluctant to trim output below 8m b/d. Saudi Arabia has been coming under mounting pressure from its more impoverished colleagues inside the producers' club to agree to a cut in overall production that would give a boost to world oil prices. But the kingdom wants to shave little more than 1.2m b/d from output, leaving an overall ceiling of 23m b/d. Mr Nazer kept a low profile at yesterday's talks and was often absent from meetings of the fractious organisation. But he was quietly insisting on a ceiling higher than most other ministers would like. Saudi Arabia is confident that a ceiling of 23m b/d will be low enough to underpin world prices. But the market is looking for more decisive action to put a floor under the price in the second quarter. One delegate stressed that the Saudi's more optimistic view of demand was close to other international forecasts and was not far from the estimate, by the Opec secretariat, that the call on Opec oil would be 22.77m b/d by April. 'Saudi Arabia will agree to share out production cuts if we all decide on 23m b/d as a ceiling,' one Gulf source said, 'but below that we have no proposals.' The brunt of the production cuts would be shared by Saudi Arabia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Nigeria and Libya, which have all raised output to compensate for the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil from the market. Ministers from 12 countries appear to be united behind a cut of at least 1.5m b/d, but Saudi Arabia is holding out. The kingdom is still pushing for production levels to be distributed according to capacity. But ministers have debated long and hard over their capacity levels. In the run-up to fixing individual production levels, there is a tendency by some artificially to inflate their figures in order eventually to gain a higher share of the overall ceiling. One delegate said that if all of these claims were added up, they come to an overall output of 25.3m b/d, at least 1m b/d higher than outside estimates for Opec capacity. It is way above the secretariat's estimate of December production, 24.4m b/d, which was when producers were believed to be pumping flat out. 'These numbers are all purely fictitious,' the delegate said, 'nevertheless, we've been debating them all morning.' At the same time, the agreement must make some allowance for Iraq and Kuwait. Mr Aminu said that any final deal would include a clause calling on members to institute immediate cuts if Iraq returned to the market, although Baghdad is unlikely to do so oil before the next meeting in May. Kuwait will be allowed to produce freely. The emirate has said it could pump 900,000 b/d by June.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> PSYCHIATRIST NOT THE ANSWER  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning was asked Tuesday if he has entertained the idea of hiring a  team psychiatrist as the Dodgers have done.  </P> <P> "You know I must have 75 letters since I've been here at San Diego and probably  another 125 when I was at Atlanta," he said.  </P> <P> "People write in and tell you they have the answer.  </P> <P> "I had one on my desk yesterday from a guy in Knoxville, Tenn., who said he can  massage away all our ills.  </P> <P> "If you were to give the card of that psychiatrist maybe I could have it  printed up and sent to these 75 people that continually write to me and have  the answers. The problem is they have all the answers, but they keep changing  the questions."  </P> <P> The Chargers placed running back Joe Mickles on injured reserve and re-signed  Tim Spencer, who was released during the exhibition season.  </P> <P> Spencer played with the Chargers for five seasons as a running back and was  moved to H-back shortly before being cut. He will return to the running back  position now and will be used as the upback in goal-line situations if injured  linebacker Gary Plummer is unable to play.  </P> <P> Henning said Marion Butts will continue to be the team's primary ball carrier,  and should he be injured, the ball will be given to Ronnie Harmon next.  </P> <P> The Chargers released practice squad player linebacker Willie Joe Walker  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The team is presently carrying quarterback John Friesz, offensive lineman Dean  Brown, defensive back Derrick Kelson and wide receiver Ron Heard on its  five-man practice unit.  </P> <P> Henning said linebacker Billy Ray Smith, who suffered a hyperextended elbow,  will be available on a limited basis at best for the game against the Jets.  </P> <P> Smith's backup, Henry Rolling, has been bothered by a hamstring injury.

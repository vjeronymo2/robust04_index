			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOM FOOD;  </P> <P> REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED OUR TASTES. THE RECIPES ARE THE LEAST OF IT.;  </P> <P> WE REMEMBER MAMA;  </P> <P> YES: MASA  </P> <P> When I was growing up on the Veracruz coast, the slap-slap of women's hands  forming corn tortillas was as constant and soothing to me as the crash of the  nearby surf. I remember wandering into our breezy, tiled kitchen each morning  and devouring the puffy gold discs as our maids whisked them from the sizzling  hot comal.  </P> <P> Just as constant was the large ball of masa that sat on the counter top covered  with a dampened piece of rough-hewn cloth. This simple dough of ground corn and  water was our staff of life. It was the base not only for our tortillas but for  countless other dishes that filled our plates and delighted our palates.  </P> <P> For Mexicans, working with masa is a spiritual tradition. As legend tells us,  the gods molded humans from corn. Some of the very food we place on our tables  today was enjoyed by Montezuma and by prehistoric Indians. In essence, every  time we work that heavy, pliable dough through our hands, we place ourselves in  touch with our ancient roots.  </P> <P> While Americans are beginning to experiment with the wide variety of Mexican  chiles, salsas and herbs that are now available, they have not yet adopted masa  into their cooking regime. A big reason for this is that hand work, in general,  is not a part of the American culinary tradition. Americans are a bit daunted  by the idea. It seems too complicated and time-consuming, especially when  frozen entree and gourmet specialty shops provide such an appealing  alternative.  </P> <P> What a shame. Nothing can quite compare to the taste of a mashed ripe avocado  or a dab of onion-flecked beans cradled in a warm, soft tortilla. Nor can any  store-bought treat make one's mouth water like the fabulous array of masa  finger foods we call antojos.  </P> <P> Literally meaning "before the eyes," these savory treats were traditionally  served before meals to spark the appetite. Today, however, antojos are eaten at  any time as convenient snacks for those on the go or alongside a tossed salad  for a delicious meal.  </P> <P> Working with masa as sculptors work with clay, Mexicans have managed to create  a seemingly endless variety of antojos. Though similar versions may be found  throughout the country, each region adds its own special twist, be it in the  spices they use, the thickness of their dough or the shape of their finished  product.  </P> <P> With the help of pre-ground masa harina and a tortilla press, available in  specialty shops and some supermarkets, working with masa is relatively fast and  simple. And the payoff is tremendous. After a little bit of practice, expert  and novice cooks will find they have discovered one of the most versatile and  delicious of cooking mediums.  </P> <P> There are a few tricks to cooking successfully with masa. Like a good pie crust  dough, masa must have just the right consistency -- not too sticky, not too  dry. The basic recipe I have provided below is my mother's. Start with the  smaller amount of water and keep adding until the masa is pliable and pulls  cleanly from your hands.  </P> <P> A proper cooking surface, heated sufficiently, is also crucial. In Mexico,  antojos and tortillas are cooked on a comal -- a thick iron griddle heated over  coals. The ideal alternative in the American kitchen is a stove-top griddle. If  this is not available, a cast-iron pan will do quite well. Either surface  should be lightly greased with vegetable oil and preheated at medium-high for  10 to 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Lastly, use imagination. Once you feel comfortable, don't be afraid to  experiment with a variety of fillings and textures. Wrap a warm tortilla around  leftover ratatouille. Enclose caramelized onions in masa, grill the pocket and  douse it with a roasted pepper sauce.  </P> <P> Masa is wonderfully adaptable, and its unique flavor and texture will add a new  dimension to cooking.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MASA AND TORTILLAS  </P> <P> FROM MASA HARINA  </P> <P> 3 cups masa harina  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 to 2 cups lukewarm water  </P> <P> Combine masa harina, salt and lukewarm water in bowl and mix with fork. Gather  into ball and knead dough until smooth and no longer sticky. Cover with towel  and let stand 1 hour.  </P> <P> To make tortillas, line base of tortilla press with sheet plastic wrap or  plastic sandwich bag. Pinch off balls of dough from masa. (Size will vary,  depending on desired tortilla diameter; balls usually are slightly bigger than  walnut.) Center masa on lined tortilla press base. Cover masa with sheet  plastic wrap. Lower top of press and push down on handle. Open.  </P> <P> Carefully peel away plastic from top. Place left hand (if right-handed) under  tortilla. Flip tortilla onto right hand, so plastic is on top. Carefully peel  away plastic. Flip tortilla onto preheated, very hot griddle or cast-iron pan.  When tortilla begins to dry on edges, flip over and cook until top begins to  puff. Tap lightly with finger tips to allow even puffing and let cook briefly,  1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Remove tortillas from griddle and wrap in napkin or clean  towel and serve. Makes 1 1/2 pounds masa or about 24 tortillas.  </P></p>

The two sides discussed  bilateral trade relations and means to bolster and develop these  relations. Details are in the following report:    Dr. Khalaf reviewed trade relations between Jordan and the  United States and the great investment opportunities that the  citizens are expecting as a result of the peace process in the  region--a process that achieves a just, comprehensive, and  durable peace and maintains Arab rights. She talked about  Jordan's current economic reform program and the positive  results of this program. She noted that the Gulf war had a  negative impact on the program, which led to its interruption  for a period of time.    The minister said that Jordan is an important partner to the  United States, pointing out that Jordan's import of U.S. goods  is 23 percent of its overall world imports at a time when  Jordanian exports to the United States are very limited. In  this regard, the minister expressed Jordan's desire to sign an  agreement with the United States to take advantage of the  preferential U.S. trade system, based on which exports to the  United States, including Jordanian exports, are given privileges  such as customs exemption. She noted that Jordanian exporters  faced some difficulties as a result of being excluded from this  system and its privileges. Dr. Khalaf said that Jordan is  seeking to improve the investment climate in order to find  appropriate trade relations with the world, including the United  States.    Minister of Planning Dr. Ziyad Fariz said that Jordan began  planning policies in the areas of investment and development of  exports in 1989. He noted that the Ministry is seeking to  privatize some of the public sector's properties, adding that  this requires assistance as well as a solution to the social  problems that could result from this. He said there are  economic and social reforms in this field such as developing the  health system.    Dr. Fariz also talked about Jordan's efforts to solve the  problem of Jordan's debts to the International Monetary Fund and  the World Bank. Moreover, the minister of planning presented to  the U.S. secretary of commerce a paper that summarizes the most  important economic and social problems and challenges facing  Jordan.    Minister of Finance Sami Qammuh talked about Jordan's debt  of  $7.5 million, which obstructs the process of serving commerce  and investment. He noted that this debt needs to be written off.    For his part, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce talked about  the  importance of trade exchange between Jordan and the United  States and the prospects of trade in the region as a result of  the peace process. He noted the importance of Jordan's  geographical location, which allows it to play a big role in  reinforcing trade in the Middle East. He welcomed economic  reforms in Jordan, which include encouraging the private sector  and reinforcing its role in investment opportunities. He noted  the possibility of cooperation between Jordanian and U.S.  businessmen to encourage the private sectors of both countries  to get involved in various forms of investment. He welcomed the  idea of opening a number of branches for Jordanian banks in the  occupied Arab territories, which will provide for broader  cooperation between the banking sectors of Jordan and the United  States.    The Jordanian and U.S. sides exchanged ideas on the  possibilities for commercial cooperation and on encouraging the  private sector's role in this field. Khaldun Abu-Hassan, head  of Amman's Chamber of Industry, talked about the embargo imposed  on Jordanian goods at the port of al-'Aqabah, stressing the need  to provide the private sectors of both countries with  opportunities for investment and commercial exchange.</p>

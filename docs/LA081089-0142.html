			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> METS' CARTER GETS 4 HITS, BUT NO MORE PLAYING TIME  </P> <P> In one afternoon, Gary Carter rapped as many hits as he had since April 23, a  stretch of 107 days, 46 at-bats and one knee operation. Carter singled twice  and doubled twice in the New York Mets' 6-0 victory over the Phillies Wednesday  for his first four-hit game since Sept. 23, 1987. And yet he earned himself no  more playing time. Carter is still the No. 3 catcher, behind Barry Lyons and  Mackey Sasser, and is not expected to start either of the games of today's  twi-night doubleheader at Shea Stadium against the Cardinals.  </P> <P> "Probably not," Davey Johnson said. "Health-wise, he was better. Obviously, he  swung the bat better, and the way he ran and moved around behind the plate  showed physically he's getting better. But he's not 100%. Last week I think I  said he was 70%. I'd probably have to elevate that to 80%."  </P> <P> But Carter indicated he is ready and eager to reclaim his job. "If that's the  way Davey wants to go about it, fine," Carter said. "My time is right now. So  what if I'm 80% or 100%? I don't think I'll ever be 100%. I haven't been 100%  in four or five years. What's the difference? I just want the opportunity to  play. That's all I ask. After a 4-for-4 game, I'd like to think I can play  every day."  </P> <P> Carter was 11 for 95 for the season before Wednesday. He hadn't managed as many  as two hits in a game since Sept. 22. Carter dropped a single into left field  in the second inning, blooped a double past diving left fielder Randy Ready in  the fifth, pulled a single into left field in the sixth and lined a somewhat  accidental opposite-field double in the eighth.  </P> <P> "My first three hits were to left field," Carter said. "I'm not about to change  my philosophy (of hitting). I'm a pull hitter and that's all there is to it."  </P> <P> Carter raised his batting average from .116 to a season-high .152. His two  doubles were as many as he had all year. Carter also scored from second base on  a ground-ball single by Kevin Elster.  </P> <P> Carter moved past Rick Ferrell into fifth place for most games played by a  catcher with 1,806. Jim Sundberg of the Rangers is fourth with 1,906.  </P> <P> "I feel great," Carter said. "It's a positive feeling, coming off a 4-for-4  game and a win that keeps us right in the thick of things."  </P></p>

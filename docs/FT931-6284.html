			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Viag to hold payout despite setback VIAG, the German energy-based conglomerate, is likely to maintain its dividend despite a 9 per cent fall in profits last year. The group, which last summer forecast higher earnings and its ninth consecutive pay-out increase, said yesterday that performance had been hit by the accelerating downturn in the second half. There were no real signs of improvement in the German economy, although the company said it expected the worst to be over in some business areas in the second half of the current year. Cost-cutting programmes and structural adjustments would continue, it added. Numbers employed rose 14 per cent to 84,200 during the year as a result of consolidating recent acquisitions, although on a like-for-like basis the workforce was cut by 3 per cent. Net profits of DM370m (Dollars 225.4m), on sales up 3 per cent at DM24.3bn, were eroded by falling income from the can-making and trading interests. Results from the glass business, grouped under the Gerresheimer subsidiary, were 'heavily burdened' by over-capacity and import competition. The rise in group turnover was largely attributable to the inclusion for the first time of sales from Viag's one-third stake in the Kuhne &amp; Nagel shipping and freight concern. Profits from chemicals, the group's third-largest sector after energy and aluminium, 'improved significantly', while sales fell from DM1.9bn to DM1.6bn. Increased earnings were attributed to good demand for special products for the building industry and structural changes in the metallurgy business. Restructuring also helped improve results in fire protection, where sales were virtually unchanged at DM1.4bn. Deliveries of electricity and natural gas from the energy subsidiaries, which contributed DM3.6bn to group sales compared with DM3.2bn last time, were unchanged and earnings remained at the high level of the previous year. Earnings from aluminium were also unchanged despite the impact on prices of shipments from the former Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Gromak report: "Lithuania's Draft Defense Doctrine </F> Published"]    [Text] Vilnius -- The purpose of defense is to protect the  independence, inviolability, and territorial integrity of  Lithuania and also to guarantee its citizens' safety from  external threats, the preamble to this document states.    In what situations can Lithuania's armed forces be used? The  document answers this question by saying that aggression by  another state or military alliance, civil war in neighboring  states or an armed conflict between them which might spread to  Lithuania, an invasion by uncontrolled military units or other  armed groupings, a large concentration of military force near  the Lithuanian border, or international terrorism constitute  such situations. True, Lithuania prefers primarily political  and diplomatic methods to eliminate threats.    The draft also points out that in strengthening its security  Lithuania cooperates with other states and international  organizations and bases itself on the universally recognized  principles of international law.    The army constitutes the basis of Lithuania's defense  system.    The section on cooperation with foreign states' military  structures provides for participation in joint exercises, the  training of joint peacekeeping subunits, and cooperation in  guarding the state border.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Arts: The spontaneity of 'Cher Poupoule' / Review of Poulenc's other writings Writing letters was almost as much a part of Poulenc's life as composing music. 'He wrote' said his great friend, exact contemporary and recital partner, the singer Pierre Bernac, 'with disconcerting speed, and his style was as alive, personal, unpredictable and spontaneous as his conversation'. And one might add, as his music. Not unnaturally his friends were eager for letters from their 'cher Poupoule'. Even when he was doing little more than provide charming entertainment, his music was never impersonal or pretentious. After 1936, when he underwent some kind of mystical experience at Rocamadour (which led to the choral Litanies a la Vierge Noire), he wrote on a deeper level not always recognised because he so blithely ignored current fashions. The impudent cheerfulness of the earlier years, however, was not banished. The letters here printed, most satisfyingly translated and edited, with admirable notes, by Sidney Buckland, continues a project started by the singer Winifred Radford, who knew Bernac and Poulenc well. In 1967 a smaller selection edited by Helene de Wendel was published in Paris. This is now out of print. Mrs Buckland has added many unpublished letters, increasing the total from 224 to 350, restoring passages formerly omitted. Soon after Poulenc's death it was understandable that some references to his private life should be cut out, less so that passages should disappear in which he endearingly described the pleasure his new works gave him. Like many artists, Poulenc was inclined to prefer his latest work above all the others. He was not always right, but the childish enthusiasm was part of the man. The private disclosures hold little joy for the prurient. He confided in certain friends, male and female, with unaffected frankness and candour. A young mechanic, Raymond, became his driver and his lover, and remained (with his wife) as a valued part of Poulenc's entourage at Noizay in Touraine. Later there was a young man from the Midi called Lucien who caused much emotional distress, increasing to breakdown-point when Lucien died of tuberculosis. At this stage Poulenc's grief became so obsessive as to draw a sharp but dignified rebuke from the long-suffering Bernac, as always 'counsellor and conscience'. These friendships (later still there was Louis, a dashing regular Army sergeant) were, whether they knew it or not, intimately bound up with the composition of various works - Raymond was 'the secret', as Poulenc put it, of the opera-bouffe Les Mamelles de Tiresias and of the Eluard cantata Figure humaine; Lucien of the Stabat Mater and the Dialogues des Carmelites; and Louis of the Cocteau opera La Voix humaine. In 1946 Poulenc had a daughter, whose mother was a friend of many years' standing. Mostly, but by no means solely, in letters to Bernac, observations about music and musicians are many and fascinating. Poulenc's generosity to younger colleagues is striking. His appreciation of two composers of very different stamp, Messiaen and Boulez, is genuine if qualified (it did not necessarily extent to their acolytes). There is a surprising reaction to a usually admired senior figure, Paul Dukas, whose influence on Messiaen Poulenc found 'irritating' - 'Saint-Saens's method could guide a Ravel, for example. But what Dukas uses is a method based on other methods.' He preferred Prokofiev to Shostakovich, whom he likened to 'Brahms: everywhere and all the time'. In the background there is the wise, benign figure of Darius Milhaud and the less positive, sympathy-demanding form of Henri Sauguet. Prompt as he was to express pleasure in his own music, he waited urgently for the opinion of friends he trusted (Bernac most of all). When Charles Koechlin, his former and greatly respected teacher, compared the new ballet Les animaux modeles unfavourably with the much earlier Les Biches, Poulenc was hurt. Judging from the concert suite, Koechlin surely had a point. Les Biches, so successful in blending near-pastiche with 'modern' (1924) sophistication and syncopation, so disarmingly, insidiously tuneful and yet so sad, is a small-scale masterpiece which in its own kind Poulenc could not surpass (it needs the rowdy chorus parts, not often I think done in the theatre but included in the Markevitch/Monte Carlo and Pretre/Philharmonia recordings). There is plenty about singers, singing and the setting of words. 'Essentially I am a man of song in all its forms'. He preferred contemporary poets, Apollinaire and, above all, Paul Eluard - 'It is really Eluard who has brought out the best in me'. He liked to hear poets read aloud their own work and to recall, when it came to setting their words, the cadence of their voice. He had a gift for describing singers, Bernac of course but others too, amateur as well as professional, among them the beloved Denise Duval who did much to cheer Poulenc's later years. Throughout the letters one senses an unresolved question - Paris or the country? Though he often enjoyed his house in Touraine he insisted he was not a Tourangeau - his childhood was spent happily at Nogent on the Marne on the Eastern outskirts of Paris, where the bal musette music had an enduring influence on his style. Was he ever, except through his social life, in the fullest sense a Parisian? Of his religion he said 'I have the faith of a country priest'. There remained something countrified, even doggy, about him  -in his features, in his way of barking stories and sallies, in the tail-wagging, trotting allegros and the lyrical-sentimental effusions interrupted by gruff, canine explosions. Yet he loved New York and he seemed at home in England. He would have come to Aldeburgh more often to perform with Benjamin Britten if he hadn't disliked the sea air. In the programme of a Festival tribute after his death, Britten and Peter Pears wrote the following - 'One of his most adorable qualities was that he was incapable of being anything but himself - a delightful friend and a lovable musician.' 'Poupoule'. Francis Poulenc. 'Echo and Source'. Selected Correspondence 1915-1963. Translated and edited by Sidney Buckland. Gollancz Pounds 30, 448 pages.</p>

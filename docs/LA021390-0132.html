			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' 4-AA, 4-A DIVISION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> STRONG FIELD MEANS THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES  </P> <P> As far as the coaches in the Southern Section 4-AA playoffs are concerned,  nothing is assured. Not in this division, not this year.  </P> <P> "If we get two wins (in the playoffs), we'll consider it a great year,"  Glendora High School Coach Mike LeDuc said.  </P> <P> An admirable goal, except that Glendora is the fourth-seeded team in the  division. So confidence, even among the division's top teams, is not running  high.  </P> <P> There are 19 teams with winning records in the 4-AA. It's not a significant  number, but, in a year when many playoff divisions have been watered down, the  4-AA might be as tough as it gets.  </P> <P> "There are six teams that are really, really good and another 12 that can be  tough on a given night," Beverly Hills Coach Jasck Dyck said. "That's 18 teams  that could conceivably win the title. It should be a lot of fun."  </P> <P> For what it's worth, Dominguez is the top-seeded team in the division. The Dons  (20-5) are quick and utilize a pressure defense.  </P> <P> Offensively, Dominguez is led by guards Jeffrey Rogers and Michael Whittiker.  Rogers is averaging 15.2 points a game, Whittiker 12.3.  </P> <P> Dominguez, which won the 4-A championship last season, also is well prepared  for playoff pressure after playing a tough San Gabriel Valley League schedule.  The Dons finished league play tied for second with Cerritos, which qualified  for the 5-A playoffs. Both trailed Lynwood, the No. 1-seeded team in 5-AA.  </P> <P> Compton, the second-seeded team in 4-AA, also didn't win its league title.  Compton (18-6) finished second to Long Beach Poly in the Moore League. Long  Beach Poly is the second-seeded team in 5-AA.  </P> <P> Compton has four players who average in double figures -- Curtis Thomas (16.7),  Calvin Curry (12.5), James Williams (11.7) and Darnell Patterson (11.6).  </P> <P> "We're pretty good at sharing the basketball," Compton Coach Curtis Knight. "In  this division, it helps to be balanced. There are too many good teams."  </P> <P> And there are a few players who stand out from the crowd. Rick Robison averages  34.4 points a game and has scored 40 or more points in each of the last four  games. David Harbour of Camarillo averages 27.7 points, including a 50-point  performance. Jason Green of Bishop Amat averages 20 points a game despite being  doubled-teamed most of the season.  </P> <P> But the teams on which these players belong are not considered among the best  in the division.  </P> <P> "There are not a lot of glamour guys among the top teams," LeDuc said. "It  takes more than a super player to win a title."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo and Edison also are balanced teams that figure to do well in the  playoffs.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo (18-6), the third-seeded team in the division, has a strong  defense and finished in a tie for first place in the South Coast League with  Capistrano Valley. Offensively, the Diablos are led by Eric Cramer (15.5), but  they have four others who average between seven and 11 points a game.  </P> <P> Edison (17-8) also spreads the scoring around. Brandon Jessie and Bill  Martineau average in double figures. Steve Thobe, Dan Lovelady and Tom Tyler  each average seven points.  </P> <P> But it's not just balance that will make the Diablos and Chargers tough. Both  teams prefer a slower pace, which could disrupt a team preferring a run-and-gun  style of play.  </P> <P> "We certainly want to take advantage of those helter-skelter teams," Mission  Viejo Coach Bob Minier said. "Hopefully, we can make them play at our pace. If  we play our game, I think we can beat anybody."  </P> <P> There is no question who is the favorite in the 4-A playoffs. Artesia stands  head, shoulder and knee caps above the rest of the competition.  </P> <P> What makes the Pioneers such heavy favorites is 6-8 forward Ed O'Bannon,  considered one of the best high school players in the nation. O'Bannon, who  averages 24 points a game, is being recruited by nearly everyone with a  collegiate basketball program.  </P> <P> O'Bannon and Artesia routed Fullerton, 74-53, in a second-round game last  season.  </P> <P> Six Orange County teams are in the 4-A. Kennedy (16-6) is the strongest of the  county teams.  </P> <P> 4-AA PREVIEW  </P> <P> DEFENDING CHAMPION -- San Bernardino (now in 5-AA).  </P> <P> TOP TEAMS -- Dominguez (20-3) and Compton (18-6).  </P> <P> DARK HORSE -- Camarillo had seven players return from last season's team, which  reached the quarterfinals. Camarillo had injury problems early in the season,  but has won four of its last five games.  </P> <P> BEST DRAW -- Dominguez. The Dons will not face a team with a winning record  until at least the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> WORST DRAW -- Compton. In the first round, Compton plays Torrance. Torrance is  led by Rick Robison, who has scored 40 or more points in each of his last four  games. If Compton wins, it probably will face California, which was ranked in  the top 10 most of the season.  </P> <P> KEY PLAYERS -- Robison (Torrance), Jason Green (Bishop Amat), David Harbour  (Camarillo) and Brandon Jessie (Edison).  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY -- The top two-seeded teams in the division did not win their league  titles. Dominguez and Cerritos finished tied for second in the San Gabriel  Valley League behind Lynwood, the top-seeded 5-AA team. Compton finished second  in the Moore League behind Long Beach Poly, the second-seeded team in the 5-AA.  </P></p>

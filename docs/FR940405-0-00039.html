			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18. A comment stated that the handling, storage, and shipping of environmental samples as required by the Washington State Tri-Party Agreement and Environment Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines was not addressed by the rule in Criterion 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department disagrees. The rule establishes basic quality assurance requirements applicable to the many and diverse types of work performed by and for the Department. Criterion 5 (paragraph (c)(2)(i)) requires that ``Items be identified and controlled to ensure their proper use.'' The definition of ``item'' provided by the rule encompasses environmental samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. One comment also stated that the rule did not provide requirements for item identification and traceability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated in the previous paragraph, Criterion 5 requires that ``Items be identified and controlled to ensure their proper use.'' ``Traceability'' is one way to ensure that items are ``controlled'' as required by the rule. For that reason, the rule does not specifically address traceability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Additionally, a comment stated that Criterion 5 of the rule did not address ``special processes'' as does the NRC's 10 CFR part 50, appendix B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In developing the rule, the Department found that work, such as welding and non-destructive testing, have traditionally been referred to by the commercial nuclear industry as ``special processes'' because of the way their acceptability was determined (in-process). The rule, because it is not inspection-driven like 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, does not distinguish between different types of work based on whether or not it can be ``readily inspected.'' How the acceptability of a work process is determined does not make a work process ``special.'' Rather, the rule, in Criterion 5 (paragraph (c)(2)(i)) focuses on the line organization's performance of work. Inspection and acceptance testing of all types of work, both ``regular'' and ``special,'' is addressed by the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(iv), ``Inspection and Acceptance Testing.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Design (Criterion 6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21. A comment stated that Criterion 6 ``does not address the design of sampling and analysis procedures but appears to be limited to design of engineered structures.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirements of Section 830.120 are not limited to the design of engineered structures. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of the rule requires that ``work (which includes those suggested in the comment) be performed to established technical standards and administrative controls'' and that ``work shall be performed under controlled conditions using approved instructions, procedures, or other appropriate means.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. One comment stated that ``the failure of the rule to define or reference the EPA requirements for site investigation and remedial action activities will result in non-standard, site-specific applications.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the context of this section, the Department feels that the existing language in the section is sufficient so that it is unnecessary to define or reference EPA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Procurement (Criterion 7)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

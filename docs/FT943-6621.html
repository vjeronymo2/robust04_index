			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: Under the stars - FT expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world trip. Many of the 40 trails and 12 lifts at Las Lenas, Argentina's most modern and up-market ski area, are named after heavenly bodies: Mercurio, Urano, Jupiter, Venus and Neptuno. Even the hotels are named after star signs. Had we consulted the stars ourselves, we would have come earlier. We had chosen the worst possible time - a national holiday - and there was not so much as a sofa to be had anywhere in the resort. We made plans to spend the night in the discotheque, casino or even our borrowed vehicle. Finally we found a room at Los Molles, 20kms down the valley. What makes Las Lenas a formidable resort is the off-piste terrain accessed by just one lift: Marte (Mars). This long, steep, windswept chair reaches a high plateau at over 11,000ft from which scores of chutes and gullies fall away in all directions, some bringing you back to the base area, others taking you into the wilderness to such places as the Laguna Escondida (Hidden Lake). On the night before we were scheduled to travel the 800kms to Chapelco, our next resort, we were homeless again but managed to make a virtue of necessity: we enjoyed a leisurely dinner at the Piscis Hotel, skied one run after midnight, and then set off. This gave us the rest of the night plus the following day to reach our destination without needing to search for snow. After two good days in Chapelco we used our 'ski at midnight' ploy again and drove towards the Chilean border. It was another 500 kilometres to Temuco and General Lopez, where we were due to return our vehicle and ski the 'local' volcano at Llaima once more before driving through the night again to Santiago and the airport. Eight thousand miles away, another volcano - Ruapehu on New Zealand's North Island - was awaiting us.</p>

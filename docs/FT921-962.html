			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Chinese envoy has disappeared, says embassy CHINA'S embassy in London said yesterday that one of its diplomats had disappeared but insisted his flight was caused by an extra-marital affair and was not a defection, Reuter reports. The Home Office said a Chinese man had asked for political asylum but did not name him. An embassy official said a first secretary and his wife left the embassy suddenly on March 18 and were still in Britain. The man's departure 'had nothing whatsoever to do with politics,' the official said. 'Therefore political asylum is out of the question.' The official said the man's wife had asked several times that she and her husband be allowed to cut short their posting and return to China.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae by </F> CHOSON ILBO senior social affairs desk reporter Yi Sang-chol,  and reporters Ham Yong-chun and Kyong Yong-won -- place and date  not given]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] Did you not give a lecture-type  speech using a chalkboard during a news conference immediately  after your inauguration?    [Yi Pyong-tae] Yes, I did. Please interpret my actions as an  expression of my "passion." I just did it to describe my  intentions with precision and sincerity. There was no other  purpose. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] What merits do you think you have that won you  the  appointment as defense minister?    [Yi] I do not know exactly. What I can tell you is that even  after I was discharged from active duty, I continued to study  national defense issues with the will and passion for reform,  regarding it as my professional field. After I was placed on the  reserve list, I realized that the military was not the whole  world. While working as consul general in Honolulu and as  director of the Office of Veterans Administration, I learned  many things about world affairs. I think this was part of the  merits for my appointment.    [Reporter] By how many years was President Kim Yong-sam your  senior at Kyongnam High School, and when did you meet President  Kim Yong-sam?    [Yi] President Kim was a graduate of the third class and I  was a graduate of the 11th. So, I am eight years behind him. I  first met him when I was chief of operation of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff in 1992. When President Kim, then chairman of the  Democratic Liberal Party, was inspecting frontline areas, I  accompanied him because the deputy chief of the Joint Staff was  on leave. Since President Kim rode the bus together with  National Defense Committee assemblymen, I thought it was a good  opportunity to explain the defense budget. So I did it with a  portable speaker.    [Reporter] People say that after President Kim was elected,  you acted as his "staff" person for military affairs.    [Yi] No. I was not in the appropriate position to do so. I  was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean as consul general in  Hawaii while he was in Sangdodong, Seoul.    [Reporter] What do you think about the position of defense  minister?    [Yi] Just as a proverb says that the one who looks down the  chessboard has a wider view of the game than the actual players,  I came to face many practical restrictions and to realize  difficulties of working-level officials.    [Reporter] Now that the investigation of the incident of  shells imports fraud came to a temporary settlement and your  report to Chongwadae [presidential office] has been completed,  we think that you will now undertake your work at a full scale.    [Yi] The mission of defense minister is, above all, to  protect the nation and people from a "miserable" war. A total of  1 million troops from both sides are still in confrontation with  each other with a 155-mile Armistice Line in between them. The  fire power has now increased by 100 times from that of the  Korean War. If a war breaks out, everything that all the people  have achieved with all their energy during the past 40 years  will collapse. Therefore, our Army should assume a stance to  prevent war by all means. As you know, the people in the North  are unpredictable.    [Reporter] Some people say that since democratization was  initiated, North Korea is not regarded as "the main enemy" in  the troop training and information program in the military. Is  this true?    [Yi] This has indeed delicate aspects. To say that North  Korea is the main enemy may be somewhat excessive. However, the  military should direct its main efforts on "preventing North  Korea's provocation."    [Reporter] There are two different views: that North Korea  is  incapable of starting a war because of its economic difficulties  and that it can start a war at any moment. This causes confusion  among the people. What is your view?    [Yi] I think such controversy might have been prompted by  the eccentric political system in the North. North Korea's  gross national product is only one-tenth of ours. Therefore,  North Korea's military power should also be regarded as such.  However, the practical situation is quite the opposite. For  example, although I cannot reveal all, I can tell you that the  number of sorties made by North Korean air force planes and the  number and scale of military mobilizations and maneuvers during  the past three years far exceed ours. This situation has not  changed even today. We should think that this is possible only  under North Korea's eccentric system.    [Reporter] Do you think there is the possibility of a North  Korean military provocation?    [Yi] Yes. There certainly is. I wish I could show you  related materials including aerial photographs to prove this.    [Reporter] Have there been any indications of a military  provocation from North Korea recently?    [Yi] There has always been such a possibility in the past.  However, since Kim Chong-il was nominated as supreme commander  of the military last March, there has been even a greater  possibility. Last October, the "order of tonsure" was handed out  to the entire Army, and all soldiers had their hair cut. Tonsure  means a certain "determination."    [Reporter] What is your opinion of the North Korean nuclear  issue and the Team Spirit exercise?    [Yi] North Korea must completely return to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and accept overall inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency. We will be ready to suspend  the Team Spirit exercise, although it has nothing to do with the  North Korean nuclear issue, so that the North-South dialogue can  make progress. However, I would like to clearly say that if  North Korea does not comply with them, we would have nothing to  concede. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Will there be any large-scale personnel reshuffle  within the military?    [Yi] No. There will be no such reshuffle. Only when  stability is attained within their organization, can the  soldiers be devoted to defense. Otherwise, they will turn their  eyes, leveled at the North, to Seoul.    [Reporter] We understand that you are member of Hanahoe  [private circle of military academy graduates]. When did you  become a member?    [Yi] That is an old story. Let us not talk about this.    I always did my best in any given situation during the past  33 years of military service. I will do so in the future, too.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] There is a rumor that you, Minister Yi, advised  all high-ranking officers in the military who are Hanahoe  members to voluntarily resign from active duty.    [Yi] The will for decision within the military should not be  hovered. If one thinks it is difficult to contribute to the  military any more, one should courageously resign from it.    [Reporter] Some people stress that young and capable  officers, who became Hanahoe members without having volunteered  to join the organization, should not be placed in a position of  disadvantage.    [Yi] That is very sensitive issue. I intend to work out  appropriate measures. [passage omitted]</p>

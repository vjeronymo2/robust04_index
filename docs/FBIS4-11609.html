This was announced yesterday when the  company announced its 1993 balance which showed a $1.143 billion  net profit. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 21  Apr 93 p B7)    Yesterday, the government reduced the import duty on 17  products to 2 percent. Economic Policy Secretary Winston  Fritsch said the objective is to warn national industry from  committing price abuses. The products are soluble coffee; soft  drinks; beer; cheese and milk byproducts; sugar; tire tubes for  cars and trucks; tires for cars, trucks, and tractors; car  generators and dynamos; disc plows; lampblack; ceramic bathroom  parts; shaving machines; shaving cream; razor blades; oil;  olives; and seeds and plants.

At the end of January, cash  reserves stood at $29.1 billion. Liquid reserves, which include  medium and long-term credits, delayed credits, and provisions  for the return of capital, stood at $36.5 billion at the end of  February, while at the end of January they stood at $35.4  billion. The Central Bank bulletin states that the slower  reserve growth compared to January, when reserves grew by $3.2  billion, was caused by a drop in the exchange operations surplus  registered in February.

This  is equivalent to 12 percent of the 8,567 foreign capital  enterprises registered in Brazil.

He estimated  that so far the country has obtained short-term credits worth  $16 billion, especially for financing exports. The flow of  short-term credits increased after Brazil began to negotiate its  foreign debt. In connection with Brazil's debt to private banks,  on the day the debt negotiation was concluded, the country  received $352 million. Of this, Citibank provided $220 million.

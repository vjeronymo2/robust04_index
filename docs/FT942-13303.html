			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Coal bidders warn on liabilities The government will have to underwrite British Coal's past liabilities if it hopes to achieve a successful sale of its assets, say lawyers representing a group of potential bidders. In a letter to Rothschilds, which is advising the government on the sale, the bidders say that they would be unable to obtain insurance against environmental problems such as water leakage or claims by employees for past injuries and industrial diseases. The lawyers describe the liabilities as a potential 'black hole'. They say: 'We believe the risks may not be quantifiable, and we are concerned as to whether insurance companies will have access to adequate data on which to formulate a reasonable proposal for covering these liabilities.' The companies in the group include Coal Investments, headed by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former commercial director of British Coal, RJ Budge, Northern Strip Mines and other opencast operators. The lawyers say that unless a government entity underwrites the liabilities, British Coal would attract only a poor price. But the letter also suggests that there might not be any sale at all unless purchasers were protected against liability claims. A further issue raised by the letter is that Stock Exchange requirements for due-diligence assessment of liabilities would be so costly that they could deter listed companies from making bids. The letter to Rothschilds follows earlier unsuccessful attempts by the group to persuade the Department of Trade and Industry to tighten the liability provisions of the Coal Industry Bill, which is being debated in the Lords. Under present arrangements, purchasers are expected to assume many of the liabilities of any British Coal assets they purchase. In the past, British Coal has insured itself. The government is inviting would-be buyers to go through a pre-qualification process which will entitle them to examine detailed information about the assets being sold. British Coal's operations are being divided into five regions, and bidders can apply for any number. Dewe Rogerson has been appointed by the Treasury as public relations adviser on the sale of the government's remaining 40 per cent stake in National Power and PowerGen, the large electricity generators. The sale is expected early next year.</p>

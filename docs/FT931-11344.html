			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Management: Another battle of the sexes - Do women or men make better bosses? New research into management styles Women will always look for consensus, while men try to divide and rule. A woman will say: 'These are the ways we can solve the problem - how many people can we get to agree with it?' A man says: 'This is the way we are going to do it, and if you don't like it, you can resign'. That, at least, is one senior personnel manager's view of how male and female management styles contrast sharply in the workplace, from an interview in a report to be published next week*. The study, conducted by headhunters Spencer Stuart, asks why so few women occupy top management positions, examining en route perceptions of leadership qualities. It concludes that the stereotype of male and female ways of managing - typified by the personnel manager quoted - flatters because it ascribes to women an exceptional degree of generosity and humility. This is damaging because it conceals differences among women and forms what is called The New Mythology. Old, politically incorrect assumptions are replaced with others just as inaccurate and unreliable, argues Spencer Stuart. It is common now to hear companies being urged to take on what are typified as superior 'female' management skills. The New Mythology sees the female management style as the most appropriate and effective in the modern corporation - less hierarchical than the male, more intuitive and open to change, more participative and, above all, more likely to encourage employees at every level to flourish. Where exactly do these new stereotypes come from, given that almost anybody who has experienced a range of female managers at work will easily be able to picture at least one who will pull rank and bark orders along with the worst of her male colleagues? Beverly Alimo-Metcalfe, senior lecturer in organisational psychology at the University of Leeds, is one strong advocate of what are seen as essentially female management skills. She acknowledges the dangers of making new stereotypes but believes that 'the most successful styles of leadership are more closely associated with women than men'. She points to research by Judy Rosener, carried out at the University of California and published in the Harvard Business Review. This suggested women were more likely to employ what is called in the jargon a 'transformational' style of leadership; the men were more likely to be 'transactional' leaders. The difference between the two styles, as reported by Rosener, is supposedly this: 'transactional' leaders see job performance as a series of transactions with subordinates; they exchange rewards for services rendered or punishment for inadequate performance. 'Transformational' leaders get subordinates to transform their own self-interest into the interest of the group. They are more likely to use charisma, interpersonal skills and personal contacts to get what they want; transactionals are more likely to use their status in the organisation. Alimo-Metcalfe also points to US case studies of organisations that had been in trouble but were then revitalised, where a common ingredient was the presence of a transformational leader. Her worry is that companies are failing to recruit and promote transformational leaders. Assessment centres run tests with a built-in bias in favour of the transactional style and therefore discriminate against women, she says. One flaw in Rosener's research, according to Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, New York City University professor, is that men and women were not observed at work, but were asked, instead, to describe their own management styles. Fuchs Epstein quotes the example from her own research on women attorneys of the 'lawyer who described her style as 'caring' but who was characterised as a barracuda by a male associate'. George Bain, principal of the London Business School, has himself been a participant in a controlled experiment aimed at identifying differences between male and female management styles. Commissioned by the now-defunct Business magazine, the battery of tests conducted on a (self-selected) group of male and female managers led to the conclusion that 'men and women executives have more talents in common than most people imagine,' but also threw up significant differences: women paid more attention to detail and men were more competitive; perhaps more surprisingly, given The New Mythology, women were found to be less democratic. But Bain is sceptical. 'I don't think there are systematic differences between men and women managers. There are greater differences between the way one man manages and another man manages than there are between men and women as groups,' he says. Even overwhelming empirical evidence would leave him suspicious. 'I would want to know if any differences in the way women manage were as a result of innate qualities or had developed because of the roles reserved for them,' says Bain. *Women in Management, available free from Spencer Stuart, 16 Connaught Place, London W2 2ED</p>

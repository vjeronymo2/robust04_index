			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Danger of making excessive claims about value of brands Sir, The method described in the article on the brand valuation of Intel (Technology, September 2) is fundamentally flawed. The returns a business earns above its cost of capital are not earned by brands alone but by the whole set of current intellectual assets of a business: brands, skills, technologies, channels of distribution and supply, publication rights, systems and other information. In Intel's case there is an investment in technology that dwarfs the advertising and tangible asset investments. Excessive claims about brand valuation are damaging, because they risk misleading investors and because they distract attention away from the real issue of understanding the investment that companies have made in their entire set of intellectual assets and the returns achieved by them. A sounder approach is described in the current issue of Professional Investor. UK investors and managers urgently need to understand these issues if we are to be competitive in the information economy of the 21st century.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Koltsov report in the "Military Industrial Complex" </F> column: "The Defense Industry Is Suffocating Without Money.  This Undermines the Country's Security"]    [Text] On 28 April a session of the Russian Federation  Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission on Defense  Security was held, presided over by First Deputy Defense  Minister Andrey Kokoshin. The commission includes Valeriy  Mikhaylov, first deputy economy minister; Andrey Vavilov, first  deputy finance minister; Yuriy Koptev, general director of the  Russian Space Agency; Aleksandr Starovoytov, general director of  the Federal Government Communication and Information Agency;  deputy heads of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Nuclear  Industry Ministry, the State Defense Industry Committee, the  Russian State Machine Building Industry Committee, the Internal  Affair Ministry, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, the Science Ministry, the Foreign  Economic Relations Ministry, the Ministry for Civil Defense,  Emergency Situations, and Liquidation of the Effects of Natural  Disasters, and senior officials from the Defense Ministry and  the General Staff.    The provision of modern armaments to the armed forces and  the  situation of enterprises carrying out state defense production  orders were analyzed in detail.    Colonel General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces Armaments Department, said that on all  the main weapon types the Defense Ministry has reduced the  variety [tipazh] of equipment ordered by two to three times,  seeking to standardize artillery systems, armored personnel  carriers, tanks, transport and combat helicopters, and so forth.  In spite of the extremely difficult financial situation, the  Defense Ministry is so far managing to ensure progress in  developing a number of major, leading-edge arms and defense  technologies.    The participants in the session stated that owing to the  chronic underfinancing of the Armed Forces needs, including in  filling defense orders, arms production, and defense research  and development projects, the worst difficult situation has  occurred in the past two years.    The Interdepartmental Commission on Defense Security  stressed  that with such financing the long-term arms program and the plan  for the organizational development of the Armed Forces just hang  in the air. Commission members noted that a number of major  presidential and government decisions are not being fulfilled.  At the same time the commission pointed to the inadequacy of  the legislative and normative basis in the defense sphere and  proposed a number of concrete measures in this field.    The situation with funding the restructuring and  diversification of defense enterprises is also very acute. With  a sharp reduction in the arms procurement fund, the requisite  funds for essential civil science-intense production and  infrastructure development orders are not forthcoming.    "The development of infrastructures in all countries is  primarily the concern of the state," Andrey Kokoshin stressed.  "This is necessary both to the economy as a whole and to ensure  the country's defense capability. The creation of modern  transport, TV and communication facilities linking primarily the  European and Asian parts of Russia must be among the top  priorities in Russia's national security policy. At present an  alarming situation is developing in this area."    Responding to questions from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA about the  situation in the country's military industrial complex, Andrey  Kokoshin noted the following.    The domestic economy has an acute need for "industrial  growth  areas" with an active role of the state and private capital.  Such areas can be created primarily by increasing state orders  to diversifying enterprises in the defense complex.    In Kokoshin's view, it is necessary not to reduce but in  fact  increase the production of civil aircraft equipped with new,  more economical engines, as well as transport automation means,  communication and TV satellites, railway rolling stock, and  cargo and passenger vessels, using advanced space and aviation  technology, and so forth. With the requisite funds allocated  for this, for a certain period the budget deficit will increase  but then, if things are properly organized, the tax base will  grow, which will help overcome stagflation.    This should be accompanied by a more flexible and  differentiated state policy in transportation tariffs because  otherwise links between East and West will weaken. It is  necessary to apply aerospace technology to creating new motor  and railway facilities, the food industry, and many other  spheres.    With an active and purposeful state policy, private Russian  capital, which is so far taking a wait-and-see attitude, will  actively flow into these spheres.    The Interdepartmental Commission on Defense Security has  prepared specific assessments and proposals for the Russian  Federation Security Council and Government to improve the  financing of defense needs and ensure priority research and  development projects, in accordance with the 19 January 1994  decision of the Russian Federation Security Council.</p>

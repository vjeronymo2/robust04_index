			<p>BFN     [Text] Major automobile parts maker Zexel will increase  annual imports of foreign-made parts to 16 billion yen by 1996,  which is over 10 times that in 1993. This figure is equivalent  to 10 percent of the total expenses for materials. Zexel  decided to change its procurement policy of giving priority to  domestically made products because quality of foreign-made  products has improved, in addition to their low prices resulting  from yen's appreciation.    Zexel, which is a primary parts maker, mainly manufactures  parts of car air conditioners and fuel injection devices, and  sells these products directly to Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. and Isuzu  Motors Ltd. So far, it has partially imported compressor parts  of air conditioners from its U.S. office. The import volume was  only 1.3 billion yen in 1993, which was less than 1 percent of  expenses for material procurement.    Zexel is now studying the quality and costs of resin  products, castings, and forgings made by U.S. and Asian makers  to check whether or not these products are usable. In the case  of the resin products, they have a quality level similar to that  of Japanese products, while their prices are 5 to 10 percent  cheaper. Zexel is likely to start importation in the near  future.    On the other hand, Zexel plans to reduce the number of  secondary and tertiary parts makers with which it does business.  Although Zexel has a cooperative organization of subcontracting  parts makers called "Shineikai," it will conduct stricter  screening to decide whether to continue doing business with  those companies.</p>

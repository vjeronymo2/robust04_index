North  Korea could use the U.S. congressman's visit as an opportunity  to renew its demand that U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea,  according to the analysts. Because Dellums' visit has been  delayed, some within the government have expressed doubt that  the trip would take place at all, they said.    It was North Korea, however, that invited Dellums to visit,  and preparations for party secretary Kim Chong-il's birthday  celebration must have caused Pyongyang's lateness in advising  the congressmen when to come, they stressed.    Noting that Washington and Pyongyang had met recently in New  York and elsewhere with the deadline in the International Atomic  Energy Agency's (IAEA) standoff with North Korea just a week  away, they said the North Koreans and Dellums would make a final  decision on the latter's visit if the contacts produced a  favorable result. Therefore, they did not rule out the  possibility that Rep. Dellums would cancel his visit if the  Washington-Pyongyang contacts proceeded unfavorably. But they  predicted he would make the visit, though somewhat later than  scheduled, in view of Washington and Pyongyang's present  relations.    One of the congressional security analysts said the Seoul  Government should watch a visit by Dellums closely because he is  a congressional dove in dealing with North Korea.    In Pyongyang, he said, House Armed Services Committee  chairman Dellums would meet President Kim Il-song, Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam and People's Armed Forces Minister O  Chin-u, with Seoul needing to take special note of these  meetings. It is highly likely that if these meetings are held,  both sides will raise the issue of arms reduction on the Korean  peninsula, including the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea  that North Korea has so determinedly pursued on the strength of  its nuclear arms development program. In that case, the focus  of Washington-Pyongyang contacts would shift from Pyongyang's  nuclear program to more fundamental issues related to the future  of the Korean peninsula. This scenario would require a smooth  solution to the nuclear issue and improved U.S.-North Korea  relations as prerequisites.    If Seoul felt alienated by an improved U.S.-North Korean  relationship, problems would emerge in its ties with Washington,  the congressional analyst said, voicing doubt that Seoul could  cope effectively with such a change.    A recent U.S. General Accounting Office report on the North  Korean nuclear problem says that if South Korean military  leaders have doubts about President Kim Yong-sam's policy on  this issue, South Korea could be plunged into political unrest.    South Korea is concerned that it could be alienated by  American diplomacy toward North Korea on the nuclear issue,  dealing a blow to its North Korea policy, according to the  report.    A visit by Dellums should be viewed as important not only to  the nuclear issue, but also to the far-reaching issue of  security on the Korean peninsula, the congressional analysts  said.</p>

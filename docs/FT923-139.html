			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party At Blackpool: Activists protest over policy plans - Delegates denounce joint policy committee CONSTITUENCY activists embarrassed the party leadership yesterday with a fierce, but ultimately unsuccessful, protest over plans for streamlining the party's policy-making process. Proposals backed by Mr John Smith for reducing the size of the new National Policy Forum and imposing a Joint Policy Committee, chaired by himself, to oversee the forum's work, were denounced as centralist and an assault on the role of conference. Left-wing delegates also tried to commit Labour firmly to clause four of the party's constitution on state ownership but were defeated on a card vote by 4.3m votes to 1m. During an uncomfortable debate for Mr Smith, a succession of delegates called for a rethink of his proposals. But a motion rejecting the plans and reasserting the right of constituency parties and trade unions to make policy submissions directly to conference was defeated on a show of hands. The Joint Policy Committee will be made up of shadow cabinet and National Executive Committee members. Membership of the National Policy Forum, which would embark on a rolling policy review programme, would be limited to save money to a total of 100 from trade unions, constituencies, MPs and MEPs. The forum was agreed by conference two years ago. Leading the revolt, Mr Francis Prideaux, of the Westminster North Labour party, said that the new framework would 'increase the overcentralised power of the PR consultants inside the leader's office'. Ms Glenda Weston of Kettering Labour party complained that constituencies would be under-represented on the forum and that the role of conference would be 'to rubber-stamp proposals from the NEC and shadow cabinet'. Mr Issan Ghazni, of the South Nottingham Labour party, said the proposals were 'designed specifically to put a stranglehold on grassroots policy development' and transfer power to the 'Labour establishment'. They would increase bureaucracy and reduce party membership. Ms Clare Short, a member of the NEC, said constituency parties would in fact be brought in earlier into policy making with the ability to contribute to draft policy documents. She described the plans as the 'final part of the modernisation of our party' - the rejuvenation of local parties. In the same debate, supporters of the motion on clause four sought to carve a stronger identity for Labour as a socialist movement. Mr Michael Mclurg, from Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, said the leadership was 'riding roughshod over the deeply held convictions and feelings of ordinary members'. He said: 'On far too many policies, this party is only a shade different from the Conservative party.' Mr Mike Green, from Northavon, said the redistribution of wealth was essential to pay for improvements in society. 'Let us tell it straight. Those who have got lots of money are going to have to pay.' Ms Teresa Pearce of Erith and Crayford Labour party, said Labour's failure to convey a strong image contributed to its election defeats. 'The Tories were out there making political speeches and we were messing about with balloons.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2): The available data do not indicate any economic or biological problems in the fishery. The amendment indicates that the average sizes of most species of fish landed have held relatively steady since 1987, and the average size of swordfish has increased since 1987. Aside from this commenter, no other participants in the fishery have indicated that their catches or profits have declined, except for fishermen who were effectively precluded from fishing traditional grounds by the area closures imposed around the main Hawaiian Islands. There is no indication that catch rates have decreased due to excessive fishing pressure. The Council and NMFS acknowledge that the expanded longline fishery has been operating for only a few years and that many interested parties have expressed concern about possible long-term impacts on the stocks or other fisheries and protected species. Therefore, the Council has proposed an approach to allow a limited increase in the fishery with greater flexibility for fishermen to make business decisions. Controlled expansion of the fishery will provide a basis for determining whether the expanded fishery is affecting fish stocks or fishery participants and whether corrective action is needed. If information later indicates problems, the amendment includes framework procedures to address those problems. Allowing upgrading of smaller vessels is intended to provide a fair competitive opportunity within the longline fishery for owners of small vessels that were effectively precluded from fishing when the longline area closures went into effect. It is not expected that all participants will acquire larger vessels to the maximum size permitted, though some shift to larger vessels is expected. Finally, disapproval of the amendment would result in no limit on participation. No change was made to the rule in response to these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3): One environmental conservation organization commented in opposition to the amendment. This organization indicated the moratorium on new entry should be continued until data are available from the longline observer program and other sources to assess impacts on sea turtles and the status of fish stocks harvested by the longline fishery. This organization felt that the allowable incidental take of sea turtles is excessive and was concerned that the amendment would result in additional effort and thus a risk of higher turtle takes and jeopardy to turtle stocks. The commenter also was critical of the low level of coverage achieved in the voluntary program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3): The moratorium terminated at 12 midnight on April 22, 1994. If the amendment had been disapproved, there would no longer have been any limitation on the number or size of longline vessels in the fishery. The moratorium may not be continued unless the Secretary rejects the amendment and issues regulations under the Secretary's amendment authority. In the Secretary's view, the framework procedures of Amendment 7 allow relatively quick action to adjust management measures if needed to protect sea turtles or fish stocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A mandatory observer program was established by an interim final rule published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67699). By April 10, 1994, 14 completed trips had been observed. This represents a significant increase in observer coverage over the voluntary program. Consultations under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) have been reinitiated and will consider data from the voluntary and mandatory observer programs, and information on the status and trends of turtle populations, to determine whether new conservation recommendations or reasonable and prudent measures should be applied in this fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the impacts of the fishery on fish stocks, the available data indicate that no stocks have been affected by the longline fishery to date. No changes have been made in the regulations in response to these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4): Two other commenters recommended partial disapproval of the amendment. Both favored limited entry for the longline fishery, but also favored limiting harvesting capacity of the fleet by only allowing vessel upgrades for safety, and not providing permits to those who did not fish in the moratorium. One emphasized the incomplete and dated nature of much of the data used and criticized the management system and fishery for the waste of sharks, noting that only a very small portion of the shark catch is retained; this commenter also suggested a quota system could be developed. The other commenter proposed that, if vessel upgrades are allowed, gear upgrades should be limited. A harvesting capacity quota approach should be developed in a three-tier (small, medium, and large) vessel system. This commenter feared that longliners could decimate stocks and then move to new areas, leaving local fishermen to pay the price. Both commenters also suggested that some Council members who worked on the amendment had financial conflicts of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4): Many elements of the amendment already comport with the commenters' recommendations; for example, the maximum number of permits may be no more than the number in the moratorium, and permits will not be issued to persons who did not fish (excluding small vessels and persons who obtained longline permits due to linkage with lobster permits) during the moratorium. However, the Council chose to allow more flexibility for vessel upgrades to equalize the opportunity for all vessel owners to compete in the fishery. The best scientific information available has been used. The Council and NMFS acknowledged the limitations of the data. The amendment includes framework procedures so management adjustments can be made rapidly if the data indicate a need for changes. The Council chose not to recommend a quota system, given the inadequacy of data to determine allowable catch and allocations to different fishermen. The Council considered gear limitations but recognized the serious difficulty in enforcing such limitations due to limited at-sea enforcement resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues of discards and bycatch have been raised to the Council, and the Council will review the data collected under the mandatory observer program to determine how to address these issues in the future. The Council considered establishment of a harvesting capacity management system and concluded that a fair and effective system would require much additional data collection and analysis. The Council agreed to continue work on alternate means to control effort and capacity for implementation through the framework procedures in the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding conflict of interest, the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) permits Council members with financial interests in harvesting, marketing, or processing activities to vote on matters that affect those interests, if disclosed publicly in accordance with regulations governing Regional Fishery Management Councils at 50 CFR part 601. No changes were made in the regulations in response to these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

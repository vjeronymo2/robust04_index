			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA)--BABIL has accused the Saudi  and Kuwaiti rulers and the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa of involvement  in a multi-chapter conspiracy that is directed against the unity  of sisterly Yemen.    In an article by Nuri al-Marsumi published today, the  newspaper says that this conspiracy is being carried out within  the systematic conspiracies and aggressions against the Arab  world, starting with the aggression against Iraq -- the  aggression by the United States, NATO, and the agent regimes.    The newspaper adds that after Iraq, Yemen is the most  important of the countries that reject aggression and  dependence. Yemen's success in overcoming economic problems and  entrenching unity will certainly constitute a shining light that  frightens the Saudi rulers and their masters.    The paper says that these rulers had been much provoked and  the moment the unity [agreement] was signed, long before 2  August 1990, mobilized their forces against Iraq, Yemen, and  Jordan.    The newspaper emphasized that the declaration of secession  is  a crime whose destructive results are no less than the first  secessionist crime in the Arab history in 1961 [between Syria  and Egypt].    Concluding its article, the newspaper said: The socialists  have gone too far in coordinating with the suspect rulers in  Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. They forgot principles and history.  Before that, they forgot that they are no more than tools to  destroy their homeland and future.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Technology: Computers take centre stage - London's South Bank arts complex has high hopes for its latest information system As a new season opens at London's South Bank Arts Centre, the usual bustle of activity behind the scenes is extending beyond the rehearsal rooms and into the computer department. Its task is to provide easy access to all kinds of information, from an artist's taste in mineral water (still or fizzy) to the current balance of the centre's Pounds 20m budget. The centre, which is Britain's largest arts complex, comprising the Royal Festival Hall, two smaller halls and an art gallery, is no newcomer to information technology. Now, however, it is making an important transition from 'systems management' to 'information management'. This means that instead of simply managing an IT department it is now exploiting a valuable resource. As Arts Council grants fail to keep step with rising costs, the centre needs tighter controls if it is to maintain its artistic budgets. In order to streamline the planning of events, it is moving towards full implementation of its US-developed Concentrics electronic diary software to cover everything from space allocation to the timely supply of fireworks for a performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. At present, the electronic diary is used for scheduling events. On the other hand, it plans to improve customer service and identify marketing opportunities, while reducing its advertising budget. This involves the introduction of systems specially tailored for its use. Thus the key to the centre's commercial development is the Box Office Computer System (BOCS) supplied by Space-Time Systems of the UK. Some 20 per cent of visitors buy 80 per cent of the tickets sold every year (more than 1m), but the centre has not been able to identify its patrons. Thus its direct mailing efforts constitute an ineffective, scattergun approach to marketing. By making individual contact with potential ticket purchasers, the centre hopes to slash its spending on press advertising. It will then use press ads only to attract new audiences. The centre's marketing database, the BOCS Marketing System, and applications - run on Digital Equipment Vax computers  -are linked to the box office. Details of individual customers, such as their name and address and the performance for which tickets are sold, are recorded at the box office and then moved to the marketing system. This continuously updates customer records, noting interests, frequency of visits, take-up of special offers and so on. This information is used by the marketing staff to prepare direct mailing lists and develop promotional programmes to meet existing customers' interests and generate new business. BOCS is also linked to the centre's accounting system. This, too, is being overhauled to provide tighter management control. A registered charity with an annual budget of Pounds 20m, the South Bank must end the year showing neither a profit nor a loss - a feat Alan Wilks, deputy finance director, likens to parachuting out of an aircraft and landing on a pinhead. In past years, failure to arrive at zero has meant a cut in funding. An accounting system installed last month and due to be up and running in the next financial year is designed to solve the problem. 'Our existing software was slow and inflexible, so people didn't use it,' says Wilks. 'It also ran on different hardware from BOCS, making communication difficult.' After an extensive software evaluation, the centre selected CFACS from Cedardata of the UK on the grounds of cost and functionality. Among key requirements were the ability to answer inquiries, to monitor the impact of new accounting entries, to set up authorisation levels for order and invoice approvals, and to help with forward planning. Ease of use was also a requirement as the centre plans to open access to the accounting system to non-financial departments, giving them responsibility for their own budgeting and report writing. The Cedardata software, which will run alongside BOCS, was designed specifically for the centre, and keeps track of departmental budgets. Artist bookings, for example, can be accounted for when they are made rather than after a production when an invoice is received. Budget planning will be improved by capturing information on bookings as far ahead as three years. Ultimately, the accounting and BOCS systems and Concentrics will be integrated, providing estimates of income from accurate forecasts of ticket sales. The need to improve management and cost control is also driving development of the Concentrics electronic diary and scheduling system, which streamlines the production process from the moment an event is booked until the curtain comes down and the bills are paid. Initially, the system is used to allocate space, check against clashing events in the centre's concert halls and generate an event profile which holds all directly related information, such as set-up time, rehearsals and receptions. As a production unfolds, comments can be added to the event profile and technical requirements detailed from which the system generates worksheets for both backstage and front-of-house staff. Users also enter equipment and staff needs. These are automatically charged to accounts, while shortages trigger the system to jolt memories in supply departments. The system reduces duplication of effort by storing information pertinent to particular productions. Dorcas Johnson, computer projects manager, says: 'In the past, all the information collected for an event was lost. Two years later, we would put on a similar event and make the same mistakes. Now the experience gained can be reapplied.' As grants go down and costs go up, successful information management will be essential to curb overheads and maintain artistic budgets. Computers will increasingly control the environment in which inspiration can flourish.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Claire Trean report on interview with FRY Foreign Minister </F> Vladislav Jovanovic in Paris; date not given: "Vladislav  Jovanovic Considers Embargo on Serbia To Be `Major Obstacle to  Peace'"]    [Text] A Franco-Serbian dialogue was officially restarted  at the end of last week with the visit to Paris of Vladislav  Jovanovic, the foreign minister of the "new Yugoslavia" (Serbia  and Montenegro). At the end of the talks, in particular with  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and the President's General  Secretary Hubert Vedrine, Mr. Jovanovic noted that by virtue of  a "tacit agreement" they had not mentioned the events of recent  weeks (the role played by France in the ultimatum imposed by the  West on the Bosnian Serbs) and he expressed his satisfaction  with the fact that France wanted to reestablish political  contact with "the Yugoslav side."    In fact, since the United States decided to intervene in the  search for a solution to the Bosnian conflict, starting with the  agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, the French foreign  minister has constantly repeated that peace would not come  through a bilateral agreement in a three-sided contest and that  the Serbs had to be brought into the negotiations.    France recalled the plan it had initiated and which the  European Union [EU] had proposed in November which, in  particular, suggested a progressive and conditional lifting of  the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations in exchange  for concessions from Serbia. It is on this aspect that Mr.  Jovanovic is now insisting, stressing his disappointment that  the EU had not "kept those promises" and expressing his hope  that it would "again take the initiative" on this point. The  trade embargo imposed on Serbia "is an anachronism," he said,  and "a major obstacle to peace and its lifting is a condition  for arriving at a solution."  <H5>  Military Logic </H5>   However, the Yugoslav foreign minister did not make this a  precondition to the Serbs taking part in negotiations on Bosnia  to which they are being convened by the Americans. He said: "The  sanctions must be lifted completely in parallel with the  implementation of a peace plan. If we conclude a peace plan, we  must automatically start to remove the sanctions and they must  have been lifted completely by the time the Serbian side has met  the commitments it signed up to in the peace plan." He added:  "If we do this, the Muslims will be stripped of any remaining  hopes they have of winning the war and obtaining a unitarian  Bosnia thanks to sanctions."    Mr. Jovanovic did not want to "speak on behalf of the  Bosnian  Serbs" on the Bosnian issue, and said that Belgrade cannot force  them to accept something they do not want. When his opinion was  asked as to whether some of their leaders, such as General  Mladic who commands the Bosnian Serbs, are not opposing any  negotiated settlement, he replied that Mladic "is a military man  following a military logic," and that, as a result, his comments  cannot be considered to be "official" on political issues. He  added: "What counts is Radovan Karadzic and his closest  advisers."    Mr. Jovanovic does not therefore speak for them. He noted  that the Bosnian Serbs had refused to enter the Muslim-Croat  federation signed last week in Washington, but, in his opinion,  they remain "open" to any initiative geared toward finding a  solution. He added: "The problem is that the Americans are  inviting them to join the process without telling them what is  being proposed. What they need is more details on the proposal  that is being made to them."    Mr. Jovanovic would only (cautiously) discuss one of the  points up for negotiation: the distribution of territory  between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs. He  reiterated that the Serbs had previously accepted to "offer"  33.3 percent of Bosnia to the Muslims (and 17.5 percent to the  Croats) and considered that "it is not impossible" for them to  again accept such a partitioning after fresh negotiations.  Without any doubt, Mr. Jovanovic will have met with the support  on this point of Alain Juppe, who had declared himself in favor  of this distribution of territory when the Muslim-Croat  negotiations started, which in his opinion not go ahead at the  expense of the third party.   <H5>    Krajina </H5>   Where the fate of Krajina is concerned (the region of  Croatia  controlled by the breakaway Serbs and for which Zagreb wants to  reestablish its sovereignty), Mr. Jovanovic was again careful  not to reveal Belgrade's strategy: "We do not take sides. The  negotiations must take place between Zagreb and Knin (the  Serbian stronghold in Krajina)." He moreover stated that the  economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Serbia "were  not related to the Bosnian crisis," although he added that, when  asked by the EU, Belgrade had agreed to "make an effort" on the  other crises in the former Yugoslavia with a view to the  progressive lifting of sanctions.    Belgrade, he said, is ready to "aid in a process of  normalization," in particular focusing on restoring  communications, on condition that the Croats "do not immediately  complicate" the issue by straightaway raising the political  issue of the status of Krajina.  <H5>  Hesitation by France </H5>   However, it is this problem that the breakaway Krajina Serbs  are raising themselves when they oppose, for example, the  reopening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway, provided for in an  agreement between the two capitals, claiming they will set up  border posts on the section that runs through their region. Mr.  Jovanovic stressed that Croatia was only recognized by the  United Nations after the decision had been made to send UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Force] troops into Krajina (the Vance plan),  "that is, when Croatia had not established its sovereignty over  the region."    Zagreb obviously disputes this version, basing its argument  on other UN resolutions that assume that Croatia will retain the  same borders it had in the old Yugoslav federation. France  appears hesitant about expressing a clear opinion on this issue,  which is again becoming essential to finding a solution. As for  the United States, its position has been laid down if we are to  believe the declarations made on Sunday to representatives of  the Krajina Serbs by the U.S. ambassador to Zagreb: "I told  them very clearly that the United States and Russia and the  whole of the international community consider that the zones  under UN protection are part of Croatia and that there is no  possibility of a political solution which would make Krajina  independent or a part of Serbia."</p>

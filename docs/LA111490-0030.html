			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASH CAME FROM SELLING OLD CARS, DEPUTY  TESTIFIES  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors sparred with defense witnesses Tuesday in the  money-skimming trial of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, accusing  one officer of failing to account for tens of thousands of dollars in cash that  he spent on cars, helicopter lessons and other expenses.  </P> <P> Denying that he had received any stolen cash, Deputy James R. Bauder testified  that he and his wife had managed to save more than $45,000 -- largely from  refurbishing and selling cars, baby-sitting and collecting loose change around  their house -- and kept the money at home.  </P> <P> But prosecutors challenged Bauder's story and said the deputy failed to explain  another $35,000 in cash that prosecutors contend is linked to stolen drug  money. Bauder and six other sheriff's narcotics officers are on trial in U.S.  District Court in Los Angeles on charges that they skimmed $1.4 million from  drug dealers and spent the money on cars, boats and other luxuries.  </P></p>

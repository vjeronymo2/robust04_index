			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Annuity rates falling Annuity rates are on their way down - and this time it is official. Several life offices suggested last year that tax changes would make immediate (non-pension) annuities significantly worse value after the end of December. However, rates did not decline by much. But from March 1, the capital content of the annuity - on which no tax is paid - will be calculated using mortality rates taken from 1979 to 1982. At present they are based on death rates between 1946 and 1948. This will reduce the net income of a 75-year-old man by 4.1 per cent, and of a 75-year-old woman by 2.8 per cent, according to Scottish Provident. The changes will not affect annuities bought by the end of this month.</p>

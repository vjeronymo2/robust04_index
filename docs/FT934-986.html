			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Mobil becomes first US oil group back in Vietnam: 50% interest in offshore exploration venture Mobil is set to become the first US oil group to return to Vietnam since the war ended in 1975, signalling a further defrosting of commercial relations between the two countries. The Virginia-based oil company said it had received a licence from the Treasury Department to take part in the exploration of the Blue Dragon block, off the coast of Vietnam. However, under current US regulations Mobil would not be able to take part in any future production from the field. Mobil said it hoped US restrictions would be relaxed further in future. If not, it would have to dispose of its interest should the field prove commercially attractive. Mobil's 50 per cent interest in a consortium formed to explore the area, alongside three Japanese companies, follows the oil group's involvement in Vietnam in the early 1970s. At that time it conducted the exploratory drilling in the White Tiger field, a moderately sized off-shore development which is now the Vietnam's only oil-producing field. Vietnam's award of the exploration contract to the Mobil consortium, and the US's decision to grant a licence, comes at a time when US energy groups are investing heavily overseas in search of large-scale finds to replace their dwindling US reserves. Most other international oil companies have already been awarded exploration contracts in Vietnam.</p>

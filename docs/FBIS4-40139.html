			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, June 13. (SNARK) -- By-elections to the  Georgian Parliament, which took place on June 12, passed with  gross violation of the Law on Elections. Such declaration was  made today by Vice-speaker of the Georgian Parliament Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili. He informed SNARK of the facts which put in  question the legitimacy of the elections. The Chairman of one  of the Electoral Commissions and his Assistant had to leave  their places to save their lives. Serious collisions took place  at some election districts, at two of them arms were used. The  candidates began blaming each other in using military  detachments to get additional votes.    Mr. Rcheulishvili said in the towns of Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku  and Salendzhikha 60-65 per cent of all the voters took part in  the elections, when in Rustavi - only 10 per cent.    "Presumably, the Central Electoral Committee will find  illegal the results of the by-elections in the towns of Western  Georgia", declared the Georgian Vice-speaker.</p>

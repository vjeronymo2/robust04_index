			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The abrupt announcement on  Friday of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's intention to resign  is likely to deal a severe blow to Japanese diplomacy as it  comes at an important time on the international front.  Hosokawa's announcement comes as Japan is seeking ways to  resume the failed trade "framework" negotiations with the United  States and as tensions run high on the Korean peninsula over  North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons.    "It would, of course, have an effect on diplomacy," a senior  Foreign Ministry official said of the resignation decision.  "But all we can do is go ahead with diplomacy calmly. For the  time being, we will watch developments on the political scene."    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata was more blunt, saying the  latest development would have a detrimental effect on Japan's  relationship with the world. "Japan has become a country which  can have some influence on various other countries," Hata told a  press conference Friday evening, and expressed concern that the  world would be anxious about the future course of Japanese  politics.    Hosokawa's resignation announcement sparked concern among  Japanese diplomatic officials, especially with regard to Japan's  relations with the U.S. since ties have soured following the  collapse of trade negotiations at a meeting between Hosokawa and  U.S. President Bill Clinton in February in Washington.    "We will pay close attention to how the U.S. Government  reacts" to Hosokawa's resignation, a senior ministry official  said.    The U.S. Government was said to have great expectations of  the government, which emerged last August after nearly four  decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. Washington  highly regarded the Hosokawa government as a promoter of  political and economic reforms and Hosokawa himself had a  trusting personal relationship with Clinton based on common  experience and policy goals, according to ministry officials.    Although Hosokawa told a press conference he wants to  support  reform even after stepping down, there is no guarantee the U.S.  will be satisfied with the efforts of Hosokawa's successor.    The officials saw next week's signing ceremony for a global  trade accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) in Marrakech, Morocco, as a crucial opportunity to seek a  breakthrough in resuming trade talks with Washington. Hata was  expected to go to Marrakech and hold talks with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor, but it is not yet clear whether he  will go as scheduled as he is touted to be Hosokawa's successor.    Japan wants stable and firm relations with the U.S.,  particularly at present, given the suspicion that North Korea is  developing nuclear weapons. North Korea has repeatedly said it  wants to hold dialogue only with the U.S. and has refused to  hold talks with Japan.    Although Hata said there will be no problem in coping with  the issue even if the government changes, as Japanese  administrations are consistent in continuing policies,  cooperation among Japan, the U.S., South Korea and China is  crucial to solving the problem.    Upcoming diplomatic events also included Hosokawa's planned  trip to Europe in early May to meet the European leaders of the  Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers. The ministry officials  considered the trip essential to getting to know the leaders  ahead of the G-7 summit meeting in July in Naples, Italy.    Hata was also scheduled to visit Middle East countries from  late April to early May.    As for visitors to Japan from abroad, Deputy Foreign  Ministry  Spokesman Kishichiro Amae said the upcoming visit by Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak will go ahead as scheduled since it has  already obtained cabinet approval.</p>

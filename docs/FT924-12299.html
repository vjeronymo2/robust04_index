			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: European markets advance on German rate cut hopes MOST European bond markets advanced strongly yesterday as the Bundesbank appeared to offer further evidence of its intention to keep German interest rates falling. The announcement that the central bank is reverting to variable rate repurchase agreement tenders, rather than the fixed-rate repos of recent weeks, was read as a sign that the Bundesbank wants money market rates to ease further - particularly in view of its clear signal to banks that it did not want the switch to be interpreted as a sign of higher rates to come. The result is widely expected to be a lower rate at today's weekly repo tender, down by 10 or 15 basis points from the previous fixed rate of 8.9 per cent. In spite of the general euphoria in bond markets around Europe on the news, some observers cautioned against interpreting the change as a sign that German rates are set to fall sharply, pulling other European interest rates down in their wake. 'If they (the Bundesbank) had wanted to signal that, they would have moved the fixed-rate repo down from 8.9 per cent,' said Mr Klaus Baader of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. The Euromark futures contract jumped on the news, rising from 91.78 at the opening to end the day at 91.90. Longer-dated German bonds failed to hold on to early gains, however, as investors took profits after the recent advance in the market. The bund futures contract on Liffe ended the day much where it began, at 91.54, having touched a high of 91.80 at one stage. THE French bond market gained confidence from the move in Germany, helping to push overnight interest rates further down after a sharp fall on Monday. Overnight rates dropped to nearly 10 1/2 per cent, having slipped below 11 per cent on Monday, as the market sensed the pressure of recent weeks was lifting from the French franc. In spite of the fall, however, the French authorities have left the key 5-10 day rate at 13 per cent, where it has been for almost a month in order to defend the currency. This interest rate is not likely to come back down to its more normal 10.5 per cent until the overnight rate has stabilised below that level, said Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, an analyst at Midland Montagu in London. 'They're being very cautious with the franc, and won't move too fast,' she added. OATs advanced on the day, with gains of up to half a point. This pushed the French/ German yield differential down to around 100 basis points, a level below which it has not broken since the ERM tensions came to a head last month. Lingering concern about the danger of a forced devaluation, and an emergency vote of confidence in the government due early next week, look likely to hold the yield spread at current levels, though any decisive break below 100 basis points is widely viewed as likely to lead to a tightening back towards pre-September levels, when it stood at around 60 basis points. AFTER their sharp drops on Monday, longer-dated gilts bounced back yesterday on news that the UK money supply is growing less rapidly than expected. Sentiment was also helped by a bounce in sterling, which jumped back to above DM2.46. The market continued to push for another cut in the UK base rate after last Friday's one point reduction, with the December short sterling contract leaping from 92.84 to 93.07, suggesting a base rate of 7 per cent. The steeping in the yield curve was less marked than on Monday, however, as longer-dated gilts also moved ahead. Gains of around a point were seen at most maturities, with the long gilt futures contract on Liffe ending at 99.00, up from 98.06, on moderate volume of nearly 30,000 lots. US Treasury investors continued to price a Democratic victory into bond prices yesterday as President George Bush showed no signs of eating into his challenger's substantial lead in the opinion polls. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  29/32 at 95 7/32 , yielding 7.653 per cent. Losses were more pronounced among intermediate-dated securities, with the 10-year note down 1 11/32 at 96 5/8, yielding 6.878 per cent, while the two-year note was 13/32 lower at 99 11/32, yielding 4.338 per cent. Prices weakened after investors judged that the president's performance on Monday night in the final presidential debate would not be sufficient to turn around his ailing campaign. Consequently, investors carried on where they left off last Friday and this Monday - selling bonds in anticipation of victory for Governor Bill Clinton. If he does win, the market believes the Democratic nominee will try to pass a growth-oriented fiscal package in the first few months of his presidency, which could push up interest rates and widen the budget deficit.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Paris plans financial aid for small businesses Mr Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, yesterday announced new loan guarantees for the country's struggling small businesses and urged commercial banks to follow the central bank in cutting the cost of credit. The government is to give CEPME, a body specialising in equipment financing for small companies, a FFr200m (Pounds 23m) loan guarantee fund, which will allow it to advance companies with less than 500 employees advances on the unpaid bills due from local authorities. The minister also said he was considering 'recapitalising' the CEPME which has been pushed into deepening losses by mounting bankruptcies of its client companies this year. This follows a government move earlier this year to use public money to take half the risk of medium term bank loans to small businesses, and is all part of an effort to make the big commercial banks less nervous in lending to small companies on which recession has taken a disproportionate toll. But Mr Alphandery also suggested commercial banks should lower their bank rate, currently at 8.15 per cent, after the Bank of France cut its floor intervention rate by a quarter point to 6.2 per cent last week. 'We very soon ought to see the bank rate below 8 per cent,' he said.</p>

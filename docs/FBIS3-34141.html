			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Hanan 'Azran] </F>   [Text] Opponents of the regime in Congo are operating in  Israel in an attempt to recruit Army personnel and rich  businessmen to carry out a coup against Prime Minister Andre  Milongo. Our correspondent has obtained secret documents in  which the coup's initiators offer tremendous incentives to  Israelis who will invest money in financing the revolution.  They also promised $15 million in exchange for engineering the  coup.    In a world of dubious business dealings, even bizarre  schemes  like this can sometimes be true. Therefore, a business venture  seeking investors in a revolution should also be taken  seriously. In the situation which has now arisen, Israelis may  find themselves facing each other on the battlefield. In an  attempt to maintain maximum secrecy, a representative of the  underground in Congo-Brazzaville, sent a facsimile from  Montreal, Canada explaining the offer to a senior Israeli  reserves officer. Israel television is keeping the man's  identity secret. The representative identifies himself as a  political figure, with a PhD. He is looking for military  experts in Israel who will be willing to carry out a coup for  $15 million. He is also proposing that Israeli investors  finance the revolution in return for huge incentives which  include, he claims, diamond and gold mining rights in western  Congo as well as 100 percent interest on their money. The  payment of course will be made after the revolution and after  the rebels take control of Congo's banks and foreign currency  reserves.    The Congolese doctor includes maps in his proposal in which  he marks out the areas under the control of his supporters, the  areas controlled by the government, and the areas controlled by  the prime minister's men. He notes that the Israeli embassy in  Congo is aware of the underground's strength and capabilities.  The situation becomes more complex when one recalls that  Israelis are already involved in the training and equipping of  the Congolese security forces. This involvement is the private  initiative of a public investment firm, known as Carden  Investments, whose offices are situated in Ramat Gan. A Carden  subsidiary, Levran, recruited dozens of army officers and  veterans of the Israeli security forces and sent them to Congo.  Carden claims that it received the Defense Ministry's  authorization to implement the deal. As reported by YEDI'OT  AHARONOT, the head of the company is reserves Brigadier General  Ze'ev Zakharin, who is considered an expert in training foreign  armies. If the new revolution initiative takes off, Israelis  may find themselves at war with each other in Congo with one  group helping the government's forces and the other plotting to  overthrow the Congolese Government. If such a situation indeed  comes to pass, it may have serious political and ethical  ramifications at the very least.    [In the same broadcast, Jerusalem Israel Television Channel  1  Network in Hebrew adds that "there were many reactions to this  evening's report on the involvement of Israelis in plans for a  revolution in Congo. The Knesset State Audit Committee will  convene again to hold a detailed discussion about the actions of  the Israeli Embassy in Congo. Knesset Member [MK] Dan Tikhon,  the committee's chairman, said that clear rules should be set  with regard to defense related exports. Tikhon expressed fears  that this would be a repeat of the Colombia affair [in which an  Israeli company trained Colombian farmers suspected of belonging  to a drug cartel]. Likud MK Silvan Shalom submitted an urgent  motion to the agenda in which he demanded that Yitzhaq Rabin,  the prime minister and defense minister, explain whether Israel  had sent official advisers to Congo. Shalom also demanded that  Rabin explain how reserve army officers, working for a private  company, had received permission to leave for Congo to establish  special units to support the regime there. In the wake of these  revelations, Likud MK Avraham Herschson submitted an urgent  motion to the agenda demanding that the defense minister  investigate whether reserve Army officers or businessmen had any  intention of accepting the proposal to finance or carry out a  coup in Congo."]</p>

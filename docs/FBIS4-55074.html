			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Deutsche Welle-attributed report: "Chetnik Leader Arkan </F> Demands the Deportation of 700,000 Albanians From Kosovo to  Albania"]    [Text] Although it is true that the message of Serbian  Patriarch Pavel II to believers and the president called for an  end to the war and for a Christian peace, the longing for peace  in Serbia shines side by side with the ever-waning NATO threat  of action if there is no immediate withdrawal from Gorazde.  According to a recent poll, 40 percent of the people want the  occupied territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be retained,  whereas 60 percent favor unification with other parts of the  former Yugoslavia. Similar answers were also given with regard  to the consequences of the [UN] sanctions. Of those polled, 20  percent think that the sanctions against the Serbs and Croats in  Bosnia [as published] could remain in force for another couple  of months, while 40 percent argue that the sanctions should be  lifted because the country is facing starvation. Any belief  that the super-dinar might work wonders has dwindled into  insignificance. The Easter liturgy, which was broadcast on all  the radio and television stations of former Yugoslavia, was  conducted by Patriarch Pavel II in the monastery of Peja in  Kosova. The Serbian militants see this liturgy as representing  their rightful claim to part to Kosova and Metohija -- the  heartland of the medieval Serbian empire.    The chetnik leader Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, an individual  who is wanted by Interpol as a war criminal and whose Party of  Serbian Unity suffered a fiasco in the last elections, last  Friday [29 April] in Prishtina, in the presence of his  idolaters, demanded the deportation of 700,000 [Kosovar]  Albanians to Albania. Arkan threatened to amputate the legs of  the U.S. soldiers stationed in the neighboring republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  if they dared to cross the border with Kosova. At the same time  he publicly made numerous territorial claims on Macedonia.    On the eve of the Orthodox Easter, the army of the former  Yugoslavia ended its large-scale military maneuvers in Kosova  and Sandzak, which, according to the chief of the [Yugoslav  Army's] General Staff, showed that the Yugoslav Army fears no  enemy whatsoever.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Strengthening Law and Order and </F> Discipline Is a Priority Area in the Activity of Military  Cadres"]    [Text] The "Legal and Socio-Psychological Problems of  Military Discipline and Regulation Order in the Armed Forces of  Ukraine and Ways of Strengthening Them Today" practical-science  conference of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense  was held the other day.    Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Main Directorate for  Indoctrination Work Chief Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar  made the opening remarks at the meeting; he stated in particular  that "the problem of military discipline and law and order in  the ranks has always attracted the attention of theoreticians  and practitioners, thanks to which a definite increase can be  observed every year in knowledge and experience in the study of  this social aspect of the vital activity of the Army.  Notwithstanding this, the state of military discipline has grown  significantly worse, and there exists a steady trend toward  growth in such types of offenses as evasion of military service,  the theft of state property and official abuses. The number of  instances of suicides remains very high in the Army. Life forces  us to address this problem again and again, and to make an  attempt to find and realize new reserves to improve  organizational and indoctrination work.    "The practical-science conference was devoted to all of  these  issues as well. The task is to study deeply the problems of law  and order and military discipline, which are becoming more and  more widespread, by moving beyond the traditional framework and  encompassing not only purely statistical data, but the host of  preconditions that give rise to them."    He gave the floor to Minister of Defense of Ukraine General  of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy for the report, "The  Moral-Psychological State of the Personnel of the Armed Forces  and the Activity of the Bodies of Military Administration to  Strengthen Military Discipline and Law and Order in the Ranks."  (The report is being published in somewhat abridged form.)    Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Main Directorate for  Indoctrination Work Chief Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar  spoke following the report of Minister of Defense of Ukraine  General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy. He devoted his  presentation to a topical theme for the vital activity of the  troops: "The Practice of the Utilization of Scientific  Approaches in the Activity of Bodies for Indoctrination and  Socio-Psychological Work Directed at Indoctrination and Raising  the Level of Discipline of the Personnel."    As Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of  Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy indicated in his closing words, a  serious and productive exchange of opinions took place during  the practical-science conference with regard to strengthening  military discipline in the Armed Forces. The conference  demonstrated that the level of serious scientific study of  problem issues in the vital activity of the Armed Forces and  their well-founded analysis has been reached. The participants  in the conference were able to formulate, in clear-cut and  scientifically substantiated fashion, new and progressive  approaches to solving the problem of strengthening military  discipline.    The practical-science conference provided a profound  analysis  of the state of discipline in the ranks, and projected the  principal directions of organizational and indoctrination work  of the bodies of military administration. The report by Minister  of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy  Radetskyy and the speeches of Ministry of Defense of Ukraine  Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work Chief  Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar, Deputy Minister of Defense  for Rear Services--Chief of Rear Services for the Armed Forces  of Ukraine Colonel-General Hryhoriy Mikhaylichenko, Deputy  Minister of Defense for Weaponry--Chief of Weaponry of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine Colonel-General Ivan Oliynyk, Ministry of  Defense Main Directorate for Cadres Lieutenant-General Hryhoriy  Dyachuk, Main Organizational-Mobilization Directorate of the  General Staff of the Armed Forces Chief Major-General Valeriy  Venher and other participants in the conference made it possible  to draw the fundamental conclusion that the level of military  discipline is defined to a considerable extent by the  moral-psychological state of the personnel, which reflects the  needs of the servicemen at a certain moment in time, their  interests, social points of reference and psycho-physiological  state, which determines the readiness of people to engage in  various types of military activity and fulfill the requirements  of standards and ethics.    The leadership of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the  participants in the practical-science conference feel that the  following are essential in order to invigorate the work  pertaining to the establishment of law and order and strong  military discipline:    1. To designate the work pertaining to strengthening law and  order and discipline as one of the priority areas of activity of  military cadres at all levels of military supervision.    The work system of military cadres with regard to the  maintenance of strict law and order and conscious discipline in  the ranks should encompass the principal areas of this activity,  ascertain and substantiate indicators of the effectiveness of  the measures that are being carried out, and create  organizational-social and psychological-pedagogical conditions  for the formation of a level of discipline among the personnel.    2. The organizational work of commanders, staffs and bodies  for indoctrination work should be concentrated on eliminating  the causes that worsen the moral-psychological state of the  personnel and, as a consequence, cause violations of the norms  of regulations for service activity.    3. The indoctrination work of commanders and senior officers  of all levels should promote the formation and development of  such individual qualities as discipline among servicemen. The  underpinnings for that should be the pedagogization of all  spheres of military activity and individual indoctrination work,  which should be of a preventive nature.    4. The efforts of military scholars and social-sciences  scholars, in collaboration with scientists at prominent  scientific institutions of Ukraine, should promote the formation  and incarnation within the Armed Forces of the ideology of the  Ukrainian state--an ideology of public patriotism with the  person and his life, rights and freedoms at its center.    5. The efforts of bodies of military administration should  be  directed toward the achievement of a solid interconnection  between Ukrainian society and the Armed Forces of Ukraine,  through active collaboration and interaction with all of the  public organizations of Ukraine to the benefit of state  interests.    6. The bodies for indoctrination work, together with  commanders, must focus their efforts on the formation of  positive military traditions and rituals within the military  collectives. The development of a system of measures with regard  to moral incentives to stimulate the service activity of  servicemen of various categories would be expedient.    7. Commanders and superior officers at all levels, together  with the cadre bodies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine,  must uphold the principle of social justice during the naming of  servicemen to official positions. It is important to be guided  therein by professional competence, high moral qualities and  experience in the service of military cadres, with the broadest  possible enlistment in this work of the officers' assemblies and  their conduct with a regard for public opinion.    8. Military scholars must launch the profound development of  a program with regard to the study, analysis and strengthening  of the moral-psychological state of the troops.    9. The Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work must  invigorate the activity of its sociological structures for the  purpose of obtaining objective and prompt information on the  moral-psychological state of the personnel in the Armed Forces  of Ukraine.    It would be expedient to be guided, during the evaluation of  the state of military discipline in subordinate troops, by  criteria that are clearly formulated by the corresponding  guiding documents.    The leaders of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the  participants in the practical-science conference expressed the  hope that the generals and officers of the central apparatus of  the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine will be actively involved in  the work to establish strong law and order and conscious  military discipline in the ranks, and will display creativity,  exactingness and discipline therein.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Electrolux sells stake in Email for ADollars 84.5m ELECTROLUX, the Swedish electrical appliance group, has sold a 10 per cent interest in Email, the Australian white goods company, to a group of international institutions for ADollars 84.5m (USDollars 56.5m). It retains an interest of just over 5 per cent in Email. Electrolux has 'no present intention' of further reducing its stake and said the disposal did not reflect any change in the commercial relationship between the two companies. Electrolux said the deal would generate a SKr200m capital gain, although it noted that one-off costs relating to the sale of a French operation meant it would have no overall impact on second-quarter results. Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux president, said: 'Email is a highly valued ally in Australia and south-east Asia and we expect this relationship to be further strengthened in the future.' Email distributes Electrolux products in Australia and uses the Swedish company's networks in Asia for export. Electrolux plans to continue to participate in technical licence and brand name agreements and Mr Anders Scharp, Electrolux chief executive, will remain on the Email board. The shares were placed by Potter Warburg with institutional investors in Australia, the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and the US at ADollars 3.25. They closed at ADollars 3.37. For the year ended March, Email made profits after abnormal items of ADollars 55.5m on sales of ADollars 1.47bn.</p>

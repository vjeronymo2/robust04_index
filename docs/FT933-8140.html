			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Whitbread slips In a weak drinks sector. Whitbread lost further ground as NatWest Securities reiterated its negative stance on the stock. The 'A' shares have fallen from 533p on Friday to close yesterday at 499p, down 10 on the day. Mr Geoff Collyer, drinks analyst at NatWest, said concern persisted over the damage being done to revenues by supermarkets switching from domestic to Continental suppliers. He added that because Whitbread was standing at a 10 per cent premium to the sector, investors looking to take profits should consider the stock an obvious candidate. Following firm results on Friday, Unilever stormed ahead by 20 to 1006p, helped by a strong 'buy' note from Strauss Turnbull. The broker pointed out that, as well as positive results, the stock has significantly underperformed the market this year. Among food retailers, Tesco responded to some healthy weekend press comment that the shares looked oversold. They climbed 9 1/2 to 233p. A brighter outlook for the discount end of the market was also being commented on. Shoprite Group added 5 at 159p and Kwik Save 6 at 688p. Among stores, results from Argos were accompanied by a cautious statement and the shares drifted back 10 to 328p. The stock had raced ahead prior to the figures and, in the absence of anything startling, dealers said it was due for a correction. Another stock to enjoy a good run, Sears, also encountered profit-taking and eased 2 to 111 1/2 p, with NatWest Securities negative. Although positive on the sector in the short term, the broker is also cautious on Boots, a penny softer at 474p, and WH Smith, 3 off at 469p. HSBC was the pick of a generally strong banking sector, the shares building on their recent strong performance and pushing up to touch a record 769p, before closing a net 10 ahead at 766p. Dealers said the big international institutions had continued to chase the shares because of the recent strong profits performance from Standard Chartered and the outstanding prospects for the Pacific Rim area. HSBC is scheduled to announce interim figures on August 31. Abbey National's decision to sell its Cornerstone estate agency business for Pounds 8m, involving the bank in a write-down of Pounds 30m in its second half, saw Abbey shares only marginally affected and finally a penny down at 400p xd. The burst of buying interest that drove British Gas shares sharply higher last week, amid suggestions that today's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the gas supply and transport industry will not recommend a break-up of Gas, foundered yesterday as nervous fund managers locked in some of the profits garnered in the past couple of months. British Gas ended 9 lower at 323 1/2 p on what one energy specialist described as disappointing turnover of 8m. 'The market does not really care about anything else other than the company's ability to pay the dividend and its ability to increase that payment,' said an analyst. BP failed to respond to reports of a major drilling success in Vietnam, the shares settling unchanged at 303 1/2 p ex-dividend. 'The Vietnam stories are old news,' said one specialist. Shell Transport edged up 2 1/2 to 663p. Enterprise Oil, whose shares were given a mauling by the market last week after news of the resignation of Mr John Walmsley and also following a bearish review of the company by Hoare Govett, staged a rally and finished 13 better at 442p. Aran Energy eged up half-penny to 34p on relatively heavy turnover of 1.5m, with speculators said to be increasingly optimistic about the group's drilling operations in the Celtic Sea. Fears that British Aerospace's negotiations with Taiwan over their regional jets joint venture may be facing difficulties weakened BAe. The shares dipped 5 to 453p. Overseas buyers were seen late in the session for aero-engine manufacturer Rolls- Royce. Earlier the company said it had sold stock, believed to be around 6.7m shares, to reduce the level of foreign ownership, which had exceeded 29.5 per cent, the level permitted under the company's articles of association. Having declined to 158p, the shares picked up to close 1 1/2 off on balance at 160 1/2 p. Nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's figures saw BICC relinquish 16 to 397p. There was some talk of a possible rights issue but it was discounted by several analysts. Profits are expected to come in at around Pounds 53m, against Pounds 58m last year.</p>

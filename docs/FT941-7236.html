			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BT plans focus on global ambitions British Telecommunications has restructured its senior management team to give a sharper focus to its international ambitions. BT's business division has been split into two, one for international business, the other for national business. Mr Alfred Mockett, the current director of business communications, will head the new international division. Mr Mockett will also take one of the BT seats on the board of MCI, the long- distance US carrier in which BT took a 20 per cent stake for Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.63bn) last June. Mr Bruce Bond, currently director of BT's product and services management division, will lead the new national business division. Mr Stafford Taylor - the former head of Cellnet, BT's cellular mobile joint venture with Securicor - will continue to head BT's personal communications division, which covers the residential market. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, said the new international division would develop BT's marketing, services and sales capabilities for multinational companies needing global services, a field where BT is likely to be in strong competition with AT&amp;T of the US. BT and MCI are establishing a Dollars 1bn joint venture company to serve the global market. It is expected to be launched within the next few months as soon as regulatory approval is secured in Washington.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] NATO is to open its doors to East European  countries but with caution in order not to upset Russia. The  enlargement has been postponed but a new phase of cooperation  starts, a sort of sweetener for the candidates. It is possible  that in the future there will be NATO intervention without the  Americans. Washington does not want to be involved in some of  the complex situations such as Bosnia and leaves the decision to  its European NATO friends. Antonio Esteves Martins reports from  Brussels.    [Martins] By signing the American proposal, Partnership for  Peace, today the 16 member states have definitively relaunched  NATO into a new area of cooperation and have opened the door for  new membership but only in the medium or even long term. This  is the price to be paid in order not to irritate Russia's  nationalists and to calm the Visegrad Four, the countries  applying for immediate membership: Poland, Hungary, Czech  Republic and Slovakia.    [Begin Cavaco recording in progress] ...a door which opens  to  a future enlargement. I think this will be an important  contribution to a greater security in Europe without creating  new divisions in Europe. The concern is not to create a new  Iron Curtain, now situated a little further east. [passage  omitted]</p>

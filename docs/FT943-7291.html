			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not against the Body Shop Sir, On August 19 you carried a somewhat inaccurate headline to an article regarding our company's sale of The Body Shop's stock earlier this summer ('US ethical fund turns against Body Shop'). As you point out, one factor (of several) leading to our sale was a belief that negative allegations scheduled to be published in the US press regarding the Body Shop's ethical performance could hurt the company's stock price in the short term. We would like to clarify that at this time we are researching these allegations and do not necessarily share them. We are independently researching a report on the Body Shop's ethical performance, which we have not finished, nor have we reached any conclusions. It is therefore inaccurate for the headline to say that Franklin Research &amp; Development has 'turned against' the Body Shop. While we have turned against the stock for a variety of reasons, we have not taken this same position towards the company. If the results of our ethical analysis are positive and the company's stock were at an attractive valuation, The Body Shop would certainly be a company whose shares we would consider buying again. Patrick McVeigh, Senior vice-president, Franklin Research &amp; Development Corporation, 711 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02111</p>

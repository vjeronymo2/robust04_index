			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Sport: Weighed down by August - Cricket / Surprising leaders and laggards in the race for the county championship With August comes full yield Then cricket wears a mantle overgrown, And counties in the field lose gloss As though they wished the season flown. THE FIRST verse of G D Martineau's memorably dreadful poem, Cricketer's August (1935), reminds us how hard this month can be in cricket, calling for endurance it does not always find. Lancashire's talented players, for instance, suffer from mid-season periods of depression. Last year, they lost their gloss so early that they did not win a single match between mid-May and early August, after which the best they could do was finish eighth in the county championship. This season, Lancashire's mid-season depression has been so bad that they provided Gloucestershire with their only championship win this season - last weekend, at Cheltenham, by nine wickets. Nor is it just Lancashire who are feeling the strain. Before the season began, few people were expecting an August championship table with Middlesex (11th last year) in first place, Glamorgan (14th last year) in second and Essex (last year's champions) reckoning it a revival to have pulled themselves up to ninth. Mind you, I can claim that I had my doubts about Essex, with batting stars Graham Gooch and Australia's Mark Waugh due to be soaked up by Test duty and bowler Neil Foster tormented by recurrent knee and spine injuries. Although this was Foster's benefit season, he had to retire from first-class cricket after a brave but troubled series of games, and is missed greatly. The fiery genius of Pakistan's Salim Malik has not worked the overseas oracle for Essex this year and, as so often, bad luck seems to breed bad cricket. Essex were one of the few counties loath to change from the three-day to the four-day format because, among other things, it would lessen the number of matches they could play on outlying grounds with enterprising pitches. It is always sad when counties centralise their cricket and, this season, Essex have only one championship game each at Ilford, Colchester and Southend, half as many as last year. Chelmsford is increasingly dominant. Habit is a strong force in cricket, and the hard truth is that Essex are not in the habit of losing and are not sure how best to react when they do. The other side of that, of course, is that Essex are in the habit of persisting. Where Lancashire are inclined to brood, Essex are inclined to fight, and I would not be surprised to see them fight better before the season ends. It will be hard, however, for anyone to challenge Middlesex's commanding lead, which is based not so much on batting or bowling points - Surrey, in third place, have more of both - but on the fact that they have had nine victories (Surrey have only six) and, most tellingly, are the only team not to have lost a single game so far this summer. Mike Gatting led Middlesex to victory in 1990 and is determined to avenge recent championship misfortunes with another triumph this year. He thinks his team are capable of winning and is proud that his captaincy is of the 'tough guy,' rather than the tactical or fitness-and-exercise, schools. Gatting is popular with a temperamental Middlesex team which includes two stars as famous for their tantrums as their talent: Phil Tufnell and Mark Ramprakash. Tufnell and John Emburey have been a profitable partnership of spin for Middlesex this year. Last season the whole fast bowling force - Ricky Ellcock, Norman Cowans and Angus Fraser - was injured and, not to be upstaged, Tufnell started the summer with appendicitis. So long as Gatting does not overwork Fraser's damaged hip, he might be able to revive him - along with Neil Williams, Mark Feltham and the young Richard Johnson - as part of a fair-paced bowling attack to work alongside the spinners. As for batting, Desmond Haynes, Mike Roseberry, Gatting himself and Ramprakash are a formidable quartet, although Middlesex are always prone to injury. John Carr has had an unexpectedly good season and has done well in the field, where Ramprakash has also fielded like a harrier picking up prey. Middlesex's favourite victim was Surrey, its old enemy from south of the Thames, at Lord's late in June - sweet revenge for last year when Surrey moved from 11th to seventh in the championship, and sent Middlesex from seventh to 11th, in the last game of the season. Then, their last wicket pair resisted Tufnell's last two balls and hung on a for a draw at the Foster's Oval. Middlesex are an urban crew; the nearest they can offer to an outlying county ground is Uxbridge, an outpost of the north-west London Underground. Still smarting from that defeat, Surrey are in their customary position of not quite doing themselves justice; but Northampton, fourth at the moment with a game in hand, are experts in doing just the opposite. The late middle stretch of the season, when other counties are getting stale, suits Northants. They are a balanced team and manage to maintain their concentration through bad patches, aided by Allan Lamb's calmer captaincy. Northampton did not drop Lamb when his first years in office were undistinguished, and his captaincy now does much better for his team. The real surprise is Glamorgan, in second place. Leaving the good sense to Northampton, the Welsh-based club have been living off high spirits. They were 100-1 outsiders at the end of last year but have won seven of their games this season, drawing attention to their home-grown players, such as the Rhondda valley's paragon of the fast-medium, Steve Watkin. Skipper Hugh Morris is a good example of how much confidence can help a troubled player. In 1989, the captaincy proved too much and he resigned, his game in tatters. This year, he cannot get enough of it and is not worried by his slightly erratic batting. Wherever Glamorgan end up, Morris will regard it as a success. Or a refutation of critics. Or a point proved. Or, at the very least, a point of passion - like Glamorgan's defeat of the visiting Australians a quarter of a century ago, against all odds, at Cardiff. As the great Martineau put it, deep in his second verse: Spring still is in their blood And bids them throng to watch heroic things.</p>

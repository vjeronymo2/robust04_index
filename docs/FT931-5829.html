			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Major urges companies to be aggressive MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday renewed his attack on the 'British disease' of talking down achievements and presenting an image of a nation in decline. Speaking at a conference on British style, quality and innovation organised by the Walpole Committee, a group of companies in the upmarket goods and services sector, he urged companies to be more aggressive in promoting their products against foreign competitors. 'Perhaps we have played at being gentlemen in industry and commerce for too long,' he said. 'We need to join the players.' Stressing the importance of quality, he said: 'Producing quality is not an optional extra in the 90s. It is absolutely essential for success.' Mr Major's comments marked the latest shot in a determined campaign by 10 Downing Street to 'talk up' the economy's prospects. While the Treasury has been reticent about claiming that the recession has ended, the prime minister is voicing optimism that recovery is already under way. His concern is that what he termed the 'British instinct for self-deprecation' could undermine the upturn in consumer and business confidence needed to sustain rising demand. Mr Major intends to pick up the same theme in a speech in Harrogate on Saturday. In an address billed as an important statement of his political strategy, he will attempt to reassure Conservative party activists that economic recovery will restore the government's battered authority. The prime minister, who returned last month from a trade mission to Saudi Arabia, said he would take more businessmen abroad with him on trips if it helped to open doors. The Walpole committee was set up last year and has 20 members. It aims to focus international attention on British excellence and style in the manufacturing, service and creative fields and to create a working body to help companies in the sector to grow. The committee is named after Sir Robert Walpole, the first British prime minister, known for his trade promotion. A survey of the chairmen and managing directors of 35 companies in the quality goods area showed that 78 per cent thought it helpful to have products marked 'Made in Britain', while 9 per cent thought it was not. The four sectors which UK companies felt were most associated by foreigners with British style and quality were 'classic clothing,' china, retailing and food and drink. However, 55 per cent of respondents felt British companies in the quality goods sector were losing out to foreign competition. The most commonly cited reasons were that foreign companies were better at marketing and product development. Sixty-one per cent of respondents said the main strength of British companies was their branding. Mr Ivor Owen, director-general of the Design Council, said that while the image created by Britain's upmarket companies was one of permanence, tradition and craftsmanship, they were operating in an extremely fast-changing marketplace. Walpole Committee members include George Ballantine, the whisky group; J. Barbour, manufacturer of country clothing; and Chewton Glen, the country house hotel. 'Amongst your members are a large number of success stories. I hope you will forgive me if I single any of you out, but I think it helps illustrate how wrong the gloomsters are: The Financial Times (international edition) has increased its circulation in the last five years by 67 per cent, and since printing began in Japan two years ago, sales there have grown by 135 per cent. William Grant continues to expand in their export markets and they have now made Glenfiddich famous worldwide as a symbol of quality. Dawson International, owners of Pringle and Ballantynes, are competing and succeeding in Germany and in Japan. I would stretch these examples across wide areas of British industry and endeavour.'

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Letter: Pragmatic peace plan for Bosnia Sir, Ian Davidson's dissection of the inadequacies of international proposals to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia ('Slippery Slopes of Bosnia', April 26) is much to the point. These proposals do not stand up to proper scrutiny. History shows that the communities in Bosnia have experienced political stability only under an externally imposed umbrella. Today, as Mr Davidson says, such an umbrella can be provided only by very large numbers of UN troops on the ground. If the international community is unwilling to commit ground troops in sufficient numbers on the long time-scale required, then it is also time to drop the Vance-Owen plan which is past its sell-by date. It is absurd to suggest that peace can be brought to Bosnia through the creation of a series of Nagorno-Karabakhs. Instead, the starting point towards an alternative could be to consider the behaviour of the Bosnian Croats in the conflict. While the Bosnian Croats, are as ready as any other group in the conflict to commit atrocities if their own interests are perceived as threatened, they were also the first group to agree to the Vance-Owen plan and to give it consistent support since that time. Why? Simply because the plan did not threaten to disperse the Bosnian Croats as much as the other groups, mainly concentrating them in one large territory comfortingly adjacent to the Croat border. Could not this principle be applied to the other communities, offering them single, integral, self-governing territories? Using such a framework, perhaps the Bosnian Serbs could be persuaded to draw back from some territory in return for a continuous band of territory looping round northern Bosnia and the border between eastern Bosnia and Serbia. The role of the UN would then be to guarantee the rights of minorities choosing to continue to live in territories allocated to a different ethnic group and to organise and finance the resettlement of people wishing to move. Surely such pragmatism would be cheaper in human life and financial resources than taking action which seems certain to escalate the conflict?

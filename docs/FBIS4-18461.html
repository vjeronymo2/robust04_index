			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the  Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT],  has warned against rushing the enlargement of the European Union  [EU] toward the East. The economic differences between the EU  countries and the former East Bloc countries, such as Poland or  Hungary, are still dramatically big, Stihl said on Bavarian  Radio on Easter Sunday. In the next 10 years it will be  unthinkable to accept these countries as full members into the  EU. Until then, such a development could be initiated through  associate membership agreements.    Moreover, the EU must now gather its strength for the  planned  enlargement by another four countries. Over the next few years,  the EU will be tied up with creating an economic, and maybe even  a political, community. With a view to Brussels, Stihl  criticized the EU's interventionism in trade issues. Bilateral  agreements with individual countries, such as the recent new  agreement with Japan on car exports, would encumber free trade,  Stihl concluded.</p>

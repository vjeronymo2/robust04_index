This time, however, we  held this conference prior to the New Year, two months earlier  than previous years. Yesterday morning, in an effort to seek  early results, leaders of the municipal agricultural departments  and various districts, counties and bureaus (general companies)  and cadres of some townships, towns, sections and second-grade  companies, a total of over 1,000 people, attended the 1994 rural  work conference to plan, mobilize, and implement earlier than in  previous years. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party  committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan attended and addressed the  conference. Vice Mayor Duan Qiang delivered a work report,  entitled: "Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth From Facts, Deepen  Reform, Expand the Degree of Opening Up, and Make Economic  Construction of Suburban Areas Enter a New Stage." [passage  omitted]    In his report, Duan Qiang put forward the guiding ideologies  of the 1994 economic work of suburban areas on behalf of the  municipal party committee and the municipal government: Firmly  grasp the "nose of the ox," which is to emancipate the mind and  seek truth from facts, strive to explore new ways and new moves  in line with the target of establishing the socialist market  economic new system, and use them to promote change and solve  difficulties, deepen reform, expand the pace of opening up,  accelerate economic development and the pace of becoming  well-off in an effort to stimulate the suburban economy to enter  a new stage.    The general fighting objectives of economic and social  development in suburban areas in 1994 are:    Total industrial and agricultural output value should reach  100 billion yuan, total social output value should reach 125  billion yuan, an increase of 46 percent and 42 percent  respectively over the previous year.    There should be four counties each with a total industrial  and agricultural output value exceeding 10 billion yuan, one  district with a total social output value of 10 billion yuan in  the urban and rural areas and 10 townships each with a revenue  of over 1 billion yuan.    The average per-capita income of peasants should reach 2,000  yuan, up 350 yuan over 1993.    The average per-capita income of workers of 60 outlying  townships and towns in the mountainous areas should reach 1,200  yuan, up 150 yuan over 1993.    In addition, new achievements should be made in village and  town construction, afforestation, and other aspects.    To realize the aforementioned objectives, we should actively  advance the work in 10 aspects in 1994 and make new strides  forward. Of these, the major ones are: To establish the  ideology that we must rely on high efficiency to realize high  returns in agriculture, follow the path of promoting large-scale  production and greatly raise labor productivity and make new  strides in developing "high yield, high quality, and highly  efficient farming"; make new strides in developing industrial  areas and building small cities and towns because they are the  places where the hopes and momentum of suburban areas lie; make  new strides in "carrying out large-scale projects, developing an  export-oriented economy, making new plans, implementing new  mechanisms, and using new technological equipment" because  township enterprises are now entering a new development stage;  establish the ideology that we must rely on using the export-  oriented economy, science and technology to bring along economic  development, and make new strides in linking with the  international track and rely on scientific and technological  progress; and establish the ideology of adopting policies of  opening the mountainous areas to the outside world and make new  strides in the "project of making the mountainous areas  prosperous."    In his speech, Duan Qiang said: We should uphold the  principle of taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both  to strengthen party building, ideological and political work,  and the building of spiritual civilization. It is necessary to  regard the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping as strong motivation and continue to actively  promote the emancipation of minds. We should strengthen the  building of the ideology and work style of leading bodies at and  above the township and section levels, strengthen the building  of grass-roots party organizations and strive to build them into  strong fight bastions for leading the masses into entering the  market, become well-off and enter a new stage. We should  persist in fighting corruption and promoting honesty and  strengthen the building of a clean government and diligent  administration, a socialist spiritual civilization, democracy,  and the legal system.

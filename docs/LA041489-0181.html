			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARKET RALLIES SHARPLY; RELIEVED DOW SOARS 41.06  </P> <P> Wall Street blue chips soared more than 40 points today as investors poured  money into the market after the release of better-than-expected inflation  figures.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 41.06 points to 2,337.06 for its  best single-day showing since it rose 43.92 points last Oct. 20.  </P> <P> The average wound up the week with a net gain of 32.26 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 1,072 up, 393 down and 468 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 169.78 million shares, against 141.59 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index rose 2.35 to 168.89.  </P> <P> The Labor Department report that the producer price index of finished goods  rose 0.4% in March, compared with 1% increases in each of the two preceding  months, was close to advance estimates. Nevertheless, analysts said, investors  were relieved that the report did not contain another unpleasant surprise.  </P> <P> Separately, International Business Machines reported first-quarter earnings of  $1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the comparable period a year ago.  </P> <P> Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing, in light of  IBM's warning a few weeks ago that its results this year probably would not  live up to some of the most optimistic estimates in the financial world.  </P> <P> Bond prices rebounded sharply in heavy trading today after the government  reports suggesting an easing of inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue jumped 1 3/16 point, or about $12 for  every $1,000 in face amount, as its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell  to 9.03% from 9.15% late Thursday.  </P></p>

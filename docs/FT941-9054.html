			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll pulls up retailers Food retail shares performed strongly as the Argyll trading statement prompted some in the market to forecast that the beleaguered sector was beginning to turn the corner. Argyll, which operates the Safeway supermarket chain, said profits would be slightly lower than last year but the group underpinned positive sentiment on margins by promising an increased dividend. While gross margins had slipped as the group responded to price competition, Argyll said some recovery had been seen recently. More positive analysts took heart from recent similar messages from Tesco and J Sainsbury. One said: 'If margins are stabilising, it nails the bear argument. The sector's reached a turning point today.' And Mr Neil Curry at SG Warburg said: 'If people are looking to reinvest in a bombed out sector, now is the right time.' Other analysts remain cautious, pointing out that few of the arguments that caused the sector's collapse - among them, competition from discounters, supermarket price wars and saturation of the market - have been properly addressed. Yesterday, Argyll's initial rise was clawed back as James Capel was said to have had a line of 2m shares overhanging the market. The shares closed 5 down at 256p with 12m traded. Tesco gained 3 to 229p and Sainsbury 8 to 377p. Kwik Save added 17 to 590p and Iceland 4 to 170p.</p>

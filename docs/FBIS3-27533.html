			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that the case of a former  U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer should not be  politicized and highlighted as a major issue in relations  between the two countries.    Kozyrev spoke during an interview with the ITAR-TASS news  agency, commenting on the arrest of Aldrich Ames and his wife  who are accused of spying for Russia and the former Soviet Union  for nine years.    The case should be left to the decision of relevant special  agencies, the foreign minister said.    He expressed regret over the incident, but added that such  cases occur all the times between countries, even between member  states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and between  the United States and Israel.    He stressed that the partnership between Russia and the  United States has reached a high level and will not be affected  by such a spy case.    He hoped that the American couple's case would not be  related  to President Boris Yeltsin's latest initiative for settling the  Bosnian crisis.    It is inadvisable to turn the case into a political and  ideological scandal, he said.    It has also been reported that the CIA will soon send a  delegation to Moscow to work out a solution to the issue with  the Russian Intelligence Agency.    Ames, chief of the Soviet branch of the CIA's  Counterintelligence Group during 1983-1985, allegedly sold  information about CIA operations and personnel for more than 1.5  million U.S. dollars.    The Clinton administration lodged a strong protest over the  case and warned that Russian diplomats involved in the case  would be punished.</p>

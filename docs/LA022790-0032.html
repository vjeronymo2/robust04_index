			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: CHEROKEE GROUP REPORTS $78,000 LOSS FOR QUARTER  </P> <P> Cherokee Group, a Sunland-based apparel and shoe concern, said it lost $78,000  in its fiscal second quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.57  million.  </P> <P> The loss came despite a 51% surge in Cherokee's sales in the quarter that ended  Dec. 2, to $42 million from $27.9 million.  </P> <P> For the first half of its fiscal year, Cherokee lost $194,000, contrasted with  an $891,000 profit a year earlier, and its six-month sales rose 30% to $92.3  million from $71.1 million.  </P> <P> Cherokee was acquired by a private investor group in May, 1989, for $174  million, most of which was borrowed. As a result, Cherokee's debt-interest  costs in the six months that ended Dec. 2 soared to $12.7 million from $20,000  a year earlier and led to the net loss.  </P> <P> The figures were included in a quarterly financial statement Cherokee filed  with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although its stock is no longer  publicly held, Cherokee must disclose its results because it sold debt  securities to the public as part of its acquisition.  </P></p>

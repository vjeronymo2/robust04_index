			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by RID correspondent Yuriy Leshkevich: "Fire Will </F> Help"]    [Text] As of today, Belarus has only two waste processing  factories: in Minsk and Mogilev.    However, their low capacity does not resolve the problem  with  the utilization of consumer waste which sounds extremely acute  in the Republic of late. In Belarus, registered waste sites  occupy some 700 hectares of land, while the area occupied by  unregistered waste sites is even larger. Therefore, the only  option is to build waste burning factories similar to ones which  are "at service" in all civilized states.    RID has learned that the construction of such a waste  burning  factory is being planned close to Gomel. According to experts,  total costs of this construction project will stand at around  320 million German marks. The output of this factory will be  500 tonnes of waste per year. According to the plans, this  factory will also burn silt which accumulates in our Republic at  a rate of close to 1 million tonnes per year.</p>

The kidnappers  are still holding up three boys, a bus driver and two pilots.    As soon as weathermen announced that the weather permitted  flight, the terrorists ordered the helicopter to be tugged by a  tractor to a remote runway. [passage omitted]    The four terrorists have not been identified yet. Officials  said the computer sketches of them are available and a photofit  picture of one of the kidnappers, made with the help of the  teenager hostages and their teacher which were freed on Friday  (one boy was freed Saturday morning) in return for a $10 million  ransom, was shown on Russian television.    Officials hope that some of the televiewers will be able to  identify the terrorists and supply additional data that may help  to free the remaining hostages. [passage omitted]    ITAR-TASS correspondent in Rostov-on-Don, where nine  teenagers and their teacher were kidnapped on Thursday, quoted  the school principal as saying that the terrorists declared that  they all were AIDS-infected and are going abroad for medical  treatment. They also promised the hostages to give them money  and take them abroad.    The principal, Valentina Fedoseyeva, said that "the children  burst into laughter when three masked men armed with assault  rifles burst into their class." They thought it was a joke  staged by their military instructor and only after the attackers  fired three rounds into the ceiling did the children realise it  was serious.</p>

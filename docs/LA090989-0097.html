			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> A FEW MOMENTS OF JOY FOR 'FROM THE HEART' STARS  </P> <P> Those few viewers who have the patience to wade through the sheen of Academy  Award gloss and canned speeches of "From the Heart," airing Sunday at 8 p.m. on  Channels 4, 36 and 39, will be rewarded with some moments of pure, uplifting  joy.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the producers of "From the Heart" don't make it easy, giving  short shrift to the real stars of the show, the disabled artists whose truely  formidable accomplishments are being celebrated.  </P> <P> A TV special taped during a weeklong salute to the organization Very Special  Arts, "From the Heart" is overloaded with celebrities -- ranging from Lauren  Bacall to Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) -- introducing different artists and film  clips. Few of the introductions ring true.  </P> <P> Most of the artists' performances are jarringly intercut with clips that  severely undermine the impact of their moments. One example: Dancer Zina  Bethune performs with her wheelchair-bound counterpart, Sarah Anderson, while  Amanda McBroom sings "The Rose" in the background . . . in between clips  explaining the dance project where Anderson developed her talent. A very  touching moment becomes almost irritating.  </P> <P> Michael Douglas is one of the few celebs who adds to his segment. Douglas  introduces playwright Neil Marcus and reads from one of Marcus' works in  between scenes performed by Marcus, who is plagued by the crippling disease  dystonia, and two actors. Douglas' reading is very effective; the performances  are enhanced by it.  </P> <P> " 'From the Heart' is not about disabled individuals," says Very Special Arts  founder Jean Kennedy Smith. "It is about talented people." It's too bad that  the producers didn't have the courage to let these individuals showcase their  hard-won skills. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

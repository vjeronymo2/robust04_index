			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 16 (CTK) -- Czech Health Minister  Ludek Rubas today rejected as false the claims by Jiri Nemec,  director of the General Health Insurance Company (VZP), about  the VZP's bad financial situation and stressed that "the health  insurance system is facing no collapse."    In the parliamentary health committee yesterday, Nemec said  that the VZP, which covers health care for three-quarters of the  population, might enter the next year with a deficit of 5.5  billion crowns (about $183 million). Nemec said that this is  due to the tension between the limited revenues of the health  insurance system and the growing expenditures on health care.    "Health care costs are not rising according to how much  people are ill, but according to how often the doctors are  inviting them for examinations so that they gather as many  points as possible for which they get money," Nemec said.    Unless the Health Ministry and the parliament adopt  regulatory measures to stop the doctors' hunt for points, the  health insurance system may collapse, Nemec warned yesterday.  He said that this would necessitate either higher health  insurance payments which now constitute 13.5 percent of an  employee's pre-tax pay or patients would have to start paying  extra money in doctors' surgeries. A third variant is to  decrease the point's value, according to the number of which  doctors are paid. But experts believe that this method would  paralyze health care, Nemec said.    The VZP and the parliamentary committee have agreed that the  system based on the number of points only had to be regulated.  Health insurance companies should be free not to pay for the  examinations which prove unnecessary, restrict prescription of  costly foreign medicaments, or introduce patients' higher  financial contribution to some types of treatment.    Nemec said yesterday that health care was sufficiently  funded. "With the seven percent from gross national product we  have secured for us a leading position among poorer countries.  But unfortunately we are not capable of appropriately managing  the money."    A statement from the Health Ministry given to CTK today said  that the ministry was attentively following the financing of  medical care, analyzing the present state, and studying  regulatory mechanisms.    Rubas has submitted to the parliament and government several  proposals of late. It plans to amend the Health Code and  legislation on insurance, insurance companies, including a list  of medical performance categories and categories of medicaments,  and to restrict patients' uncontrollable access to specialists.    The amendments are to be discussed in the autumn, the  statement says. It adds that Rubas has not found any reason to  raise the health insurance rates because he believes that the  insurance companies had the possibility to turn to revision  doctors to examine whether particular treatment was necessary.  The law not only renders this possible, but even orders the  companies to do so, the statement says. Rubas and Nemec will  meet tomorrow to discuss the above problems.</p>

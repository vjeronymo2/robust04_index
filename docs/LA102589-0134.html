			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NO MONOPOLY ON GOOD GAME IDEAS, BUT JUST TRY SELLING ONE  </P> <P> Ask experts on the toy and game market what the chances are of successfully  introducing a new board game -- let alone a phenomenal best-seller such as  Trivial Pursuit -- and they will say you have a better chance of winning the  California Lottery.  </P> <P> The $500-million board game market has always been saturated and difficult to  crack, industry observers say, but it is even tougher to break into these days,  with Trivial Pursuit clones crowding the adult market and glitzy video games  luring children's attention away from board games.  </P> <P> Larry Carlat, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine, a leading trade  publication in New York, said: "The average guy who thinks he's come up with a  great game idea usually heads straight for a Milton Bradley or a Parker  Brothers, expecting that they'll take his idea and make him a millionaire.  </P> <P> "But in reality, you'll be lucky if they don't slam the door in your face."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Practically Nil' Chance  </P> <P> Diane Cardinale, a spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an  industry trade association, is equally discouraging. Asked about the difficulty  of launching a new game, she said, "I would say your chances are practically  nil."  </P> <P> Despite all that, a San Diego landscape architect turned game inventor named  Craig E. Allison thinks that he can defy the odds. Allison and his partners  conceived and developed this summer Strokeamoby, a board game that tries to  capture the excitement and disappointment of trying to catch the big one in a  bass-fishing tournament.  </P> <P> Strokeamoby boasts sponsorship of the sport's biggest promoters, including the  Future Fisherman Foundation. Those imprimaturs, combined with the game's  peculiar name ("stroke a Moby" is fishing jargon for landing a hefty female  bass) should attract a significant percentage of the millions of this country's  fresh-water fishermen, Allison said.  </P> <P> Allison's game will not be available to the public until June. Because giant  manufacturers hardly ever accept ideas from novice game makers, such  entrepreneurs as Allison usually pay for initial production and distribution on  their own. He and his partners said they are ready to invest $200,000 to pay  for the manufacturing and marketing of their game through sporting goods, bait  and tackle shops.  </P> <P> The investors' hope is that Strokeamoby will sell well enough at $19.95 a game  that they will be in a position to sell the game to such major manufacturers as  Parker Brothers or Milton Bradley, receiving royalties from future sales.  </P> <P> A nice scenario, to be sure, but industry experts said the odds of success are  stacked against Allison.  </P> <P> "You can't imagine how many people call us every day believing that they have  the idea, the next Trivial Pursuit," said Stacy Botwinick, associate editor of  Playthings, a leading toy and games industry magazine based in New York. "But  the truth is, nobody is going to buy an idea."  </P> <P> The inventor, if no one else, remains optimistic. Allison, who has been  successful with a new game once before, is confident that he has a winner.  </P> <P> Besides finding a novel concept, he has already covered other game-launching  steps, such as financing and distribution.  </P> <P> And he thinks that he has found a rich vein of potential customers. Unlike  other sports such as baseball and football, which have more than their share of  games, fishing has been overlooked by the game industry, said Allison, who got  into the business when he tried to create a one-of-a-kind game for his children  a couple of years ago.  </P> <P> "At first, I was a little skeptical about the idea too," said Allison, who was  approached by bass fishermen who were co-workers at his landscape architecture  firm. They were interested in seeing their sport in a board game.  </P> <P> After some research, he discovered Americans' love affair with fishing. "That's  when I realized that there was potential for a huge marketplace," Allison said.  </P> <P> If his game is stocked at bait and tackle shops and sporting goods stores, he  said, fishermen can pick up Strokeamoby along with a new fishing rod.  </P> <P> "Have you ever hung around with fishermen? These people can't leave a tackle  store without buying something," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still No Guarantee  </P> <P> Allison may have found a niche, but that does not mean the people in the niche  will buy his game, Carlat noted: "I'm a basketball freak, but that doesn't mean  I'm going to go out and buy Larry Bird's basketball board game."  </P> <P> At first glance, the success of games such as Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary  would seem to have helped board games regain the popularity they lost with the  advent of video games in the early 1980s. In 1988, for example, board game  sales were $512 million, according to Toy Manufacturers of America, up sharply  from $377 million in 1982, when video games had their most profound impact.  </P> <P> As a result, many game inventors now think that selling board games is a path  to riches. Not so, Carlat said.  </P> <P> "Besides Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary, how many other hot board games can you  name?" he asked. "The sales of those two games have really skewed the picture.  </P> <P> "It's so difficult to attract board game buyers. You're competing against so  many other things, against movies and other leisure-time activities. People  don't seem to realize that games like Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary come along  maybe once in a lifetime."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, game inventors, large and small, are introducing many  adult-oriented board games.  </P> <P> "What Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary have done is opened the board game  manufacturers' eyes to the adult market," Carlat said.  </P> <P> Pursuing the older game player also allows game makers to recoup sales they  have lost to video-game manufacturers. Children's games retail for about $10,  and most adult games sell for $20 to $30.  </P> <P> As a result, industry officials expect plenty of Trivial Pursuit clones or  "social interaction" games to appear on store shelves.  </P> <P> "When something pops in the toy business," Carlat said, "then every major  company will come up with a similar product and try to ride the bandwagon. What  you get is a tremendous oversaturation, and then everybody suffers.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid that's what we're beginning to see. People in the game business are  notorious for killing the golden goose."  </P> <P> With game inventors rushing to pitch their winning ideas to manufacturers,  industry experts said selling a game concept, traditionally a difficult task,  will become even harder.  </P> <P> "Selling a game idea is probably one of the hardest things to do," said  Cardinale, the Toy Manufacturers of America spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Because major manufacturers have a staff of game inventors, they rarely accept  unsolicited ideas, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sticking With Their Own  </P> <P> "Besides, if they take outside ideas, they would have to pay the inventor  royalties," she said. "If one of their own comes up with a winner, all they  have to do is pay that person his regular salary."  </P> <P> Cardinale added: "You have to realize that a manufacturer puts a lot of money  behind the introduction of a new product. They're not going to take a risk on  an unproven concept."  </P> <P> So how does a novice game inventor get a game out on the market?  </P> <P> "Go out and pound the pavement," said Botwinick, the associate editor of  Playthings. "Go store to store in your neighborhood. You've got to start small.  Until you can prove that your product sells, you won't be able to get the  attention of the big game makers."  </P> <P> In addition, industry experts strongly urge aspiring game inventors to attend  toy fairs -- particularly the one sponsored by the Toy Manufacturers of America  -- where retailers and buyers come in droves, hoping to find next year's  best-seller.  </P> <P> "Essentially, if you want to get something to the American buyer, you have to  come to our show," Cardinale said. The group's show is the largest toy trade  fair in the United States -- second-largest in the world -- and attracts more  than 17,000 buyers and 1,100 exhibitors annually.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advertising Space on Board  </P> <P> Allison plans to attend TMA's toy fair as well as other exhibition shows but  said his planned "instant-distribution network" will allow him to worry less  about finding distributors at such fairs. He is trying to sell 16 game spaces  on his game board as ad slots for fishing equipment manufacturers.  </P> <P> "According to my plan, the manufacturer actually becomes part of the board  game," Allison said. "A player could land on a certain spot that actually  features a manufacturer's logo.  </P> <P> "Whoever buys advertising space will have a vested interest in having the game  do well. The manufacturer can sell the game to his established network of  dealers, along with his other products. Once I get manufacturers to advertise  on my game, I get an instant-distribution network."  </P> <P> Allison has contacted more than 300 fishing equipment manufacturers in hope of  landing their ads on his board. The inventor is charging $100,000 per game  space and has not yet signed any advertisers. But he emphasized that he and his  partners will put up $200,000 of their own money to pay for the game if the  "distribution network" idea fails.  </P> <P> About a year ago, Allison -- in a partnership he has since left -- started a  board game called Skaters Only for skateboarders, using the same  instant-distribution concept. Eight skateboard equipment manufacturers paid  $8,000 each to advertise on the board. The partnership declined to say how the  game is faring now.  </P> <P> Whether Allison will succeed this time remains uncertain, but "what he's trying  to do is certainly a very acceptable strategy," Carlat said.  </P> <P> More important, industry experts said Allison has the right "mental approach"  for the game-launching business.  </P> <P> "Sure, I would love to be a millionaire," Allison said. "But I'm not greedy.  Trying to develop a game is a game in itself. I'm having fun doing this."  </P></p>

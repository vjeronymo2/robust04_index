A request for a specific category of records will be regarded as fulfilling this requirement if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive of Office operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Wherever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the General Counsel determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, he will either advise the requester what additional information is needed to locate the record, or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. The General Counsel will also extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with Office personnel with the objective of reformulating the request in a manner which will meet the requirements of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Frankfurt - Other markets The key event for German equity markets next week is the opening of subscriptions for the near DM3bn rights issue from Daimler-Benz, the German automotive, engineering and aerospace group. It priced the issue 12 days ago at DM640 a share, a then 20 per cent discount to the existing share price of DM804.50, writes William Cochrane. Since then, notes Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Daimler has dropped to DM725, in line with a thoroughgoing correction in German cyclical stocks, and the discount has narrowed accordingly. The Daimler issue forms part of a projected equity raising total of DM24bn to DM25bn in the German markets this year, compared with DM15bn to DM16bn in 1993. However, says Mr Frahm, it is thought that major shareholders like Deutsche Bank, the government of Kuwait and Stella, a holding company owned by large German industrial and financial companies - owning an aggregate of 51 per cent of the Daimler equity - will take up their rights, easing the potential pressure on institutional investors. Strategists will also be looking, on Tuesday, at the latest M3 money supply figures.</p>

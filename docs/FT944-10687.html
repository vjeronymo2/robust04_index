			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich ends weak despite UBS rumours Rumours apart, bourses seemed to be waiting for America: for the US congressional mid-term elections yesterday, and for the FOMC decision on interest rates next week, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH was enlivened by a flurry of activity in UBS amid rumours, stirred by an Italian newspaper report, that the bank had settled its differences with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision investment trust. The SMI index, underpinned in early trade by UBS, subsequently turned back to finish 14.0 lower at 2,543.9. UBS bearers picked up SFr24 or 2.1 per cent to SFr1,183, off a high of SFr1,190, and the registered stock was SFr8 or 3.0 per cent ahead at SFr272, after a peak of SFr280, with the bank's refusal to comment on the rumour helping to fuel the speculation. BK Vision, which was said to have denied the rumour informally in the stock market, was marked SFr5 higher at SFr1,315. BK Vision owns 18 per cent of UBS registered shares and opposes the bank's plan to introduce a single, bearer share and scrap the registered stock. Analysts, who said that there had been rumours of a reconciliation for the last 10 days, dismissed speculation of a settlement of the dispute ahead of an extraordinary shareholders meeting on November 22. They said UBS looked set to win approval for its proposal at the meeting, although some thought this was likely to be the prelude to a protracted legal battle. FRANKFURT recovered some of Monday's losses, but the two big department store groups, Karstadt and Kaufhof, stayed weak as the Dax index rose 9.92 to 2,053.44 on the session, and inched higher to 2,056.36 at the end of afternoon Ibis trading. Karstadt fell DM18 to DM578 and Kaufhof DM101.10 to DM474.40, the most obvious manifestation of worries that German consumption is potentially weak, and that economic recovery is slowing. Mr Werner Wanke, who gave up his partnership at B Metzler in Frankfurt and set up his own consulting company there at the beginning of this year, said that Europe was only about a year out of recession, and that the extremely sharp rise in interest rates this year, so early in recovery, was likely to have a negative effect on the economic cycle. PARIS made a modest recovery, following a lead from the bond markets. The CAC-40 index gained 15.47 at 1,921.54 as turnover remained low at FFr3.2bn. Alcatel Alsthom suffered a sharp fall, down FFr14.30 to FFr447.60, on reports of problems at its German unit. The group had lost FFr11.10 on Monday after it was reported that France Telecom might make a claim of up to FFr400m in connection with over-pricing of equipment provided by another division. CarnaudMetalbox was unchanged at FFr188 after reporting a rise in nine-month sales. Hoare Govett, maintaining its buy recommendation on the stock, commented that the group had benefited recently from a recovery in its foreign markets, productivity gains and improved market share. The group, it added, had re-embarked on an acquisitions strategy in areas of strong growth potential - such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and China - and should see sales in emerging markets account for 16 per cent by 1998, compared with just 6 per cent in 1993. MILAN edged lower amid heavy trading in Credito Italiano and as attention turned to insurers as they began to count the cost of the floods in northwest Italy. The Comit index dipped 3.66 to 620.15. Credito Italiano picked up L44 to L1,596 in hefty volume of 44.8m shares, amid arbitrage trading between the ordinary shares and the rights, trading for the final day on the bourse. Bid speculation in other banks eased. Ambroveneto fell L147 to L4,411 on the conclusion that the BCI bid would fail. BCI firmed L6 to L3,508. Generali fell L375 to L37,450 and Toro was L259 lower at L22,650 as the insurance industry association said that the sector would suffer substantial, but not disastrous, losses from the recent floods. AMSTERDAM finished a lacklustre session barely changed, the AEX index slipping 0.87 to 407.69. KPN, the telecommunications company which was privatised in the summer, shed 10 cents to Fl 54.80 as James Capel issued a bullish report. The broker commented that with estimated eps growth of 17 per cent for 1995 and 1996, an estimated p/e ratio of 12 for 1994, representing a 4 per cent discount to the Dutch market, appeared to be unjustified. Hunter Douglas, the manufacturer of window coverings, went in the direction of the market, off 20 cents at Fl 78.20, after reporting a rise in nine-month sales and forecasting higher full-year profits. STOCKHOLM mounted what may be a fragile recovery, the Affarsvarlden General index rising 18.60 or 1.3 per cent to 1,445.80 on unconfirmed rumours of an opinion poll showing 'yes' voters in the lead ahead of Sunday's EU membership referendum. COPENHAGEN concentrated on Den Danske Bank, the commercial bank, following Monday's news that it was to acquire a controlling interest in Baltica, the country's largest insurer. The KFX-20 index dipped 0.70 to 91.57 in low turnover of DKr329m. Den Danske Bank was unchanged at DKr312, after a high of DKr318, while Baltica added DKr160 at DKr1,460. Novo Nordisk, which reports nine-month results today, lost DKr6 at DKr538.

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: EX-HOYA PLAYER ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGE  </P> <P> John Turner, a former Georgetown University basketball forward, has been  arrested on charges of possession of crack cocaine with the intent to  distribute.  </P> <P> Turner, along with four others, was arrested Monday at a recreation center in  Glenarden, Md., a Washington suburb, according to Maryland National Capital  Police.  </P> <P> Police said they believe Turner and his associates were planning to sell 51  grams of crack cocaine. Turner posted $30,000 bail and was released. If  convicted, he could face a 10-year prison sentence, officials said.  </P> <P> Turner's scholarship was not renewed by Georgetown, after Coach John Thompson  told a national television audience that he had learned Turner and freshman  Alonzo Mourning had been seen in the company of Rayful Edmond III, an alleged  drug dealer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Turner, who asked Georgetown University to review the nonrenewal of  his basketball scholarship, had been playing under a pseudonym in a non-NCAA  sanctioned summer league, his attorney confirmed.  </P> <P> "I'm sure everyone knows it's John Turner," attorney Sheila Albright told the  Washington Post.  </P> <P> Albright said she had been told of Turner's participation in the National  Basketball Assn. Say-No-To-Drugs Pro-Am League by Mary Robinson, Turner's  grandmother and legal guardian.  </P> <P> The league is not among the four Washington area summer leagues approved by the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn., according to the NCAA's legislative  services office.  </P> <P> NCAA rules state that any student-athlete who participates in a nonsanctioned  summer basketball league is ineligible for any further NCAA Division I or  Division II play. But an NCAA official told the Post that, under normal  circumstances, someone in violation of the rule would lose one game of  regular-season eligibility for every nonsanctioned summer league game played.  </P> <P> Turner is not enrolled at any college.  </P></p>

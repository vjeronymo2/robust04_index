			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: N Brown improves 22% to Pounds 19m N BROWN, the Manchester-based direct mail order group which specialises in clothing for older women, yesterday reported a 21.5 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits. For the 52 weeks to February 27 profits rose from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 19m, on turnover ahead 12 per cent to Pounds 170.8m (Pounds 152.6m). Earnings per share were 17.5 per cent higher at 17.74p (15.10p), and a final dividend of 5.06p makes a total of 7p (6p). Sir David Alliance, chairman, was pleased with the record results in a difficult year for the retail sector as a whole. 'Concentration on one of our long held beliefs, of improving service and value to customers, is paying off with strong evidence of established customers ordering more frequently,' he said. The core home shopping business increased sales by 13 per cent to Pounds 164.2m (Pounds 145.6m) including turnover of Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 1.2m) from Odhams, the mail order video, compact disc and children's learning packs company, acquired from the receiver in November 1991. Home shopping operating profits increased 13 per cent to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 20m). The previous figure was restated to include Pounds 939,000 of exceptional costs related to a warehouse reorganisation The operating margin was maintained at 13.8 (13.7) per cent despite only a small contribution to profits from Odhams. Pre-tax profits also benefited from a Pounds 522,000 exceptional profit on the sale of a stake acquired in a potential acquisition target, where a rise in the share price ultimately eliminated the opportunity. In addition, interest charges fell by 18.5 per cent to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 4.05m) mainly reflecting the lower cost of funds. Gearing at the end of February stood at 37 per cent (44 per cent). COMMENT Brown has built a solid reputation for recession busting on the back of its carefully targetted niche direct mail-order business focused primarily on selling clothes to older women. It claims 24 per cent of the Pounds 726m UK direct home shopping market which, unlike the larger agency business, has been growing quickly over the past decade. Demographics are working in the group's favour. However, it has also been actively reducing costs and improving customer service, for example, by consolidating five warehouses into a single unit and investing in computer technology - measures which are only just beginning their pay back. Aside from the Odhams acquisition it is also expanding its existing business. Of the turnover 15 per cent came from the three new catalogues launched in the past three years. The share price has risen in recent months, but with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 21m this year puting the shares on 18 times prospective earnings, the stock could still go higher.</p>

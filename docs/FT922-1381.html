			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Swedish bank in leadership change GOTA, Sweden's fourth-largest commercial bank, yesterday announced the appointment of a new president and chief executive from September 1. The move follows last week's announcement of a SKr13.5bn (Dollars 2.4bn) five-year financial insurance plan designed to stabilise the bank in the face of mounting financial troubles caused by credit losses this year estimated at around SKr4bn in 1992. Mr Per Lundberg, at present deputy chief executive of Investor, the investment company controlled by the Wallenberg family, will take charge of the bank. He will also take a leading position in the insurance giant Trygg-Hansa SPP, which is the dominant shareholder in Gota. Most of Mr Lundberg's business career has been within the Wallenberg empire. He began work with Stockholm's Enskilda Bank in 1969. After its emergence in 1972 as Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, he became head of company analysis and credit administration. From 1979 until last year, Mr Lundberg was chief executive of Providentia, the Wallenberg-controlled investment company that was recently merged with Investor. Mr Lundberg also sits on the boards of a number of the Wallenberg companies, including Atlas Copco and Saab Automobile. Mr Bjorn Sprangare, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa SPP, said Mr Lundberg's long experience with SEB and Providentia, as well as his work on the boards of industrial companies, made him well-qualified to lead Gota. Mr Lundberg replaces Mr Gabriel Urwitz who has been Gota's president and chief executive since 1989. In a statement, Mr Urwitz said it had been important to give Gota a stronger base for the future. Having achieved this goal, he added, it was the right moment for a change of leadership at the bank.</p>

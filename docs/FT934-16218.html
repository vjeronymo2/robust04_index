			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day pulls out of imports and distribution SHARES IN Amber Day Holdings fell by 14p to 56p after the controversial retailer said it was withdrawing from the import and distribution business and would concentrate on What Everyone Wants, its Glasgow-based discount retail chain. Mr Peter Carr, who took over as chairman in August after a boardroom split, also warned that the group's results for the year to July 31 - which will be reported in November - would be depressed by charges totalling not more than Pounds 8.5m. The bulk of this will relate to the disposal of the group's import and distribution business, which has offices in London and Sri Lanka. However, a substantial chunk will also go on compensation to former directors. A payment of Pounds 1.13m was made to Mr Philip Green, who stepped down as chairman and chief executive last September after the group reported a drop in last year's profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 7.5m. This year's results should also reveal how much compensation was paid to Mr Stacey Ellis, who stepped down as chairman in August, only seven months after he joined the group in an attempt to rebuild its credibility. The third element in the charges will be a further exceptional provision for the group's former men's wear division, which was sold during the previous financial year. This mainly covers write-downs on property and is in addition to the Pounds 5.99m exceptional charge which the group took when it sold the division last year. Mr Carr said: 'The board believes that it is important to take these measures now, recognising the need to clear the impositions of the past, in order to devote skills and resources to the core business of the group, What Everyone Wants.' Trading at What Everyone Wants in 1992-1993 continued satisfactorily, with the underlying trend of sales and profits ahead of the previous year, despite difficult trading conditions. However, the group warned that operating profit of the chain would show a small decline as a consequence, principally, of a non-recurring change in accounting method for stock mark-downs. 'The board is confident of the opportunity that exists in the British discount retail sector, as well as the growth potential of What Everyone Wants within it and a strategy for expansion is in the final stages of preparation.' Amber Day said it intended to recommend a final dividend which, taken with the interim of 1.1p, would 'form a base from which to grow the dividend in future years.'</p>

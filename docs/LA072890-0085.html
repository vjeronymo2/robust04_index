			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLEN RELUCTANTLY AGREES; ALZADO LIMPS FROM CAMP  </P> <P> Tailback Marcus Allen returned to the Raiders in silence Friday, and defensive  end Lyle Alzado departed with a knee injury, perhaps ending his comeback.  </P> <P> Apparently unable to meet his request to be traded, the Raiders and Allen  conditionally agreed on his return. He would earn the same $1.1 million he  earned last season in the final year of a three-year contract.  </P> <P> The possibility remains that the Raiders will trade him.  </P> <P> Allen would say only: "I have nothing to say. You guys never understand."  </P> <P> Allen did his best to avoid reporters who had staked out training camp. He  slipped into the Raider clubhouse through a back door Friday morning and then  went through a side door to take his physical examination.  </P> <P> What prompted Allen to end the stalemate after missing the first week of  training camp?  </P> <P> "You'll have to ask him that," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "That's not my  business. Every guy is an individual, and he has to make decisions as to what's  best for him. Marcus made a decision not to report, and he made a decision now  to come in for whatever reason. I don't want to get involved in that. I'm just  happy to have the guy here."  </P> <P> Allen infuriated Raider owner Al Davis by missing training camp last season in  an effort to have his contract renegotiated.  </P> <P> After Davis refused to give Allen a three-year extension, Allen relented,  returning a week before the regular season began.  </P> <P> When the Raiders acquired tailback Greg Bell from the Rams in an off-season,  Allen requested a trade to the Rams. But the Raiders were unable to make a  deal.  </P> <P> Asked whether Allen still wants a trade, Shell said: "I don't know that. You  have to ask Marcus that. . . . I'm not trying to hide anything, but I'm staying  away from that particular situation. Hopefully, the guy will still be a Raider.  That's what I want.  </P> <P> "If he demands to be traded, the organization will take a look at it. But we  will not trade a guy just to be trading a guy. We'll do what we feel is  necessary to help our football team."  </P> <P> Alzado underwent exploratory arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Attempting  to make a comeback at 41, Alzado had been held out of practice because of the  injury.  </P> <P> Shell, asked if this means the end of Alzado's comeback, said: "We don't look  at it that way. The doctors will let us know exactly what the damage is and how  long he'll be out. If he's a quick healer, it could be two weeks. It all  depends on how extensive the damage is."  </P> <P> Shell was reportedly instrumental in Allen's return.  </P> <P> "I just talked with him last night and told him we were happy to have him here,  and he said he was excited about it and was here to work," Shell said. "He said  he was going to do all he could to make this football team better, and I told  him that I'd never questioned that."  </P> <P> Although he has been hindered by injuries for the last four seasons, Allen, 30,  can still be productive, Shell said.  </P> <P> Allen's agent, Ed Hookstratten, agreed.  </P> <P> "Marcus is in the best physical condition of his football career," he said.  "His fractured wrist has healed. His speed is better than ever. It's just  unfortunate that he and Mr. Davis are not better friends."  </P> <P> Shell said: "He's always been an outstanding football player for us throughout  the years, and we look forward to having him back this year.  </P> <P> "The guy's an outstanding player. He's a leader by example. Guys respect him  wholeheartedly. He has the ability to catch the ball and run with it, and he's  an outstanding blocker. He adds a lot to our football team. It's going to make  our overall football team better."  </P> <P> Quarterback Jay Schroeder agreed, saying: "Marcus is a versatile player. He's a  gamer. When the big play needs to be made, he's the guy that can make it, and  that will be a big plus for us."  </P> <P> Allen has made a lot of big plays during his eight-year NFL career.  </P> <P> The 10th player selected in the 1982 draft, Allen was named the most valuable  player in Super Bowl XVIII after rushing for 191 yards in a 38-9 victory over  the Washington Redskins.  </P> <P> He won the NFL rushing title in 1985, gaining 1,759 yards, and was named the  NFL's most valuable player by the Associated Press, the Sporting News and the  Professional Football Writers Assn. But Allen's rushing totals declined in the  last four seasons because of injuries and the part-time presence of Bo Jackson.  Still, he has been voted the Raider MVP four times by his teammates.  </P> <P> Allen rushed for 759 yards in 1986 after injuring his ankle. Plagued by more  injuries, he gained 754 yards in 1987 and 831 yards in 1988.  </P> <P> He missed half of the 1989 season because of injury, rushing for a career-low  293 yards.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> When Marcus Allen signs, the Raiders will have five unsigned players --  quarterback Steve Beuerlein, fullback Steve Smith, defensive end Greg Townsend,  cornerback Mike Haynes and safety Vann McElroy. Townsend, who earned a reported  $475,000 last season, may be close to signing. "I'd be surprised if Greg didn't  make the trip to London," said Neil Allen, Townsend's agent. . . . The Raiders  will practice this morning, then break camp. They're scheduled to leave Sunday  for London, where they will open their exhibition season against the New  Orleans Saints on Aug. 5. They will return to Oxnard on Aug. 6 and resume  practice the next day. . . . Tailback Leon Perry, a ninth-round draft pick from  Oklahoma, was waived to make room for Allen.  </P></p>

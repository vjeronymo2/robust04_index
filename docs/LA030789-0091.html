			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENPEACE SCORES A POP 'BREAKTHROUGH' IN MOSCOW  </P> <P> They didn't look like Russians. Several wore bowler hats, two had their hair in  Rasta dreadlocks, and all looked distinctly Western, as only being in the  Soviet Union can make you look. But just who they were eluded most of the  Russian pedestrians going about their business in Red Square at 10 a.m. Monday  when rock stars like Annie Lennox of Eurythmics, Peter Gabriel, Chrissie Hynde  of the Pretenders, and Tom and Alannah Currie of the Thompson Twins -- in town  to launch an album to raise money for the international environmental group  Greenpeace -- went for a stroll.  </P> <P> What happened? "Nothing," admitted one organizer. Did anyone recognize them?  "Well a few looked."  </P> <P> Half an hour later, however, a dozen of the Western rockers found themselves  facing thousands of fans who had lined up from the early hours of the morning  for a chance to buy the album and have it autographed.  </P> <P> The album, launched under the name "Breakthrough" features music by 25 groups  and individuals who donated their music to help raise money for Greenpeace.  Other artists on the record include Sting, Bryan Ferry, the Grateful Dead,  INXS, Simple Minds, R.E.M., Sade and Dire Straits.  </P> <P> At one outlet of the state-run Melodiya record company only about a mile from  the Kremlin, about 3,000 fans, pushing for position, had already broken a  window before the musicians even arrived. All three of the Melodiya stores  where the guest artists were due to appear had sold out of the initial 2,800  albums they received well before closing.  </P> <P> In an unusual bit of promotion, viewers had been treated to a commercial  promoting the album on Soviet television for several days earlier. In addition,  stars like David Byrne of Talking Heads and U2's the Edge did interviews with  Soviet television and radio stations.  </P> <P> As rare as a TV commercial is in the Soviet Union, press conferences to launch  albums are even rarer. At Monday's "Breakthrough" press gathering, a spokesman  for the Soviet record pressing company, also called Melodiya, told reporters,  "Melodiya sells 120 million albums a year, but this is the first press  conference we're having."  </P> <P> Of the initial 500,000 albums from the promised 3 million records and 500,000  cassette tapes to be sold on behalf of Greenpeace here, 160,000 were released  to Melodiya outlets across the country Monday. Half of the expected earnings of  8.6 million rubles (about $13.9 million) from the sale of the double albums,  which are selling for 11 rubles (about $18), will be used to set up a  Greenpeace office in Moscow and Greenpeace environmental projects in the  U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> The other half will be donated to an independent Moscow-based, East-West  foundation called the International Foundation for the Survival and Development  of Humanity. That foundation was recently set up to promote international  scientific projects and public activities aimed at preventing nuclear war and  preserving the environment. According to Greenpeace the foundation's membership  includes some of the world's leading scientists, public servants and  philosophers concerned about the future of the planet.  </P> <P> One of the attractions of the album for Soviet youths is the chance to get  quality recordings from Western rock groups most of them have only heard of,  but never had the opportunity to buy their music. Because Melodiya has refused  to pay royalties to musicians and contract holders in the past, most Western  music has remained in the West. Occasionally, however, Melodiya has sold  pirated versions of Western music, most commonly old Beatles albums.  </P> <P> While musicians at Monday's press conference expressed delight at being part of  the Greenpeace cause, both Peter Gabriel and Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads  seemed surprised to see fans bringing copies of their albums to be signed.  Neither knew their albums had been released in the U.S.S.R. Said Gabriel: "I'm  sure my album has not been bootlegged. I'll be asking my record company about  it tomorrow."  </P> <P> In answer to reporters' questions about why they had donated their music to  Greenpeace, the pop stars said it was out of concern for the future. "I've just  had a new baby," said Alannah Currie of Thompson Twins, "and I'm afraid for  her." Gabriel and Karl Wallinger of World Party voiced the same concern for  their children.  </P> <P> Annie Lennox told reporters it was her first time in the Soviet Union, "and I'm  thrilled to be here. The fact we've been given the freedom to do what we want  while we've been here gives me a fantastic sense of progress for us. This is an  historical occasion."  </P> <P> Australian singer John Farnham said he asked kids in line at one of the stores  why they were lining up. "We're here to see Peter Gabriel," they answered. "How  long will you wait for him?" Farnham pressed. "As long as it takes," they  replied, in true Soviet style.  </P> <P> Though Greenpeace plans to open its office soon, it is currently working out of  space in Moscow's Academy of Sciences. The Greenpeace album will be released  elsewhere in the world April 24 under the name "Rainbow Warriors." It was  released first in the Soviet Union to "celebrate" Greenpeace's move into the  Soviet Union, officials said.  </P></p>

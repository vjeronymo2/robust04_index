			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government has refuted a report by some  newspapers that the Nigerian ambassador to the United States,  Alhaji Zubeiru Kazaure, has resigned. In a statement yesterday  in Abuja, the chief press secretary to the head of state, Mr.  David Attah, described the report as a false and mischievous  fabrication aimed at creating fear and insecurity in the minds  of the people. He described the purported copy of Alhaji  Zubeiru's resignation as a fraudulent forgery meant to cause  confusion. Mr. Attah stated that Alhaji Zubeiru himself had  written to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denying knowledge of  the purported letter of resignation being speculated by one Mr.  Akim Abiola. The chief press secretary warned those he  described as saboteurs and political mischief makers to desist  from acts capable of destabilizing the nation.</p>

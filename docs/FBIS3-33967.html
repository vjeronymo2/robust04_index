			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army Commander General Emile Lahhud has warned that  Israel might escalate its aggression on the south because of  what he called differences among Israeli officials on withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories.    In his monthly interview with the AL-JAYSH [Army] magazine,  Lahhud called on the Army to raise the level of its preparedness  to prevent Israel from using the south and local security  incidents to its advantage during peace negotiations.    He stressed that only just and comprehensive solutions can  bring about the kind of peace that protects dignity. He  remarked that solidarity between Lebanon and Syria is the  backbone of domestic stability.    Lahhud added that the Army has recently apprehended all  violators in the north and south and that investigations into  the Phalangist Party headquarters explosion have reached a  serious stage.</p>

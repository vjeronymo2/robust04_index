			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENMORE CANYON RESIDENTS ASK FOR FIRE CHIEF'S OUSTER  </P> <P> Saying the Glendale Fire Department sacrificed their neighborhood during a June  hillside blaze, Glenmore Canyon residents Wednesday urged the City Council to  oust the city's fire chief and compensate victims for uninsured losses.  </P> <P> In a letter hand-delivered to Glendale City Hall, Rob Sharkey, president of the  Glenmore Canyon Homeowners Assn., also asked the council to seek an independent  investigation of the manner in which the fire was fought. The association is  also seeking a council pledge that the city will provide equal fire protection  for all hillside homes.  </P> <P> Sharkey said the letter is based on five resolutions adopted recently by the  board of his association, which represents owners of about 200 houses.  </P> <P> "We've never gone to the City Council with any of these requests," he said. "We  hope they will be fair-minded and just. Failing to ask, nothing will happen.  This isn't a wish list. It represents the feelings of the fire victims. People  just don't feel safe at this point."  </P> <P> In Glenmore Canyon, 14 houses were destroyed and another six were damaged in  the June 27 fire. Residents have complained that their houses burned while they  waited two hours for firefighters to arrive.  </P> <P> Last summer, a coalition of Glendale homeowner associations asked the state's  fire marshal and attorney general to investigate the way firefighters fought  the blaze, which damaged or destroyed 64 homes in Glenmore Canyon and two other  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Both state officials rejected the plea, saying it was outside their  jurisdiction. Sharkey made the same request Oct. 30 to the California Joint  Senate-Assembly Committee on Police, Fire, Emergency and Disaster Services. But  committee members urged the association to pursue its grievances through local  channels.  </P> <P> Some residents have questioned whether Glendale officials can conduct an  impartial review of city firefighting policies, but Sharkey said his  association agreed to take its concerns to the local governing body.  </P> <P> In the Glendale Fire Department's own analysis, released Oct. 23, fire  officials acknowledged that Glenmore Canyon was "devoid of firefighting  resources for approximately two hours into the incident."  </P> <P> But Fire Chief John Montenero defended the strategy, saying it was necessary to  concentrate firefighting efforts in another neighborhood at the fire's eastern  edge to keep it from burning into Pasadena. Montenero said this tactic helped  save more than 700 houses, and he said he would use it again under similar  circumstances.  </P> <P> Montenero was on vacation and unavailable for comment Wednesday on the  association's call for his removal.  </P> <P> But Mayor Larry Zarian said Wednesday: "Overall, I'm satisfied with Chief  Montenero and his staff and their handling of firefighting in the city. I feel  the department is run very professionally."  </P> <P> However, he added that "if the question is, 'Are we perfect?' the answer is,  'No, we're not perfect.' Is there room for improvement? Absolutely."  </P> <P> Zarian said he had not read the association's letter Wednesday morning, but he  promised to review it with City Manager David Ramsay and other council members.  He said he may meet with Sharkey and other association members to discuss the  group's concerns.  </P> <P> The letter asserted that "Glenmore Canyon was sacrificed to the June 27th fire  without just cause" and that the Fire Department's own analysis of the blaze  was "replete with fallacies, omissions and contradictions."  </P> <P> It also asked the council to seek an independent investigation by the Los  Angeles County district attorney and the Los Angeles County Grand Jury  concerning the way the fire was fought.  </P> <P> The letter asked the council to respond within 15 days.  </P> <P> Sharkey said he is sending copies of the resolutions to 10 other Glendale  homeowner associations, seeking their support.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham from Washington] </F>   [Text] The Balkans, Albania, Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia], and the Cyprus issue were among the  topics on the U.S. agenda at the Pentagon meeting of Greek and  U.S. Defense Ministers Yerasimos Arsenis and William Perry.    According to reliable information, during the one-hour  meeting, the U.S. Pentagon mentioned:    a) The situation in the Balkans might remain fragile and  this  is why the U.S. side is examining the repercussions of possible  developments that will affect Skopje and Albania.    b) The U.S. Secretary of State made a lengthy reference to  the issue of Albania, leaving the impression that the U.S.  Government efforts to help that country include military  cooperation through the new Partnership for Peace doctrine.  Perry did not discuss the Greek minority rights issue, but  conveyed the broader view of the U.S. Government. He mentioned  that despite minor problems, Greece can and should help Albania  during this period. According to the same information, the  Greek delegation appeared willing to examine ways of  "tripartite" cooperation (Greece, United States, Albania) within  the greater framework of Partnership for Peace. In accordance  with a Greek proposal, this issue will be discussed extensively  during Perry's official visit to Athens on 19 July. It is noted  that during this period, Perry will have a clearly "Balkan tour"  and will visit Bucharest, Sofia, Skopje, Athens, Tirana, and  Sarajevo.    c) The U.S. military delegation was particularly insistent  on the issue of Skopje. The U.S. officials repeatedly expressed  their concerns about the recent border "incidents" between  Serbia and Skopje. Some international newspapers had played up  these incidents.    According to the same sources, a U.S. interlocutor at the  Pentagon expressed "his great concern" about "the fate" of the  U.S. peacekeeping force in Skopje "if something goes wrong."    d) The "traditional" reference to the Cyprus issue was made.  The Greek delegation proposed that an extensive discussion on  this issue as well as on the defense doctrine be conducted in  Athens in July.  <H5>  Larisa </H5>   The Greek side immediately expressed interest in active  participation in the Partnership for Peace, stressing that as a  strong Balkan country, Greece can play a particularly  constructive role in this effort, thus "upgrading" Greece's bid  to be the headquarters of "NATO's multinational swift  intervention force," which is being pursued by both Athens and  Ankara.    Following this, the defense minister preferred not to raise  at this meeting the issue of an air subheadquarters, preferring  to discuss the issue of a Larisa headquarters during his meeting  with Perry in Athens.    During a recess in this meeting, the Greek delegation raised  the issue of redistributing annuities from U.S. military aid to  Greece. The tremendous debt (6 billion dollars, 2 billion of  which are from taxes) is pressuring the Greek side. This is why  a proposal was made for a favorable way to "write off" the two  billion.  <H5>  On CNN </H5>   In an 8-minute interview on the U.S. network CNN, which was  relayed last night, the Greek defense minister supported the  Greek positions on the Greek-Turkish differences and the issue  of Skopje.</p>

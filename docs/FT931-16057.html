			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Ministers look at cuts in mortgage tax relief: System no longer 'sacrosanct' THE PROSPECTIVE surge in Britain's public borrowing has opened up a high-level debate within the government about the future of mortgage interest tax relief. As Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, studied the options for his March Budget at a meeting with Treasury colleagues yesterday, senior government insiders said the present tax regime for homeowners was no longer 'sacrosanct'. The chancellor's traditional talks at Chevening in Kent came as cabinet colleagues said an extension of value added tax and curbs in the allowances against income tax appeared inevitable in one of the two Budgets planned for 1993. But the ministers said Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has indicated he will take the pivotal role in budget planning, would be reluctant to risk stalling the economic recovery with large tax increases in March. Mr Major's aides are emphasising that he wants a 'Budget for industry' designed to underpin business confidence and investment. He will explore the options with his Downing Street policy advisers at a separate meeting this weekend at Chequers, his official country residence. Mortgage tax relief will cost the Treasury Pounds 5.2bn this year, down from more than Pounds 7bn in 1991-92. The saving reflects the sharp fall in interest rates and the bill will begin to rise again if interest rates move higher. Some of Mr Lamont's cabinet colleagues want him to consider a package combining more short-term help - particularly for first-time buyers - with a long-term programme to scale it down. At present, relief is given at the basic income tax rate of 25 per cent on interest paid on the first Pounds 30,000 principal of a mortgage. One suggestion is that the tax concession should be 'front-loaded' to help people with their first house purchase but it would then be 'capped' after they had established a foothold in the housing market. Advocates in the government of the reform believe public attitudes have changed sufficiently to allow a gradual shift towards abolition without raising a political storm. Labour would find it difficult to oppose such a move. The Conservatives pledged in last year's election manifesto that: 'We will maintain mortgage tax relief.' However no specific commitment was given as to the level or the distribution. The change now being floated would deliver little or nothing in the way of immediate savings since it would be impossible to change the regime for those with existing mortgages. But it would signal to financial markets that the government was committed over the medium term to raising additional revenue and cutting borrowing. It would also dovetail with ministerial concern that the government should do more to stimulate the rented housing sector. More broadly, the chancellor is under intense pressure from within the Treasury to raise taxation in March or in the second Budget, which is planned for December. Officials are sceptical about Mr Major's public optimism that most of the borrowing requirement will melt away with economic recovery. They expect the deficit for the financial year beginning in April to approach Pounds 50bn. The Treasury is concerned that sterling will remain dangerously vulnerable unless the government is seen to be ready to take hard decisions about taxation and spending. Despite the obvious political objections, Mr Lamont is ready to consider extending VAT to newspapers and books, public transport, domestic fuel, new construction and, most controversially, to food. Ministers stress that any move in that direction would be gradual. Major sets sights on new political agenda, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 8 Lex, Page 24</p>

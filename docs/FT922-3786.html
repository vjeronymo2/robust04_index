			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cost control gives lift to GWR Steady sales growth and control of costs helped GWR Group, the independent radio contractor, boost interim profits to Pounds 253,984 pre-tax. The outcome of this USM-quoted group for the six months to end-March compared with just Pounds 32,509 last time and was achieved on turnover marginally ahead at Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 3.36m). National and local advertising improved 15 per cent and 12 per cent respectively over the previous, albeit depressed, half year reflecting, according to Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, listening figures ahead by 15.8 per cent. Despite acquiring a 17 per cent stake in Classic FM, the first national commercial classical music station which is due to be launched in the autumn, and stakes in Minster Sound in York and Spire FM in Salisbury for a total consideration in excess of Pounds 1m, gearing remains low at 15 per cent. The interim dividend jumps from 1p to 3p, payable from earnings of 5.7p (0.7p) per share.</p>

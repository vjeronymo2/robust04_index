			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] On 7 June as part of its series of consultations  with new provisional government officials, the upper chamber's  unofficial office heard attorney Louis B. Toussaint, justice  minister in the provisional government. Toussaint assured the  audience that restoring government authority, reforming justice,  and reducing the cost of living will be Justice Ministry  priorities and discussed the Ministry's meager resources at the  current juncture. [passage omitted]    "Senator Romel Manigat, president of the upper chamber's  justice commission, painted his own picture of the Haitian  justice system in a five-page address in French, saying he  believes it is on crutches and even paralyzed. He pointed an  accusing finger at judges he claims are selling justice at  will." [passage omitted]    "Toussaint thanked the president of the unofficial Senate  office. He did not refrain from turning the pages of Haitian  history, saying that the country is currently passing through  the gravest moments in its history. The minister summarized  four points on which they should work so that the justice  department can function properly and that legal order can be  restored." [passage omitted]    "We will work to reform Haiti's judicial system even though  the task will not be easy, Toussaint said as Senator Yves  Rousseau was taking a nap in his seat. Senator Dupiton had a  quiet laugh when Toussaint said that the one who asked for  10,000 people instead of 7,000 people to enter Haiti within the  scope of the UN Mission in Haiti should be arrested. The  Ministry he leads lists as its priorities: salaries, the cost of  living, economic stabilization, and the restoration of  government authority. Unfortunately, they may be biting off  more than they can chew. It is a provisional government, not a  definitive government."</p>

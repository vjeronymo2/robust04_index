			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart G_Determinations and Actions Taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.41  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is revised to conform the cross-references to amended &sect;210.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(1)(i) is revised to establish new time frames in which the initial determination on violation must be filed. If the target date for completing the permanent relief phase of the investigation is set at 15 months or less, the initial determination is to be filed three months before the target date. If the target date is more than 15 months, the initial determination is to be filed four months before the target date. (The procedure for establishing the target date is found in &sect;210.51, discussed below.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (b) and (c) are revised to reflect the amendment of &sect;210.70 to include the return as well as possible forfeiture of a complainant's temporary relief bond. Paragraph (c) is further revised to include initial determinations that may be issued in two new situations: in granting a motion for forfeiture or return of respondents' bonds pursuant to &sect;210.50(d) and in granting a motion to set a target date exceeding 15 months from the date of institution pursuant to &sect;210.51(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(3) is revised to give initial determinations issued pursuant to &sect;210.50(d)(3) the same status as those issued pursuant to &sect;210.70(c). The effect of the exception expressed in this paragraph is to give a 45-day effective date rather than a 30-day effective date to initial determinations granting motions for forfeiture or return of either complainants' or respondents' bonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.43  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs (a)(1) and (d) are revised to refer to initial determinations issued under new &sect;210.50(d) and to put these initial determinations on the same footing as those issued under &sect;210.70(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.49  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) is revised to conform the cross-references to amended &sect;210.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(3) is revised to implement the specific statutory direction that the Commission determine the amount of a respondent's bond ``sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury.'' 19 U.S.C. 1337(e) and (j)(3). The Commission expects to construe this direction on a case-by-case basis. Language referring to past Commission practice in determining the amount of a respondent's bond has been deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2) is revised to conform the cross-references to amended &sect;210.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) is new and implements the statutory limitations on issuance of a general exclusion order found in 19 U.S.C. 1337(d)(2). These limitations are consonant with past Commission practice as articulated in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certain Airless Paint Spray Pumps and Components Thereof,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Inv. No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;90 (USITC Pub. 1199, Nov. 1981) and cases following it. The Commission expects the law in this area to continue to develop on a case-by-case basis in view of the new statutory language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) is new and implements the statutory requirement that the Commission prescribe terms and conditions under which bonds may be forfeited. 19 U.S.C. 1337(e)(4) and (j)(3). The terms of this rule are essentially similar to those in &sect;210.70 relating to the forfeiture or return of a complainant's temporary relief bond. Both rules implement the Congressional mandate that the Commission be guided by practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with respect to forfeiture of a complainant's bond. H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 142 (1994). Although Federal Rule 65 literally applies to bonding by the proponent of temporary relief, its underlying rationale is equally applicable to respondents' bonds in section 337 investigations. ``Practice under Rule 65'' includes all sources of authority pertaining to Rule 65 that are generally relied on in the practice of law, including (but not limited to) judicial decisions and notes of the advisory committee on rules. Treatises and commentary also may be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

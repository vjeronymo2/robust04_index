Control Cost Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Overview.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA estimates the total combined annual social cost of control of the 1991 NSPS and today's proposed standards to be about $200 million per year, and the overall national average cost per unit of waste combusted would be about $13.50/Mg. For perspective, typical costs incurred in 1990 by the general public for the collection, transportation, and combustion of MSW and ash disposal ranged from $22/Mg to over $145/Mg of MSW, averaging about $90/Mg. Additionally, the EPA estimates the capital cost of control in the first 5 years of application of the 1991 NSPS and today's proposal to be $769 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Control Costs for Typical MWC Plants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The previous section presented costs of the proposal on a national basis. This section presents examples of typical costs that would be experienced at both a large MWC plant and a small MWC plant. These are typical costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costing data presented in this section are provided in the following formats: capital cost, annualized cost, and cost per Mg of municipal waste combusted. The costing information is subcategorized by air pollution control components (i.e., acid gas scrubber, activated carbon injection application, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control). For perspective, the estimated cost of combustion units (which includes the cost of GCP) is also displayed. This costing information has been derived from 1989 background information documents that were used in developing the 1991 NSPS (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for more information about these documents), and is presented in 1987 dollars (the escalation factor for converting to mid-1990 dollars is 1.111).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From table 3A, it can be noted that the capital cost for control at a new large MWC plant (730 Mg/day capacity) would be about $14.2 million of which $12.0 million would be for the acid gas control, 2.0 million for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control, and less than one million for activated carbon injection. On an annualized basis, the cost would be about $4.2 million/yr or about $17.50/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase baseline combustor cost from about $60/Mg combusted to about $77/Mg combusted. Large MWC plants represent about 95 percent of MWC combustion capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a new small MWC plant (90 Mg/day capacity), table 3A shows a capital cost for control of about $3.14 million of which $3.1 million would be for the acid gas control system and the remaining for activated carbon injection. On an annualized basis, the cost would be about $920,000/yr or about $31/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase baseline combustor cost from about $60/Mg combusted to about $91/Mg combusted. Small MWC plants represent about 5 percent of MWC combustion capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following provides a discussion of the total economic impacts (e.g., household, community, and business impacts) of the proposed and 1991 NSPS over a pre-1989 baseline. As discussed in sections III.A.4 and III.B.4 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this preamble, the proposed subpart Eb standards would have a small incremental national average cost per unit of waste combusted ($1.95/Mg) as compared to the combined impact of the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS and the proposed subpart Eb NSPS ($13.50/Mg). Since the proposed NSPS is based on the same technologies as the 1991 NSPS, and since the 1991 NSPS has been effective for 3 years, the impacts presented below provide a useful account of the total economic impacts of the NSPS, based on both the 1991 and proposed NSPS. In estimating the economic impacts, the EPA assumed that all new MWC's would have been built with no more emission control than that mandated by regulations promulgated before 1991, specifically, 40 CFR part 60, subparts E and Db. This pre-1991 situation represents the baseline for estimating regulatory costs; therefore, all cost estimates provided are the full costs above this baseline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

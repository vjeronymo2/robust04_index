			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Negotiators trying to head off a television actors' strike resumed work Monday  following a 22-hour weekend session. "They worked very, very hard," said Dick  Moore, spokesman for the American Federation of Radio and Television Artists.  "There is obviously a desire on everyone's part to get this thing behind us."  The talks at CBS headquarters in New York began at 9 a.m. Saturday and  continued through Sunday morning, Moore said. "There was some progress, but the  negotiations are not concluded." An agreement between AFTRA and the television  networks prevents him from providing progress reports on specific issues. Some  37 different contracts are being hammered out. AFTRA contracts expired Nov. 15,  but work is continuing under a day-to-day agreement. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Summer sales help cut inflation AN UNUSUALLY early start to the summer sales helped push the inflation rate down to 1.2 per cent - its lowest level for nearly three decades. The retail prices index dropped 0.1 per cent in June to 141.0. The Central Statistical Office said price cuts were most pronounced in household goods, clothing and footwear. Sale offers on a range of furniture and electrical appliances caused a 0.6 per cent month-on-month fall in the price of household goods. Clothing and footwear prices registered the sharpest June fall since 1952 at 0.9 per cent. Most vegetables were cheaper, and plentiful supplies of fresh fruit helped keep price rises at bay. Seasonal food prices dropped 4.6 per cent on the previous month, the sharpest June fall since 1987. Special offers on aftershave, condoms and spectacles pushed the price index for personal goods and services down. Prices fell by 0.3 per cent compared with the previous month. Reductions in the cost of local cheap-rate telephone calls caused a 0.8 per cent drop in the prices of household services in June. Price increases for second-hand cars and petrol have moved against the downward trend, with sharper increases than a year ago. Motoring costs rose 1.1 per cent over the month, and were 4.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Mortgage rates held steady compared with a small fall in June last year. The last time inflation was 1.2 per cent was in February 1964. It was last lower in July 1963 when prices rose by 0.8 per cent year-on-year. International comparisons show that only Denmark and the Irish Republic have lower inflation rates than the UK. It is lower than the EC average of 3.3 per cent and the G7 average of 2.7 per cent. The bringing forward of the summer sales to June may mean that the inflation figures for July will be less encouraging, since prices will be compared against extremely sharp reductions in July last year. British Telecommunications' special offer on cheap-rate local calls also ends in July. Nonetheless, prices for seasonal food usually fall sharply in July and continuing summer sales will help keep down prices for clothing, footwear and household goods. Most economists are confident that underlying inflation will remain within the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent for the rest of this year. Underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - was 2.8 per cent in the year to June, unchanged on the previous month.  ------------------------------------------- INFLATION REFLECTS HIGH STREET PRICE CUTS  ------------------------------------------- UK inflation rate (+1.2 per cent)  -------------------------------------------                               per cent  ------------------------------------------- Housing (164)                 -6.6 Motoring (136)                +4.7 Food (non-seasonal) (123)     +2.8 Alcohlic drink (78)           +4.5 Household goods (79)          +1.0 Clothing &amp; footwear (58)      -0.1 Household services (47)       +3.0 Leisure goods (46)            +1.6 Catering (45)                 +5.3 Fuel &amp; light (46)             -2.0 Personal goods, serv.

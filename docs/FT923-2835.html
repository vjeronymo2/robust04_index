			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Coal directors win appeals TWO directors of a coal company who were jailed for five years for a Pounds 2.7m fraud on lending institutions have been cleared by the Court of Appeal. Mr Alexander Moffat, said to have organised a scheme to gain financial backing dishonestly for an open-cast mining operation in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, left the court in London after seven deception convictions against him were quashed by the appeal judges. His partner in Balmoral Coal Group, Mr Henry McCaffer, was cleared of the same charges but lost his appeal against conviction on two further counts of deception. His jail term was cut to two years.</p>

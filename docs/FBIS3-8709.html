			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Osmancevic from Tuzla] </F>   [Text] The first plane landed at Tuzla airport today after  almost two years of waiting. The wheels of the plane bearing UN  insignia touched down on the runway of the Dubrave airport this  morning, or, to be more precise, at 1145. The landing of the  first plane at Tuzla airport passed without any incidents.  General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, was in the plane, as were  some of the staff who will take care of the delivery of  humanitarian aid to this region in the future.    As we have found out from sources close to UNPROFOR, over  the  next few days some of the equipment necessary for navigation and  fire prevention is expected to arrive at Tuzla airport.    In a way, the landing of the first plane bearing UN insignia  marks the fact that Tuzla airport has started functioning. As  for the official opening, that will depend on the political  decisions made at the level of the United Nations.</p>

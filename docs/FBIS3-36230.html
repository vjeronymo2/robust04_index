Belgium is well aware of the destruction caused by the  dispute in Daghlyk Karabakh and laments that state of affairs.  In parallel with our president's tasks as the chairman of the  European Union [EU] Committee, my country is making a diplomatic  effort within the CSCE Minsk Group's framework to contribute  toward the finding of a just solution to that dispute. Any  decision for the solution of the problem must be in accordance  with CSCE principles and provide for the maintenance of  international borders and the protection of the rights of ethnic  minorities.    Disturbed by the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees,  who are in serious condition, Belgium and its EU partners have  recently decided to increase their humanitarian aid to that  region.    Meanwhile, I am convinced that mutual cooperation between  Belgium and Azerbaijan can be successfully improved. The  Belgian Government is prepared to cooperate with you on that  matter.    Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to convey my  respects to you once again.</p>

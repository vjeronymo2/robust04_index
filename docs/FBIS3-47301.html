			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Han Sung-su, ROK ambassador to the United </F> States, by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk in  Washington; date not given]    [Text] [Chin] What is your assessment of the current  relations between the ROK and the United States?    [Han] The top leaders of the two countries have consolidated  their friendship through the two rounds of ROK-U.S. summit talks  last year. The United States assesses the ROK quite positively  because of its political and economic reform and opening-up  policy, and relations between the two countries are now smoother  than ever.    Both the ROK and the United States have had difficulty  because of the nuclear issue, but they have maintained firm  mutual cooperation on the issue. In conclusion, I do not think  we will have any problem in relations with the United States in  the new year.    [Chin] How will ROK-U.S. relations develop in the new year?    [Han] Because the United States is likely to strengthen its  economic diplomacy with China and Japan in the new year, we need  to do our best to prevent this from exerting negative influence  upon our country.    In its trade with the United States, Japan keeps the balance  of $50 billion in the black a year. Due to its continued  economic slump, however, Japan cannot easily find an effective  way to avoid its trade imbalance. Accordingly, economic  diplomacy between the United States and Japan will undergo  vicissitudes this year.    When the United States agreed to extend the term of the  most-favored-nation treatment for China last year, it added a  provision that China improve its human rights situation. This  is likely to become the point at issue in relations between the  two countries this year.    The United States seems to be determining that there has  been  no considerable improvement in human rights in China.  Accordingly, I think, the United States and China will go into  a dispute over the extension of the term of the  most-favored-nation treatment for China this year.    Among the three Northeast Asian countries, the ROK is the  only country that maintains a trade balance with the United  States. Therefore, the ROK will have no economic friction  [kyongje machal] with the United States. As it is possible,  however, that the U.S. approach toward China and Japan will  affect us any way, we have to prevent its negative affect.    [Chin] What do you think are our prospects for trade with  the United States this year?    [Han] The ROK registered negative growth in its exports to  the United States in 1991 and 1992. Owing to the rehabilitation  of the U.S. economy to a certain degree, the growth of ROK  exports to the United States for 1993 was up 1 percent from  1992. As the U.S. economy is expected to progress more  favorably this year, I will make efforts to increase our trade  with it.    Particularly, it is important to induce the ultramodern U.S.  industries to advance into China and Japan with the ROK as a  stepping-stone.    [Chin] What is our diplomatic policy toward the United  States for the future?    [Han] The ROK diplomacy with the United States was somewhat  subordinate to the Japan-oriented diplomacy of the United States  in the past.    The ROK should now abandon its position as a subordinate  variable of U.S.-Japanese diplomatic relations and establish its  independent relationship with the United States.    The ROK has already become a country that the United States  needs politically, militarily, and economically. By  strengthening this position, the ROK is now developing  independent relations with the United States.    Thus, the ROK should discard its government-oriented  diplomacy and develop a ranging diplomacy involving the  parliament and academic, press, and business circles.</p>

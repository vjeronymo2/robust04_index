			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S BART SIMPSON: KINDER, GENTLER, CUTER;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE ANIMATED ADVENTURES OF 'TINY MISS MARUKO' HAVE TOPPED THE  RATINGS AND SPAWNED A 'SIMPSONS'-STYLE MERCHANDISING BLITZ.  </P> <P> Does this script sound familiar?  </P> <P> The surprise TV hit of the year is a wacky little cartoon show about a funny,  middle-class family. The family becomes a national pop-culture phenomenon.  Posters, T-shirts and other commercial spinoffs pop up everywhere. After a long  battle, the cartoon drama catches the long-running No. 1 show to become the  nation's top-rated prime-time program.  </P> <P> That scenario is being played out on both sides of the Pacific this fall as the  great good fortune of "The Simpsons" is matched here by a spectacularly  successful cartoon show called "Chibi Maruko-chan," the mega-hit of the season  on Japanese television.  </P> <P> At that point, however, all similarities between the Simpson household and the  Sakura family featured in "Chibi Maruko-chan" come to an end.  </P> <P> Where the cartoon Simpsons are sour and cynical, the cartoon Sakuras are sugary  sweet. Where the Simpsons mock traditional values, the Sakuras glory in them.  If Bart Simpson ever met Maruko Sakura, the round-faced third-grader who is the  star of the Japanese cartoon, he would get off a few rude cracks about her  serrated bangs and pink cheeks, and she would dissolve into embarrassed  blushes.  </P> <P> The ascent of "Chibi Maruko-chan" -- it translates to "Tiny Miss Maruko" -- to  the top of the heap in the hugely competitive ratings war here reveals a basic  secret about Japan. This mighty economic powerhouse, home of samurai and sumo,  is hopelessly addicted to cute.  </P> <P> While "Chibi Maruko-chan" concerns the daily to and fro of a 9-year-old -- also  her friends in the third grade, her sixth-grade sister, her parents and  grandparents -- it is just as popular among adults as it is with elementary  schoolkids, according to the ratings firm Video Research.  </P> <P> When four 20ish women, all reading Chibi Maruko-chan comic books in a downtown  Tokyo restaurant, were asked the other day to explain their passion for the  cartoon, they replied nearly in unison: "Kawa-iiiiii." In English, that would  be "cuuuuuuute."  </P> <P> Advertisers, consequently, are using the cartoon show to sell everything from  Barbie-like dolls aimed at preteens to credit cards and cordless phones for  young executives. Part of the program's success stems from its theme song,  "Odoru Ponpokorin," an infectious ditty along the lines of "Zip a Dee Doo Dah."  Released as a record (with Maruko's picture on the jacket, of course), it has  become the third-biggest-selling single in Japanese history.  </P> <P> The tune is ubiquitous here; it is by far the most popular choice in the  karaoke, or sing-along, bars where "office ladies" and "salarymen" congregate  after work.  </P> <P> In addition to the record, "Chibi Maruko-chan" has spawned a massive spinoff  industry.  </P> <P> Sales of the six bound volumes of the comic book featuring Tiny Miss Maruko  have gone through the roof. Every store in Japan seems to have set aside a  special section for Chibi Maruko-chan plates, pennants, calendars, ashtrays,  aprons, candy, games, etc. The Tokyo public prosecutor last week held a press  conference to announce a raid on a gangster's warehouse full of non-licensed  Chibi Maruko-chan T-shirts and awnings.  </P> <P> The fervor comes to a head each Sunday at 6 p.m., when millions of households  tune in to the Fuji Television network for Maruko's weekly adventure.  </P> <P> Part of the appeal seems to be that each episode revolves around utterly  familiar aspects of Japanese school and family life. The audience sees  earthquake evacuation drills, teacher visits to the home, students sweeping the  floors in school, family discussions about how to spend the father's biannual  bonus and trips to view the spring cherry blossoms and the autumn leaves.  </P> <P> All of this is draped in a thick haze of sentimentality. The days don't always  go perfectly for Tiny Miss Maruko, but things always work out to a happy  ending, with the star cuddling up to sleep in her father's lap or running off  happily with her friends.  </P></p>

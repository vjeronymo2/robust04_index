			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Why it pays to bank by mail - Postal accounts can offer higher rates CHEQUES are always in the post for those who operate their savings account through the Royal Mail. Postal accounts are attractive to savers because they have maintained their competitive edge over branch-based accounts; hence their regular appearance in our Highest Rates for your Money table (see page VI). The building societies cite centralised administration and low overheads as the reasons for being able to pay rates on instant notice postal accounts which often are higher than on 90-day notice accounts. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society was the first in the market and its London Share postal account, launched in April 1989, has spawned a whole breed of others (as the table on this page shows). The rate on London Share is, however, one of the lowest; C &amp; G says this is because it has added facilities - at the request of clients - which have made it more expensive to operate. Customers can arrange withdrawals over the telephone, and can order travellers cheques. They can also use the branch network to make deposits. 'London Share has become less competitive because of increased overheads and so we cannot give rates which are as high as on a conventional postal account,' C &amp; G explains. The more traditional postal accounts issue customers with a passbook, or with slips which are used to make deposits and withdrawals in pre-paid envelopes. Most postal accounts pay yearly interest but some also have a monthly option (as the table shows). Yorkshire is unusual in paying interest monthly as a standard feature. While postal accounts advertised as 'instant access' do not require notice, it still takes customers at least a week to get their hands on any cash. If you mail a withdrawal request on a Monday, you could not hope to get a cheque before Wednesday at the very earliest. It would then take at least three working days for it to clear. So, usually, you would not be able to draw any cash until the following Monday. Two societies, however, have got around this problem by providing their customers with cash withdrawal cards. Chelsea's Classic account also has a chequebook facility and its cash card, which can be used to withdraw up to Pounds 200 daily through the Link network, also doubles as a cheque guarantee card. Nationwide is the only one of the big five building societies to have entered the market and launched its Investdirect account in April. Customers can withdraw a maximum Pounds 250 daily with their Link card. They must, however, pay 50p each time if they use a Nationwide machine and Pounds 1 if they use another Link member's machine. Nationwide says it imposed the charge because the account is meant to be postal, with the card supplied only for peace of mind. Some postal accounts impose relatively high minima. C &amp; G's Instant 7 account, launched in May to replace the (non-postal) London Deposit account, is a seven-day notice account which stipulates that transactions must be at least Pounds 250, whether as a deposit or withdrawal. The minimum withdrawal with the Yorkshire building society's First Class return postal service, also launched in the spring, is Pounds 200. You need Pounds 2,000 to open the account and further deposits must be at least Pounds 100. Along with Manchester, the Yorkshire offers a bonus, of 10 per cent of the gross rate to investors who do not make capital withdrawals during the year. This means that the top rate of 7.25 per cent would be translated into 7.98 per cent once the bonus is added. The bonus at Manchester is 0.75 per cent, which increases its top rate from 7.5 to 8.25 per cent cent if no withdrawals are made. The table also shows that some societies - Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West, C &amp; G and North of England - operate postal accounts which also require investors to give notice of withdrawals. The rate offered by Bradford &amp; Bingley on its Direct Notice (30-day) account is the highest (if the bonus rates of Yorkshire and Manchester are not applied), while B &amp; W's 7.6 per cent on its 30-day Balmoral Monthly is also the highest for accounts of this type, with the same proviso. The only society to offer a postal bond is B &amp; W, which has operated a series of them and is today launching a one-year, variable rate bond paying tiered interest of 7.35 per cent gross on a Pounds 5,000 minimum, ranging up to 8.5 per cent gross for Pounds 100,000 and over. The trouble with variable rate bonds is the danger of the initially attractive rate being dropped before maturity. 'Societies that do that are just cutting off their nose to spite their face,' says B &amp; W. 'We are committed to maintaining a competitive rate in order to keep customers.' Perhaps the only serious drawback of postal accounts is their reliance on the Royal Mail. The Inland Revenue recommends taxpayers not to use the postal system to settle their tax bills because of the danger of cheques getting stolen in the post. The societies deny there are any significant problems - but most advise savers sending a deposit to make the cheque payable to the building society, followed by their own name.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BUILDING SOCIETY POSTAL ACCOUNTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Building society/account                  Gross rate paid (Pounds)                                     ----------------------------------                                      1,000    2,500    5,000   10,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires/First Class      6.75     6.75     6.75     7.00 (Monthly)                            (6.27)   (6.27)   (6.27)   (6.50)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bradford &amp;

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Galerias seeks protection Galerias Preciados, Spain's second biggest department store chain which was formerly owned by the UK's Mountleigh property group, applied for protection from its creditors over the weekend, citing liabilities of Pta64.3bn (Dollars 491m). A decision to place Galerias in receivership would be likely to lead to its break-up and the dispersal of the chain's 29-strong nationwide network of prime site stores, five of them in Madrid, among domestic and foreign buyers. Marks &amp; Spencer of the UK, which already operates five stores in Spain and plans to open a further 10, said last month that it was in talks with Galerias with a view to taking over some of its properties. Among the retail chain's chief creditors are suppliers, which are owed some Pta28bn, and its chief financial backers, Lloyds Bank, Citibank and Barclays, which are understood to be calling in bank loans totalling an estimated Pta18bn. Galerias, which has more than 7,000 employees, was acquired from Mountleigh by a group of Spanish investors for Pta21.2bn two years ago. This year, the company's turnover is forecast to drop from Pta80bn to Pta72bn and its losses are likely to be in the region of Pta10bn. Weakened by a succession of owners in the past 15 years, Galerias was part of the controversial Rumasa private holding of financier Jose Maria Ruiz Mateos between 1981 and 1983. It was bought by Venezuela's Cisneros group in 1984 after the government expropriated Rumasa to avert the holding's bankruptcy and sold it to Mountleigh in 1987 for Pta30bn.</p>

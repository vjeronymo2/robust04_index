			<p>BFN     [Text] On 4 April, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Dr. Luis  Maria Ramirez Boettner confirmed the government will officially  receive Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who announced  his visit to our country as part of his South American tour that  also includes Uruguay, Peru, and Argentina.    Ramirez Boettner made it clear that he personally will be  unable to receive the Cuban foreign minister because it  coincides with a scheduled visit to Morocco (Africa) where he  will sign a final document on the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.  The Paraguayan foreign minister added: "It is not that we will  not receive him. It is just that it coincides with my visit to  Morocco. Therefore, Vice Foreign Minister Cabello Sarubbi will  be in charge of taking care of him."    Robaina, who is now in Montevideo, said: "The purpose of my  visit to South American countries is to explain Cuba's current  situation to the presidents and announce the opening of our  markets to foreign capital, which will not be limited," in an  effort to overcome the island's delicate economic situation.    The Cuban foreign minister held three official activities in  Uruguay on 4 April. Robaina met 30 minutes with Uruguayan  President Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera, paid tribute to  Uruguayan hero Jose Gervasio Artigas, who was exiled to and died  in our country, and met congressmen from the three Uruguayan  political parties (Blanco, Colorado, and Broad Front). Foreign  Minister Robaina's duties include reviewing a way in which Cuba  might settle a $33 million debt to Uruguay. This point will be  discussed when he meets Central Bank President Enrique Braga.    Cuban ambassador Manuel Aguilera de la Paz, who began his  duties on 18 March, told journalists: "We are not in a position  to pay at this time, but we are actually willing to find new  ways of contributing to finding a solution to begin paying this  debt."    The Cuban foreign minister said the invitation to invest in  his country has been prompted by the new economic measures  promoted by Cuban President Fidel Castro's regime. Robaina  emphasized: "We have no limitations on the reception of capital.  No one has been excluded." He added that tourism, oil, nickel,  citrus, and agriculture in general are the most attractive areas  for foreign investment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement No. 2 of the Appeal Court for Information </F> Disputes under the Russian Federation President Concerning the  Publication of So-Called `Scenario No. 1' in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA"  -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA headline]    [Text] On 19 March, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA published the  so-called "Scenario No. 1" concerning an alleged coup d'etat in  preparation. The document caused public excitement and prompted  a torrent of articles in the newspapers, broadcast reports, and  also statements by officials. The Russian Federation Committee  for the Press officially warned OBSHCHAYA GAZETA (founder and  chief editor Ye.V. Yakovlev) that "its actions are perceived as  a deliberate step aimed at destabilizing society and undermining  constitutional authority."    The Appeal Court has started receiving requests from  citizens  and the media asking it to speak out on the publication of  so-called "Scenario No. 1" in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA and assess  whether it was, on the one hand, freedom of expression or, on  the other hand, an abuse of mass media freedom.    The Appeal Court examined the case of the publication of  "Scenario No. 1" by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA and the subsequent items in  various publications and statements by officials and saw fit to  make the following statement:    OBSHCHAYA GAZETA had rather substantial grounds for  publishing "Scenario No. 1" of an alleged coup d'etat in  preparation. The promulgation of this material was preceded by  a statement by a number of well-known politicians concerning the  threat of a "palace coup," to the effect that "signs of a coup  are already in evidence" and that "analytical memoranda are  circulating and various coup scenarios are being discussed."  All this was causing agitation in society and giving rise to  rumors and conjecture. It was in these conditions of social  tension that the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board decided to  publish "Scenario No. 1." The subsequent reaction shows that it  did not destabilize society, but defused the political  situation. Even supposing that actions were actually being  prepared, they were prevented to some extent by the publication  of the "Scenario." The world has known of cases where a leak of  information has prevented state upheavals, while dismissal of  information has resulted in tragedy.    The Appeal Court believes that by publishing "Scenario No.  1"  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA did not break the Law on the Mass Media. The  newspaper was right to inform citizens of actions in the offing  or of insinuations about such actions.    Nor can the publication of "Scenario No. 1" be seen as  sensation-seeking, whereby information authenticity would be  sacrificed. An editorial note plainly states: "Most likely  what we have here is an obvious hoax, a 'letter of incitement.'"  In other words, the editorial board's attitude toward  publication was a balanced one. This is also indicated by the  unsensational way in which the material was presented.    Criminal proceedings have been instituted over the  publication and an investigation is in progress, the results of  which are not yet known. So far it has not been established  whether the "Scenario" is a letter of incitement or instance of  political hooliganism, or if it has a real basis. Thus, the  Appeal Court has refrained from drawing any hasty conclusions  about the authenticity of the publication. In this connection,  the Appeal Court also regards as premature certain assessments  of the actions of the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board, and in  particular the taking of administrative action against it.    [signed] Appeal Court Chairman A. Vengerov    [dated] Moscow, 4 April.</p>

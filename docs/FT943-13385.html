			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Britons still walk a mile for a pint Mr John Major's dream of a return to a Britain of warm beer and cricket on the village green was given a boost yesterday by news that the traditional pint of milk on the doorstep and pint of beer in a pub will live on. From October 1 next year the UK will move into line with the rest of the European Union by adopting metric measures for most purposes. But beer and cider will still be sold in pint rather than half-litre measures - provided these are in returnable containers - while road signs will stay in miles rather than kilometres. Lord Strathclyde, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday he had laid before parliament statutory instruments to implement the European Units of Measurement directive. But the legislation provided for a handful of the most popular imperial measures - some first standardised just after the signing of the Magna Carta - to continue to be used. Past reluctance from the public and from traders to adopt metric measures led to the UK being granted a special exemption from the weights and measures directive. However most goods that are not already sold in metric measures will have to conform from next year. The main exceptions will be foods such as meat, poultry, fish and cheese, which are sold loose by the pound and ounce. These will not have to switch to metric until 2000. The imperial measures that will continue beyond that are the mile, yard, foot and inch for road-traffic signs and distance and speed measurement; the pint for milk, draught beer and cider sold in returnable containers; the troy ounce for precious metals; and the acre for land registration. Consumers fearing confusion should take heart. Retailers will display price conversion charts for goods sold in metric quantities.</p>

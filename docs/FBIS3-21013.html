He expressed the opinion  that the market would not improve suddenly as if by magic.  Figures relating to the second half of 1993 show that while a  nadir has been reached, there were a few bright spots during the  year:    1) AEROSPATIALE not only consolidated, but in some cases  improved its market position in spite of the difficult period.    a) Civil market was particularly down in 1993:    -- In the case of aircraft with more than 100 seats,  cancellations and new orders balanced each other out. The three  major constructors thus consider 1993 to be a year of status quo;    -- Demand for commuter aircraft was more vigorous during the  2d half of the year and the ATR [Regional Transport Aircraft]  significantly strengthened its position;    -- The civilian helicopter market was also in deep  depression, although EUROCOPTER increased its share to more than  50 percent of the world market;    -- Space products, the Ariane and satellites proved that  they  could successfully compete, notably, with American products.  Key events during the year 1993 were seven faultless Ariane 4  launchings, anticipatory launcher procurement by ARIANESPACE and  the starting up of a new satellite platform, Spacebus 3000 with  the Arabsat II.    b) In the field of military helicopters and missiles: In  spite of a continuing slump in the market, there was a definite  improvement in export orders which indicated the ability of the  company to remain competitive. The French Defense budget for  1994 is better than might have been feared with a market poor in  promise for military expenditures.    During 1993 orders for civil aircraft and helicopters  retracted to around 29 billion francs [Fr] against nearly 40 in  1992, in spite of an improvement in military and space export  contracts. At the end of the year, order books stood at Fr130  billion, representing two and a half years of activity. The  1993 revenue of the AEROSPATIALE group was around Fr49.3  billion, a retraction of only 5 percent compared to 1992.    2) Trim-down Steps Already Show Significant Results in 1993.    While net profits were still in deficit phase in 1993, there  was a significant improvement. This improvement, vital for  AEROSPATIALE, was not obtained, as we have seen, through any  recovery in the general situation, worse in 1993 than in 1992,  but through rigorous restructuring efforts by the company and a  remarkable willingness of personnel to accept them. These  efforts will continue through 1994. At the time, andebtedness  stabilized and even diminished. Now the aim is to return to a  balanced situation as soon as possible, and, in any event, no  later than 1995.</p>

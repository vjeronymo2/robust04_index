			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Industry hones competitive edge THE COMPETITIVENESS of UK industry continued to improve in June, official figures revealed yesterday. Manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output were 3 per cent lower in the three months to June than in the same period a year before. This figure compares with a fall of 3.4 per cent in the three months to May. Manufacturing productivity - output per head - was 1.3 per cent higher in the second quarter compared with the first and 8.2 per cent higher than in the same three months a year earlier. The year-on-year increase in productivity was the second highest since December 1986. The highest since then was in the three months ending May, when productivity grew by 8.5 per cent. Output per head in the whole economy was 0.8 per cent higher in the first quarter of this year than in the previous three-month period and 4 per cent higher than in the same quarter a year ago. The latest figures suggest UK industry is competing effectively abroad. The 3 per cent drop in unit wage costs in the first quarter compares with growth of 9 per cent in Germany, 7 per cent in Japan and minus 1 per cent in the US during the same quarter.</p>

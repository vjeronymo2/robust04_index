			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Dow Corning puts cost of litigation at Dollars 1.24bn Dow Corning, the US's biggest manufacturer of breast implants, said yesterday that it expected its share of an industry-wide settlement of litigation over leaking implants to reach Dollars 1.24bn. The company, a joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, said that Dollars 600m of this would be met by insurance companies, leaving it with a pre-tax charge of Dollars 640m, or Dollars 415m after tax, for the fourth quarter of 1993. The scale of the potential costs have raised fears that Dow Corning may not be able to continue without support from its two own-ers. The company said yesterday, though, that it would be able to 'meet ongoing operational needs,' provided the expected payments from insurers were received and its 'evaluation of current financing arrangements' and future business prospects proved correct. Yesterday's announcement came as Dow Corning and other implant manufacturers, including Baxter International and Bristol-Myers Squibb, continue to negotiate over how to divide between them the costs of a tentative Dollars 4.74bn industry-wide settlement. This has still to be confirmed by the courts.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Gonzalez puts job on line over charge MR FELIPE Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said yesterday he was ready to resign if corruption charges against his Socialist party were proven, Reuter reports from Madrid. But he added that he was convinced it could never be shown that he or any member of his government had made personal gains by abusing their position.

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No order to seize Brazilian mahogany Sir, The article 'Judge orders seizure of UK-bound mahogany' (October 29), by Oliver Tickell, is misleading and inaccurate. We are concerned that your readers, who include many of our suppliers, customers, bankers and professional advisers, may now be under the impression that we have been involved in an illegal shipment of mahogany from Brazil. At the time of your article, Tradelink had no 'shipload of mahogany half way across the Atlantic'. No Brazilian judge ordered 'the immediate seizure' of this shipload, nor had he ordered 'the sequestration of thousands of cubic metres of mahogany belonging to C&amp;C'. The last shipment we made from C&amp;C was loaded on October 8 and had already arrived and been distributed in the UK. It was exported from Brazil with the usual valid export licence and necessary export documentation. In terms of The Timber Trade Federation guidelines for shipments from a non-AIMEX supplier like C&amp;C, we took the additional precaution of insisting on Brazilian certificates of origin guaranteeing that the mahogany did not come from Indian reserves. The information we have about C&amp;C regarding the judge's ruling on October 18 is that IBAMA, Brazil's environment protection agency, accused C&amp;C of obtaining a mahogany export quota on the basis of false information. The Brazilian judge ruled that all mahogany exports by C&amp;C from Brazilian territory should be halted. He also suspended its mahogany quota and gave C&amp;C five days to respond to the allegations. C&amp;C responded on October 21, vigorously contesting all the allegations made against it, and the matter is still in the hands of the Brazilian courts. In the meantime, C&amp;C continues its business in other species because its export licence has not be revoked. We have suspended our mahogany purchases from C&amp;C effective October 19 and will review our policy towards it after clarification of its legal position. We do not wish to be seen as fighting for or defending C&amp;C's legal position as this is a matter for the Brazilian authorities. We fully support TTF and its efforts to ensure that mahogany is derived from legal sources. We will take no part in illegally sourced timber from anywhere in the world and always attempt to obtain supplies from well-managed forests. H P Schey, managing director, Tradelink Wood Products, Tradelink House, 25 Beethoven Street, London W10 4LG Editor's note: We understand that this report was based on a mistranslation of the judge's ruling, which contained no order to seize wood destined for Tradelink. We regret this error and apologise for any inconvenience it may have caused</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Compared with the feverish anticipation surrounding Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget last year, this year's exercise has attracted remarkably little excitement so far. Perhaps that is because Mr Clarke has already been so emphatically dismissive of the prospect for tax cuts in the short run. Judging by the yesterday's 'green budget' from Goldman Sachs and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, he has little room for manoeuvre anyway. Though the public sector borrowing requirement is falling faster than expected, it is all to do with the impact on spending of higher-than-expected growth and low inflation. Unlike last year, when the government had to deal with a surging deficit, there is no urgent need for a change in the overall fiscal stance. While the pace of recovery remains uncertain there is little call for further tightening over and above what is already in the pipeline. Equally, premature relaxation could spill over into a deterioration in the payments deficit. The UK's unexpectedly strong trade performance this year has added powerfully to the impression that the recovery is sustainable. So if Mr Clarke does want to make a political splash with the Budget, it looks as though he will need to find a way of robbing Peter to pay Paul. An obvious possibility is freezing allowances to finance an increase in the 20 per cent tax band. But Mr Clarke's tax on insurance premiums last year also shows he enjoys springing surprises. The City seems to have fought off any serious attack on dividends but, given its unpopularity with the public at large, the financial sector should not rest entirely easy till after November 29.</p>

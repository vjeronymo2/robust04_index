			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Observer: Highway code Sprawl - the Society for Promoting Road Accidents by Writing Ludicrously - is at its nefarious work again. The latest example, photographed and sent in by the Company Writers consultancy, is a highway notice reading: 'Physical width restrictor reinstated'. As the consultancy says, a good many passing motorists would be in danger of hitting something before they'd worked out that what the notice means is 'Road narrows'. Even so, Observer finds it easier to translate Sprawl's verbiage than to divine the precise meaning of a sign on a building near the main car park in Bridport, Dorset, which states: Executive Snooker. Deeper pockets, perhaps?</p>

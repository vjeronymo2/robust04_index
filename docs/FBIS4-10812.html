			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raul Llanos Samaniego] </F>   [Text] Industry Undersecretary Fernando Sanchez Ugarte has  said that "the political situation is becoming stable," and,  therefore, there will be no permanent repercussions on the  economy. Sanchez Ugarte added that the federal government has  not "yet" considered making any changes in its targets regarding  growth and inflation.    Fernando Cortina, president of the Confederation of  Industrial Chambers [Concamin], noted that the today's "moments  of political tension" might affect economic prospects, and,  therefore, "we should not be confused by rumors," because only  by "visualizing the type of country we want in the future" will  we be able to eradicate "the signs of violence and antidemocracy  that pervade these times of confusion."    Meanwhile, Enrique Aranzabal, president of the National  Chamber of the Textile Industry [CNIT], said during an interview  that in light of political uncertainty in the nation, "it will  be difficult to meet official economic targets."    During the regular General Assembly of the Textile Chamber,  Sanchez Ugarte pointed out that the federal government is  determined to stay the course in terms of its macroeconomic  program, anti-inflationary policies, and healthy public finances.    "We hope that all macroeconomic factors continue to hold  steady and that the economy remains stable," Sanchez Ugarte said  at the end of his speech.    Sanchez Ugarte expressed his confidence that the GDP will  increase by 3.5 percent, and he added that "no changes have been  made yet" to meet this target.    Asked about the national industrial situation, he commented  that there are no current figures on industrial performance at  this time, but he indicated that in December 1993, manufacturing  sector began to recover. He also expressed confidence that  figures for the first quarter of 1994 will reflect an  improvement over previous months.    In terms of job creation, Sanchez Ugarte noted that today  the  industrial sector provides employment to approximately 3.5  million workers, and "in 1994, this sector could generate  150,000 jobs."    Meanwhile, Concamin leader Fernando Cortina underscored that  the intensity of the globalization process is not only reflected  in greater economic competition, but also in the exacerbation of  social problems, "which hint the turn of the century will be  shaken by unemployment, plummeting investment, economic  slowdown, volatile financial markets, the internationalization  of new commercial agreements, and the general use of violence as  a means of political pressure."    In Mexico's case, Cortina maintained that in light of  "uncertain times," it is commonplace to emphasize the negative  aspects of a period of tension. However, he added that the  country's industrialists "must trust in Mexico, considering the  progress accomplished, and they must also, in all seriousness,  continue to press for those goals that remain unresolved."    Cortina added: "We should not be confused by rumors.  Conditions for economic stability exist, and if we trust in  Mexico, we will overcome the uncertainty of having little time  to lead the country along a path of environmentally sound,  sustained growth."    Along this line, Cortina urged the national business  community to maintain its trust in the future of Mexico,  because, through hard work, it will be possible to achieve the  proposed 4.2-percent average industrial growth.    Cortina concluded: "Let us not lose our objectivity, and let  us keep working on what we know how to do efficiently -- to  produce with quality and efficiency. Let us defeat those  adversaries who only seek to destabilize us. Together, we will  create a better Mexico."    Meanwhile, CNIT President Enrique Aranzabal noted that the  Mexican economy is facing a very difficult period characterized  by political circumstances that are causing instability in the  national economy and might result in foiled government  expectations regarding inflation and growth.    In his speech before Sanchez Ugarte, Aranzabal demanded  prompt solutions to the problems threatening the textile  industry -- namely, financing and the entry into national  territory of merchandise priced at dumping levels.  <H5>  The National Chamber of Commerce [Canaco] Says Economic </H5> Problems Have Not Been Overcome    Canaco leader Gustavo A. Madero pointed out on 12 April that  it would be a mistake to think the nation's economic problems  have been overcome, because the fight against inflation is still  continuing. The inflation problem must be truly solved,  effectively controlled, and secured with "strong locks" to  prevent the remergence of pitfalls that have been apparently  overcome.    Madero indicated that in terms of growth, the country is  facing the worst times in the entire six-year period, with local  problems and increasing obstacles, but organized businessmen  have neither slowed down nor ceased their efforts to reverse the  trend.    Consequently, Canaco has supported the creation of a credit  union for its members, as well as the establishment of a "single  office" for transactions -- although it is currently overwhelmed  with requests -- and it has implemented a permanent promotion  campaign to standardize corporate mergers, among many other  tasks.</p>

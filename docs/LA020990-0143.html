			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING;  </P> <P> RHYTHM STILL HAS PLENTY TO PROVE  </P> <P> Although Rhythm won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last year and was voted the  champion 2-year-old colt by the Eclipse Awards electorate, he has more to prove  than some of the horses that finished behind him in both the race and ballot  box.  </P> <P> Rhythm was the shakiest of Eclipse winners, not polling the most total votes  but finishing No. 1 in a bloc-voting system that was barely able to separate  him from his other rivals, Grand Canyon and Summer Squall.  </P> <P> Rhythm's only stakes victory came in the Breeders' Cup, his fifth and final  start as a 2-year-old. Grand Canyon, second by two lengths in the Breeders'  Cup, wound up with stakes wins at Santa Anita, Churchill Downs and Hollywood  Park and outpolled Rhythm and undefeated Summer Squall, the winner of four  stakes who missed the Breeders' race because of injury.  </P> <P> "Wayne, you wuz robbed," Don Clippinger wrote recently in the The Thoroughbred  Record, referring to Wayne Lukas, trainer of Grand Canyon.  </P> <P> Rhythm is trained by Shug McGaughey, who last year at this time had another  2-year-old champion, Easy Goer, in his barn. That's the extent of the  similarity, because in Easy Goer, McGaughey knew he had an exceptional colt,  who had the misfortune to be foaled in the same year as Sunday Silence. The  Eastern press raved about Easy Goer before he got to the Kentucky Derby, but  the projections for Rhythm, both from turf writers and the trainer, are  considerably more circumspect.  </P> <P> Others are also apprehensive. For Rhythm's debut as a 3-year-old, in the  seven-furlong Hutcheson Stakes on Saturday at Gulfstream Park, the track  linemaker has installed him as a mild 5-2 favorite, even though the race will  be run over the same surface on which the colt won in the Breeders' Cup.  </P> <P> Second choice in the 12-horse field is Housebuster at 3-1. Housebuster's  stamina for the longer Triple Crown races is questionable, but he's dangerous  at the Hutcheson distance, having already won a six-furlong stake at Gulfstream  three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Grand Canyon is in training at Santa Anita and won't meet Rhythm again until  Kentucky. Summer Squall also is in Florida.  </P> <P> Three of trainer Charlie Whittingham's seven Santa Anita Handicap winners --  Pretense, Ack Ack and Lord at War -- also won the San Antonio Handicap.  Whittingham has the potential for another such double, running Ruhlmann and  Payant on Sunday in the $300,000 San Antonio.  </P> <P> Ruhlmann will be the high-weighted starter at 122 pounds and Payant has drawn  117 pounds. Their running styles put Whittingham in a good position. Ruhlmann  has early speed and Payant likes to come from well off the pace.  </P> <P> Present Value, who carries 120 pounds, is also expected to start, along with  Criminal Type, Complicate, Hollywood Reporter and Stylish Winner.  </P> <P> A successful 1989 means talented mare Bayakoa must carry 127 pounds instead of  118 in the Santa Margarita Handicap.  </P> <P> The 1989 Santa Margarita was seven stakes wins and one Eclipse Award ago for  Bayakoa. Last year, Bayakoa was spotted seven pounds by Goodbye Halo, who  finished second to her in the stake. This year, Bayakoa is the high weight and  must give two pounds to Gorgeous and considerably more to any other horses in a  small field.  </P> <P> Bayakoa carried 126 pounds and Gorgeous 125 when both horses easily won Santa  Margarita prep races at Santa Anita last weekend, and Ron McAnally, who trains  Bayakoa, had hoped that the spread would be the same when they have their  showdown a week from Sunday. Bayakoa is attempting to become the first  back-to-back winner of the Santa Margarita since Tizna in 1974-75.  </P> <P> California's 3-year-olds make another attempt to sort themselves out Saturday  when six run in the San Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes at Santa Anita. Entered in  the seven-furlong race are Farma Way, Top Cash, Phantom X., Leading Laddie,  Tarascon and Mister Frisky, who makes his American debut after winning 13  consecutive races in Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> Jockey Ron Hansen's dual appeal for stays of an order banning him from Golden  Gate Fields was denied on separate fronts Thursday.  </P> <P> Henry Chavez, chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, allowed Golden  Gate's ban of Hansen to remain in effect, at least until a hearing can be  scheduled.  </P> <P> And in Alameda County Superior Court, Hansen was denied a temporary restraining  order at Golden Gate, with his hearing to be continued on Feb. 28.  </P> <P> There were reports that Hansen might ride quarter horses at Bay Meadows this  weekend, but he is not named on horses at Bay Meadows for tonight or Saturday  night.  </P> <P> The unfortunate part about Bill Shoemaker's last ride is that after the day --  and the race -- were specifically orchestrated for the convenience of ABC  television, the network could squeeze in only about seven minutes on its "Wide  World of Sports" program, which was dominated by boxing.  </P> <P> Left on the cutting-room floor were several prepared pieces on Shoemaker's  career. The telecast is just the umpteenth example of the historically  difficult relationship racing has had with television.  </P> <P> The night before Shoemaker's last ride, the 58-year-old jockey was honored at a  charity dinner that included Bob Hope. Two of Hope's better lines:  </P> <P> "People who play golf with Shoe are always worried that they're going to lose  him in the hole."  </P> <P> "When Shoe was born, he was so small that the doctor went to slap him and  missed."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> The Eclipse Awards will be presented tonight at a dinner in Miami Beach, Fla. .  . . Kent Desormeaux, who will pick up his statuette for best jockey, begins  riding at Santa Anita next week. A week from Monday, Desormeaux will be riding  in Saudi Arabia, where Steve Cauthen once made a celebrity appearance.  </P> <P> Rosemary Ferraro has been reappointed by Gov. Deukmejian to another four-year  term on the California Horse Racing Board. A new board member is John La  Follette, a San Fernando Valley attorney who starts a four-year term as a  replacement for Ray Seeley.  </P> <P> John Henry, who is eligible for the first time, is a cinch to be elected to  racing's Hall of Fame. There is a good chance that his trainer, Ron McAnally,  also could get elected, should he wind up on the ballot.  </P></p>

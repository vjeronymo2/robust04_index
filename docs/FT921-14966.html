			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Chambers urge Budget for investment and small businesses CHAMBERS OF Commerce today called for a Budget that will encourage increased investment and also take into account the difficulties facing smaller companies. The Association of British Chambers, which represents 100 of the largest chambers, highlighted three areas of taxation where changes would benefit industry in general and small businesses in particular. It called for removal of the 25 per cent limit on profits that can be set against advance corporation tax. The association also recommended that the government should reform inheritance tax with the ultimate aim of abolishing it. It said the tax was important not only for individuals but also for the commercial sector 'where many proprietors of small businesses are looking to release, or pass on, their assets in a manner which does not require the break-up of their company'. The association's third area of concern is the costs to business of complying with tax legislation and of administering different taxes. It called for different forms of taxation to be integrated. The chambers' Budget submission emphasised the importance of exports. It urged the chancellor to take a 'long-term view of the UK's place in the European Community and the world economy' and stressed the need for a satisfactory conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, even at the cost of big changes in UK and EC economic policies. In detailed recommendations for changes in excise duties, the chambers said duty on Scotch whisky should be charged at the time of sale rather than manufacture. They also advocated that lead-free aviation fuel should be given favourable treatment in terms of excise duty similar to that of lead-free petrol. Mr Miles Middleton, the association's president, said: 'We are looking for a long-term strategy for stability. We want a framework which does not overly distort commercial activity and takes into account the day-to-day problems which bear particularly heavily on smaller firms which make up such an important part of the UK economy.' Paul Cheeseright writes: The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) yesterday urged the government to bring forward its renovation programme for school buildings in order to stimulate the depressed construction industry. The proposal was made in a submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The submission reflects the more general concern among business organisations that the government should act to revive the domestic economy. Mr Tony Miller, the FSB's financial affairs chairman, said school renovation would 'give a kick-start to the building industry', which would affect the wider economy. 'Business failures are at an all-time high, with all that implies - destroyed hopes, lost jobs and shattered family life,' Mr Miller wrote. To stem the failures, the government should help small businesses and the construction industry, he argued. The FSB is also advocating the establishment of a state-ubsidised fund to provide medium and long-term finance at stable interest rates to small businesses. Mr Miller said that the government could either make funds available for the commercial banks to lend on to companies or provide funds so that banks would be able to lend at lower than the prevailing rates of interest.</p>

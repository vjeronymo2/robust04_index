			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bagif Efendiyev: "Sketches for a Portrait. Who </F> Is He?"]    [Text] One might say that all of Azerbaijan has heard of  Zakir Makhmudovich Tagiyev. He was a candidate for the post of  president of the republic in 1993. He is chairman of the Veten  Adzhagy Party (previously--Gummet). He is simply a billionaire.  He is president of the Tarana firm. He is the author of the  economic program for revival of Azerbaijan. This program has  now been brought up for discussion in the National Assembly.  But...    But it was written even prior to that, two years ago, during  the summer in some beautiful little corner of Azerbaijan. In the  apt words of Mr. Tagiyev, Azerbaijan is the center of the  universe. This is why Russia, Turkey, Iran, England, and even  the United States are hankering after the ancient and rich land  of Azerbaijan. Not to mention the hostile Armenia. It is  Armenia's misfortune that it began a battle for Azerbaijani  land, as Germany did against Russia in its day. God has always  been with us because our people live according to the divine  laws of goodness, kindness, and amity. And any aggressor,  especially the unhappy and pathetic Armenians, is living  according to the laws of the devil, Iblis--the eternal enemy of  God and Man....    The war will not last forever. It will come to an end. And  then it will be necessary not only heal the wounds but also to  feed the people, build houses, and develop science, sports, and  culture. Without an economic base there can be no culture--this  is one of Mr. Tagiyev's aphorisms. The main task now is to carry  out radical economic reforms. But there should be no radicalism  in politics. Let there be leftists and rightists and centrists.  But 90 percent of social life must consist of economics, 7  percent--of politics, and only 3 percent--of foreign policy.  That is what Zakir-bek thinks. And it is true! Look at what the  independent states of the former, now collapsed, USSR are  engaged in. Russia: Yeltsin's fight against the opposition.  Ukraine: the president's fight for the Black Sea Fleet.  Kazakhstan: the fight for Baykonur. Belarus: the fight to defeat  Shushkevich. Moldova: Snegur and the Dniester region. Georgia:  Shevardnadze overthrew Gamsakhurdia, but Ardzinba appeared in  Abkhazia. Uzbekistan: Karimov is successfully suppressing the  opposition. Kyrgyzstan: The fight for power is still going on.  Turkmenistan: Turkmenbashi is reinforcing his personality cult.  And then Azerbaijan and Armenia are fighting over Karabakh....    Let us imagine for a second what would have happened if the  money lost on political fighting or war had been used for  economic development. There would have been an economic miracle  in the CIS long ago. But no, everyone is infected with the  bacilla of political fighting. They all want to become  presidents, rulers, and masters, forgetting about the destinies  of the peoples, about the standard of living of the simple  people, who have ended up on the brink of poverty and are  waiting for a political miracle!...    But there has never been such a thing in the history of  mankind...and thank the Lord God and Almighty Allah that there  are people who are thinking about economic revival! It is  curious that Zakir-bek's program received a high rating from  such luminaries of economic politics or political economics  (however you wish) as Shatalin and Yavlinskiy, who are highly  respected in the world.    The path to revival and entry into the market economy passes  through capital. And the more people who are drawn into economic  development, the richer the society will be and thus every  person who makes up this society. And if Mr. Tagiyev two years  ago asked the question in his work "What to do?", now he knows  how to save us from the economic crisis that is getting worse  with every leap of the dollar. The growth of prices has brought  people to the point of spiritual degradation: They lie and  deceive the new-fledged "businessmen," treat relatives like  enemies, and brother turns against brother for a piece of land,  for a small area of property, and the most audacious and bitter  people assert that war is advantageous not only to Russia or  Armenia... Tagiyev's program for entering the market has been  approved by the Social Liberal Party of Russia and several  business academicians in Kazakhstan. It makes up the economic  parts of the programs of several parties in Azerbaijan, but for  some reason we do not see it here in our republic. AZERTADZH was  still even naive enough to refuse to print it, saying that there  were too many parties and too many programs. Yes there are  indeed too many programs. But not to see the advantages of Mr.  Z.I. Tagiyev's economic program is ridiculous to say the least.  Just one part of it, pertaining to the protection of mothers and  children, makes it worthwhile. Have we read many concrete  programs for social protection of children and women?    Whoever loves children loves God and whoever respects women  respects the Most High! Incidentally, to the question of whether  the esteemed Zakir believes in God and how his attitude toward  the Most High is reflected in the program, he answers instantly:  Allah will help us and bless us for serving the people...in  principle this question might not even have been  asked--journalistic curiosity got the better of me... It is  sufficient to listen to a couple of minutes of Mr. Tagiyev's  discussion with a refugee, a worker, an intellectual, a  businessman, or an academician. Goodness and kindness simply  radiate from him. He has a rare ability to understand and  sympathize with the person with whom he is speaking; all the  latter has to do is open his mouth! This is a true sign that he  is constantly thinking about the future, about people first and  then about himself! In order to understand this you yourself  have to be without selfish egoism....    The construction of that which will produce fruits in a year  has been conceived now. I do not want to get ahead of events. We  have adopted the practice of not noticing the success of another  and scoffing if what they plan does not come to pass. But to  imagine, for example, the existence of a sugar refinery in  Azerbaijan is almost a fantasy. We are not Cuba or even Ukraine.  But if Zakir-bek is certain that there will be such a plant,  then there will be one!    It is impressive that Zakir Makhmudovich is gifted with  respect to all components of human existence. One can only envy  his patience. One can only be amazed by his ability to  sympathize and understand people. His ability to penetrate to  the essence of things without a lot of verbiage and tedium is in  general apparently his main talent. And also his wisdom--not so  much acquired as innate. He is clearly aware that if you lose  two you will receive 20! If you make those around you happy,  happiness will not abandon you. If you give confidence to  another, success will not leave you. The Most High does indeed  love Zakir-bek. And perhaps Allah loves those with whom Mr.  Tagiyev himself communicates. In any case the phenomenon of  Zakir Tagiyev has still to be understood and revealed. After  all, many are not yet aware of the phenomenon of Zeynalabdin  Tagiyev! And these symbols are not random: Z. and T., for many  people are called by the name of the world-renowned patron Hajji  Zeynalabdin Tagiyev. And many assume the name of the great  patron themselves. But so far none are worthy. And, to be  honest, I would not want to name Mr. Zakir Tagiyev or compare  him to his initial namesake whom he resembles. In my opinion, he  is a personality in and of himself and in time others will be  compared to him and be said to resemble him, people who while  increasing capital do not forget about God and, the main thing,  about people or, vice versa: They do not forget about people  and, the main thing, about God!    But still, why does my title contain the question: "Who Is  He?" The reason is as simple as can be: Zakir-bek has a major  secret about which the time has not yet come to speak. Perhaps  he himself guesses about it intuitively. Not many people know  about it. Whether or not I know is also a secret. But as a  respectable journalist I promise to write about the secret.  When? Only the Most High knows about that. And when He allows  it, blesses it, then I will write it. Of course, with the  permission of Zakir Makhmudovich Tagiyev himself.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Lottery consortium names the day The UK's first multi-million-pound National Lottery draw will take place live on BBC television on November 19, less than six months after the Camelot consortium was chosen as the preferred operator. The announcement of the launch date came yesterday as Camelot was formally awarded its licence by Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery and the lottery operator unveiled its logo - a smiling hand with crossed fingers. The logo, created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Design and chosen from more than 100 designs, was claimed to represent everything from fun, friendliness and approachability to hope, anticipation and honesty. Anyone who has chosen the numbers in any order could win Pounds 2m although the odds are almost 14m-1 against. Although the size of the prizes will normally be influenced by the number of Pounds 1 lottery tickets sold in any week it is likely there will be a minimum jackpot of Pounds 2m for the first draw. The licence, which will run until the end of September 2001, closely follows the draft licence published last year except that the commitments made by Camelot when it applied for the licence have been incorporated. These range from the percentage of ticket sales that will go in prizes to the percentages of revenues that will go to five good causes: the arts, charities, a millennium fund, national heritage and sport. The percentage of prize money before deduction of 12 per cent lottery duty ranges from a low of 47.2 per cent of ticket sales in the 1995 financial year ending March 31 to a high of 50.65 per cent the following year. At ticket sales of between Pounds 750m to Pounds 1.5bn a year the percentage going to good causes will range from 21.66 per cent to 26.8 per cent. If the lottery has revenues of more than Pounds 3.5bn a year - which is thought to be possible - the good causes will get between 31.35 per cent and 34.005 per cent. Companies in the Camelot consortium are: Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks group; security printer De La Rue; computer company ICL; Racal Electronics; and GTech, the US company which claims to be the world's biggest lottery operator. It said yesterday the project was on track for the launch. Manufacture of the computer terminals has begun and more than 8,000 of the 10,000 retail outlets needed for the launch have signed up.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO COUNCIL OKS SHOPPING CENTER  </P> <P> By a 4-1 vote, the Redondo Beach City Council approved the Redondo Shores  Shopping Center, a 104,941-square-foot commercial and office complex planned  for a site just north of City Hall on Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> The triangular, 5.9-acre site, bordered by Carnelian and Beryl streets and  Elena Avenue, is vacant except for a drugstore. The developer, Redondo Shores  Ltd. submitted plans for a one- and two-story, Cape Cod-style complex of stores  on the site. The Mrs. Gooch's grocery store in Hermosa Beach will relocate to  the new center, and other retail stores and a restaurant are envisioned.  </P> <P> The project was approved with 72 conditions to lessen its impact on the area.  The conditions include requiring offices and stores to participate in a  recycling program where feasible, operating a security system for a proposed  underground parking garage and prohibiting bars in the complex.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Barbara J. Doerr, expressing concerns about security, traffic and  how well the project would blend into the existing residential neighborhood,  voted against the project.  </P></p>

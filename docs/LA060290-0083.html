			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE FLARES OVER PUSH TO RECYCLE NEWSPAPERS  </P> <P> When New York's Suffolk County this week adopted the nation's toughest  newsprint recycling law, it joined a groundswell among community activists to  induce the birth of a market that they believe has so far failed to develop on  its own.  </P> <P> While several states have passed laws requiring newspapers to use recycled  paper, and similar federal bills are pending, Suffolk County is apparently the  first local government to enact legislation.  </P> <P> Publishers and paper manufacturers say the activists are getting ahead of the  game.  </P> <P> "In fact, newspaper recycling is going great guns," said Tonda F. Rush, vice  president for industry affairs for the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. As  recently as a year and a half ago, collection of old newspapers -- ONP in  industry jargon -- was haphazard, she said. But municipal curbside recycling  efforts have proliferated in that time, and the supply of old newspapers has  outstripped the ability of paper mills to process it.  </P> <P> Rush said it may be as long as a year and a half before the mills will finish  building the plants they need to handle the torrent.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Toronto and Washington have considered ordinances requiring  newspapers sold on city streets to use recycled paper.  </P> <P> In Oregon's Multnomah County, a ballot drive for mandatory newsprint recycling  was derailed only after the publisher of Portland's Oregonian newspaper agreed  to a voluntary plan.  </P> <P> By the end of 1990, California, Wisconsin, Missouri and Maryland will have  mandatory newsprint recycling laws in place. Currently, publishers have agreed  to voluntary plans in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts and  Michigan. Rush of the ANPA said that in Kentucky, New Jersey and another half  dozen states, voluntary agreements are under discussion.  </P> <P> Paper manufacturers say that, like the publishers, they favor recycling. But  they, too, oppose mandatory recycling, citing the costs of compliance with a  hodgepodge of state and local statutes. The American Paper Institute, a trade  group, contends that recycling is working better than people think, and that it  has increased at more than twice the rate of newsprint consumption overall.  </P> <P> "We expect that one out of every two newspapers in the United States will be  collected for recycling by 1995," says Red Cavaney, API president.  </P> <P> Publishers prefer voluntary plans and warn that creating a market by fiat will  inevitably raise newsprint prices. Knowing that their customers are forced to  buy the product, paper suppliers will charge more, the argument goes.  </P> <P> But publishers are considering challenging the Suffolk County law on  constitutional grounds, arguing that mandatory recycling threatens the First  Amendment right to freedom of expression.  </P> <P> "Look at it this way," said Rush of the ANPA. "You've got a state capital that  controls the raw material that's necessary to publish the newspaper. And the  government controlling that raw material is the same government that you're  writing about."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in neighborhoods across the country, citizens who dutifully pile  their old newspapers at the curb are increasingly frustrated as the feeble new  market founders and papers stack up in warehouses.  </P> <P> Demand hasn't yet caught up with the supply generated by neighborhood  recycling, contends Grant Ferrier, editor of the San Diego-based Environmental  Business Journal. He recounts the example of an Ohio recycler who less than two  years ago was getting $30 a ton for old newspapers; when he went out of  business last year, he had to pay $10 a ton to have the old newspapers hauled  away.  </P> <P> Tales like this have encouraged community leaders to take matters into their  own hands. Some have even talked of adding deposits to newspapers, like the  deposits on soft drink bottles.  </P> <P> Maxine Postal first began to worry about the bad rap that Suffolk County was  getting in 1987, when the infamous Islip garbage barge prowled the world's  oceans for months, searching for a friendly port for its load of Suffolk County  trash. Postal began to worry that "that's what we were going to be famous for,  exporting garbage."  </P> <P> Then Postal, a county representative, discovered that her town of Amityville  was planning to incinerate half the newspapers that she and her neighbors had  been carefully separating to recycle.  </P> <P> "And that would be a death knell for recycling," she recalled thinking. "Why  would someone separate newspapers if they knew they would just be burned?"  </P> <P> Postal figured that the only way to create markets for recycled newsprint was  to compel publishers to use it. Her law requires any newspaper of more than  20,000 circulation that is printed, sold or distributed in the county to use  newsprint that is at least 40% recycled fiber by December, 1996.  </P></p>

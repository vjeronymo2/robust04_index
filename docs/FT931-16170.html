			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: The Curse of the Pharaohs - Theatre There is a fine play to start the New Year at the Lyric Studio in Hammersmith. The Curse of the Pharaohs has wit, pathos, spine-tingling suspense and some political and social overtones. Above all, it is a wonderfully good story and the acting by the Empty Stage Theatre Company is to the highest standards. The story is of Howard Carter, his patron, Lord Carnarvon, and the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamon in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. An additional pleasure is that it might be equally about the British and Suez Canal: several lines suggest that the analogy is deliberate. The play captures that patronising, but sometimes mutually admiring, relationship between the British and the Egyptians to a tee. The Curse is, of course, a thriller as well. The Empty Stage Company works almost entirely without props: a chair here and there, the odd torch to illuminate the tomb and a stick both to support the ailing Lord Carnarvon and to beat to death the insidious, unseen cobra. Occasionally the gold and green figure of Tutankhamon appears in the background, most ominously at the end when it looks as though he is laying a final curse on Carter. There are only four parts in Robin Brooks's text: Carter, Carnarvon, his daughter, Lady Evelyn, and an Egyptian who switches between guide, doctor, prime minister and political detainee. Only at the close, when the British have deposed him, do you realise how crucial the Egyptian is to the structure of the play. About halfway through I would have given the acting laurels to Nick Rawling as Carter, the Norfolk draughtsman who took to Egypt as if it were a vastly more interesting version of East Anglia. Another prize would have gone to Sophie McConnell for the relatively small part of Lady Evelyn. Ms McConnell, without the slightest affectation, is both loving daughter to her father and doting admirer of Carter. Then, in the second act, Carnarvon dies. I thought this scene, played by Peter Glancy as Carnarvon, was extremely moving. Again, nothing is overdone. The old theatrical standbys of death on the stage and a final deathbed conversation, man-to-man, come off gloriously. Even Glancy, however, is finally overtaken by Nick Rawling as the Egyptian. As prime minister, Rawling throws out the patronising British only to be himself thrown out as the British fight back. He takes the rebuff with immense calm and charm, confident no doubt that one day the Egyptians will be back. Other pleasures abound: the Egyptian music composed by Richard Heacock, the lighting by Ron Hollis which is essential to the plot. There are some very funny, very English lines along the way. Brooks has been writing for Empty Stage since 1989. His previous works include an adaptation of Pilgrim's Progress and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The Curse of the Pharaohs is not just a play for a studio stage, it should go down well anywhere. The production is impeccably directed by Andrew Holmes, the founder of Empty Space. If he turned off the illuminated exit sign at the back of the theatre, one of the key scenes would be even creepier. Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, until January 23. (081) 741 8701</p>

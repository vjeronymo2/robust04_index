William J. Fox  Airfield in Lancaster and immediately began to lose power in both engines,  deputies said.  </P> <P> The crew of a U.S. Air Force medical rescue helicopter that had just taken off  from the airport saw the plane was having problems and followed, deputies said.  </P> <P> The plane, piloted by Adam W. Berg, 67, of Panorama City, was headed west and  flew about three miles from Fox Airfield when both engines shut down. The plane  landed in a vacant field at 70th Street West and Avenue G, deputies said.  </P> <P> Deputy Ronald Thomason said the plane's landing gear was up when it landed and  the aircraft skidded about 300 feet on its belly before coming to a stop. The  passengers did not need any medical help from the crew of the helicopter, which  also landed in the field. Berg suffered a slight injury to his leg, Thomason  said.  </P> <P> The propellers, engines and underside of the plane were damaged, and  authorities said it would have to be removed from the site by truck.  </P></p>

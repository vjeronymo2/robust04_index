			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE AIDES TURN UP HEAT ON WALL TO STEP DOWN  </P> <P> President Bush's senior assistants said Thursday that embattled thrift  regulator M. Danny Wall has no supporters in the White House -- a clear signal  that they want him to step down from the government agency charged with  supervising the nation's savings and loans.  </P> <P> Although Bush so far has refrained from calling on Wall to resign as chairman  of the Office of Thrift Supervision, he has offered no public support for the  regulator, and the President's aides have made it clear that they believe  Wall's days in the job are numbered.  </P> <P> Wall has been criticized for his handling of the thrift crisis, particularly  the problems leading up to the $2-billion collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan of Irvine. Wall rejected recommendations to seize Lincoln in 1987,  delaying a government takeover until last April.  </P> <P> "The life signs are not great," said one senior Administration official. Though  the White House does not believe that Wall has "done anything wrong," the  official said, "the situation is such a mess, and he's such an integral part of  it, it would be best if he stepped aside."  </P> <P> One of Wall's senior aides, Karl T. Hoyle, brushed aside such comments.  </P> <P> "Rumors of our demise are greatly exaggerated," Hoyle said. "The White House  has not contacted us. The Treasury has not asked us to leave."  </P> <P> Wall has come under increasing fire in recent weeks. On Monday, Senate Majority  Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) called on Bush to replace Wall to enable the  Administration to make a "clean break" with regulatory policies that may have  contributed to the Lincoln debacle.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, three public interest groups said Wall should be fired because he  had handled the savings and loan crisis incompetently. Wall responded that his  agency had saved taxpayers $6 billion to $8 billion last year by selling failed  thrifts rather than liquidating them.  </P> <P> When he testified last month before the House Banking, Finance and Urban  Affairs Committee, Wall had no visible Republican support. Indeed, several  Republican members of the panel asked critical questions.  </P> <P> Bush said in an interview in early November that he was considering whether to  remove Wall but that he did not want to prejudge him. The President has made no  public comments on the matter since then.  </P> <P> The critical comments by the President's aides Thursday clearly turned up the  heat on Wall by several degrees, although the advisers stopped short of saying  that Bush himself wanted Wall to quit.  </P> <P> Reflecting the frustration that senior officials at the White House say they  feel over Wall's refusal to act on what appear to have been the broadest of  hints that he step aside, one Bush aide said: "I'm not sure how you solve the  situation. If he didn't want to take the revolver from the drawer, it's not  clear he'll want to take the revolver placed in front of him on the desk."  </P> <P> Another Administration official commented: "You can huff and puff, and if the  guy feels the wind, he gets out. If he doesn't, he stays."  </P> <P> In the face of such pressure, Wall appears to have the support of a key senator  on banking issues, Jake Garn (R-Utah). Wall is a former Garn aide who served as  staff director of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Garn  was chairman of the committee from 1981 to 1987.  </P> <P> Garn secured Wall's nomination as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board  in July, 1987, and helped him keep the job earlier this year when Congress  placed the board under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department and renamed  it the Office of Thrift Supervision.  </P> <P> Last year, Garn refused to support comprehensive legislation to clean up the  savings and loan industry unless Wall was allowed to keep his post without  facing reconfirmation hearings in the Senate, according to Sen. Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.).  </P> <P> Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee,  recently ended six weeks of hearings into the Lincoln controversy and  acknowledged that the sessions were intended in part to force Wall to resign.  </P> <P> Gonzalez has said that the bank board's failure to seize Lincoln in 1987, as  recommended by regulators in San Francisco, was responsible for the loss of an  estimated $2.3 billion in federally insured deposits.  </P> <P> The hearings yielded evidence that Wall encouraged bank board employees to  settle the Lincoln investigation amicably and that he was still resisting  federal seizure of the thrift only days before it was put into receivership  last April 14.  </P> <P> Wall insisted in his testimony before the House committee that he did not have  sufficient evidence to seize Lincoln sooner. He staunchly denied that his  reluctance to act was the result of pressure from Charles H. Keating Jr., the  Arizona financier who controlled Lincoln's parent firm and who had visited him  three times at the bank board during the investigation of Lincoln.  </P> <P> But, Wall said, "I acknowledge that if we had known then what we know now about  this savings and loan, I for one would have done things different -- even  though it appeared to be a solvent and well-capitalized institution at the  time."  </P> <P> In a separate development, the House committee disclosed Thursday that Keating  had purchased $750,000 in Phoenix Cardinals football tickets last year using  Lincoln's funds.  </P> <P> "We now add professional football tickets to junk bonds, speculative land deals  and luxury hotels as favorites on the Keating list of recommended investments,"  Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Committee officials said some of the estimated 16,000 tickets were offered to  guests of the Phoenician Resort, a $300-million luxury hotel built by Keating  near Phoenix. Others were used as part of promotional efforts in selling homes  in Estrella, a giant master-planned community 20 miles outside Phoenix.  </P> <P> In radio commercials, Keating offered 50 pairs of tickets to each of the  Cardinals' eight home games to prospective home buyers who visited Estrella  model homes on the Saturdays before the team's games.  </P> <P> In a statement, Lincoln's parent company said the tickets were purchased by a  Lincoln subsidiary and not by Lincoln itself.  </P> <P> "Contrary to Congressman Gonzalez' allegations, the Phoenix Cardinals tickets .  . . were not purchased by Lincoln Savings," the company said. "Instead, they  were purchased by the Phoenix Resort Corp. as part of its overall advertising  and promotional budget."  </P> <P> Phoenix Resort Corp. is a Lincoln subsidiary that operated the Phoenician  Resort and the Crescent in Phoenix. The tickets were offered for sale as part  of the hotels' weekend packages, an American Continental spokesman said.  </P> <P> "It was a marketing tool," the spokesman said. "When we bought the tickets, the  Phoenix Cardinals were the hottest item in town."  </P> <P> Times Staff Writers William J. Eaton in Washington and James S. Granelli in  Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

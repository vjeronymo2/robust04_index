			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Mercury A selection of comments from this week's FT / Pick of Lex Mercury Communications delivered a classic strategic U-turn on Monday. In pulling out of payphones, directory inquiries and two other peripheral businesses, the company returns to its roots, providing business customers with long distance and international telephone services. This re-focusing goes hand in hand with welcome cost cuts, but it does not provide much comfort for investors in Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent. Times have changed since the days when Mercury and BT carved up the UK telecommunications market. Since the duopoly came to an end in 1991, competition has intensified across the board, but especially so in the business customer segment. Mercury's traditional policy of competing on price, rather than on the range and quality of service, has left it vulnerable to attack from powerful new entrants such as Worldcom and Energis, not to mention a revitalised BT. Over the past year, BT has successfully implemented price cuts designed to hurt Mercury, demonstrating how well BT has adapted to the new environment. The announced cost-cutting gives Mercury a chance to restore its competitiveness. The reduced cost base will help Mercury's profits momentum in the short term. But the medium-term future remains uncertain; and for those investors who do not share the euphoria about the development of Hongkong Telecom, C &amp; W's highly profitable Hong Kong subsidiary, the uncertainty over Mercury's strategy provides further good reason for selling the stock. The shares are down by 19 per cent against the market over the past 12 months, but the prospective yield is still a modest 3.3 per cent. This could rise sharply if investors sense that C &amp; W's growth stock rating is no longer deserved.</p>

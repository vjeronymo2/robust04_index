			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ida Martirosyan under the rubric "Parliament": </F> "'The People Are Much More Intelligent...' As Before, the  President Is for a Referendum"]    [Text] It can be said that the president's phrase about the  fact that "a compromise on this question is impossible" has  become paramount. One way or another the participants in the  debate returned to it, and I must admit that I continued to  expect that someone from the opposition would say something  like: "If the president will not compromise even on this  question, then what can be expected when his powers are  broadened?! This is in reference to a very sore subject--the  form of statehood: parliamentary or presidential. But although  such an acute extreme was not heard, the extreme wing of the  opposition in the person of Gagik Oganesyan (ARFD) [Armenian  Revolutionary Federation Dashnak] noted that contrary to the  thesis on the unacceptability of a compromise, it is exactly  what is needed, and exactly now. And that the instability is  exactly the result of the absence of a constitution. And,  consequently, to avoid it, and for the sake of preserving  stability; that is, in the interests of the people, a quicker  adoption of the constitution is necessary exactly at the price  of compromise. In his opinion, to submit all of the variants of  the constitution to the judgment of the people is inadvisable,  and it is necessary to arrive at a final draft through a  constitutional assembly, which will then submit it to a  referendum. This is really a compromise, judging by the fact  that Gagik Oganesyan emphasized that he agrees with this,  although he himself was always a supporter of parliamentary  rule. His comment on why the communists were laboring on the  creation of their own draft, when we have been living under  their constitution up until now, evoked an appropriate reaction  in the hall. Moreover, for the sake of fairness, it is necessary  to note that this was not simply a dig. "We had a very  democratic constitution and a very totalitarian regime." This  statement was a key to the future--the issue was not so much and  not only about how democratic and perfect the law is on paper as  about how it is being put into effect. That is, if the president  will be a dictator by nature, nothing will prevent him from  "crushing" the basic law as well, for which there are examples  in history. It is impossible to refute this conclusion either  logically or with reason, the role of personality in  history--contrary to what was taught in Soviet schools--is  unquestionable. Moreover, to some degree it is the personality  of the present leader that lies at the basis of conceptual  disagreements about the role of the president in the future  republic. Although it is obvious that the maximum perfection of  the law is in its "paper execution," nevertheless, there is a  guarantee of avoiding extremes, just as there is of putting the  laws into effect. Incidentally, the latter is so important that  it is difficult not to be amazed sometimes why there is all of  this strife mainly around the role of the president, and not  around the accuracy and clarity of other also significant  circumstances.    In this connection, it is difficult to disregard the speech  of Tigran Sarkisyan (NDU) [National Democratic Union].  Especially from the standpoint of the notorious parliamentary  professionalism. He noted the political aspect casually: Not one  of the submitted variants was perfect; therefore, it would be  more sensible to settle on a draft for a transition period, but  it will last for no less than 10 years, and it will be very  painful. As yet, the social strata and mechanisms have not been  formed--both economic and political--as a result of which there  is no clear expression of their interests, their defense, and  representation. Mr. Sarkisyan placed the main emphasis on the  economic block of drafts, which it was generally feasible to  expect from the leader of the finance-budgetary commission, and  it demonstrated a professional approach. Mr. Sarkisyan said that  the main flaw that was basic and common to all of the variants  of the constitution in the block that he subjected to analysis  was the sloganizing and the lack of accurate mechanisms. How  does a budget come up for examination, who approves it, and who  is responsible for it? It would seem that the government submits  it, but what it is--the government--is not clear in even one  variant. There is no list of its powers. What is more, as it  becomes clear, it is not parliament that determines its  structure. It turns out that both the structure and the  formation of the Cabinet of Ministers is the prerogative of the  government of this "something" that, nevertheless, possesses the  powers to prolong the adoption of a vitally important decision  for 30 days. Can the Supreme Soviet introduce changes to the  budget that is submitted by the government? But, after all, this  is an important point, as the last word--ratification--rests  with parliament. But this is not specified in the drafts. But  if, for example, the Supreme Soviet does not ratify the budget,  and the government works in the old way, then maybe this is  advantageous to it and it is what inspires or provokes  hostility. But where are the stipulated mechanisms of mutual  relations, the rights and duties, and the conditions of  ratification or no ratification? Mr. Sarkisyan's summary about  the need for a clear law on the government will hardly seem  unimportant to anyone. It is more likely that it is precisely  one of the elements for the "paper implementation" to be  absolutely correct, just as is the element of another also--when  the mechanisms are clearly designated, the probability of  "starting them up", that is, putting them into effect, is  increased significantly.    Rafik Mkhitaryan (KP) [Communist Party] in his speech turned  attention to a bone of contention. He admitted that, formally,  the draft, which was presented by the constitutional commission  of the Supreme Soviet (the so-called presidential draft) meets  the requirements of the standards. But the powers relegated to  the president, nonetheless, are increased to such an extent that  it will be necessary to rely on the personality, on the  "specific executor." If he turns out to be a reasonable person,  there will be no problems; otherwise, the specter of a  dictatorship will assume a very real outline. As for the draft  of the "six", then although it also proposes a "mixed"  government, the importance of the president is so formal that  one is at a loss as to why it should be kept in general, plus  maintain a necessary and large staff? Comrade Mkhitaryan is  confident: The "compromising" synthesis of the submitted  variants is unreasonable, and they should all be submitted to  the judgment of the people.    In light of the recent political "shocks" outside the walls  of the Supreme Soviet (the letter of the seven, which proposes a  split in the AOD [Armenian Pan National Movement], the work of  the commission on abuses in the upper echelons of authority,  etc.), one could launch into an analysis of why the  representative of the ruling party, contrary to the attitude of  the president on not compromising, called for the opposite?  However, although interesting this would deviate from the  subject. Nevertheless, Ter-Iusik Lazaryan noted that it would be  advisable to expand the constitutional commission by adding  representatives of the parties, factions, authors of all five  drafts, and once again to examine everything, and to synthesize  everything and submit a final variant for a decision by the  people.    The speech of Shavarsha Kocharyan (NDU)--for both  emotionality and, perhaps, for substance can be categorized as  extreme. It is true that at the beginning he noted that even the  variant of the "six" and also the presidential variant are  democratic in form, and the question, nevertheless, is which one  is preferable for us. As for the compromising "synthesized"  variant, it can lead to instability. The history of Turkey and  France are an example of this: According to the words of Mr.  Kocharyan, except for perhaps the United States, there is no  other model of a presidential government that would lead to  positive results. Consequently, there is no doubt, in fact, that  a definite struggle for power is concealed behind the debate on  the form of authority. In making the concluding remarks,  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan said that the four-day  debate convinced him of the correctness of the propositions  expressed by him on the first day of the discussions. The  president once again emphasized that he rules out compromise in  ideology. The Communist Party cannot reject communism, the ARF  [Armenian Revolutionary Federation] cannot reject the Ay Dat  [constitution], and the AOD and the Liberal Democrats cannot  reject the idea of private property.    Levon Ter-Petrosyan said: "If you want to make a salad out  of  this version of the constitution, then we will perish. The claim  that allegedly the people cannot accept the constitution is  cheap demagogy. Collectively, the people are much more  intelligent than everyone sitting here separately and taken  together." In the opinion of the president, the only way to  adopt the constitution is through a referendum. Today, the  Supreme Soviet can also make a determination on this question,  but if it does not cope with it, there are other legal avenues.  The president can gather 200,000 votes in favor of supporting a  referendum. However, L. Ter-Petrosyan called this an "extreme  means." He will be satisfied if the four-day meeting leads to  some definite result. One of the five variants should be  approved as a basis. In the event that the variant of the  constitutional commission is adopted, the president will agree  to an expansion of its staff, as was proposed by a number of  deputies. If there will be no approved variant, the  constitutional commission will have to yield its powers, and the  work will be continued by a new commission.    In the opinion of the head of the state, the variant of the  basic law developed by the constitutional commission can be  improved--he personally has reservations about this draft. L.  Ter-Petrosyan emphasized that out of the three proposals  submitted by Deputy Yuriy Sarkisyan, a member of the commission,  he accepts two--on the dissolution of parliament and on the  appointment of the prime minister. The question on the  appointment of the Supreme Court, which in this draft is  appointed for life, can be reconsidered.    The Armenian president emphasized that he has established  the  condition: After the adoption of the constitution, elections of  the new Supreme Soviet and president will be scheduled.    One way or another, if it is possible to put it this way,  the  strategy of the uncompromising compromise was victorious.  According to the results of the voting, it was decided to expand  the staff of the commission by adding political organizations  that have representatives in the Supreme Soviet, but that are  not represented on the constitutional commission.  Simultaneously, the speaker--B. Ararktsyan--was elected its  cochairman. A decision was also made to continue the work of the  special session to 27 June. The arena of battles seems to have  narrowed, but it is difficult to determine whether they will  become less uncompromising even after the compromising nature of  the adopted decision.</p>

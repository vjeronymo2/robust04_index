			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television The last in the current series of Business Matters (7.30 BBC2) asks a question which might be applied to television presenters or company chief executives: does it matter that a university lecturer should earn great wealth? The man in question is Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, said to be the world's highest paid academic. He advises companies, even countries, on how to be more competitive. The Climbers is a solid and sober yet highly entertaining series about mountaineering (8.00 BBC2). Today's subject is Reinhold Messner, the first man to conquer all 14 peaks over 8,000 m. Nomads is the first of four 60-minute documentaries about desert peoples. Today's programme shows the life of a family in Mauritania in the western Sahara (9.00). Guess what Channel 4's Check Out 92 decided was the most pressing subject at the start of a new series. The great British grocery rip-off? The British car price scandal? Nuts. Sexually explicit videos sold as educational aids is what's worrying the public champions down at the once worthy now not-so-minority channel. Just think of all the naughty pictures they will have to show us. Yummy yummy (10.00).</p>

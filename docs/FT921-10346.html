			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Opposition seeks a balance-sheet crock of gold: David Owen and John Willman explain how deft handling of borrowing could produce some spending magic IS LABOUR thinking of using magicians' tricks to mask the cost of the transport, housing and other infrastructural policies many of its spokesmen and women would like to implement? The party has lately shown much ingenuity in devising 'cost-free' schemes for achieving specific policy goals - for example, it proposes to trade part of the government's stake in the two non-nuclear electricity generating companies for control of the National Grid. Critics might say this week's suggestion that the party would like to redefine the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) smacks of an even greater desire for Labour to have its cake and eat it. For all its newly found rigour in economic management, Labour still harbours deep desires to increase public expenditure - and is attracted by 'off-balance-sheet' financing as a way of paying for it. The specific proposal alluded to on Tuesday by Mr Clive Soley, the party's housing spokesman, is for Labour to exclude from the definition of public-sector borrowing the recycling into housing investment of local-authority capital receipts from the sale of council houses. That would provide a crock of gold to fund an expansion in house building and repairs which Labour councils are itching to launch to help kick-start the economy. Any intention to change the definition of the PSBR was later denied by the party, which attempted to portray it as a gaffe by a junior spokesman. But it has the support of several frontbench spokesmen. Many policy advisers see the present rules as unnecessarily restricted, particularly in relation to borrowing for public-expenditure projects that would yield a stream of revenue to service the debt. Other changes - including separating current spending from capital investment for PSBR purposes - are also being assessed. A range of options for improving the access of public bodies such as British Rail and local authorities to private funding outside the PSBR is being explored. Labour is quick to insist that its intentions for the public accounts are not linked in any way to its spending proposals. Yet the party's argument would be more convincing if it had been able on Tuesday to agree its reasons for thinking some changes are necessary. Is it to make the figures more accurately reflect what is happening in the underlying economy or to make UK practice conform with Europe and North America? The latter may be a necessary step for any government in the aftermath of the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union. Among the terms for monetary union is a condition that 'general government borrowing' should not exceed 3 per cent of GDP. That definition of public borrowing is more restrictive than that of the PSBR - it excludes borrowing for commercial operations, for example. If the UK is not to be more severely constrained than other EC countries by the terms for monetary union, a redefinition of the PSBR may be necessary, regardless of the party in power. There are other good reasons for bringing British public accounting practices into closer harmony with international standards. A recent report by Arthur Andersen, the audit and accountancy group, argues that UK investment is low in comparison with its continental counterparts and that UK government debt is among the lowest in Europe. The report suggests that an audit based on commercial accounting principles would show that the case for lifting government borrowing to finance investment appeared stronger in Britain than elsewhere. That view would certainly be music to the ears of politicians seeking to increase public expenditure. In short, a sound case for public-accounts reform could be constructed by who ever resolved to grasp the nettle. Financing the future. Arthur Andersen, 1 Surrey Street, London WC2R 2PS.

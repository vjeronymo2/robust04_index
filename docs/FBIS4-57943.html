			<p>BFN     [Text] Provisional President Emile Jonassaint met with  about 30 senators and deputies at the National Palace from 1530  to 1700 on 25 May on issues concerning the Haitian parliament.  According to a press release from the special cabinet of the  provisional president of the Republic, the representatives  elected by the people touched on problems relating to the  parliamentary institution and to issues concerning their  constituencies.    The summit of the Army High Command should also be  mentioned.  A source close to the military command advised us that  high-ranking officers of the Haitian Armed Forces and those in  charge of units and garrisons in both Port-au-Prince and  provincial towns met on 24 May at Army Headquarters. This  meeting lasted several hours, focusing on major issues,  according to our source, which indicates that both the Haitian  situation and the international matter were broached.    The management of the country under the United Nations total  embargo, the curb on the clandestine emigration of boat people,  and the Army's improvement of the judicial system were the three  main topics discussed in this meeting, presided over by Army  chief, General Cedras. The military also discussed the Army's  response in case of foreign military intervention, but this  subject was the eighth of 11 points discussed during this  meeting, which lasted several hours.    Gen. Cedras was surrounded by the Army High Command,  commanders of the country's nine departments, the navy,  aviation, engineering, communications, health, and anti-drug  representatives. The intensification of the fight against drug  trafficking and crime was also part of the agenda during this  important meeting of the Haitian Army High Command.</p>

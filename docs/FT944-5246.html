			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Call for change to accounts degrees A research report published today by the Association of Certified Accountants calls for an urgent review of undergraduate accounting courses. The authors claim that courses 'have merely pandered to students' expectations of an accounting degree as a preliminary - and thus perceived necessary - stage of professional accountancy training'. The report says that it is wrong to allow the curriculum to be dominated by what it calls 'technicist' views which prepare the students to enter professional training in one of the Big Six accountancy firms. 'The fact is that opportunities for graduates to enter into professional accountancy training through the Big Six are rapidly shrinking with those from the 'new' universities being particularly affected,' say the authors. They put forward an alternative approach based on accounting studies rooted in social science - accounting which would look beyond profit and loss to aspects such as environmental and social impact. The authors, accountancy academics, also argue that those students equipped with such a broader accounting education would be better suited to enter the Big Six. 'Current accounting degrees, the core content of which appears to be largely watered down versions of the professional syllabus, do not achieve this,' they say.

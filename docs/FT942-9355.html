			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / EDS and Sprint talks may lead to 'merger of equals' General Motors said yesterday it was considering spinning off its Electronic Data Systems subsidiary to pave the way for a possible merger or strategic alliance between EDS and Sprint, the US telecommunications group. EDS and Sprint simultaneously confirmed that they were in talks which could lead to a 'merger of equals' or other type of alliance. A marriage between EDS, the world's largest computing services company, and Sprint, the third largest long-distance US carrier, would create an information services powerhouse, with annual revenues of more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.3bn). GM said EDS would best be able to pursue a strategic alliance if it were an independent company. EDS has held discussions with numerous potential telecommunications partners in recent years - including British Telecom - but has found it hard to clinch an alliance because of its unusual ownership structure. GM, which acquired the company in 1984 from its founder, Mr Ross Perot, retains ownership of its assets, but holders of a special type of GM stock, known as class E, have a claim on EDS's dividend stream. GM said yesterday it was considering spinning off ownership of EDS to class E stockholders through an exchange of shares, provided this transaction was tax-free. GM bought EDS for Dollars 2.5bn, but the company now has a market value of about Dollars 15bn, so sale of the group could trigger a large tax liability. It will be up to the US Internal Revenue service to decide whether the spin-off is for legitimate business purposes rather than tax avoidance. GM said the spin-off would be dependent on two other factors. It must be able to conclude a plan, announced last week, to inject the remaining Dollars 6bn of class E stock held by its treasury into its underfunded pension plan; and the spin-off must not result in a recapitalisation of E shares into GM common stock at a 120 per cent exchange ratio, as provided for under the group's certificate of incorporation. EDS and Sprint emphasised that many issues remained to be resolved in their merger discussions. But Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of EDS, and Mr William Esrey, chairman of Sprint, said the two companies had the opportunity to 'create a single source for products and services to meet the converging information and communications needs of customers'. EDS's strength in the large business market would help Sprint expand here, while Sprint's presence in the consumer market would allow EDS to develop products for the individual. Shares in Sprint jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to close the day at Dollars 37 3/4 while E class stock was up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 34 1/2 . GM slipped from Dollars 53 1/2 to Dollars 53.

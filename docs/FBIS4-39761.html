			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- Russia's military budget is to be  revised, Major General Vladimir Osadchiy, a high-ranking  spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry, told Itar-Tass today.    According to him, the 40.6 trillion rubles allocated for  military spending by the State Duma represents a threat to the  national security of the armed forces. "The defense budget will  not find support in the upper chamber of parliament, and  discussion of this pressing problem will be continued," Major  General Vladimir Osadchiy noted. In so doing, he cited public  remarks made on this issue by Vladimir Shumeyko and the  statement by Petr Shurshov, chairman of the Federation Council  security and defense committee, who said the upper chamber would  not approve a military budget of less than 55 trillion rubles.</p>

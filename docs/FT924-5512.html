			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Chairman of fund manager Henderson Administration quits MR David Backhouse, chairman of fund managers Henderson Administration, resigned suddenly yesterday, saying that regulators have questioned his activities as managing director of a small bank which went into administration two years ago. 'The reasons for my resignation are unconnected with Henderson,' Mr Backhouse said. 'I was managing director of Authority Bank between August 1986 and April 1990. Regulatory bodies have recently expressed concern with my own role during this period,' he said in a statement issued through a firm of solicitors. While Mr Backhouse did not specify which regulators were involved, it is believed to be the Bank of England which had regulatory authority for the bank. Mr Backhouse, who comes from a well-connected City family, also resigned as a director of Witan Investment Company. He said that while he intended to 'respond fully' to regulators' concerns, it would not be in Henderson's best interests to remain its chairman while he did so. Mr Benjamin Wrey, Henderson's deputy chairman who is to replace Mr Backhouse, said that the firm immediately notified Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, of his actions. The move, he said, came at a regularly scheduled board meeting yesterday morning and directors had no inkling of the affair until shortly before then. Authority Bank went into administration on December 11 1990 with assets of more than Pounds 40m. Its creditors were said to be mostly Latin American depositors, although payments have been made to UK depositors by the Bank of England-run Deposit Protection Board. The bank was a subsidiary of Authority Investments, a quoted company also in administration. Henderson had been a big investor in Authority Investments. Henderson, which has recently announced plans to acquire investment trust company Touche Remnant from Societe Generale, said that the resignation will have no effect on the merger. Mr Paul Manduca, chairman of Touche Remnant, said: 'Our negotiations with Henderson are proceeding well and I don't see David's unfortunate departure has any bearing on the process.'</p>

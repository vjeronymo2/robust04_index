			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UDM told cost-cutting in collieries will continue THE UNION of Democratic Mineworkers was warned yesterday that a successful employee buy-out of British Coal would not reduce the need for continued cost-cutting in the industry. Mr Albert Wheeler, British Coal deputy chairman, said that, in spite of a reduction of 33 per cent in deep-mine operating costs over six years, longer underground shifts were needed, plus the virtual abolition of national bargaining in favour of agreements suited to each colliery. Mr Wheeler told the UDM national conference in Weymouth: 'We must question whether national arrangements and national rates can give us the flexibility to meet our needs.' He pointed out that 22 per cent of miners' earnings already came from local deals. Mr Wheeler advocated six-day working, with one week off in four - as practised at the new Asfordby mine in Leicestershire - for all collieries. The UDM, which broke away from the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984-85 strike and now represents about a third of British coalminers, is keen to lead a possible employee buy-out, or part buy-out, of the soon-to-be-privatised corporation. Mr Roy Lynk, UDM president, said he had recently held informal meetings with the British Association of Colliery Managers to discuss buy-out plans, but he insisted: 'They have to join our consortium.' Mr Lynk, who has previously warned that many senior managers would be replaced in the event of a successful buy-out, envisages an employee stake of at least 25 per cent. He is keen to attract individual members of the National Union of Mineworkers, even though the NUM leadership remains strongly opposed to the plan. In spite of moral and financial support from the government for a UDM-led employee stake, it is not certain to succeed. The value of the corporation and the number of pits likely to survive privatisation remain uncertain. Mr Wheeler warned yesterday that, without a satisfactory outcome in negotiations with the electricity industry, British Coal's biggest customer, 'there will be little of value in the business to privatise'. The generators at present buy 65m tonnes a year, which is likely to fall to 45m, declining eventually to 30m.</p>

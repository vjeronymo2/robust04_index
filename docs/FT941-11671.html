			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / People: Porter Chadburn Tony Philipson, 47, has been appointed group chief executive of Porter Chadburn, the consumer products and packaging company. He replaces Raymond Dinkin who left in December after a run of poor results saw the share price fall from 300p in 1987 to a low of 14p last month. A graduate of Nottingham University, Philipson spent the 1970s at graphic arts company Letraset before moving to Pritchard, the industrial services group, in 1982. But it will be his performance at Savage Group, the hardware supplier, where he has been chief executive since 1991, that will hold most appeal for Porter Chadburn's shareholders. When he took the helm, the company had a market capitalisation of Pounds 12m. Two and a half years later, it was sold to Midlands manufacturer, McKechnie, for Pounds 48m. The key to that success was the elimination of losses in international subsidiaries, an interest he will be able to maintain at Porter Chadburn, whose US labelling business has continued to disappoint.</p>

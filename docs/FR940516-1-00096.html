			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The manufacturer would be required to conduct emission tests of selected engine(s) using the proposed test procedure discussed herein. Finally, the proposed rule does provide for Administrator approval of special test procedures if the small SI engine is not capable of being satisfactorily tested under the proposed test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 15.

One cycle would be for all Class III, IV, and V engines (Cycle C), while two cycles would be possible for Class I and II engines (Cycles A and B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cycle B would only be used for those Class I and II engine families in which 100 percent of the engines were sold with a governor which maintained engine speed within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  two percent of rated speed (rated speed means the speed at which the manufacturer specifies the maximum rated power of an engine) under all operating conditions. Cycle B would be a 6-mode steady state cycle consisting of five power modes at rated speed and one no-load mode at idle speed. For all other Class I and II engines, the test cycle to be used would be Cycle A. Cycle A would be identical to Cycle B, except the five power modes would be run at intermediate engine speed (intermediate speed is defined as 85 percent of rated speed).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Class III, IV, and V engines, the engine manufacturer would be required to use Cycle C. Cycle C is a 2-mode steady state cycle consisting of one power mode (at rated speed) and one no-load mode at idle speed. The test modes for each cycle would be run in a prescribed order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three test cycles (modes and power settings) documented in the proposed regulations are based on work performed by the Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE) Small Engine Committee. The SAE Small Engine Committee has published a recommended practice for measuring gaseous exhaust emissions from small utility engines typically less than 20 kW. This recommended procedure is known as SAE J1088. Test Cycles A, B, and C are all taken from J1088. The mode weighting factors are taken from work performed by CARB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has published recommended test cycles for measuring exhaust emissions from reciprocating internal combustion engines. Recommended exhaust gas measurement procedures and test cycles for reciprocating internal combustion engines are contained in ISO 8178, Part 4. ISO has three test cycles for spark-ignition engines less than 20 kW termed G1, G2, and G3 which are identical to SAE Cycles A, B, and C, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the proposed test procedures are adequate for the proposed emission standards. The purpose of a certification test procedure is to adequately represent the emission levels produced by the test engine when it is used in actual operation. The test procedure in this proposed rule does this. The 6-mode test cycles (Cycle A and Cycle B) used for Class I and II engines and the 2-mode cycle (Cycle C) used for Class III, IV, and V engines were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineer's Small Engine Committee to cover the broad range of engine operating conditions seen by small engines. The weighting factors were developed by CARB using data supplied by the small engine industry. The weighting factors are intended to be representative of the modes (speed and power conditions) used by the broad range of small gasoline engines. The Agency believes these weighting factors are sufficient for this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The methods used to measure the gaseous emissions of HC, CO, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for all small engines would be independent of the type of engine and test cycle. EPA proposes to allow manufacturers to sample emissions using either the Raw Gas Method (raw) or the Constant Volume Sampling Method (CVS). Using either method, each test engine would be stabilized at each mode before emission measurement began. After stabilizing the power output during each mode, the concentration of each pollutant, exhaust volume, and fuel flow would be determined. The measured values would be weighted and then used to calculate the grams of exhaust pollutant emitted per kilowatt-hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAE J1088 contains a recommended procedure for the measurement of gaseous emissions using the Raw Gas Method. A recommended testing procedure, such as SAE J1088 or ISO 8178, by definition allows sufficient flexibility for individual manufacturers to develop unique features in their test procedures while still being within the allowable guidance. This flexibility is not a desirable feature in a regulatory program where both manufacturers and EPA want to ensure uniformity between test labs, since conformity and compliance testing decisions are binding on the parties involved. For this reason, the test procedures proposed by EPA are not identical to SAE J1088 or ISO 8178, but are compatible with those procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA understands the importance of compatibility between the EPA proposed test procedures and those used to demonstrate emission compliance for other regulatory agencies within the U.S. and throughout the world. Compatibility allows a manufacturer to exercise the cost efficiencies of using one engine configuration to demonstrate emission compliance in more than one market. EPA has tried to establish a test procedure that is compatible with both CARB's utility engine test procedure and with ISO 8178. As a result, EPA expects that a manufacturer using the resultant EPA procedure would also meet the CARB and ISO requirements. However, since the SAE and ISO procedures are recommended practices and do not have stringent test parameter tolerances, a manufacturer using the SAE or ISO procedure may or may not meet EPA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

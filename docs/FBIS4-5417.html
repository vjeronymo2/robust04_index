			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- New party Sakigake, one of  the seven coalition parties, unveiled a policy platform Monday  with a proposal to reorganize the political landscape from  scratch with political, administrative and economic reforms as  top priorities.    The policy platform said a new government to succeed that of  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be drawn up "on  a blank sheet of paper."    The new government should be free from the framework of the  current coalition that excludes the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), currently the primary opposition party.    Party leader and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura,  however, told a news conference that Sakigake, which has 15  members in the House of Representatives, will not join a  government "under the leadership of the present LDP."    Sakigake's deputy chief, Shusei Tanaka, said, "This is not  an  appeal to the LDP for participation in a government."    Sakigake (Harbinger) outlined its goals for the next  government as coalition members struggled to come up with a new  premier following Hosokawa's abrupt resignation announcement  Friday.    It also stipulated that the new government should observe  the  war-renouncing constitution and firmly resolve not to turn Japan  into a major political or military power.    Sakigake's basic stance is in stark contrast to the vision  of  Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's chief strategist and cofounder of  the alliance's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party).    Ozawa wants Japan's Self-Defense Forces to play a more  active  role in UN peacekeeping activities.    Given that the Hosokawa administration faltered over a  financial scandal, Sakigake's platform said the next government  has a special obligation to live up to reform pledges.    It also urged a more democratic and more transparent policy-  making process.    Last August the LDP was ousted after 38 years in power when  Sakigake and Shinseito, whose members are former LDP  parliamentarians, joined five other parties to form the  coalition. The LDP failed to win a majority in July's general  election.    The seven ruling coalition parties remain divided over how  to  pick a successor to Hosokawa.    Hosokawa declared his intention to resign last Friday to  assume responsibility for involvement in scandals pertaining to  his finances, and to break a deadlock in the Diet that had  brought debate over the fiscal 1994 budget to a standstill.    A rift is growing among the fractious coalition components,  splitting the parties into two blocs. One comprises Shinseito,  Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP). The other  consists of the largest component of the coalition, the Social  Democratic Party (SDP), along with the Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP) and Sakigake.    Shinseito and Komeito will soon join a new parliamentary  group in the lower house established last Friday by the JNP.  The SDP, the DSP and Sakigake have said they will not  participate in the group because they fear it will be dominated  by Shinseito and Komeito, official sources said.    Shinseito and Komeito envisage forming a new party, while  the  SDP, the DSP and Sakigake favor a multiparty system, but with  fewer parties than at present, they said.</p>

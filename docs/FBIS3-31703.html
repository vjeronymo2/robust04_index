			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 22 (AFP) -- The international community  has tolerated massive violations of human rights and  international humanitarian law in Bosnia-Hercegovina, according  to a strongly-worded United Nations report released Tuesday.    "The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in particular in  Bosnia-Herzegovina have once again proved that human rights only  play a secondary role in the context of international politics,"  the latest report by the UN Human Rights Commission's special  rapporteur commented.    Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former Polish prime minister who has  been compiling reports on former Yugoslavia since August 1992,  said humanitarian efforts had not compensated for what he termed  "political inertia" and called for the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) to be allowed to intervene more actively.    "A number of formal steps which have been undertaken may be  considered as a substitute or excuse for political inertia....  The enormous efforts and sacrifices of the field officers of  the various international agencies have not compensated for that  policy," he argued.    "Such a policy undermines some of the most fundamental  principles upon which international law and the system of human  rights protection have been built," he concluded.    Mazowiecki acknowledged that he had not been able to achieve  his main objectives of offering effective assistance to victims  and of reducing the massive scale of the violations of human  rights and urged that UNPROFOR be given a more active mandate.    "UNPROFOR forces have not been effectively empowered to  intervene to protect against human rights violations as they  occur and have been forced to observe passively many serious  breaches of international humanitarian law owing to the  inadequacy of their mandate and resources."    He particularly accused Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats of  exploiting humanitarian aid "as an element in a political game."    Although aid continues to get through by road, there are  frequently massive delays at Bosnian Serb checkpoints, he noted.    He also denounced the plan for Bosnia put forward last  September by the international mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg  (UN) and Lord Owen (European Community), saying the proposals  for partition represented "an absolute repudiation" of his most  basic recommendations.    Mazowiecki, who published five reports last year, emphasised  that "this warning has been ignored by the international  community" and that all this time, ethnic cleansing has  continued without any respite.</p>

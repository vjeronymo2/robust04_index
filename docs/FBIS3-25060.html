			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nick Olivari] </F>   [Excerpts] In the main street of Ottosdal, the Vierkleur  [flag of the former Transvaal Republic, now used by right-wing  groups] was flying high this week. The Western Transvaal  farming town lies in the heart of an area that has seen at least  29 sabotage attempts on train lines, ANC offices, power pylons  and private property in the past two months. [passage omitted]    This week, intelligence sources said the rightwingers  responsible for the sabotage campaign that has included targets  in the PWV [Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging] area, the Free  State and the Western Transvaal, had clearly modelled themselves  on the IRA. Using cells of only one or two members, they are  completely independent and operate without orders.    ANC organiser Moses Mothupi said Wednesday's attack on the  organisation's offices in Letsopa was a retaliatory raid for the  distribution of ANC election posters the week before.  Neighbours said they neither heard nor saw anything of the  blast, though several residents had heard rumours of a  mysterious white minibus cruising the township streets the night  before. In Ottesdal itself, the townsfolk say it's too early to  say who was behind he blast -- but they wouldn't be surprised if  it was the ANC themselves.    The police in the Western Transvaal say they have had no  luck  so far in identifying anyone in connection with the spate of  blasts in the area. Intelligence sources said they doubted any  arrests would be made "unless the police get lucky."  Intelligence officers are combing thousands of files in an  attempt to identify radical rightwingers, but they frankly admit  there is little chance of stopping the saboteurs unless a cell  can be infiltrated -- something that has proved difficult in  recent months.    The explosives used include home-made devices concocted from  diesel fuel and fertiliser, but commercial explosives have also  been used in several blasts. One intelligence source said  outdated stock from mines was the main source.    Security forces are desperate to put an end to the bombings  -- but intelligence sources say the right wing has the  capability to "completely disrupt this country -- and there is  little we can do about it".    "We don't have a plan to combat them, we are undermanned and  our biggest problem is that everything we do gets leaked to them  in advance," said one frustrated senior SADF [South African  Defence Force] source, who believes the rightwing campaign will  "get worse" as the election date nears.</p>

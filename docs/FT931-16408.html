			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Brown wants to lead US trade policy MR Ron Brown, the commerce secretary-nominee for the Clinton administration, yesterday moved quickly to assert his predominance over US trade policy and promised to become 'a forceful advocate' for US technology and economic development. The man who, as chairman of the Democratic party, paved the way for the election of a Democratic president, went on to demonstrate mastery of the many trade and industrial issues. Mr Brown is the first Clinton nominee to come up for confirmation hearings. He said that his department would be 'the lead agency on trade policy,' by implication defining the role of Mr Mickey Kantor, the nominee for US trade representative, as the official who simply 'negotiates agreements'. Unlike his Republican predecessors, Mr Brown clearly will not allow ideological restraints to enfeeble him. The department will fund 'targeted, innovative programmes' to spur technology development, and he hopes to play 'a large role' in defence conversion. 'The question before us is how best to design trade, technology and development policies, not theoretical arguments about whether we ought to have those policies,' he said. 'Action, not ideology, will be my watchword.' He had tough words for trade law enforcement. 'I think we have to stop getting rolled.' In another departure from the Republican administration, he promised to back barter 'as a vehicle for improving our ability to trade,' particularly with Russia and other countries which have little hard currency. More like his predecessors, he talked about a private-sector-led partnership between industry and government, but he seemed to have the will and the wiles to achieve this goal. Mr Brown smoothly confronted questions about his career as a Washington lobbyist, when his clients included American subsidiaries of Japanese electronics companies and the government of Haiti. Senator Trent Lott, the member designated by Republicans to make Democratic nominees uncomfortable, asked Mr Brown if his work for 'special interests' and his insider status did not 'perhaps send the wrong message as we begin with this. . . administration?' 'I think it sends the right message,' Mr Brown shot back. 'I think it sends the message that I'm someone who is a good advocate and gets things done.'</p>

Heavy financial input and raw material consumption have  helped maintain China's high economic growth as well as giving  rise to heavy pollution, said Qu, head of the Environment  Committee of the National People's Congress, in Environment  Protection [HUANJING BAOHU] magazine.    Despite significant progress, China's industrial efficiency  in recent years still lags behind that of developed countries.    To produce the same amount of industrial products, China  uses  five to 10 times more water than developed nations, Qu said.    Authorities have not fully recognized the importance of  environmental protection in drafting economic plans.    Priority has been given to increasing the input of raw  materials and energy, while encouraging low energy consumption  and low pollution has been largely ignored.    China can no longer afford this model, Qu said.    First, resource reserves are limited. China's per capita  water availability is only a quarter of the world average; per  capita land area is only one-third of the global level; and per  capita mineral resources only account for half the world average.    With population growth and economic development, the  shortage  of resources will only become more acute.    If measures are not taken to raise efficiency, production  costs will rise and industrial development will be handicapped,  Qu said.    The environment has become an important concern in the  world.  Pollution control and environmental protection regulations have  been included in many international trade laws, with possible  sanctions against nations with poor environmental performances.    And China, increasingly dependent upon foreign trade, must  abide by international laws.    Qu suggested that China speed up its industrial, structural  reshuffle and technological renovation to reduce pollution.    One method would be to increase the number of nonpolluting  industries, such as the service sector.    Another method would be to reduce the consumption of energy  and raw materials. Pollutants should be recycled, treated or  stored to create a more efficient consumption.    Qu also called for increased government funding to fight  pollution because environmental protection has become very  costly.    The government should try to allocate 1 to 1.5 percent of  its  GNP to protecting the environment. Presently the figure is only  0.7 percent.    And environmental investment is very profitable. For every  100 yuan of investment, 600 yuan of profit could be generated.    The State might not be able to afford the increased  expenditures, Qu said, but spending cuts should come from other  portions of the budget to finance environmental protection.    More money earmarked for industrial projects should be given  to environmental protection. The government should demand that  8 to 10 percent of new industrial investment go to environmental  protection, instead of the present 4.5 percent.    The government can also raise standards for pollutant  discharge, Qu said, adding that low standards partly explain why  many businesses are not eager to fight pollution.    The government needs to adjust financial policies to make it  easier for the environmental protection projects to get bank  loans.</p>

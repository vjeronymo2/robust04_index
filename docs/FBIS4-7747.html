			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, at Villa Lac-2, Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic held talks with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu. The talks were attended by the ambassador of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] to Bucharest.    A press release that was faxed to us a short while ago says  that during their talks President Slobodan Milosevic -- after  outlining the high level reached in bilateral relations before  the introduction of economic sanctions against the FRY --  expressed his conviction that those sanctions will soon be  lifted because, considering the recent evolution of the  political situation in that area, they are no longer justified.  Anticipating that moment, impatiently looked forward to not only  by Serbia but also by its neighbors, who are severely affected  by the embargo imposed by the international community, it is  necessary that ways of cultural, scientific, and educational  cooperation should be examined now, whereas after the partial or  total lifting of the sanctions cooperation between Serbia and  Romania should also be extended to industry, investments,  finance, and commerce, so that within a short time the level of  bilateral exchanges should equal or surpass the previous levels,  the guest stressed.    In turn, Vacaroiu pointed out that Romania has strictly  observed the international embargo imposed on the FRY but it  also consequently acted by intervening at international fora for  the reduction of the level of those sanctions, especially  considering recent political evolutions that give reason to hope  for the peaceful settlement of the conflicts that broke out out  with the dismembering of the former Yugoslav Federation. The  consequences of the embargo were drastic for Romania as well,  especially because they came in addition to the difficulties  emerged in the process of economic reform and industrial  restructuring currently under way in our country. A number of  enterprises, the Romanian prime minister emphasized, which used  to work in cooperation with Serbian firms had to suspend their  activity, which accentuated the decline of our industrial  production and amplified unemployment.    During their meeting, the parties agreed to examine, at the  level of a joint commission, possibilities of resuming, as soon  as possible, bilateral economic and commercial relations, once  the level of the international sanctions imposed on the FRY is  diminished or the sanctions are totally lifted.</p>

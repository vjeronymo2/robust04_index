			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- Croats expelled by the  Muslims from Zenica, Muslim-held city in central  Bosnia-Herzegovina, are arriving each day in the region of the  Lasva river valley, the Croatian radio reported on Thursday. The  radio said that the wave of ethnic cleansing of Croats has  gained in intensity especially after March 18 when the Bosnian  Croats and Muslims submitted to U.S. pressure in Washington and  signed an agreement on setting up a joint federation in Bosnia.  Some 1,500 Croats from Zenica fled to Vitez, Busovaca, Novi  Travnik and Nova Bila (all Croat-held towns in central Bosnia),  the Croatian radio said.    The realization of the agreement on the Muslim-Croat  federation has been slow although both sides, which met in  Vienna this week, agreed the borders of the ethnic cantons  within the future state and that its first president is a  Bosnian Croat. Despite the agreement, Bosnian Muslim leader  Alija Izetbegovic has said he would continue to head  Bosnia-Herzegovina. I will remain the president of the  Presidency -- the only body which should symbolize the  continuation of the state as a whole, Izetbegovic told Sarajevo  television on Wednesday evening. He said that this should not  present a problem in relations with the Croats because after six  months a Muslim should become the head of the Muslim-Croat  federation.    On Wednesday the Bosnian Croats and Muslims closed their  five-day talks by reaching agreement on the ethnic division  within the future federation, which will spread on 30 percent of  Bosnian territory, by planning to extend their cantons at the  expense of the Serb territories in this ex-Yugoslav republic.  The two sides' plan for their federation to include 58 percent  of Bosnia practically announced new offensive actions on  territories currently controlled by the Bosnian Serbs. The  Muslim-Croat offensives on Serb territories in Bosnia are  already underway in northern and eastern Bosnia.</p>

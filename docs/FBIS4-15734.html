			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Igor Rostovtsev; From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] This air strike has become the  first occurrence of using NATO combat airplanes against  ground-based targets in Bosnia. Though in purely military terms  this operation can be described as small-scale, its political  reverberations have been far stronger. It was stated that the  United Nation's priority was to ensure the safety of the  international forces stationed in the crisis area; however,  there were civilian casualties. The Serbs will not be  intimidated, they reserve the right to defend themselves using  all the weapons at their disposal, says the statement of the  high command of the Serb republic.    Can this attack mean the start of a wide international  confrontation with the Bosnian Serbs? No doubt the decision to  strike or not to strike, as, incidentally, it is the case in  adopting any other tough measures, is within the competence of  the United Nations.    That is why one is bewildered by the fact that such actions  are being implemented without a proper agreement with all its  members. How else can one interpret the fact that no  consultations had been held before the bombardment between  Russia and the United States -- the two countries that should of  course act in consensus in order to restore peace in former  Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. Grosskinsky, B. Baeumlisberger, B. Schindler: </F> "The Test"]    [Text] For their grandfathers it was a vision, for their  grandchildren a bit of reality: united Europe. On 12 June,  Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer will decide on the makeup  of the next European Parliament.    Whom the grandsons will vote for is no secret. The Frenchman  will vote for "the other Europe." No surprise, since the  descendant of the great general is himself running for this  bourgeois ticket that has a strong nationalist bias. Konrad  Adenauer will probably back his grandfather's party, which he  wants to represent in the Cologne City Council in October. How  the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the other German  parties will do in the European election has been examined by  the Basis Research Institute between 16 and 20 May exclusively  for FOCUS.    Only three of 26 parties (23 nationwide, the CDU with 15  land  tickets, in Bavaria the Christian Social Union [CSU], the German  Family Party in the Saarland) can be certain that they will be  represented in the European Parliament: CDU/CSU, SPD, and  Alliance 90/Greens.    The CDU/CSU and the SPD come neck-and-neck when people are  asked: "Whom would you vote for if the European election were  held next Sunday?" Of the approximately 1,500 citizens in  eastern and western Germany who were asked in the middle of May,  38.5 percent opted for the two major parties each. A possible  explanation for this stalemate: What the two parties say in  connection with Europe is only marginally different. Peace,  internal security, and jobs are the main issues. Alliance  90/Greens follows with a clear margin: 8.5 percent.    June 12 will be thrilling for the CSU. Because the number of  people entitled to vote increased by 15 million since the  conclusion of German unity, the 5-percent hurdle is now higher  for the CSU. So for them it is decisive to mobilize as many  voters as possible in Bavaria to prevent a landslide as in 1989,  when the CSU lost 11.8 percent compared to the 1984 European  election, even though in absolute terms it scored 216,000 votes  more.    If, say, the turnout is 62 percent at the national level,  but  only 51 percent in Bavaria, the CSU will need some 42.5 percent  of the Bavarian votes. "No problem," says Ingo Friedrich, the  always optimistic leading CSU candidate. "Realistically," he  anticipates "45 percent plus x," even though CSU Chairman Theo  Waigel has set a higher goal -- "50 percent plus x." Not  without reason: For the CSU it may become difficult to get in  if, as a result of the many local elections to be held on the  same day, the voter turnout is very high at the federal level.  There is agreement within the CSU leadership on one thing: It  would be a "fatal signal" for the Landtag election on 25  September if the party were to be thrown out of the Strasbourg  Parliament.    In the 1994 super election year, the European election is  going to be a test for the Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP]. With a projected score of 4.5 percent, its reentry into  the European Parliament is touch and go. The FDP might still  manage to get in again, but there is a serious danger that it  will not. The argument that the FDP is needed as a party that  can help create a majority is irrelevant on 12 June. Europe's  citizens only elect a parliament --not a government.    The situation is particularly sensitive for leading  candidate  Uta Wuerfel. "On principle, I do not make any predictions  regarding the election result," Wuerfel, who is one of the very  few really prominent German candidates for the European  Parliament, said. She knows what is at stake. "For the FDP  this election is of particular importance. It is not merely a  question of the liberal voice in the European Parliament," but  the voters will determine Europe's future course.    There is also more at stake for Uta Wuerfel personally: If  the FDP were to fail she would have to look for a new job. She  will not run again for the Bundestag, and she rejected a  position in the party presidium. Moreover, the FDP must refute  the downward trend that has been projected for the Bundestag  election.    The smaller parties and Maastricht opponents who want to  mobilize protest voters in the European election will stand no  chance. The Republikaner, who scored 7.1 percent in the last  election, are currently projected to score 2 percent. The Party  of Democratic Socialism [PDS], which is running for the first  time in the European election, stands at 4 percent. All others  -- from Manfred Brunner's "Alliance of Free Citizens" to the  Instead Party and the "Ungovernable" -- can count on no more  than 4 percent together.    The Federal Government and the Bundestag, the European  Parliament and the German mission of the EU Commission have  spent no less than 14 million German marks [DM] to mobilize  Germans for the 12 June poll. Not without reason: "In the view  of the citizens, the European election is of rather little  importance," Werner Langen, leading candidate in  Rhineland-Palatinate complains. Langen has so far been the head  of the CDU Land group, and now replaced longstanding European  Parliament President Egon Klepsch at the top of the ticket, has  noticed a "certain tiredness with Europe" on the part of the  Germans. Claudia Roth, number one of the Greens, even speaks of  "disenchantment with Europe."    Yet, the FOCUS survey has not confirmed these assessments.  The expected turnout of approximately 63 percent is slightly  superior to that of 1989, while as many as 69 percent even said  that they intend to participate in the vote. What is more,  two-thirds are in favor of a united Europe and regard Germany's  membership in the European Union [EU] as "a good thing," even  though one cannot ignore the differences between east and west:  People asked in the old laender are significantly more  enthusiastic about Europe than east Germans (72 and 69 percent  in the west, compared to 45 and 52 percent in the east).    So is the European election more than just a token election?  This is certainly what the candidates would say. Bundestag  deputy Peter Kittelmann, nominated as number one by the Berlin  CDU group, points to the "process of continual expansion of  powers of the parliament since the first direct election in  1979," such as the right to codecision in the lawmaking process  and the establishment of commissions, which has become possible  since Maastricht.    Yet, what SPD leading candidate Klaus Haensch has to say on  the importance of the European election will probably play a  much more significant role for the Germans: "The German parties  know that the election result will set trends for all elections  of the year. This is why 12 June is being taken so seriously."</p>

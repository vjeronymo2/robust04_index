			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLU BASEBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> HILL WANTS TEAM AS COMPANY FOR PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Rich Hill attended the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3  baseball playoffs last year but not in the capacity he would have liked -- as  coach of the Cal Lutheran baseball team.  </P> <P> Hill was put in the awkward position of having to help administrate a  tournament in which his Kingsmen had no involvement. Cal Lutheran failed to  qualify for the district playoffs after finishing in a tie for third in the  Golden State Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> "Being there without my team was one of the toughest things I have had to deal  with as a coach," said Hill, who is beginning his second season with Cal  Lutheran. "We had the talent to be there, but we just did not execute in the  last 10 games.  </P> <P> "All I kept thinking was that I could not wait until next year."  </P> <P> The Kingsmen will have to improve in several key areas this season if they are  going to improve on their 20-23 record and compete with perennial Golden State  Athletic Conference powers such as Westmont College. CLU was 13-11 in  conference play last season.  </P> <P> Fortunately for Hill, Cal Lutheran has a month of preseason games before  opening conference play against Christ College on March 4.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran will need a month to solidify a pitching staff that is headed by  senior right-handed reliever Jay Anderson, the Kingsmen's top returning  pitcher. Joining Anderson, who had a 2-3 record and a 4.67 earned-run average  last year, will be right-handers Mike Clark from Pierce College, Craig Anderson  from Golden West College and Dean Martinez (7-5 at Saddleback College).  </P> <P> The Kingsmen also picked up junior Devon Schutzler, a left-handed  pitcher-infielder from Monterey Peninsula College. Returning left-hander  pitchers include sophomore Tim Lewis, who batted .327 but pitched in only 1  game last season, and junior Kevin O'Neill. Hill also has Greg Minick, a senior  right-hander who compiled a 3-8 record and 5.47 ERA last year and is expected  to be ready later this month after having undergone elbow surgery.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran bolstered its outfield with the addition of Darnell Mitchell, a  center fielder from Cuesta College. He will join returning outfielders Henry  Campos, who also played third base last year, and first baseman-outfielder Dan  Weis.  </P> <P> "We had to get a center fielder to anchor the outfield because we had no speed  out there last year," Hill said.  </P> <P> Sophomore second baseman Dave Leonhardt, who hit .420 in GSAC play last year  and .311 overall, is Cal Lutheran's top returning infielder. Hill also has  Daren Cornell, who is returning at shortstop after missing last season because  of academic ineligibility, and junior Jeff Brouelette from Orange Coast College  at third base.  </P> <P> Senior Anthony Espitia, who batted .344 last season and was second on the team  in home runs with 5, is back at catcher along with sophomore catcher-outfielder  Jeff Chalmers. The Kingsmen added junior Leonard Matsumoto, a junior  catcher-outfielder from Santa Monica College.  </P> <P> "We have a nucleus of 10 or 11 guys who are going to be playing all year for  us," Hill said. "Right now, it depends on which guys are swinging the bat the  best."  </P> <P> Hill expects that a tough preseason schedule, which includes 3 Division I  opponents and 7 Division II teams, will prepare the Kingsmen for conference  play.  </P> <P> "I feel this year that there is a complete turnaround on this team," Hill said.  "We have some guys who really want to work hard and win."  </P> <P> CLU, whose season-opening doubleheader against Cal State Northridge was rained  out Saturday, will play at The Master's College on Thursday at 2:30 p.m.  </P></p>

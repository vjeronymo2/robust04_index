			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with French Colonel Pernod, commander </F> of troops in the UN Sarajevo sector, by unidentified radio  announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Commander of the Sarajevo sector,  Colonel Pernod, good evening. Can you hear me?    [Pernod] Good evening, I can hear you. [passage omitted]  There have been developments. Since 2000 this evening the  weapons have started to be brought in, that is, we have been  putting them under our control. Four have already arrived, the  others are following. According to Major (Endic), the situation  should be back to normal tomorrow, to what it was before the UN  air strikes. This is of course [word indistinct] but we will  see how things turn out tomorrow.    [Announcer] Colonel, what pressure is being put on the Serbs  to return these weapons?    [Pernod] Well, we have continued the negotiations all  afternoon. I assume that these negotiations are in conjunction  with other negotiations of which, evidently, I am not aware.  These negotiations are undoubtedly being conducted at a higher  international level. I refer to Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Mr.  Yakushi Akashi and at the level of governments. As far as we  are concerned, we have negotiated all afternoon and the pressure  has drastically decreased. Tomorrow in theory, we expect to have  the freedom of movement we enjoyed before last week's air  strikes.    [Announcer] Thank you, Colonel.</p>

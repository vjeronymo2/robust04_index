			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Sport: Tricks of victory - Olympics ANYONE who followed the campaign leading to the choice of Atlanta for the 1996 Games knows Charlie Battle. The Georgia lawyer was the General Patton of the charm offensive. Anywhere an IOC member could be found, Charlie was alongside them. Now Battle is executive vice-president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. He is uniquely placed to comment on how the candidates play the endgame in Monaco next week - and it is worth remembering that Atlanta was never favourite to win the 1990 vote in Tokyo. He thinks cities are mistaken in paying too much attention to atlases. 'I've never believed too much in the 'bloc' vote,' said Battle. 'The ballot is the one area where an IOC member can do exactly what they want to. 'They can ignore what their government wants and what their sport wants them to do. You should never forget that in that secret moment they vote from the heart. 'And even now there is still everything to play for. The last few days can be critical. Keep working on the one-on-one relationships and then confirm your whole vision in the presentation.' Opinions differ on the value of the final brief presentation to the full IOC. Some say that votes are already decided, others that it is the crux of the entire three-year effort. 'I don't think you can win on your presentation but you definitely lose existing support,' said Battle. 'By the time Tokyo came around our bid was really running short of funds and we had to put together a very basic presentation which relied almost entirely on the personal appeal of Billy Payne (the Atlanta chairman) and Andrew Young. 'You can't just get up and blow them away with some bang-up show you've rehearsed for seven months. Each of the 91 people will react differently.' Keep to the course previously set and maintain that personal contact right up to the eleventh hour and the 59th minute, is the Battle advice. 'It ain't over until until it's over,' he adds. 'I still don't know to this day exactly why we won,' Battle said. 'The beauty of this whole game is that it's such a spectacular exercise in conjecture and speculation.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Merton] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- The South African  Police [SAP] are to investigate the Independent Electoral  Commission's [IEC] ballot paper distribution system to see if it  has been interfered with, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler said on Wednesday [27 April].    The IEC has been criticised by various political parties for  inadequate or non-existant supply of ballot papers at voting  stations.    The IEC also announced at a media briefing at Gallagher  Estates, midrand that it had started printing an additional 9.3  million ballot papers. Mr Justice Kriegler said it was possible  the statistics of the last census on which the initial ballot  paper requirement had been based had been too low.    Mr Justice Kriegler however said "there was no evidence of  any kind indicating a possible crime".    The police investigation was sparked by an inference made by  the IEC in view of the large-scale lack of ballot papers, he  added.    Another possible reason for the problem was a greater rate  of  urbanisation than calulated from the basis of the last census.  Too many ballot papers were supplied to rural areas, while urban  areas experienced shortages, he said.    Another reason could be that millions of black South  Africans  did not register under the apartheid regime, Mr Justice Kriegler  said.    The supply of ballot papers was also complicated as more  voters than expected arrived at voting stations.    The IEC had calculated that about 60 to 70 per cent would  vote on Wednesday.    Now it seemed as if most voters had arrived at the stations  on the first day of South Africa's all-race elections, Mr  Justice Kriegler said.    Mr Justice Kriegler also declared that Thursday would be a  public holiday.    Additional ballot papers were already being printed in  Johannesburg, the Eastern Cape and at SA Defence Force [SADF]  premises. Mr Justice Kriegler said he did not know how secure  these premises were. The new ballots would be distributed with  the help of the SADF, he added.    The new ballot papers would have the Inkatha Freedom Party's  entry printed on them, he said.    About two million papers were allocated to Natal, the  Eastern  Cape and the [Orange] Free State. The Western Transvaal would  receive 1.5 million papers each, the Western Cape 600,000, the  Eastern Transvaal 700,000 and the North Western and PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions 500,000 each.</p>

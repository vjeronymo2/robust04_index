			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Sidenko, deputy minster of railways and </F> member of the Russian Federation governmental commission on the  conduct of the 1994 spring sowing and crop harvest, by V.  Chibisov, GUDOK correspondent: "Transport to the Village"]    [Text]    [Chibisov] The present belated spring has brought additional  troubles to the farmers. Already in the sowing campaign a volume  of work a third greater than last year has to be accomplished,  since about four million hectares of arable land were not sown  in the autumn due to a shortage of fuel and equipment. Moreover,  many areas occupied by winter crops have suffered from intensely  cold weather and required re-seeding. And then there are still  high waters in many regions. The providing of the farms with  seeds, equipment, and fertilizers also caused concern for a  time. What is the situation now, Anatoliy Yakovlevich?    [Sidenko] The village always was one of the priority  directions of their work for railroad workers. Now by tradition  the Ministry of Railways at the beginning of the year carefully  analyzes the results of the transfers of agricultural products  during the past year and, in accordance with the tasks which the  government sets for the agro-industrial complex, determines the  specific measures regarding the organization of the delivery of  agricultural freight.    And today the railroad workers are coping with the tasks set  for them. Some 260,000 tonnes of seed grain, as was provided for  by the plan, has been delivered to the regions of the sowing  campaign. Not a single failure has been permitted. Our employees  on the railroads and divisions and at the stations are  approaching with full responsibility the fact that the timely  performance of spring field work is to be secured by their  participation. The last freight cars with imported seed corn  destined for the Volga and North Caucasus regions left  Kaliningrad a few days ago. Shipments of seed potatoes are  proceeding actively. Almost 100,000 tonnes need to be delivered  from Moscow, Ryazan, Orel, Ivanovo, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts  to the northern regions--Vologda Oblast, Komi, and Karelia. Also  to the Orenburg area and even to Chita. A special dispatcher  group has been created in the Ministry of Railways which  monitors applications for the shipment of this product and their  fulfillment and tracks the movement of freight cars, etc.    [Chibisov] And what about fertilizers, equipment, fuel?    [Sidenko] A very important question for today. The villagers  have only 21 percent of their fertilizer needs. They are being  shipped in an uneven fashion although there is finished product  at the plants. However, its shipment is being held back because  of the recipient's inability to pay. The government of the  Russian Federation has allotted credits for the purchase of  fertilizers. State support (in the form of subsidies) of  consumers is provided for. The fact is that now the cost of a  single tonne of fertilizers exceeds the cost of a tonne of grain.    One must give the railroad workers their due in this  situation. Despite all the complexities and the large debts of  the shippers, fertilizers are being delivered to the village.    Its delivery is also connected with the same inability of  the  villagers to pay the producers of agricultural equipment.  Shipment volumes come to only 30 percent of last year.    The picture is somewhat different with petroleum products. A  rather alarming situation with supplying villagers with fuels  and lubricants had developed by the beginning of spring. A  decision has been adopted to transport them without waiting for  the credits which the government will allot for the  agro-industrial complex. And now there are quite enough  petroleum products at the oblast bases of all regions to carry  out the sowing. And what is more villagers have obtained loans  for settling up with the producers. Stocks of diesel fuel at the  petroleum bases now exceed last year's level by 1.5 times.    All this permits the conducting of spring field work in as  short a time as possible. Practice confirms this: today more  than 12 million hectares of spring crops have already been  sown--higher than the level of last year.    [Chibisov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich, tell us briefly about the  work of the governmental commission.    [Sidenko] Its task is to monitor everything that is being  sent to the agro-industrial complex for the conducting of the  spring field work and the harvest. To comprehensively resolve  the questions of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Central Bank,  and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. So to avoid difficulties  which arise, in particular, in the financial interrelations  which confront agriculture. I think that this task is being  fulfilled. In any case the sowing is proceeding normally.    And one needs to make preparations for the harvest now. The  shipment of early vegetables is beginning for the railroad  workers. Taking into account that the Council for railroad  transport of the CIS has instructed the Ministry of Railways to  manage the fleet of refrigerator rolling stock, we have  redeployed the necessary number of cars to the early cabbage  growing regions. Now refrigerator sections are to be found in  Moldova, Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Moreover, instructions  have been given to the railroads regarding the preparation of  3,000 more such cars in order to include them in the work as  products are presented. There is every reason to think that the  railroad workers will cope with the shipments of the volumes of  early vegetables envisaged by the treaties and contracts that  have been concluded.    [Chibisov] We have talked about the customers' inability to  pay. But how are the producers of products for the village  settling up with the railroad people for shipments?    [Sidenko] This problem is the same for all shippers of  freight. As a whole the debts to the railroads for shipments  carried out come to about 2.3 trillion rubles. The suppliers of  products for the agro-industrial complex have a large debt.  Thus, if one takes petroleum products, it is almost R300  billion. With respect to mineral fertilizers... the Apatity  Production Association alone has owed R11 billion and  Kuybyshevazot and Tolyattiazot R5 billion and R2.5 billion  respectively. The fertilizer producers of the regions of the  Sverdlovsk and other railroads have a sizable debt.    However, I repeat: we have a good understanding of the  problem. And if we don't deliver the rolling stock for loading,  we thereby exacerbate the situation in the country. That is why  we are looking for the most varied forms of reciprocal  settlements so as not to stop the shipment process short and to  deliver all that is needed to the villagers.    [Chibisov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich! A purely sectorial  question.  A new railway traffic schedule is to be introduced on 29 May.  What is its fundamental difference from the one now in operation?    [Sidenko] There are special features and significant ones at  that. If previously we tried to create a freight traffic  schedule intended for maximum carrying capacities and the  greatest throughput of car flows, now it has been formulated on  the basis of realistic shipment volumes. This has been done so  as to not hold on to a surplus fleet of locomotives and cars and  surplus locomotive brigades. And through this to reduce  operating costs.    As for the passenger traffic schedule, its rates have been  somewhat increased. Taking the wishes of the passengers into  account, we have revised a number of the timetables for the  running of trains. The new schedule makes it possible to carry  out the capital repair of a track while not disturbing the  rhythm of the running of passenger trains.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: German rate cut revives flagging UK equities - Market Report A strong two-way pull developed in London with a sharp downgrading of market forecasts offset by a surprise half-percentage point reduction in German interest rates and good economic news from the US. The upshot of was that the FT-SE 100 index reversed a fairly harsh mid-morning slide, made rapid progress on the German interest rate reduction and good economic news from the US, then eased off to close a net 7.6 higher at 3,425.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 ended the day 3.7 higher at 4,054.3. Mr Nick Knight, market strategist at Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker, put paid to an early rise in the London equity market. Opening around six points higher in the wake of Wall Street's overnight rise and a better showing by the Hong Kong market, the FT-SE 100 index began to falter as news filtered into the market that the Nomura strategist had cut his 1994 FT-SE 100 year-end forecast by 500 points to 3,500. Mr Knight caused flurries of uncertainty across most markets at the end of last week after forecasting a bout of short-term turbulence across global markets. The Nomura stockbroker said yesterday that he felt investors in UK equities should sell into strength, forecasting deterioration in UK inflation, the trade deficit, sterling and both short- and long-term interest rates. As the Nomura story spread throughout the market, the FT-SE 100 retreated to a session low of 3,404.5, a fall of 13.2 in mid-morning. However, the market embarked on a good rally and staged a strong upwards move during lunchtime after the Bundesbank wrong-footed many market observers and cut its discount rate by half a percentage point to 5.25 per cent, the first cut since last October. The German move encouraged London dealers who said the decision could hasten another reduction in UK rates. Shortly afterwards there was good economic news from the US where inflation was unchanged in January, heading off fears that US interest rates may have needed to rise again in the short term. At its best the FT-SE 100 was almost 20 points higher, at 3,437.6, but it later subsided in the face of some determined profit-taking to close well off the day's best levels. Mr Edmond Warner, equity market strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the integrated securities house, said he viewed the German rate cut and the US economic news as providing a good short-term buying opportunity in the UK market. The key, Mr Warner said, was to buy the market after a correction. He said the corporate results season so far has provided plenty of good news. Mr Ian Harnett, market strategist at Strauss Turnbull, said the German cut was a pleasant surprise for the market and there was now scope for further UK cuts later in the year. He cautioned, however, that the market was still waiting for news of a sustained earnings revival and was tending to move sideways. The German news was seen as encouraging for the likes of Redland and RMC, building groups with a big exposure to Germany. There were also hints that big activity in options and via the inter-dealer broker screens could herald strategic stake-building or even full-scale takeover activity in Blue Circle. Turnover in equities was a disappointing 701m shares, while customer business on Wednesday was worth Pounds 1.62bn.</p>

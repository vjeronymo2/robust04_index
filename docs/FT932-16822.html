			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV director survives investigation MR ALLAN McKeown, the controversial managing director of SelecTV, the independent production company, has survived an investigation by the company's solicitors, Richards Butler. The solicitors were asked to conduct a detailed investigation following the issuing of a writ last month against Mr McKeown alleging irregularities in the way the company was run. The writ was never served. SelecTV, which makes programmes such as Lovejoy and Birds of a Feather, said last night it would issue a full statement to the Stock Exchange on Monday giving the results of the Richards Butler review. It is clear that, following the investigation, Mr McKeown will be fully reinstated with the support of the SelecTV board. The company is, however, expected to take note of points made about its standards of corporate governance.</p>

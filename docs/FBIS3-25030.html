			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The situation was considered to be calm in the city  of Cuito today, after violent clashes between government and  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  forces yesterday. The residents have taken advantage of that  calm to bury the dead. Radio Angola reports that 48 people were  killed and another 62 seriously wounded during clashes on 5  February. A spokesman for Cuito-based government forces told  Radio Angola yesterday that his forces had not been caught by  surprise and had in fact expected such clashes to occur at any  time. Radio Angola also reported that the UNITA forces were  using weapons and mortars to, quote, decimate the residents of  Cuito and reduce the city to ashes, unquote. Jorge Araujo, a  BBC reporter, has been in touch with UNITA Information Secretary  Jorge Valentim, who has confirmed that there were fierce clashes  in Cuito, adding however that the government was to blame and  that it had attacked first.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] It was the government that  started the clashes. In the wake of orders they received from  Luanda, the government forces began the fighting. This was in  line with recent remarks by General Joao de Matos, Angolan Armed  Forces chief of General Staff. The clashes began at 0745 [0645  GMT] and continued until about 2000 in the evening. The  situation remains critical at this stage. We, in the UNITA  negotiating team, have one position: we lay the responsibility  for the clashes at the door of the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola [MPLA] government. We blame the MPLA  government solely and completely for the start of the clashes.  Such behavior is in complete contradiction with the Lusaka  peace talks.    [Araujo] What do you view as a critical situation?    [Valentim] It is a critical situation because the clashes  assumed absolutely maximum dimensions. The government took  certain UNITA positions. There were successive waves of  bombings against military positions and civilian targets. This  is a very serious threat to peace in Angola.    [Araujo] Are the clashes continuing at this point?    [Valentim] I cannot give you any more details but, seeing  that this was in line with government plans, it is possible that  clashes are continuing. For instance, the observers and  mediators here in Lusaka are deeply concerned about the  situation and believe these clashes must cease because they can  be harmful to the search for peace in Angola. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Aldemiro Vaz da Conceicao, spokesman for the  Angolan Government team to the Lusaka peace talks, has granted  an interview to the Portuguese Radio Broadcasting Corporation,  RDP, in which he rejected UNITA's version of the events. He  added that the government had the duty to respond to UNITA  attacks on civilians and on territorial integrity.    Today, AFP quoted UNITA's Voice of Resistance of the Black  Cockerel, Vorgan Radio, as saying that the UNITA leadership had  held a special meeting in Huambo and that it had decided  unilaterally to reestablish the cease-fire in Cuito.</p>

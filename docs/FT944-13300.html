			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Genentech loses patent suit A patent infringement suit filed by US biotechnology company Genentech against Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Sumitomo Chemical, has been rejected by a court in Osaka, according to Sumitomo. Genentech filed the suit in 1989 alleging Sumitomo copied the same genetic engineering techniques used to develop a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) used to treat heart attack patients. The court said techniques used by the two companies were not identical and it did not constitute a patent infringement. Sumitomo said it was unable to provide details of the ruling. The court and Genentech in Japan declined comment. The controversy concerns amino acid sequences used to produce TPA by Genentech and Sumitomo. Sumitomo said its TPA was developed by Sumitomo itself before Genentech's genetic engineering techniques were made public. In 1992, Genentech won a similar suit against the Japanese company Toyobo over the same product. The court ordered Toyobo to stop producing its TPA.</p>

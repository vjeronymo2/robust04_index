			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Avonmore Foods expands AVONMORE FOODS, the acquisitive Kilkenny-based dairy and meat products company, is buying two liquid milk businesses in the UK, for a total of Pounds 11.4m. The acquisitions will add 17m gallons a year of liquid milk to Avonmore's sales in the UK, taking it to nearly 50m gallons. The companies being acquired are Churchfields Dairies, based in Salisbury, Wiltshire, for which Avonmore is paying Pounds 6.13m, and Tom Parker Dairies, of Fareham, Hampshire, costing Pounds 5.25m. Avonmore plans to integrate the operations with its existing milk business. The milk is sold both door to door and through supermarkets. Mr Pat O'Neill, group managing director, said the acquisitions would 'enhance our presence with major national multiples'. Avonmore is paying Pounds 5m cash immediately with the balance due by November next year. Total net assets being acquired are Pounds 3.98m. Churchfields made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 510,000 in the nine months to March 31 this year, while Parker made Pounds 600,000 in the year to September 30 1991.</p>

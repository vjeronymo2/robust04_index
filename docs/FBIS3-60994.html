According to a statement issued by the Istanbul  Security Directorate, security forces learned that some people  arrived in the country in order to reactivate their  organization. In operations launched as a result of this  information, security forces captured 13 organization members in  their safe houses together with two pistols, many rounds of  ammunition, and organizational documents.    It was reported that some of the organization members were  caught en route to Hatay with the aim of attending a training  camp in Syria. During their interrogation, the suspects  admitted that after their training in the camp they were to be  assigned to participate in actions in the rural and urban areas  in line with instructions to be received from the organization's  headquarters abroad.    The suspects were reportedly involved in throwing bombs and  distributing pamphlets on behalf of the organization in Izmir,  Istanbul, Germany, Switzerland, and Netherlands. Meanwhile it  was also learned that in 1992 the suspects underwent armed  training in the organization's Syrian camp.</p>

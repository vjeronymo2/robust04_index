			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Arab Banking moves into the black with Dollars 90m profit ARAB Banking Corporation (ABC), the biggest international Arab bank, posted a Dollars 90m pre-tax profit in 1991 compared with a pre-tax loss of Dollars 47m in the previous year, Reuter reports from Manama. 'The turnround was reflected in the healthy trend towards the growth and diversifications of non-interest income, which jumped by 56.5 per cent from Dollars 168m in 1990 to Dollars 263m at the end of 1991,' the bank said. 'This more than compensated for the slight decline in interest income resulting from the prevailing low-interest rate environment,' it added. Operating income rose to Dollars 622m from Dollars 555m the previous year. Total assets dropped slightly to Dollars 20.45bn against Dollars 20.55bn. Operating profit before provisions, tax and minority interests rose to Dollars 213m against Dollars 153m. The bank allocated Dollars 102m for possible loan losses in 1991 compared with Dollars 179m the previous year. Deposits from interbank markets increased to Dollars 6.3bn from Dollars 5.7bn in 1990. Customers' deposits fell to Dollars 10.5bn compared with Dollars 10.9bn a year earlier. ABC, which is owned mainly by Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and Libya, became the first Gulf-based Arab bank to offer shares to investors on the open market with a Dollars 350m issue in June 1990. Saudi Arabian private investors now hold 6.5 per cent of its shares and international investors own 15 per cent.</p>

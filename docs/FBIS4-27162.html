			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Japan's NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reports on 28 May that  a new plan is being mapped out for the ROK, the United States,  Japan, and international organizations to provide economic  assistance to North Korea under the condition that North Korea  accepts full-scope nuclear inspections [chonmyonjogin  haeksachal].    NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported that the plan to assist North  Korea was tapped out by the United States in a joint  consultation meeting between the three countries. It also  reported that it seems that the ROK and Japan already notified  the United States that such a proposal will be dealt with  (?positively).    NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported that therefore, there is a  possibility that the United States will reveal a method for a  comprehensive assistance at the third round of high-level  DPRK-U.S. talks which is expected to take place early next  month, depending on North Korea's attitude in the negotiations.    It was learned that the multinational assistance method the  United States is planning is expected to include China, Russia,  the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Program to  organize a consultative body.</p>

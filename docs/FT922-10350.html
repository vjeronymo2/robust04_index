			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG Lihir gold licence extended PAPUA NEW Guinea's government has extended for another two years the prospecting licence covering the Lihir Island project, one of the biggest known gold deposits outside South Africa, as long as the joint venturers 'take all reasonable steps necessary' to start mine construction by the end of this year. The PNG government also wants negotiations about a mining development contract completed by October 31, reported Niugini Mining, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold of the US, which owns 20 per cent of the Lihir project. RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, which has the other 80 per cent, said that discussions were continuing with the PNG government but might be complicated by the June general election. In March a Dollars 767m proposal was submitted for treatment of an annual 2.83m tonnes of ore for the production of 620,000 troy ounces of gold for the first 12 years and an average of 370,000 ounces over the project's 31-year life. Niugini's breakdown of the capital costs shows process facilities accounting for USDollars 188m, mining equipment and facilities Dollars 98m and infrastructure Dollars 99m. Full operating costs would be Dollars 248.75 an ounce for the first five years and Dollars 274 over the mine's life.</p>

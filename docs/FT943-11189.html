			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / People (Names in the news): Parker picks his own leaving date Gordon Parker, the chairman of Newmont Mining, must be the only businessman who has faced up to the attentions of three of the world's most aggressive corporate raiders - T Boone Pickins, Lord Hanson and Sir James Goldsmith - and still be in his job, writes Ken Gooding. Boone Pickins, fresh from raiding the US oil patch, was the first to make a run at Newmont in 1987. Parker beat him off but had to sell most of Newmont's assets to cover the costs and turn for help to the UK's Consolidated Gold Fields, which ended up with 49 per cent of Newmont. Parker had no sooner started to rebuild Newmont as a gold company - it is now the biggest in North America - when he had to reciprocate by helping Gold Fields ward off Minorco, the offshore arm of Anglo American of South Africa. Gold Fields won after a two-year battle but was in no shape to put up much resistance and was gobbled up by Lord Hanson's outfit shortly afterwards. That was in 1989. After a year of dancing around Parker, Hanson retired and swapped his Newmont holding for Sir James Goldsmith's North American forestry interests. Through all these tribulations, Parker was protected by a neat legal safety net - anyone who picked up Gold Fields' 49 per cent Newmont stake also inherited a 'standstill' agreement preventing them from buying the extra shares to give control. Sir James tried to wriggle round this by encouraging a merger between Newmont and Peter Munk's American Barrick; that fell apart almost as soon as talks started. Goldsmith gave up and sold all but 4.9 per cent of his Newmont stake as the gold price went up last year. This left Parker, who joined a Newmont copper affiliate in 1959, once more as Newmont's undisputed boss. Fittingly as the gold industry's great survivor, Parker, a tall and taciturn man of 58, has dictated when he plans to retire. He will hand over the chairmanship of Newmont to chief executive Ronald Cambre at the end of the year - and not a day before.</p>

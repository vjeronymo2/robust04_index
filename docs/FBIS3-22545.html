			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] According to data from the Department of Health up  to and including 6 December 1993, 187 persons are recorded as  suffering from AIDS in Indonesia. This is an increase of 12  persons, compared with the total at the end of October 1993,  when 175 persons were listed by the Department of Health as  suffering from the disease. Of the 187 persons suffering from  AIDS 43 have full-blown AIDS and 25 have died. The remaining 18  are still alive.    Meanwhile, according to data from WHO [World Health  Organization], the total number diagnosed as being HIV-positive  throughout Indonesia is between 20,000 and 30,000.    Minister of Health Sujudi made this statement in testimony  before Committee VIII of Parliament in Jakarta on 7 December. He  added that the most serious aspect of these figures in Indonesia  is that the numbers tend to increase exponentially. According to  him, the figure of those suffering from AIDS has doubled over  the past two years and tripled over the past year.    He also reported that his ministry has estimated that it  will  spend 5.0 billion rupiahs on the care of AIDS victims during  fiscal year 1994/1995. This money will be used for screening  blood donors, research, distributing information, laboratory  equipment, training health workers, and counseling services.    In answer to a question from a member of the committee about  the very surprising difference between the figures from the  Department of Health and WHO on AIDS victims, the minister of  health said that the WHO figure of 20,000 to 30,000 was arrived  at by using several models ranging from the simplest to the most  complex. Meanwhile, the minister of health said that the figure  of 187 is the total actually reported to the Department of  Health. The Department itself makes predictions based on how  sexually transmitted disease has spread in Indonesia. These  predictions are calculated by extrapolating statistics. Sujudi  continued that by using this kind of calculation the figures  obtained by WHO and those of the Department are not very far  apart: about 20,000 persons suffer from AIDS.    Sujudi said that to deal with AIDS, the government has  formed  the National Committee for Handling AIDS, chaired by the  coordinating minister for the people's welfare. This committee  has developed a policy for handling AIDS on a national basis.  Sujudi said: "In the near future it is hoped that a Presidential  Decision Memorandum will be issued to deal with AIDS."    In answer to a question from a member of the committee  concerning the amount of counterfeit medicine available the  minister of health said that the punishment handed out to  producers and traffickers in counterfeit medicine is still too  light. The fines collected until now, based on an ordinance  covering medicine containing alcohol, amount to 5,000 guilders  for each case. This is considered to be the equivalent of 5,000  rupiahs.    However, he continued, with the enactment of Law No. 23 of  1992 on health matters, it is hoped that producers and  traffickers of counterfeit medicine will be discouraged from  engaging in this kind of activity. This law provides for a  sentence of up to 15 years in jail and a fine of up to 300  million rupiahs.    Sujudi said that another problem encountered by the  department in dealing with counterfeit medicine is that  frequently cases brought to court are not actually tried.  Therefore, the department has asked its officials in the  provinces to raise these cases with the mass media.    Sujudi said: "This effort is intended to exercise a more  definite social and indirect control on the production and  distribution of counterfeit medicine. In this way it is hoped  that there will be no more cases involving the production and  distribution of counterfeit medicine which are not prosecuted."    According to Sujudi, the efforts being made by the  Department  of Health to speed up a more even distribution of medical  doctors throughout the country involve PTT assignments [the  appointment of personnel on a temporary basis]. Since February  1992, 3,988 medical doctors, divided into four groups, have been  given temporary appointments to the government health service.  Some 2,135 doctors have been assigned to ordinarily settled  areas, 1,185 of them have been assigned to isolated areas, and  668 have 3n3 been assigned to very isolated areas. These  employees have been hired on a temporary basis, in anticipation  of the possibility that the number of permanent state employees  being trained will be reduced to "zero" in the course of 1995.    The appointment of temporary employees will later be applied  to other workers in the health sector, including dentists,  pharmacists, and midwives assigned to the villages. Their  assignments will be carefully coordinated with the needs of the  provinces where they will work. It is planned that during fiscal  year 1994/1995 2,200 medical doctors, 600 dentists, 300  pharmacists, and 11,000 midwives will be assigned to villages.  Funds for the construction of housing, amounting to more than  5.0 million rupiahs per employee, will be provided on a special  basis for village midwives, in addition to other costs and  transportation facilities such as bicycles.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Magritte: master of the surreal - William Packer considers the life of the playful Belgian artist OF ALL the movements of modernism, Surrealism is the most accessible, which is both its great virtue and essential limitation. With Surrealism, the image is everything, that is to say the idea proposed in all its incongruity, the story told to its false end, the joke ever chasing its own tail. Visual it may be in its expression, but Surrealism remains at heart a literary form. It may be the hallucinatory reverie of a Dali, the ambiguous invention of an Ernst, the abstracted firmament of a Miro: whatever the case, we can always see, if not what it means exactly, at least a meaning to guess at or imagine. Given so much to hold the eye and engage the mind, to turn then to the consideration of such work in more formal terms, in its qualities of line and surface, paint on canvas, may seem to many if not actually perverse, at the very least, irrelevant. With the work of the Belgian painter, Rene Magritte, the archetypal bourgeois in the bowler hat, faceless, impassive and elusive, we face the problem as an extreme case. Where, with Ernst for example, there would always be at least some overt painterly engagement with surface and material to bring us back to the work as work, or, with Dali, an insistent self-promotion to persuade us of an immaculate, entirely bogus technical mastery, with Magritte there are only the images, left to play their quiet conundrums, jokes and contradictions upon themselves. Those images are powerful enough in all conscience - the back of the head repeated in the mirror; the face as naked female torso; the lamp alight in the night-time that is midday; the unlaced feet; the painting of a landscape that is a painting of a landscape that is a painting of a landscape. Both by direct quotation and example in principle, these things have become long since the commonplace of advertising and illustration. Yet, with the artist himself conspicuous by his absence, with no actual public presence, in the manner of a Dali or a Picasso, to invite further interest and speculation to the work, the received opinion was ever that as painting on canvas, these things were as dull as their author, mechanical statements, touching, if anything, only in their obvious simplicity. Mutatis mutandis, we think of Lowry in this respect, an isolated and reclusive figure whose peculiar and long-familiar imagery still comes between the artist and a true recognition of his actual quality as a painter qua painter. This large and splendid exhibition, beautifully selected for the organisers, the South Bank Centre, by Sarah Whitfield and David Sylvester, confounds all such comfortable prejudice. It covers the whole career, from around 1920 to 1967, the year of Magritte's death, just short of 69. Many of the more familiar works are of course included, but the great virtue of the show, as of Surrealism itself, is its quality of surprise. As strong and surprising as anything are the earliest works, which give the lie to any supposition that that the young Magritte was no more than a natural. They show him, on the contrary, as alive as any of his fellows to the currency of modernism, in particular to the decorative later phases of synthetic Cubism. No less pervasive at that time, but more powerful and lasting upon him, was the influence of the young metaphysical painters, of the Italians most of all, Carlo Carra and Giorgio de Chirico especially, but also such northern equivalents as the German, George Grosz. After his own fashion, Magritte was to remain in essence a metaphysical throughout his career. No matter that he would take to himself many of the devices of high Surrealism, the psychological reversals, contradictions and bizarre conjunctions - the draped head of his drowned mother, the tubas, the guns, the suitcases, the galaxies of floating bells, the strong man at the circus. No matter, on the other hand, looking to Dada, that he would play all the formal, proto-conceptual games - the artist painting, quite literally, his model and just coming to the arm; the nude wrestling with her lover/violator, yet still but a single figure; the sky drawn forward physically on to the foreground stage, like cut sheet-metal. Even more particular to the conceptual are the plays on words as images  - the pipe declared not to be a pipe; the clock labelled as the wind, the jug as a bird; the grey blob that is the horizon, a wardrobe, a person bursting into laughter. Even so, whichever the particular preoccupation of the moment - and such themes continue from his maturity to the end - there is constant in the statement of the image a quiet intensity of realisation, at once febrile and yet ironical and detached, that marks him for ever as the true metaphysical. His is the poetry of an visual possibility, of a hermetic, pictorial, other world - and it depends, as does all poetry, entirely on the quality of its making. The marks, as the words, must be just right. Magritte, au fond, is after all as subtle and delicate a painter as Chardin, the mark effective, particular and to the point, the surface most beautifully controlled. There are aberrations and diversions, of course, odd excursions into Renoiresque pastiche and variations upon Matisse, but always he is back soon to his true self, and to that strange stone surface laid, immaculate, over all, the lapidary flash of lightning at once epic and monumental. Magritte: Hayward Gallery, until August 2, then to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Menil Collection, Houston;and the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>

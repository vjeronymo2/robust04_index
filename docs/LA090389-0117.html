			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUS BLUES;  </P> <P> COMMUTER'S ODYSSEY TAKES 6-7 HOURS A DAY  </P> <P> Call it a very long commuter bus ride.  </P> <P> Alvis Holloway spends between six and seven hours a day traveling between  Pomona, where he lives, and Venice, where he works.  </P> <P> He gets up at 4 a.m. to get to work by 9, traveling 57 miles on three bus  lines. Then he turns around and does it backwards, getting home at 8 p.m. on a  good day. He's in bed by 10, resting up for the next grueling round trip.  </P> <P> Holloway, the coordinator of a walk-in service center for alcoholics and drug  users, lives a two-dimensional life. Working and commuting. "During the week, I  have no social life whatsoever," says Holloway, 62, a short, barrel-chested man  with slicked-back hair and a wispy goatee, serving to remind you of his past as  a jazz bass player.  </P> <P> Southern California Rapid Transit District representatives say that in mileage  -- if not in time -- there are longer bus rides than Holloway's, such as the  73-mile express run between San Bernardino and downtown Los Angeles, a  140-minute trek through two counties on the San Bernardino Freeway. There are  even RTD commuters who change buses more often.  </P> <P> But they can't identify another bus rider more consumed by the act of daily  travel than Holloway.  </P> <P> It's a long, frustrating process, says Holloway, who loves his job, at one  extremity of Los Angeles County, and is enchanted by his Pomona senior citizens  apartment complex, at the other.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think I'm somewhat of a nut," he confesses.  </P> <P> Stress is part of the deal. The monotonous rhythm of bus tires on pavement or  the herky-jerky of street traffic keep him mumbling the "Serenity Prayer" to  himself. That's the well-known Alcoholics Anonymous anthem about having  serenity to accept the things you can't change, courage to change the things  that should be changed and wisdom to know the difference.  </P> <P> The idea is, says Holloway, a recovering alcoholic who's been on the wagon for  six years, to remember that there's nothing he can do about delays, breakdowns  and slowdowns.  </P> <P> "Last month, the bus broke down three days in a row," he says. "They don't send  a replacement. You just have to stand there and wait for the next bus."  </P> <P> This is a time of unusual dissatisfaction with public transit in the San  Gabriel Valley. Twenty cities, claiming that the area is treated by RTD as a  poor relation, want to pull out of the RTD system altogether to start what they  say will be a more responsive, cost-efficient transit system using private  operators. The county Transportation Commission has authorized them to set up  the Foothill Transit Zone, a three-year experiment to contract with private  companies to take over much of RTD's San Gabriel Valley service.  </P> <P> "RTD acts as if they don't give a damn whether you ride with them or not," says  Holloway. "It seems to me, they even try to discourage you."  </P> <P> Exactly, Foothill executives pipe in. While maps of the RTD bus system show the  San Fernando Valley covered by a neat, all-encompassing grid, there are large  empty spaces in the San Gabriel Valley, where bus service is a distant amenity,  critics say.  </P> <P> And the prospects are for bigger empty spots still. Because of low ridership  and the high cost of suburban bus service, the area has been targeted for  further RTD service reductions. The buses that do operate in the area break  down frequently and run behind schedule, the critics say.  </P> <P> "There are big holes in the (RTD) service," says William Forsythe, executive  director of Foothill. Before a Supreme Court action brought by RTD drivers and  mechanics put a hold last week on expansion by Foothill, the private system had  already taken over seven RTD lines, including two express routes from Glendora  and Diamond Bar to downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No RTD Comment  </P> <P> An RTD spokeswoman said that, because the transfer of lines to Foothill is  still in litigation, she could not comment on critics' complaints. "All I can  say is that RTD is concerned about maintaining a regional transportation  system, which better serves the public than breaking the system up into  individual zones," she said.  </P> <P> At the rider level, the complaints usually stick to the asphalt-level  nitty-gritty. Riders at the El Monte Bus Terminal, the mecca for San Gabriel  Valley public transportation where 700 buses a day pick up and discharge  passengers on a carousel-like platform, talk about long waits on street  corners, jammed buses and insufficient seats for all the passengers.  </P> <P> For example, Marcella Gomez, a secretary for an El Monte insurance agency, said  she has to give herself an extra half-hour every morning in case of delays in  the trip from her home in West Covina. "You never know what time the buses are  going to pass by," she said.  </P> <P> There are delays and more delays. But often it's not RTD's fault, passengers  acknowledge. "It takes a long time on hot days," says Patricia Yung, a  secretary in a downtown import-export firm. "That's when there are breakdowns  on the freeway."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leaves Early  </P> <P> Holloway's day begins about 5:15 a.m., when he leaves the apartment he shares  with his wife, Margaret, on 3rd Street and walks two blocks in inky darkness to  the bus stop on Mission Boulevard. "I always leave earlier than I have to,"  says Holloway, "because the buses can run late and, if you wait too long, you  have to stand up."  </P> <P> It is 15 minutes before RTD's 480 bus shows up. "A lot of your bus time is tied  up in waiting," he says. "The actual time in transit isn't that bad." The bus  stop is on a sidewalk, next to a vacant lot. "What am I supposed to do out here  when it's raining?" he says. "During the winter, I get soaked at least once a  week."  </P> <P> There are still plenty of seats at that hour, and Holloway settles next to a  window. They're not individual seats, as on an airline, but cramped "love  seats," each accommodating two passengers. "Not very conducive to relaxation,"  says Holloway.  </P> <P> The Detroit-born Holloway is a loquacious man, full of stories about his long  and varied life ("I've been cut, stabbed and shot") and bits of wisdom ("I've  never seen anybody go out with a smile on their face," he says, talking about a  job he once held in a funeral parlor. "Everybody's struggling for just one more  breath.")  </P> <P> He has been a bass player, a dental technician and a professional boxer,  fighting briefly as a light heavyweight with the nickname "Baby Bull."  </P> <P> "Why do you think they called me that?" he says, leaning forward in his seat to  give you a clear view. "No neck."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can't Afford Car  </P> <P> An emphysema patient who suffered a heart attack seven years ago, Holloway is  passionate about helping people with disabilities on his job, for which he  earns a salary too modest to afford a car. Holloway was paying more than $120 a  month ($6.40 a day) in bus fares before he acquired a medical disability card,  which entitles him to monthly service for $10.  </P> <P> "I very rarely miss a day," he says. "I'm so uncomfortable if I don't come to  work, knowing that people need me, knowing that people are out there sick with  no place to go."  </P> <P> He is just as adamant about keeping his Pomona apartment. He points to a  neighborhood in the pitch darkness. "This is where I used to live," he says. "I  had just dozed off one night, and all of a sudden I hear bam-bam-bam, gunshots  right there in the complex. It was that kind of a place. You had to keep your  hand on your knife when you went in at night."  </P> <P> But his current apartment, besides providing elevators, a sauna, a swimming  pool and pool tables, is gated, with armed security guards patrolling the area.  "You don't have to worry that some guy is going to grab your wife and put a  knife to her throat," he says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Toilets  </P> <P> It's 6:15, the sky is beginning to light up and traffic is already  bumper-to-bumper on the 10 Freeway. Holloway's bus edges toward El Monte. The  worst part of his long daily odyssey, he says, is "no toilets." Holloway must  take a diuretic to cleanse his system of accumulated fluid. "It can put you in  a tight spot, brother," he says.  </P> <P> Holloway could leave his bus at the El Monte terminal and race downstairs to  the men's room. But that would probably add 20 minutes to his trip, forcing him  to wait for the next scheduled bus. At the very least, he says, he'd lose his  seat.  </P> <P> Holloway sticks with the bus, which pulls out of El Monte at 6:25. "Now we'll  make some good time on the diamond lane," he says.  </P> <P> The bus, with a full complement of snoozing service and office workers, whizzes  past a monumental jam-up on the freeway. By 6:45, it arrives at Wilshire  Boulevard, where Holloway, after rushing to a nearby restroom, switches to the  320. He used to switch downtown to the Pico Boulevard bus, he says. "People  would climb over your back, elbow you, hit you," he says. "I've seen them  tooting coke right in the bus. Then somebody told me about this line."  </P> <P> The Wilshire Boulevard bus wheezes along, with Holloway perched on a rear seat.  Office and restaurant workers jam into the bus, pressing against Holloway's  knees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Great Guys'  </P> <P> Like a lot of riders, Holloway doesn't like to complain. It's not always the  service or the drivers that are so bad, he says. "Most of the bus drivers are  great guys," he says. "But when there's a problem with the bus, the passengers  start cussing, ranting and raving, developing an attitude with the driver. It  isn't his fault."  </P> <P> Indeed, some riders at the El Monte terminal talk glowingly of the bus service.  Despite having to program in extra time for delays, some said, you can read or  sleep on the way. "It's easier on the nerves," said Jerry Winn, a comedian and  magazine layout artist from Hacienda Heights. "You get on the bus, sit back and  relax."  </P> <P> As long as his ride lasts, Holloway concedes, it probably offers fewer hassles  than if he drove a car.  </P> <P> The Wilshire bus drops him at 6th Street in Santa Monica at 7:55. From here,  it's easy sailing. There remains a slow trip south to Venice on the neighborly  Santa Monica Municipal Bus Line 3. After stopping for his first container of  coffee of the day (to avoid restroom problems, he doesn't eat or drink anything  before he leaves his house), Holloway opens his little office, where he works  for the Santa Monica-based Clare Foundation on Lincoln Boulevard, at 8:20.  </P> <P> On a glitch-free morning, Holloway's cross-county commute has taken about three  hours to the minute.  </P> <P> Holloway settles behind his desk and merrily thinks ahead to the trip home.  "It's a lot more crowded in the afternoon," he says. "You need the patience of  Job."  </P></p>

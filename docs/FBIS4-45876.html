			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oscar Sole] </F>   [Excerpts] Stopping the vaccination, banning the handling  of the virus, a possible increase in the Indemnification Fund  from 0.21 to 1 percent, and the slaughtering of animals in case  the disease is reintroduced are some of the direct consequences  of the beginning of the second stage of the plan to eradicate  foot-and-mouth disease, which is to be implemented on 16 June.    Uruguay, which is at present considered free from  foot-and-mouth disease, with vaccination, enters this new stage  amid pressures and criticism from several sectors involved, but  with the firm decision of producers, who together with  ministerial authorities agreed that 15 June will be the last day  for vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease in our territory.    There is no going back now. Agriculture and Fishing Minister  Pedro Saravia will communicate this significant decision at the  International Office of Epizootics (OIE) annual assembly, which  is to be held in Paris on 16 May. [passage omitted]    Trade benefits undoubtedly played a central role in making  such an important decision. It should be remembered that the  government has announced that once the country enters the  disease-free circuit, it will sell 20,000 tonnes of beef to the  United States as part of a quota upon which no tariffs are  levied.  [passage omitted]    Uruguay has been free of foot-and-mouth disease for 46  months. No focal points have been reported since January 1991,  and authorities have reported that no viral activity has been  spotted within 300 km of our border. [passage omitted]</p>

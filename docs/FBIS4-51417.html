			<p>BFN     [Text] The Taipei Association of Travel Agents told its  members on Wednesday [25 May] that group tours to Mainland China  are being resumed immediately.    To protect the interests of its members, the association  said  that it has won the permission from the cabinet-level Mainland  Affairs Council to lift the ban on group tours to the mainland.  The association reminded its members they should register their  mainland tours with tourism bureau to complete the legal process.    Nevertheless, a number of mainland destinations continue to  be listed as areas of high risk, and local travel agencies will  not organize tours heading for such places, including the  infamous Chientao [Qiandao] Lake in eastern mainland province of  Chekiang [Zhejiang].    Thirty-two people including 24 Taiwan tourists, six crew  members, two mainland guides were robbed and burned to death in  a pleasure boat ride on Chientao Lake March 31.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is Kyrgyzstan's major partner and its  strategic ally, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev declared during  his meeting with Chairman of Russia's Federation Council  Vladimir Shumeyko on Wednesday [4 May] in Bishkek.    In the course of their conversation Akayev pointed out that  Kyrgyzstan and Russia maintain traditional friendly and  partnership relations. However, in his opinion, there are  several problems in the republic related to migration of the  Russian-speaking population.    Akayev underlined, that Kyrgyzstan does its utmost to solve  this problem. In his words, it needs Russia's assistance. He  indicated that the Slavic University formed in Bishkek in which  the Republic's Russian-speaking population can receive an  education represents "one of the examples of the  Russian-speaking population's strengthening."    As Akayev said, it is necessary to create other institutes  and organizations so as to lower the level of Russian migration  from Kyrgyzstan. He also pointed out that in the near term the  Republic's government would adopt a state program in order to  keep its Russian-speaking population from leaving.    Shumeyko underlined that Russia is ready to render economic  assistance to Kyrgyzstan, in particular, "to support the  Republic's regions, which have suffered from natural disasters."</p>

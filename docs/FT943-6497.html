			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: US telecoms One of the reasons many Baby Bells piled into the UK cable TV industry in the early 1990s was to gain experience for the time when they would face competition back home from cable companies. That time has now arrived. The exact nature of the competition will be influenced by the details of the telecoms bill that emerges from Congress. But even if Congressional wrangles over healthcare kick the telecoms bill into touch, competition in the 'local loop' seems inevitable. Rivals are already able to set up shop in the biggest markets, including California and New York. Legislation at the Federal level would merely hurry up the laggards. So far cable companies have taken only tentative steps into the Dollars 100bn local telephone market. In part, this is from a desire to influence the pace with which the Bells are allowed to enter their markets. It would be hard to maintain that the Bells should be kept out of TV if they were pushing aggressively into telecoms. But the temptation of adding telephone revenues to their cable subscriptions will eventually be too great to resist. As the UK cable industry has found, having two revenue streams transforms its economics. Similarly, the Bells cannot afford to be left out of cable. True, cable generates only a quarter as much revenue as local telecoms. But the Bells are keen to invest in fibre optic networks. And while a gambler might hope to recoup such investment by providing 'multimedia' services, the inclusion of more predictable TV revenues would cut the risks. Again what Washington decides will mainly be a tidying-up job. Two Bells have already won the right to provide TV. In the coming fight, the cable companies seem to have the stronger hand. Not only are they more entrepreneurial. They are also less regulated. But the Bells have strengths too, most obviously huge financial resources. As the battle is joined, further mergers between cable companies are likely. More alliances between Bells and cable groups are also possible. A trend to marry the two industries ground to a halt early this year when regulators cracked down on cable charges. But once the regulatory fog clears, the business reasons for combining forces will look powerful.</p>

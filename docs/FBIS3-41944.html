He explained that "in contrast to Ukraine, Belarus does not  claim for low enriched uranium which is used as fuel for atomic  power stations. We have no nuclear reactors and power plants.  Belarus pretends for monetary compensation for this uranium --  he underlined -- the American party has given its backing to  this approach and President Clinton will fix it legally."    In Kravchenko's words, the draft of a corresponding  agreement  which is expected to be signed on Saturday in Minsk stipulates  that "Russia will not be able to sell low enriched uranium to  the United States without preliminary coordination with Belarus,  Ukraine, and Kazakhstan," said Kravchenko.    According to the minister, the visit of the American  president to Minsk is a historic event. "The visit has broken  Belarus' obscurity in the world once and for ever. From now on  Belarus has a chance to be represented in the world as a small  democratic civilized state with its deep national traditions,"  he said.    Kravchenko believes that the Belarusian-American summit  "helps to correct the disbalance which has been in our bilateral  relations." "Earlier cooperation between two countries was  restricted to military strategic problems and problems of  refugees," he said.    The minister stressed the importance of the treaty on  security of American investments in the Belarusian economy which  is to be signed in the course of Clinton's visit to Minsk.    According to the republican Foreign Ministry, in 1993 the  volume of turnover between Belarus and United States was $125  Mn. "In 1994 this number will increase by 10 times after  signing of the treaty," believes the minister.    He reminded that in February 1993 Belarus was granted the  most favored nation regime in trade with the United States. "It  means that tariffs higher than common ones will not be imposed  on deliveries of Belarusian goods to the United States. In  addition, in some cases Belarusian goods will be entirely  relieved of any customs tariffs," indicated Kravchenko.    In his words, Belarus hopes to receive an assistance from  the  United States totalling "several tens of million dollars in  addition to those $76 [figure as received] as it has already  received according to the Nunn-Lugar law." "This funds will be  channelled to prevent transportation of contraband uranium from  Russia to the Western Europe by transit via Belarus and to solve  export problems and to re-train retired officers," he said.</p>

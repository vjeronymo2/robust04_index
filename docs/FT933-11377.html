			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading GROWING optimism that a discount rate cut in Germany today would trigger one in the UK tomorrow provided some invigoration for stock index futures, Christine Buckley writes. All expectation was directed towards today's meeting of the Bundesbank council. This enabled the contract to push up through the 2,900 mark to touch 2,910 around lunchtime. However, it suffered an unsteady ride in late trading when it fell back to 2,888 after Wall Street's opening proved disappointing. But a rally brought September back to the level at which it opened the day, closing at 2,894. Volume, buoyed by the interest rate cut hopes, reached 10,631 contracts by the end of the session. However, with trading having been very lacklustre in previous sessions, there was also an element of the contract moving back to a more even keel. The closing level of the contract was about 5 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash, which also stands at 5 points. In the traded options market, there was also reasonable activity, with volume reaching 32,702 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option was moderately traded at 7,617 lots. Storehouse was the most heavily traded of the stock options at 2,324 lots. Asda came next at 1,763, followed by BAT Industries at 1,316.</p>

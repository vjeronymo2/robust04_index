			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Appeal by the session of the Lvov Oblast Council of </F> people's deputies to the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian  Supreme Council; date not given]    [Text] Esteemed Mr. President and Mr. Chairman, esteemed  deputies!    We, the deputies of the Lvov Oblast Council of People's  Deputies are gravely concerned with the escalation of the  activities of separatist antistate anti-Ukrainian forces in  Crimea, supported by the Crimean president, the Crimean Supreme  Soviet leadership, and imperial-chauvinistic forces in Russia.  Supporting the Ukrainian president's recent statement regarding  the situation in Crimea, we hope that the administration will  take decisive consequent measures to safeguard the unity and  integrity of the Ukrainian state, and thus, prevent the  escalation of anti-Ukrainian moves on its territory.    In light of the tense political situation in Crimea we  demand  that:    Measures be taken to discontinue the antistate and  anti-Ukrainian propaganda carried out by Russian mass media on  the territory of Ukraine;    Measures be taken to strengthen Ukraine's northern and  eastern borders to prevent the infiltration into our territory  of foreign military formations and arms. Appropriate  governmental structures be requested to pay attention to the  deployment of Russian troops along Ukrainian borders.    To discontinue further development of separatist activities  in Crimea a state of emergency be proclaimed there and direct  presidential rule introduced.    Proceeding from the provisions of the tripartite agreement  of  Ukraine, Russia, and the United States, unilateral nuclear  disarmament of Ukraine be suspended until the international  community provides distinct guarantees of Ukraine's territorial  integrity and Russian troops are altogether withdrawn from the  territory of the Ukrainian state.</p>

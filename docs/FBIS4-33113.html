			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Clara R.M. do Prado] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government is negotiating  debt payment terms with three debtor countries -- Bolivia,  Guyana, and Mozambique -- to enable them to make their payments  through "swap" [preceding word given in English] operations  using U.S. Treasury long-term "zero coupon bonds" purchased on  the international secondary market.    Based on existing agreements, those countries are paying  their debts using Brazilian foreign debt titles purchased on the  secondary market. They thus obtain a large discount by passing  old debt papers to the Central Bank with a previously negotiated  discount, which is normally below market prices.    But the foreign debt agreement reached between Brazil and  the  international creditor banks states that restructured debt bonds  cannot be negotiated on the secondary market for at least two  years, this being the "phase-in" [preceding word given in  English] period for making an additional guarantee  contributions. Renato Naegle, Seplan [Secretariat of Planning  and Coordination of the Presidency of the Republic] financial  affairs general coordinator, has said Brazil will have to  renegotiate "swap" agreements with the three debtor countries.    Negotiations with Bolivia, which owes Brazil $70 million,  have developed to the point that it will be able to use the U.S.  "zero coupon bonds" to repay its debt.    Mozambique's debt is larger. The original agreement was  reached in June 1992, involving the repayment of nearly $325  million over 12 years. Another $300 million debt depends on  defining a new "swap." The case with Guyana is more simple  because its last repayment installment falls due in September.    Before the new foreign debt agreement, Brazil reduced its  debt by $1.3 billion through "swap" operations. The first  country to use this kind of operation was Paraguay which paid  off its debt.    The International Affairs Secretariat [Secretaria de  Assuntos  Internacionais, Seain] has stated that on 31 March, Brazil had  credits with the governments of 39 Third World countries. They  amounted to $5.588 billion, plus $864.3 million with private  debtors from several countries. To these figures we must add  $1.490 billion in Bank of Brazil credits that are being  renegotiated with debtors through the Foreign Credits Evaluation  Committee [Comite de Avaliacao de Creditos ao Exterior]  (Comace). Most of these credits involve foreign trade  operations contracted through the former Finex [Financing and  Export Fund] or the present Proex [Export Financing Program].    The situation of the six main debtor governments is as  follows:    Poland -- Payments are being made on schedule. Its debt was  rescheduled within the Paris Club framework. As of last March  it owes $3.7 billion, of which nearly $1.2 billion is contracted  with the Bank of Brazil.    Angola -- The second largest debtor; owes Brazil nearly $800  million. It did not comply with the additional agreement it  reached with Brazil in 1991 because of the internal political  problems and the 1992-1993 civil war. A Brazilian mission is  currently visiting Luanda, holding talks to reach a new  agreement.    Peru -- This country reached a bilateral agreement with  Brazil in 1987 and it is paying on schedule. Peru owes Brazil  nearly $390 million.    Mozambique -- This is the fourth largest debtor and its $300  million debt will be renegotiated between the two governments  during the first half of June, to include "swap" operations.    Ecuador -- This country owes Brazil nearly $280 million and  is paying on schedule.    Argentina -- The Argentine Government debt with Brazil  totals  about $220 million and payments are being made on schedule  without any problem.    Nigeria -- This country owes nearly $40 million to Brazil.  Its debt was rescheduled within the Paris Club framework, but  the Nigerian Government has not been able to pay because it does  not allow payments by private creditors in Nigerian currency.    Cuba -- The Cuban Government's debt with Brazil is small: $5  million. This debt is being negotiated within the terms of a  trade deal that foresees the purchase by the Brazilian  Government of Cuban medicines for an initial amount of $30  million. The agreement foresees that the Cuban debt will be  deducted from the Brazilian payment for Cuban products.    Seain Secretary Mauro Marcondes Rodrigues recalls that in  January 1991 the overdue debt by Third World countries with  Brazil amounted to 75 percent of the total debt; this has  dropped to 12.9 percent. The overdue debt from the private  sector of those countries is still high: 73 percent. Marcondes  Rodrigues has said Comace must now concentrate on recovering the  credits Brazil granted to the private sector of those countries.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECORD  </P> <P> Please allow me to publicly correct a part of my letter ("Secord Gets  Probation," Feb. 2) and to publicly apologize to Gen. Richard V. Secord for not  standing and fighting this injustice like a man.  </P> <P> The fact is that he is doing just that.  </P> <P> Gen. Secord writes, "I filed an appeal against the sentence" the day following  his sentence, Jan. 25. "I still maintain that what we did during Iran/Contra  was right, proper and legal."  </P> <P> Gen. Secord concludes, "President Reagan has, in my opinion, behaved  disgracefully. . . . No commander in chief should desert his men -- ever!"  </P> <P> EDWIN O. LEARNARD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Gore to attend Gatt deal signing The US vice president, Al Gore, will join trade ministers in Marrakesh next week for the signing of the world's most far-reaching trade deal by the 120 nations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Gore's attendance will give prominence to the Gatt and its successor, the World Trading Organisation and will stress the US commitment to a workable multilateral trading system. The vice president played an important role in getting Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, when he debated and prevailed against Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who opposed the pact. Mr Gore's attendance in Marrakesh could help the US recapture its lead in trade matters following criticism of its aggressive Japanese trade policy and its push to include labour rights on the WTO agenda. Although Mr Gore will address the ministers, it will be the US trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, who signs the pact on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mexico Takes Step to Privatize Banks: Eight years after banks were  nationalized, the lower house of Mexico's congress -- the Chamber of Deputies  -- approved a constitutional amendment to return them to private ownership. The  measure, proposed on May 2 by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, now goes to  the Senate, where its passage is virtually assured. A total of 31 state  legislatures also must approve it.  </P></p>

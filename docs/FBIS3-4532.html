			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, March 30 (XINHUA) -- East China's port  municipality, Tianjin, has played an increasingly important role  in economic cooperation and contacts between China and the  Republic of Korea (ROK).    This was underlined by yesterday's arrival of the economic  delegation of Inchon city of the ROK consisting of 130 members  with 60-plus from local business and industrial circles in  Tianjin.    They will inspect the investment environment of Tianjin,  hold  trade talks with Tianjin's trade counterparts and attend the  inauguration ceremony of an Inchon product exhibition.    Tianjin is one of the country's largest ports and also among  the nearest to the ROK in geographical location.    After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the  two countries in 1992, Tianjin has opened direct navigation ties  for cargo transport to Inchon and airline service to the ROK's  capital city, Seoul, thus effectively promoting the expansion of  mutual economic contacts.    By the end of last month, there were 275 enterprises in  Tianjin partly or totally funded by ROK investors, with capital  exceeding 340 million U.S. dollars. The enterprises involve  fields including industry, architecture, international trade,  the service industry, agriculture and transportation.    Among them, Tianjin Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. has not  only occupied a large share of the domestic video-corder market  but also begun to export to other countries.    The construction in the Tianjin Development Zone of the  1.2-sq-km industrial zone by Korea Land Development Corporation  is in full swing. The zone is expected to attract 100-plus rok  enterprises in the near future.    Along with the enlargement of the investment scale of ROK  enterprises in Tianjin, ROK finance and banking circles have  also begun to eye the Chinese municipality.    Korea Exchange Bank has set up a branch and Chohung Bank and  Shinhan Bank have opened agencies in Tianjin.    In the year 1993, Tianjin's trade volume with the ROK topped  100 million U.S. dollars with exports standing at 38 million and  imports at 64 million.    Tianjin has mainly imported steel, fabrics, imitation  leather, and auto spare parts from the ROK and exported clothes,  shoes, textiles and elevators to it.    The ROK has become one of Tianjin's most important trade  partners.    A sea postal route from Tianjin to Pusan in the ROK, first  of  its kind between the two countries, was opened to service this  month.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Long-bond yield heads towards 6.5% THE US credit market's attention will be focused on Washington this week, where Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will give his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins report on monetary policy to Congress against the backdrop of a bond rally which has carried long rates to record lows. On Friday, for the seventh successive trading session, the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue dropped to the lowest level since the Federal government began issuing these bonds on a regular basis 16 years ago. The long bond ended the week with a yield of 6.54 per cent, down from 6.64 per cent a week earlier after a raft of statistics showing that fears of inflation in the early summer were greatly exaggerated, and highlighting new signs of sluggish growth. The biggest push to the market came from the producer and consumer price indices for June, released on Tuesday and Wednesday. The producer price index for finished goods dropped 0.3 per cent, its largest monthly decline since January 1991, while the consumer index was unchanged from May, its best performance since March 1991. But the rally was reinforced by figures on Friday showing that industrial production dipped one-fifth of a percentage point last month, its first decline since last September, and rumours that a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence was showing a drop in early July. The economy is certainly growing slowly, but is the outlook so sluggish that the Fed will feel moved to eliminate the bias towards tightening which it put in place last May (and artfully leaked to the market) at the height of the inflation scare? Mr Greenspan, a master of the verbal stonewall, is unlikely to reveal this to Congress on Tuesday, though he is expected to cut his forecast of economic growth this year to around 2.5 per cent from the 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent rate he suggested in his last Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in February. At the same time, the Fed's expectations of inflation seem likely to rise to around 3 per cent from the 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent rate foreseen in February, which most analysts always considered extremely optimistic. Still, there seem to be few inflationary clouds on the horizon. The severe flooding by the Mississippi will give an upward blip to some agricultural prices, but the past week has also brought some significant signs of contrary trends. Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant, announced big detergent price cuts, while General Motors is promising to raise its vehicle prices by an average of only 1.8 per cent in the model year that begins in the autumn. Most Wall Street analysts expect this background to keep Fed policy on hold for the immediate future, possibly the whole year, yet some wonder whether a touch of monetary easing could be in prospect before the summer is out. Mr Mitchell Held, of Smith Barney, suggests that if Congress can agree on a meaningful budget deficit reduction programme, and the economic growth and inflation numbers remain 'well-behaved', then the Fed will implement a modest easing to avoid a more pervasive slowdown. However, the Fed is unlikely to consider such action without the Senate and House of Representatives resolving their differences over a deficit package  -and expectations of agreement on legislation are already largely factored into bond prices. Any signs of serious difficulties in Congress over the next few weeks could severely upset the market's upward momentum, which might also be tried by a heavy Treasury refinancing operation in the second week of August. But with those caveats, the odds look good for the long bond yield falling through the psychologically significant level of 6.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Letter: EC in danger of endorsing obstacle to airline competition Sir, Prof Doganis (Personal View, April 29) performs a valuable service by highlighting the potential benefits of competition among airlines, especially from new entrants. A glimpse of the wastage which accumulates in the absence of competition was revealed by British Airways in 1989 when, despite a remarkable sudden productivity improvement of more than 50 per cent starting in 1979, it admitted that it still had to charge 25 per cent more than newer British airlines. That is a completely unnecessary burden of several million pounds every day upon businesses and individual travellers. Even with the benefit of fares 25 per cent higher than needed, some European airlines need subsidising. Prof Doganis lists four. Government subsidies to airlines are a prodigious waste of money. Immense savings in travel costs are waiting to be realised once the barriers to competition from new airlines are removed. But this is not happening, despite Prof Doganis' optimistic claim that European air transport will be largely liberalised by January 1993. Removing some old anti-competitive rules achieves little if passengers remain captives of the same old high-cost airlines. The principles of competition as set out in the Treaty of Rome would do the job if applied to aviation. In particular, there is an urgent need for a sustained systematic attack on so-called grandfather 'rights' which form a highly effective obstacle to new airlines, especially when used to govern access to essential facilities such as arrival and departure slots at the airports used by most passengers. Without competitive slots, no airline can be fully competitive, yet these privileges are currently allocated on the irrational basis that previous possession of these profit opportunities entitles the holder to first claim upon them, forever. Instead of scrapping this obstacle to effective competition, the European Commission appears to be in grave danger of endorsing it. It is to be hoped that the imminent UK presidency will come just in time to stop this myopic retrograde step, and instead will open real competition. When it does, it will convert European aviation into an efficient industry, and save the businesses, citizens and taxpayers of Europe a prodigious amount of money.

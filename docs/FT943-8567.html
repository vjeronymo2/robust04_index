			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charter sets new deadline for Esab bid Charter, the UK industrial group, has declined to raise its stalled Pounds 260m (Dollars 400m) bid for Esab, the Swedish welding group, but extended its original offer for two weeks to August 26 in the hope of a change of mind by reluctant Esab shareholders. The UK company said it had received acceptances at its offer price of SKr345 a share worth 53.1 per cent of the voting capital in Esab by last Friday's initial deadline. With shares acquired in the market, Charter is assured of 57.3 per cent of the votes in Esab. But the bid, recommended by the Esab board, is conditional on Charter receiving 90 per cent acceptances and has been blocked by the rejection of Swedish institutional shareholders who say it is underpriced. Since the bid was launched in late June, Esab has raised its earnings forecast and its share price has risen as high as SKr365. The share price has been kept high by the widespread expectation in Stockholm that Charter will raise its offer. But Charter has so far refused to budge from its insistence that the bid price - which at the time it was laid represented a 20 per cent premium - is based on a fair valuation of Esab, the world's largest supplier of welding equipment. Extension of the deadline to August 26 will at least give Charter more time to try to persuade Swedish minority shareholders that the bid is reasonable. It still has behind it the acceptance of Incentive, the Wallenberg family industrial group which is Esab's controlling shareholder. But the institutions, sensing Charter's reluctance to pull out of the takeover, argue that at the least, the premium in the original bid has been wiped out and should be restored in a revised offer. Charter may be calculating that this argument will be undermined by the bearish mood on the Stockholm stock market. Yesterday, Esab's B shares slipped SKr2.00 to SKr360 in trading interrupted for much of the day by technical problems in the trading system.</p>

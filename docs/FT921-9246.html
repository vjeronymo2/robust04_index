			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / BZW scraps leaked research report BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, yesterday announced it was scrapping a controversial research report after leaks of its conclusions hit the share prices of the companies concerned. The move by the broker follows complaints from some of the companies that the report was inaccurate and misleading. In a statement issued through the Stock Exchange yesterday, BZW said: 'Some comments in that report were capable of misunderstanding; this, and as a result (of) certain press comment, may have given rise to an inaccurate perception of the financial position of these companies.' A draft of the report is believed to have been sent to a number of investment institutions at the end of last week, attracting press comment. It concerned the likely effects of accounting changes proposed by the Accounting Standards Board on the published figures of five companies: Fisons, P&amp;O, Cable &amp; Wireless, Ladbroke and British Airways. At least three of the companies - Fisons, Cable &amp; Wireless and British Airways - said yesterday the BZW draft contained inaccuracies, and they had complained to the broker about these. The companies declined to describe the alleged inaccuracies. 'We were in touch with BZW, and pointed out inaccuracies in their statement and examples which were open to misinterpretation,' BA said. Cable &amp; Wireless added: 'We considered that the information that was coming out was misleading. On the basis of what we saw, we made representations to them (BZW).' The BZW paper is believed to have redrafted the five companies' accounts as they would look under sweeping changes proposed to UK accounting by the ASB. The resulting earnings per share, balance sheet gearing or both would have deteriorated in each case, the broker is believed to have said. Mr Bill Smith, head of UK research at BZW, said early press comment on the report had been wrong, and added: 'It was not a position we wanted to see continue, and this was the best way of dealing with it.' Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, said yesterday that redrafting published accounts to the board's proposed new formats should not have had any impact on the companies' share prices because it involved looking at existing information in a new way.</p>

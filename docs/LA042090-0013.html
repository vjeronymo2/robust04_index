			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN BLVD. DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The Times article on effects from planned development on or near Lincoln  Boulevard (Part A, April 4) describes a traffic gridlock catastrophe in the  making. Planning experts quoted in the article, and your editorial (April 8),  call for the formation of regional planning agencies as a solution to limit  uncontrolled development.  </P> <P> I believe regional planning will be ineffective without crucially needed  accountability at the local level to prohibit irresponsible decision making on  development.  </P> <P> With the exception of Culver City's Marina Place proposal, all of the runaway  offending large projects mentioned in the article, and most of the smaller  ones, are directly under the control of Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. Galanter is  a proponent of piecemeal, project-by-project deals with developers, an approach  that ignores the cumulative effect of development on the quality of our lives.  </P> <P> For several years Venice residents have asked Galanter not to approve  development that exceeds the capacity of our community. The Venice Town  Council, a grass-roots community organization, gathered petitions asking  Galanter to sponsor an objective study to set capacity limits. Galanter  rejected these requests.  </P> <P> STEVEN SCHLEIN  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

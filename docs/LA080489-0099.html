			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BARRETT STAYS WITHIN RANGE IN COUNTY GOLF  </P> <P> Bill Barrett needed a great finish as he teed off on the par-five 18th hole at  Torrey Pines South Thursday afternoon. A par would leave him in also-ran  territory in the $40,000 Buie San Diego County Open, but anything better would  keep him within range of the $4,500 first prize.  </P> <P> Barrett, from Spring Valley, finished with an eagle three and is one of eight  golfers three shots behind Brad Bell and Mike Swartz, who are at six-under 138  after 36 holes.  </P> <P> Bell, from Sacramento, shot a 69 and Swartz, of Phoenix, shot 70 to tie for the  lead entering today's final round. Seventy golfers made the cut of 149.  </P> <P> Barrett, like many toiling on the mini-tours, knows what a key shot or round  can do for a golfer.  </P> <P> There was that 63 he shot Saturday on the Golden State Tour stop at Rancho San  Diego. It put him in a playoff that he eventually won on the 10th extra hole.  </P> <P> Then there have been his last two attempts at the PGA Tour qualifying school.  Both times, Barrett made it through the sectionals, only to finish one shot  away from advancing to the final qualifying tournament in the regionals.  </P> <P> Barrett is between qualifying schools. He hits the mini-tour trail to keep  sharp and perhaps make a little money to help keep the drive alive. When he's  not on the course, he's giving between 30 and 40 lessons a week.  </P> <P> "I just do that to make me some money and keep playing," said Barrett, whose  sister, Sharon, is on the LPGA Tour. "You have to try to make enough money to  keep out of the gutter."  </P> <P> After a couple more tournaments, Barrett will prepare for PGA qualifying school  sectionals in October. This will be his ninth try. Once he made it to the final  rounds but did not get his card.  </P> <P> "A lot of these guys could do well on the tour if they could just get out  there," Barrett said. "A lot of these guys on the (PGA) tour now made it when  it wasn't as tough to get out there. Then they would have a qualifying school  every six months. Now if you miss, it's like putting your life on hold for  another year."  </P> <P> Barrett, 29, is not sure how many more years he has to qualify, but he's buoyed  by a recent trend.  </P> <P> "I was reading that the average age for guys getting their (PGA) card is 31,"  Barrett said. "The average age keeps going up because there are so many good  players out there and they don't make it and keep going back."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Burundian and  Mozambican organizations strongly urged the repatriation of old  Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in  South Korea, to the northern half of Korea and the release of An  Hak-sop, an old man.    Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who were soldiers of the Korean  People's Army during the Korean war served more than 30 years in  prison, after taken prisoners, for the mere reason that they  refused to recant their belief. And An Hak-sop is now serving  in prison for more than 40 years since he was arrested, charged  with being "a spy of North Korea".    The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association and the Burundian  Group for the Study of the Chuche Idea in a joint protest letter  to the South Korean authorities April 19 said the repatriation  of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan and the release of An Hak-sop  accord with the humanitarian spirit and the UN principles on  human rights and democracy.    The Mozambican committee for friendship with the people of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement April  13 said Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan were living a life worse than  death in South Korea without any protection, though they are  sick. It strongly urged an immediate return of the old men who  want to meet with their dear relatives and friends at home even  at this late hour of their life. The South Korean authorities  must know clearly that if they refused to return the old men,  they would face curses and a stern judgement by the Korean  people and the world people, warned the statement.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the proposed rule would eliminate the requirement to disclose litigation against CTAs allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and the principals of FCMs and IBs. Of course, as noted above with respect to conflicts of interest on the part of FCM and IB principals, the requirement to disclose all material information may require such disclosure in particular cases. Proposed Rule 4.24( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> l <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) also requires disclosure of litigation against a pool's trading manager, if any, and its principals, a requirement which is encompassed within the existing requirement for disclosure of litigation against CTAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Limited Risk Pools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> So-called ``guaranteed pools,'' which generally are designed to assure participants the return of their initial investment, have been extensively offered in recent years. Such pools generally commit a significant portion of their assets to interest-bearing instruments, letters of credit or other investments to fund the ``guarantee'' and correspondingly reduce the level of their futures or other investments. Many ``guarantee'' structures require that the participant maintain his investment in the fund for a specified period of years in order to realize on the guarantee. Because such structures impose significant costs which limit the potential for futures and other investment-related returns, are often subject to significant conditions,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that redemption rights not be exercised for a specified period of years from the date of the initial investment, and are subject to varying degrees of risk of nonfulfillment due to unforeseen trading losses or other reasons, the use of ``guarantee'' terminology in pool disclosure documents raises certain regulatory concerns. These concerns relate to such matters as the representations expressly or impliedly made as to the nature and security of the pool investment and the impact of the guarantee structure upon the overall investment. In Advisory 86&hyph;1 <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE> , the Division of Trading and Markets set forth certain disclosures that should be made in this context to assure that prospective investors are apprised of material information concerning guarantee structures. These include, for example, statements that a specified percentage of each unit of participation in the pool has been set aside to purchase the guarantee, that redemptions are not available for a specified period and that additional expenses and management fees are charged in connection with the guarantee, as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (1984&hyph;1986 Transfer Binder), Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) &para;23,035 (April 25, 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 4.24( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) would codify minimum disclosures relevant to limited risk pools. Under the proposal, the term ``limited risk pool'' would be defined in Rule 4.10(i) to mean ``a pool&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;that is designed to limit the loss of the initial investment of its participants.'' Rule 4.24( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) would generally codify Advisory 86&hyph;1 by requiring the CPO of a limited risk pool to describe the nature of the limitation on risk intended to be provided, the manner in which the limitation is achieved, including the cost of providing it, the conditions that must be satisfied for participants to receive the benefits of the risk limitation and the circumstances in which the risk limitation becomes operative. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 71 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CPOs are also reminded of the admonition in Advisory 86&hyph;1 that ``(a)ny statements that suggest that the risks of futures trading are decreased by reason of this structure have a high potential to mislead or deceive and could result in serious violations of the Commission's regulations and anti-fraud provisions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 71 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 4.24(p), which deals with transferability and redemption, would require a description of restrictions on redemption associated with the pool's investments. The Commission intends that this discussion include a description of any restrictions on transferability and redemption due to use of pool funds to support a guarantee and of any restrictions upon vesting of a guarantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Other Proposed Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current Rule 4.21 requires certain negative statements to be made in a pool disclosure document where there is no pertinent information to report. A CPO must state, if true, that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest regarding any aspect of the pool on the part of certain persons, that certain persons do not own any beneficial interest in the pool, that no material litigation occurred within the past five years against the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals, and that the CPO, CTA, and their principals will not trade for their own accounts. These negative statements would no longer be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 4.21 would permit CPOs to provide prospective participants who are accredited investors as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act <FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>  with a notice of intended offering and term sheet prior to delivery of the disclosure document. This provision should facilitate the offering of pools that qualify for relief from registration under the Securities Act as private offerings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 72 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR Rule 230.501 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is requesting comment as to whether there are specific situations in which the streamlined disclosure document proposed herein may not offer adequate protection to prospective and existing pool participants or managed account clients. Further, the Commission requests comment as to whether additional changes to further streamline the requirements of Rule 4.21 and 4.31 and improve the clarity of such disclosures could be made without reducing customer protection and on whether any additional disclosures should be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also requests comment on whether the requirement in current Rule 4.21(d) (proposed to be numbered as Rule 4.21(b)) that a CPO must receive from a prospective pool participant an acknowledgment that the participant has received a disclosure document for the pool continues to be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

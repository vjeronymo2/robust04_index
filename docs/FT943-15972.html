			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Output rise adds to recovery hopes: Modest gain in May - Healthy growth in manufacturing / New vehicle registrations surge Further evidence that the UK industrial recovery is becoming broadly based without overheating emerged yesterday after official figures showed that output expanded modestly in May. Car manufacturers also received a boost after new vehicle registrations surged in June, suggesting that car sales will rise to 2m this year for the first time in four years. The figures provided a favourable background to yesterday's monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, which was thought to have decided against a change in bank base rates from their current level of 5.25 per cent. The Central Statistical Office said that overall UK industrial output grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in May compared with April, and rose to its highest level for almost four years. This monthly growth was lower than in April, when output surged by 1.6 per cent compared with March. But the data was in line with City forecasts, and analysts welcomed it as a sign that the recovery was proceeding steadily without expanding so fast that it threatened to fuel inflation. Measured on a three-monthly basis, overall industrial output rose by 1.3 per cent in the three months to May, compared with the three months to February. Although this rise was boosted by a strong performance from the North Sea oil and gas sector, manufacturing also showed a healthy 1.2 per cent growth, quarter on quarter. As a result the CSO said yesterday it believed that manufacturing was growing at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent, up from its earlier trend estimate of 4 per cent. The Treasury welcomed the figures as 'confirmation of the broad-based recovery in manufacturing we have been seeing this year'. The most encouraging aspect of the data, analysts said, was that they showed that investment goods such as plant and machinery and intermediate products such as raw materials and components were playing an increasingly important role in recovery. Although the UK recovery last year was largely consumer led, last quarter's data showed that the output of investment and intermediate industries rose faster than in the consumer product industries. Mr Adam Cole, UK economist with James Capel, the stockbrokers, said: 'The more demand gets balanced between investment away from consumption, the more sustainable a recovery we have.' One concrete example of this manufacturing recovery came from statistics released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday. They showed a year-on-year jump of 18.3 per cent in new car registrations in June and of more than 24 per cent in commercial vehicle registrations. These figures have taken the UK car and commercial vehicle industry by surprise. Heavy truck sales have made a strong recovery from the market collapse of 1990, supporting the manufacturers' view that activity is picking up across a broad spectrum of the economy. However, the country's main car dealers' association warned that the recovery was mostly fuelled by corporate sales and did not yet appear to be extending to private motorists.

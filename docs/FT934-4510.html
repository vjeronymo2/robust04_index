			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / People: Hoare flies in to Heathrow Express BAA, the former British Airports Authority, has appointed an airline man to the post of managing director of Heathrow Express, the planned fast rail link between Heathrow and Paddington in west London. Rod Hoare is currently managing director of British Airways Regional, a Pounds 300m business, and has responsibility for the direct flights from Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland. Construction has already begun on the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express project, a joint venture between BAA, which owns 70 per cent and British Rail, with 30 per cent. Hoare says his main tasks will be to see that the project is completed on time and within cost and to ensure that the trains are built to a high standard. The new service is intended to reduce the journey time from the airport to Paddington to just 16 minutes from 1997. Hoare began his career with BOAC, the precursor of BA, spending 16 years with the airline. He was area manager for Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon when the Lebanese civil war broke out in the mid-1970s. He was the last BA expat to leave Beirut when he was finally forced to shut the office and move to Jordan and was subsequently awarded the MBE for services to the British community in Lebanon. He left BA to become chief executive at Sally Line, a ferry operator, and then moved to Pandair, the air freight subsidiary of P&amp;O. He then became director of ground operations for British Caledonian, the airline acquired by BA in 1988. A fan of Italian opera, Hoare recalls that Verdi's Aida was commissioned to mark the opening of the Suez canal. As far as he knows there are as yet no plans for an opera to commemorate the launch of the Heathrow Express.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hyundai plans capacity boost - Geneva Motor Show South Korea's leading carmaker, Hyundai, is planning to increase capacity by 60 per cent to 2m units by the year 2000, Mr Se Yung Chung, chairman, said yesterday. Current global production capacity was 1.25m units, 1.15m in Korea and 100,000 overseas, he told The Economist motor conference in Geneva. The group produced 960,000 vehicles last year with domestic sales of 620,000 and exports of 350,000. It controls close to half the domestic market. Mr Chung said Hyundai was planning to build more foreign production sites to reinforce its presence in overseas markets. 'We envision manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, south-east Asia and in the Middle East.' The company also intended to shift the emphasis in its new car development programme 'away from smaller passenger cars to put more weight on the development of higher value-added vehicles'. Production capacity would rise by 110,000 vehicles this year and construction had just begun on a bus and heavy duty truck plant in Chonju. The entire South Korean motor industry has embarked on a period of rapid expansion of capacity and is moving quickly to expand its presence in foreign markets. Hyundai is seeking to cut its dependence on Mitsubishi of Japan for engine technology. Mr Chung said that 'in the not too distant future all Hyundai vehicles will be equipped with engines and transmissions of Hyundai's proprietary design'. The company was seeking 'technological independence' so that its survival could not be challenged.</p>

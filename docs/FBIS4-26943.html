			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The State Development  Bank of China (SDBC) has granted 32 billion yuan in loans since  it was founded three months ago, SDBC spokesman Chen Tielin said  here today.    Ninety percent of the loans have gone to state key projects  in basic industries and infrastructure, he said.    "The 257 large and medium-sized projects covered by the  bank's loan scheme have all received 50 per cent of their  current year loan total of 57 billion yuan," said Chen.    The bank, which began operation on March 17, was responsible  for providing loans to finance state key construction projects.    The bank plans to provide 2.8 billion yuan loans to the  Beijing-Kowloon railway which is under construction and it has  so far provided 2.1 billion yuan to the project.    It has also pumped 1.25 billion yuan into the Three-Gorges  project, 42 percent of the total lending the bank has promised  for 1994.    The operational capital of the bank comes mainly from bonds  it issues to state specialized banks and other non-banking  financial institutions. It plans to issue 65 billion yuan of  financial bonds this year.    It has raised 28 billion yuan so far and another 37 billion  yuan will be raised in the latter half of this year.    The bank has formed a special committee to conduct studies  on  the 16 projects applying for loans, including the electrified  railway from Wuhan to Guangzhou and a Chang Jiang River bridge  at Wuhu, Anhui Province.    Chen revealed that the bank is considering extending working  capital loans to projects completed this year.    A dozen groups organized by the bank and the People's  Construction Bank of China have been dispatched to provinces and  major cities to find out the actual situation in the demand for  working capital, Chen noted.    The bank is also exploring other ways of raising funds,  including issuing of bonds abroad, in order to secure long-term  and stable sources of funds, Chen said.</p>

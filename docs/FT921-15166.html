			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Swedish budget cuts spending sharply SWEDEN'S non-socialist coalition government announced net spending cuts of SKr14bn (Pounds 1.35bn) in its first budget for the next financial year starting on July 1, presented to parliament yesterday, Robert Taylor writes from Stockholm. The cuts amount to just over 3.5 per cent of total government expenditure in 1992-1993. But the government still faces a budget deficit of SKr70.8bn, mainly because of falling tax revenues and the cost of rising unemployment. Mrs Ann Wibble, the finance minister, said a further SKr10bn worth of net tax cuts would be needed in every financial year until the middle of the 1990s to stimulate a business recovery. She insisted the government would maintain a 'permanently tight fiscal policy and a fixed exchange rate'. The highest priorities would be to secure a low inflation rate, reduce unit labour costs and stimulate productivity through improved competitiveness. Mrs Wibble said the budget sought to create conditions for an export-led recovery from next year. The government also hoped to see a substantial increase in private saving. The Stockholm bourse reacted positively to the budget and the general index rose by 0.9 per cent yesterday. Sweden's tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product will fall to 52.2 per cent next year from 53.5 per cent in 1991, while state outlays will actually increase slightly from 63.8 per cent in 1991 to 64.2 per cent next year. The proposals to reduce public spending include higher charges on dental treatment and medicine, the end of benefits for the first two days of sickness absence, a decrease in housing subsidies and removal of subsidies from business and commerce. The government plans to increase spending on the disabled, single parents, infrastructure projects, education and aid to eastern Europe. Mrs Wibble said the budget would not hit living standards. This year private consumption is set to rise 0.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 28 SAPA -- Leaders of the National  Party's [NP] three new Cape provincial regions were elected at  the 79th and last congress of the former Cape National Party in  the Strand on Saturday.    Dr Dawie de Villiers, chairman of the NP's disbanded Cape  Province structure and minister of environment affairs and  tourism in the government of national unity, was elected leader  of the NP's Western Cape region under the party's new federal  structure.    Agriculture Minister and Senator Dr Kraai van Niekerk was  voted head of the Northern Cape region, and Dr Tertius Delport  as Eastern Cape leader.    The Cape National Party formally disbanded at its last  congress on Saturday, when party delegates at the Strand Civic  Centre unanimously adopted the NP's new federal constitution.  Discussions on the draft provincial constitutions were  postponed.    The three Cape provincial regions were to be formally  constituted at congresses later this year, possibly in October,  an NP source said.    The three new provincial leaders would constitute a  committee  to decide on the divisions of assets, liabilities and staff  matters.    In his address, Dr de Villiers said the three Cape provinces  had contributed 41.9 percent of the NP's total national tally in  the general elections.    He said the system of proportional representation was good,  but had also led to MPs being severed from their constituencies.    In future, magisterial districts should replace the old  Westminster-type constituencies as the only logical and  practical way around the problem of representation. One or more  party officers should be appointed in each magisterial district.    The revamped structure of proportional representation should  be verified when the country's final constitution was written  over the coming two years.    Dr de Villiers said the NP had done better than expected in  the "liberation elections", but had to get down to work  immediately to start preparing for the 1999 poll. "The NP will  continue to grow in strength and exercise its influence... Our  values and principles are greater than any challenges and  problems," he said to a standing ovation.    Western Cape Premier Mr Hernus Kriel was elected deputy  chairman in the province, along with Mrs Maretha Badenhorst MP  and Western Cape Housing Minister Mr Gerald Morkel.    Dr Delport's Eastern Cape deputy is Mr Tobie Meyer, with Mr  Manie Schoeman, Mr Donald Lee and Mrs Ann Nash elected as  vice-chairmen.    The Northern Cape vice-chairmen are Mr P W Saaiman, Mrs  Peggie Hollander and Mr Jan Brazelle.    Dr de Villiers said he had experienced some longing and  nostalgia at the end of his five years as leader of the Cape NP  -- and as one of only five leaders to have led the party in the  former province in the past 79 years.    The party faced big and difficult challenges. As a member of  the government of national unity it would also serve as the  oppositon, and would have to carry its supporters.    It had to be more responsive to the communities it  represented and be more than just a political party.    Dr van Niekerk proposed that the three new provincial  structures continue meeting every two or three years. "People  should not be discouraged, or think we are doing a mopping-up  operation; we are busy establishing South Africa on a new  footing."    Dr Delport said, "as Christians, we make room and welcome  others, but the NP cannot move from the basic values which it  built over so many years. We must make sure that it is the  party which wins the 1999 elections."</p>

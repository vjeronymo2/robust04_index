			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>   [Text] There were no talks in Lusaka today. The UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  negotiating team this morning informed its government  counterpart that it was not able to take part in the talks  because the UNITA leader had not given the green light to the  issues raised by the UNITA negotiators about Vorgan [Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel]. The government accepted the  UNITA negotiators' request for an adjournment because that is  the prerogative of the two teams. There are decisions that the  two negotiating teams cannot make without consulting their  leaders.    Today the two delegations held separate meetings. A  well-placed UNITA source said in Lusaka today that the issues  raised with Jonas Savimbi are not only linked to Vorgan, but  also to the government's reaction to UNITA's participation at  various levels of government. UNITA says the (?government's  reaction) has been negative. There is nothing scheduled for  tomorrow. It all depends on UNITA. Meanwhile, the government  continues to wait patiently.</p>

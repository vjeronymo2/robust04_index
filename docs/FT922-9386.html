			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / EC aid of Dollars 496m to help redundant customs agents THE European Commission yesterday set aside Ecu400m (Dollars 496m) to retrain or re-employ 250,000 customs agents whose jobs will disappear when European Community trade barriers fall at the end of 1992, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'This is a very special sector,' tax commissioner, Ms Christiane Scrivener, said after the 17-member Commission approved the special aid package: 'Up to midnight December 31, 1992, they have to work.' The Commission estimates 240,000 people work in 16,000 companies handling internal Community customs documents and procedures. Tens of thousands are expected to lose their jobs and others will have to retrain once internal tax frontiers are abolished to create the single EC market. Strike action by customs agents protesting against the job losses has caused chaos at frontiers, ports and airports in France, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. Ms Scrivener said the funds would only cover about 20 per cent of the estimated Ecu2.3bn cost of the industry shakeout. She said member states and customs had only belatedly accepted that barriers would really disappear.</p>

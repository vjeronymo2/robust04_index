			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Alcatel to win Framatome control Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications, engineering and transport company, appears set to gain control of Framatome, the state-owned nuclear power station group, according to an official at France's atomic energy authority. Mr Philippe Rouvillois, the general director of CEA Industrie, who has been charged by the government to draw up plans to privatise Framatome, said that Alcatel Alsthom was likely to be offered a further 15 per cent of Framatome's shares in addition to its existing stake of 44 per cent. In an interview with Les Echos, the French financial daily, Mr Rouvillois said that Alcatel Alsthom could be offered part of CEA Industrie's stake in Framatome and the 5 per cent of Framatome held by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank. EdF, the state electricity group would maintain its holding in Framatome at 10 per cent and the 5 per cent stake held by Framatome employees would also be unaffected. The proposed share structure would leave the state with a blocking stake of about 34 per cent, according to Mr Rouvillois. 'This would guarantee the preservation of essential interests in nuclear policy and in the company's co-operation with Siemens of Germany.' said Mr Rouvillois. The conclusion of the deal is expected to be reached within the next two or three months, according to Mr Rouvillois, following the valuation of the shares in the nuclear power station company and approval by the privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government on the sale of state assets. Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chairman, has made no secret of his desire to gain control of Framatome. He believes the two groups would complement each other, with Framatome's strength in the construction of nuclear power stations combining with Alcatel Alsthom's presence in conventional power generation. The Daya Bay project in China, in which Alcatel was involved in the construction of the conventional power units and Framatome led the nuclear reactor project, is seen as an example of how the groups could combine their activities. In 1990, Alcatel Alsthom briefly managed to acquire a majority stake in Framatome, raising its holding from 40 per cent to 52 per cent. But the socialist government of Mr Michel Rocard forced Alcatel to reduce its shareholding. Framatome, which also has activities in electronic components, has annual sales of more than FFr12bn (Dollars 2.02bn). In 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, it reported net profits of FFr900m.</p>

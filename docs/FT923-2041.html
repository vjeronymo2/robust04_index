			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Smiling through the tears: After a week of angst, John Major must start again from scratch. Philip Stephens takes the measure of the man It could not have been a crueller week for Mr John Major. In the space of a few hours the foreign exchange markets brushed aside everything the prime minister has worked for during nearly two years in 10 Downing Street. He must now start again from scratch. It is not an impossible task. Too many made the mistake five months ago of judging Mr Major's April general election victory as the precursor to permanent Conservative government. It would be equally wrong now to view the, albeit bloody, defeat he suffered this week at the hands of the currency speculators as the prelude to inevitable self-destruction. Politics is not that simple. There is no doubt, though, that the next year will be gruelling. The events of this week have greatly weakened Mr Major's political authority and left his government without a coherent economic strategy. They have exposed and widened the fault lines in his party over Europe. Mr Major's own reluctance yesterday to set any date for sterling's return to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System indicated that the personal pain of his defeat is clouding a more considered judgment of how he can rebuild his strategy. The mood at Westminster yesterday did not reflect that reality. In the extraordinary way of politics, the despair which had gripped the Conservatives on Wednesday night, when sterling was withdrawn from the ERM, had been replaced by a surreal euphoria. For many in a Tory party desperate to see an end to the recession, and one in which a streak of xenophobia is never far from the surface, breaking the link with the D-mark was a cathartic experience. Mr Norman Lamont, the embattled chancellor, caught the mood when he talked yesterday of running a 'British economic policy'. Ministers joined Tory MPs in predicting an early interest rate cut and in prophesying that a devalued pound would hasten recovery. And Britain would no longer be pushed around by the Germans. In a strange way it is easy to see how, in the short term, life could be easier for Mr Major. The chancellor was at pains yesterday to stress that anti-inflation policy would remain the first priority. But the implication of his comments was that the ERM obligation to hold sterling at DM2.95 had been imposing too tight a squeeze. A cabinet colleague said the government had recognised for some time that the tensions in the ERM caused by German unification meant that the British economy was 'disinflating too fast'. It had decided to stick with DM2.95 because of the long-term credibility that it would buy with financial markets. But now it had been forced off that rate, it could recognise a more realistic approach was possible. A more junior minister offered a Pounds 10 wager that interest rates would be below 10 per cent by the time Mr Major rises to address the Tory party conference on October 9. Added to a few harsh words about the Bundesbank, it would guarantee the prime minister a rapturous standing ovation. The minister was scornful of the suggestion that the conference might wonder about past promises to the Tory faithful to keep the pound pegged to the D-mark: 'Our capacity for collective amnesia is infinite.' An apparently ineffectual Labour opposition tied by its own support for the policy of holding the pound at DM2.95 added to the strange mood of optimism. But Mr Major cannot afford to relax. It may well be that life in the short term will be easier. It may be still easier if the French electorate votes tomorrow to reject the Maastricht treaty on European union. 'That would solve a lot of problems,' one of the prime minister's colleagues said this week. But as he reflects this weekend on the traumas of Wednesday, the prime minister cannot be sanguine. Since the day in October 1990 when he persuaded the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher to take sterling into the ERM he has invested as much of his own credibility in a single policy as any British politician in recent history. For two years he has poured scorn on the long list of predecessors in Number 10 who promised to defend the pound and then failed. Only 10 days ago he had this to say of the then Mr Harold Wilson's decision to devalue sterling in 1967. 'Did this lead to a sustained improvement in the UK's competitiveness?' he asked rhetorically. 'It did not. A brief flurry only. Retail price inflation doubled over the following year and any improvement in competitiveness swiftly ended. No greater competitiveness and doubled inflation: what sort of bargain is that?' Such phrases will come back to haunt him in coming months and years. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is promising a litany of them during what will be be a bruising debate on the economy in the House of Commons next Thursday. But there is more at stake than personal or political pride. Mr Major justly has the reputation of being a pragmatist. He is fond of telling people that he is neither an intellectual nor a philosopher. His steady yet spectacular rise through the ranks of the Tory party during the 1980s owed much to his shrewd determination to be branded neither a Thatcherite nor a Wet - but to seen by his peers as both. It is those traits which have brought the wounding comparisons this week with Mr Wilson, the arch-pragmatist of post-war British politics. But the prime minister's approach to inflation is different. His repeated assertions that Britain's poor inflation performance is at the root of the nation's economic decline represent conviction rather than convenience. He sees inflation as a moral as well as a political issue, a phenomenon that erodes the social fabric of society and drains its economic strength. Thus last week he quoted approvingly from Keynes that: 'There is no subtler, nor surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.' It was from that perspective that over nine difficult months as chancellor in 1990 he persuaded Mrs Margaret Thatcher to put sterling in the ERM. When he replaced her in 10 Downing Street a fixed parity for sterling against the D-mark was confirmed as the fast-track to the Holy Grail of stable prices. Barely two months ago Mr Major was wondering aloud at cocktail parties how long it would take before sterling joined the D-mark in Europe's hard-currency club. It sounded fanciful but he meant it. Now the pound has been bracketed with the lira and the peseta. He must add another two years at least to whatever the timescale - a decade or so - he had in mind. It was not just the prime minister's economic policy that lay in ruins on Wednesday evening. His second ambition when he got the job was to rebuild from the wreckage left by his predecessor a consensus in the Tory party over Britain's place in Europe. He is not a federalist and never will be. But he was and is convinced that Britain could not risk being stranded on the fringes of the European Community. Just as Mr Major wanted the pound to be spoken off in the same breath as the D-mark rather than the peseta so, too, was he convinced that Britain had to be in Europe's first division. He painstakingly rebuilt the bridges with Chancellor Helmut Kohl that had been so merrily burnt by his predecessor. In literally scores of meetings with groups of sceptical Tory backbench MPs he persuaded them that the government had to live with Europe rather than revile it. Mrs Thatcher was marginalised as the new prime minister declared that the Maastricht deal - albeit with its opt-out clauses - represented 'game, set and match' for his brand of pragmatic Europeanism. Ironically the seal was to be set on that policy during the current presidency of the Community, with December's Edinburgh summit confirming with great fanfare Britain's return to what Mr Major is fond of calling the 'heart of Europe'. Instead it is the Euro-sceptics who now have the upper hand. The swathe of uncommitted MPs in the Tory party at Westminster are beginning to wonder if the irreconcilables - the small band who have always opposed the ERM and Maastricht - were right in blaming sterling's link to the D-Mark for the economic pain of the past two years. Mr Major's thinly-veiled attacks on Germany and Mr Lamont's appeal to the spurious notion that there can be something akin to a uniquely British economic strategy have not helped his own cause. He questioned yesterday the basic structure of the ERM. But the D-Mark's domination of the system is nothing new. Mr Major, a former chancellor, cannot claim to have believed the Bundesbank would be anything but inflexible about its domestic anti-inflation strategy. Mr Major's present stance will help reassure the Euro-sceptics. And perhaps, after such a shattering week, it is not surprising that Mr Major should want nothing more than a period of peace and quiet at Westminster. But over the coming months he will have to rebuild a European policy which consists of more than blaming the Germans. He presides over a pro-European cabinet. The senior ministers he gathered around him on Wednesday to share in the decision to leave the ERM - Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke - still see Britain's future at the heart rather than the periphery over Europe. And, as Mr Heseltine signalled yesterday, they do not believe there is a long-term future for the pound outside the ERM once the single European market is in place. Nor do they doubt that the prime minister still shares his ambition of stable prices and partnership rather than conflict with Germany and France. During the crisis hours on Wednesday it was Mr Major who demanded confirmation and reconfirmation from the Treasury that the government had fulfilled all its ERM obligations before he took the decision to withdraw the pound. His colleagues expect Mr Major's understandable angst to be replaced in coming months with a return to the pragmatism which persuaded him to join the ERM and his party to jettison the anti-Europeanism into which Mrs Thatcher had led it. It will be a long and painful journey, punctuated by further outbursts of internecine strife in the Tory party. But Mr Major has invested too much in his anti-inflation strategy and in the ERM to break loose now; and too much in Europe to declare that he too is a Euro-sceptic.</p>

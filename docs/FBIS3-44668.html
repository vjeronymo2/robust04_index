Zhu Rongji,  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing  Committee and vice premier of the State Council, emphatically  pointed out at the meeting: Prices of grain and edible oil are  the base prices of the market. Therefore, we must quickly curb  the current rise of these prices and bring them back to a  reasonable level so we can prevent a possible chain reaction.  To achieve this, all localities must act as one body,  coordinate their efforts, and immediately take effective  measures to resolutely lower the current excessively high prices  of grain and edible oil as well as ensure a stable market in  order to create a favorable climate for the smooth institution  of various reform measures in the next year, and for ensuring  the economy develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy  manner.    Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Chi Haotian, Ismail Amat, and other  leading comrades of the State Council attended and spoke at the  meeting. Also attending were responsible officials of various  concerned departments and responsible comrades of concerned  departments of the people's governments of all provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities.    The meeting was presided over by State Councillor Luo Gan,  who is also secretary general of the State Council.    Zhu Rongji said: Since November, prices of grain and edible  oil have risen by a large margin -- from the coastal areas to  the interior of the country, from the south to the north --  rapidly spreading to many localities across the country. In  some localities, this might have been caused by the inadequate  supply of grain, low grain stocks, untimely shipping of grain,  and other factors. But judging from the overall situation, this  has been primarily caused by psychological factors, speculation,  and other temporary factors. This year, China's grain output  has been abundant, grain stocks have been ample, and grain  transportation has been ensured. As long as we provide better  guidance; unify our thinking; eradicate the erroneous idea that  "price increases do not matter," as is harbored by comrades of  some localities and departments; and employ various kinds of  propaganda to clear misunderstanding and doubts from the masses  minds, we will completely be able to swiftly keep down grain  prices and return them to a reasonable level.    Zhu Rongji pointed out: Some feel they no longer need to  watch grain prices now that control of grain prices has been  lifted. This is a misunderstanding of the market economy.  Decontrolling the grain market and prices does not mean we no  longer need to pay attention to them, and certainly does not  mean we can let things go their own way. According to the law  of market supply and demand, exercising regulation and control  of grain prices -- which affect the national economy, the  people's livelihood, and social stability -- is a common  practice in market economy countries as well as an important  part of our macroregulation and control efforts.    Zhu Rongji stated: The current efforts to keep down the  prices of grain and edible oil and to stabilize the market are  an important decision made by the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council; this decision must be resolutely implemented.  Localities across the country should act as one body and quickly  carry out the decision. First, by the end of this year,  state-owned grain stores should lower the selling price of grain  to around the level established in the state's plan for 1994;  localities who fail to reach this level must not take the  opportunity to raise grain prices. Second, grain prices should  be further appropriately lowered before the Spring Festival to  provide room for the readjustment of grain prices scheduled to  be made next year. State- owned grain stores should fully serve  as a major player in regulating and controlling the grain  market; they should list the lowered prices and should supply  grain without setting restrictions. While the purchase price of  grain stays high, state-owned grain departments should not race  to purchase grain at high prices, but should insist on  purchasing grain at originally established prices. They should  realize the grain supply is ample and the purchase price of  grain will decrease after the selling price is lowered and  stabilized. The grain and oil currently to be sold at lowered  prices was purchased at previous prices; therefore, selling them  at the lowered prices will not increase grain departments'  losses.    The meeting urged all concerned departments of the State  Council to meticulously organize and coordinate work on keeping  down the prices of grain and oil. It urged grain departments to  organize cadres and workers -- group by group and from time to  time -- to study the macromanagement of grain circulation under  the conditions of the socialist market economic system, and to  improve their business management skills to ensure a good job in  circulating grain. The meeting called on the railway and other  transportation departments to give priority to and fully assure  the transportation of grain, edible oil, and non staple food; it  called on local people's governments at all levels as well as  their grain, price, industry and commerce, taxation, and other  concerned departments to tighten supervision and inspection of  local grain markets and to properly manage them; it resolutely  urged cracking down on unlicensed grain dealing, attempting to  drive up grain prices, speculation, and attempting to manipulate  grain markets in order to ensure the grain market remains stable  and the objectives of price lowering are achieved within the  specified period.    The meeting emphasized: While stabilizing the grain prices  and the market, we should effectively strengthen our leadership  over agricultural production, take effective measures to ensure  good agricultural production this winter and the coming spring,  and, following the bumper agricultural harvests we have this  year, strive to reap another good agricultural harvest next year.    Bai Meiqing, vice minister of internal trade, briefed the  meeting on the "Opinions on the Arrangement for Keeping Down the  Prices of Grain and Edible Oil and for Stabilizing the Market,"  which was prepared by the State Planning Commission, the State  Commission for Economics and Trade, the Ministry of Internal  Trade, and the State Grain Storage Bureau. He also set forth a  plan for keeping down the price of grain and edible oil and for  stabilizing the market; he urged grain departments at all levels  to go all out and take the lead in keeping down the price of  grain and edible oil, to endeavor to ensure a good job in grain  and edible oil processing and transportation, to supply grain  and oil in a timely manner at the announced lowered prices  without setting restrictions, to not set limits on the amounts  of grain and oil to be sold, and to ensure that grain and edible  oil are not out of stock. He also urged grain departments to  ensure grain and edible oil supplies for key large and medium  cities as well as for poor areas, and to ensure timely supplies  at wholesale prices for the cafeterias of universities and  special secondary schools.    The meeting coordinated and decided the procedures for  lowering the price of edible oil and the standard levels of the  price of edible oil. Based on production-supply-marketing  balance situations and the price relations in specific  localities, the meeting decided the price parities for  respective localities and for grains and edible oils of various  categories.</p>

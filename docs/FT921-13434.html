			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Riyad Bank seeks to raise SR3.8bn in new equity RIYAD BANK, the largest in Saudi Arabia, is seeking nearly to double its capital base in a move which could herald the start of a wider recapitalisation of the Saudi banking system. If successful, the offer to Saudi investors would raise SR3.8bn in new equity for the bank, which had shareholders' funds of SR4.6bn at the end of 1990. The bank said the new equity, plus retained earnings from last year, would double the bank's capital-to-assets ratio to about 10 per cent. This would give it the best ratio of any bank in the kingdom. The bank does not disclose its risk-adjusted capital ratio. The move aims to provide extra capacity to meet new loan demand in the kingdom in the aftermath of the Gulf war, the bank said. The 8m shares on offer, at SR475 each, are restricted to Saudi investors. Riyad Bank is also adding to its equity base through a five-for-one capitalisation issue.</p>

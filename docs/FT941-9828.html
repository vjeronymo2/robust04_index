			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finger-in-the-air method: Northern industrialists' plans We are putting money into our businesses. We're not idiots,' says Mr David Belton, finance director of Richardson Sheffield, which makes kitchen knifes. His comments sum up the reaction of many in Yorkshire and Humberside to the charge this week by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, that UK investment is weak because directors still want rates of return as high as 17-20 per cent on capital. Mr Belton believes he and his counterparts are doing everything they should in the current economic climate. 'We aim to improve productivity by 5 per cent each year. You can't do it by working harder. You can only do it through investment,' he says. But in the region identified by the CBI as among the most buoyant in the UK, consideration of rates of return often forms little part of investment decisions. More worrying for those who, like Mr Davies, are concerned about Britain's long-term production capacity, the main driving force seems to be a quest to push short-term unit costs constantly downwards. The Engineering Employers Federation recently calculated the region is working at only 72 per cent capacity - leaving room for production to expand without new plants. For Mr Andrew Cook, chairman of William Cook &amp; Sons, which makes steel castings, cost cutting is first priority now that trading conditions are more favourable. 'Leaving the European exchange rate mechanism saved all of us in our export markets. The consequent low interest rates have enabled us all to afford more debt for investment in efficiency,' he says. The company turns over Pounds 100m a year with 1,900 employees. It is investing Pounds 6m this year in streamlining its operations, buying new machines and relocating plant. 'I don't work out rates of return. My technique is more finger-in-the-air. The answer has to be yes to two questions: have we got a fundamentally sound market? Do we want to stay in it? We then invest in anything that keeps driving down costs to keep us in the game,' he says. Similarly, Mr Roy Pilgrim, finance director of Aurora, a Sheffield steel processor which has a capital expenditure budget of Pounds 7m, says he has 'no rigid rules' about rates of return. 'What we expect is payback within three years. We look at the security of the market for any product. We then buy almost anything that takes cost out of making it.' Mr Mike Hennesey, chief executive of Kalon, which makes paint for DIY retail stores at its factory in Batley, West Yorkshire, says: 'We don't bother with discounted cash flow analysis and all that nonsense. We look at how much cash we have got and estimate how long it will take to get it back if we use it to become more efficient. If it looks OK, we go.' He says, however, that improved competitiveness has won the company increased market share, so some investment is now going into extra manufacturing capacity. Among small manufacturers, traditional investment decision-making practices are well entrenched. Mr Hugh Foulerton's family owns United Cutlers of Sheffield, which sells mainly sterling silver cutlery direct from the factory by mail order, cutting out retailers' margins. 'My niece estimates our cash flow for six months and 12 months ahead and we then decide what we can afford to invest,' he says. Since 1991 the company has invested a total of Pounds 285,000 and annual sales are 40 per cent up at about Pounds 2.5m a year. Mr Charles Burton of Haines Watts, a Yorkshire-based accountancy firm, says most investment decisions made by his small business clients are based on unsophisticated principles. 'The smarter they work, the more profitable they will be. Very few owner-managed businesses have got the resources or skills to work out a rate of return. They rely on gut feel and come to us for help with the tax allowances. They don't even work it out on the back of an envelope.'</p>

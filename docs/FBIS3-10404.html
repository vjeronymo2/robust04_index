			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994; source follows in parentheses after  each item.    According to a poll by EL TIEMPO and the National Advisory  Center (CNC) conducted from 6 to 10 February in 22 cities,  Liberal Party (PL) candidate hopeful Ernesto Samper Pizano is  ahead with 39 percent of the votes while Andres Pastrana Arango,  of the New Democratic Force (NDF), follows with 32 percent.  (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 20 Feb 94 pp 1a, 6a)    Samper Pizano has proposed all political parties, social  movements, and candidates running for office should "join in an  antiviolence crusade." He added the flare-up of violence is  aimed at "frightening the country and preventing the 13 March  elections." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 23 Feb  94 p 7a)    Both Pastrana Arango and Samper Pizano continue to campaign  in Antioquia and Cauca Departments, explaining their economic  and social proposals. Both candidates are fighting for women's  vote as they announced programs to give women a more active role  in society and to protect children in the poorer areas. (Santa  Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 7a)    Senator Regina Betancur de Liska, presidential candidate  from  the Metapolitical Unitary Movement, began yesterday a tour of  the country in Leticia, Amazonas Department.

When  asked if he would accept being the vice president running mate  for Pastrano Arango, de la Calle Lombana answered: "I believe I  am going to become the president of the Republic, and I am not  hoping for any consolation prizes."

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETE SCHABARUM ON TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> Willie Brown's threat to punish the handful of Assembly members who supported  Prop. 140 by making the first cuts in these legislators' staffs aptly  demonstrates the vindictive and business-as-usual approach to government which  has Californians so fed up with Sacramento. Term limits may not be the panacea  for California's legislative ills, but it might do us all some good to  ultimately be rid of Brown.  </P> <P> MARK E. "EAGAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

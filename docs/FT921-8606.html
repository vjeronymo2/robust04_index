			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / French approve Nestle bid for Perrier THE French government has approved the offer by Nestle, the Swiss foods concern, to buy Perrier, the French mineral water group currently being courted by Italy's Agnelli family. Approval from the French finance ministry for the FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) bid being mounted by Nestle and its French ally, the Indosuez banking group, is a fresh setback for the Agnellis as it removes one of the obstacles to a full-scale takeover battle for Perrier on the stock market. The French bourse authorities, which have already given the offer the green light, can now open the bidding period during which Perrier stockholders can accept Nestle's FFr1,475 a share offer price. Bourse authorities were expected to move quickly to open the bidding period, which usually lasts around a month. Since they resumed trading last Monday, Perrier shares have climbed far above the FFr1,475 a share offered by Nestle and Indosuez, leading to the view that the group will need to raise the offer to win control of the company. Speculation has been fuelled by the disclosure that Arab Banking Corporation, the Bahrain-based bank, now has 1.4 per cent of Perrier. Although the government's decision is a step in Nestle's favour, the battle is by no means over. Attention this week will shift to the courts. The key issue is whether the French commercial courts will accept Nestle's attempt to annul the purchase of a crucial 13.8 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, a French foods group allied with the Agnellis.</p>

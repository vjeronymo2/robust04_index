			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: PATH TO AIRPORT SITE CONSENSUS WAS BUMPY  </P> <P> "Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die," veteran urban  planner Al Bell said in greeting about 125 Orange County residents attending  the final meeting of the Airport Site Coalition recently at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> "Everybody don't want an airport, but everybody wants to fly," he observed.  </P> <P> Coalition members had toiled for 20 months, examining more than 30 sites in  hopes of forging a public consensus on at least one location for a new regional  airport.  </P> <P> When it comes to jails, dumps, hazardous-waste treatment plants or shelters for  the homeless, reaching consensus on a site is tough. Finding a home for a new  airport is no different.  </P> <P> A consensus of sorts was reached. But critics will argue for months about  whether the rules were fair, the technical data on individual sites was  accurate and whether some of the choices reflected the political realities of  congressional, U.S. Forest Service and Pentagon opposition.  </P> <P> When the coalition's final report is filed in a few weeks, these sites are  likely to be on it: Potrero Los Pinos, a plateau east of San Juan Capistrano in  Cleveland National Forest; Cristianitos Canyon east of San Clemente; South Camp  Pendleton in San Diego County; March Air Force Base in Riverside County, and  Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Norton was a sort of sentimental choice for most of those attending the final  assembly because it's already available. The military is shutting it down. But  the coalition's final report may rank others higher.  </P> <P> Yet how the coalition even got this far is a bit of a mystery unless you  watched it perform these past 20 months. After all, the Board of Supervisors  declared six years ago that there is no "practical" site for a new airport  within Orange County's borders.  </P> <P> In this latest effort in a decades-long search for a new regional airport site,  San Clemente residents sought to protect their decidedly non-urban environs and  lobbied strongly against Cristianitos Canyon, a location preferred by some  technical experts.  </P> <P> San Clemente's apparently unsuccessful opposition was a major test of the  coalition's unorthodox attempt to build a consensus. The experimental strategy  was aimed at preventing residents of any one city from dictating the outcome of  the search, which has been authorized by the Board of Supervisors, the Federal  Aviation Administration and the Southern California Assn. of Governments.  </P> <P> The key elements were:  </P> <P> * Anyone could attend coalition meetings, but the agenda was controlled by a  "refinement" committee and urban planner Bell's consulting firm, the Planning  Center. Each meeting was aimed at resolving particular issues. Also, a point  system emerged that gave most weight to sites that would adversely affect the  fewest number of people.  </P> <P> * At meetings, participants were divided into about 20 small groups that met  individually for about an hour, each trying to resolve specific technical  issues on a given day's agenda. One person from each table summarized the  discussion orally for the larger assembly.  </P> <P> * After each meeting, the coalition staff and the refinement committee reviewed  the results and prepared for the next round of evaluations, which would narrow  further the list of sites.  </P> <P> More than a few folks were unhappy. Advocates of civilian or joint use of El  Toro Marine Corps Air Station were upset when El Toro was eliminated at the  coalition's July meeting. Others stopped attending after North County sites  such as Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center fell by the wayside.  </P> <P> San Clemente folks were relieved when Cristianitos Canyon was relegated to a  backup list last July. Later, the coalition staff and the refinement committee  members took it upon themselves to add it to the list of top sites. They also  removed Norton from the top list, ostensibly to avoid duplicating airport  studies that San Bernardino County officials recently initiated.  </P> <P> It was on Saturday, Nov. 18, that about 125 people gathered in the faculty  dining room at the University Club to have a final say. Critics of both the  Potrero Los Pinos and Cristianitos Canyon sites accused Bell and his staff of  using flawed data. Some spoke of preserving such open space for future  generations.  </P> <P> The caucus reports came in. One disgruntled group asked that Bell's consulting  firm not be retained for any follow-up effort.  </P> <P> Despite significant dissent, Cristianitos Canyon appeared to stay on the final  list, as did Potrero Los Pinos. And Norton appeared to be headed back onto  list.  </P> <P> Some San Clemente residents thought that they had been railroaded by the staff  intervention to resurrect the Cristianitos Canyon site. Others were eager to  proceed, including coalition member Doyle Selden of Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> "We've had 20 years of inaction, so now let's close the loop and move on,"  Seldon told fellow members.  </P> <P> The next step is for final report to be submitted to the Board of Supervisors  and various agencies. They will be asked to act on a proposal to create a  joint, public-private consortium to seek specific airport construction  proposals for various sites, and all necessary governmental permits.  </P> <P> Regardless of the outcome, some say the coalition has made progress.  </P> <P> Said Barbara Lichman, director of the grass-roots Airport Working Group and an  Airport Site Coalition refinement committee member, "If nothing else, this  process came up with two brand-new Orange County sites that had never been  studied before."  </P></p>

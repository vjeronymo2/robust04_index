			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara/Diyarbakir -- Pro-Kurdish sources in Turkey  are denying government assertions that the mass migration of  villagers from parts of southeast Anatolia to northern Iraq is a  ploy by the outlawed Workers Party Kurdistan (PKK) aimed at  embarrassing Turkey in the West.    Referring to the migration of Kurdish villagers, first  brought to public attention earlier this month and which some  sources claim has been going on for months, Salim Sakik, deputy  for Sirnak from the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP), said on  Thursday [26 May] that government allegations on this subject  were false. Addressing Parliament Sakik said that he had  personally talked to people leaving for Northern Iraq and  concluded that they were being forced out of their villages by  special security forces operating in the region and by  government armed village guards. Sakik said these people  numbered around 13,000 and had to be helped.    He asked for a Parliamentary delegation to be sent to the  region to investigate the matter first-hand and to report back  on its findings.    Responding to the charges levelled by Sakik, Minister for  Interior Nahit Mentese repeated to Parliament his government's  view that the whole thing was "a new tactical move by the PKK."    "The PKK has induced these people to go to Northern Iraq by  making various promises to them" Mentese said, going on to  indicate that the Turkish security forces were in the region to  protect innocent citizens.    Referring to the fight against the PKK Mentese added that  the  "state was in a condition of self defense" in the region.  Mentese also pointed to the fact that Sakik had not condemned  the PKK for its recent attacks during which innocent women and  children were among those killed.    He repeated that the Turkish security forces were trying to  protect these people and recalled that the government had called  on those who had migrated to return to their country and their  homes.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told reporters  yesterday that talks had been held in Geneva with U.N. officials  about the subject of the migration of villagers from southeast  Anatolia to northern Iraq.    Ataman refrained from elaborating on this further but merely  repeated Ankara's contention that the migration was a "PKK ploy."    He also said that these people should not be considered as  refugees.    Kurdish sources in Diyarbakir have told the Turkish Daily  News [TDN] that the migration was taking place because local  people had been caught between the PKK and the security forces  in what is becoming an increasingly acrimonious and violent war.  One of those who has decided to migrate to northern Iraq,  Abdullah Yilmaz, the DEP candidate for mayor of Uludere in the  March local elections, claimed people had decided to flee from  his region because of pressure from the government-appointed  local prefect and from the regional security chief.    "There is a war raging on between Turkey and the PKK and it  is the civilian population which is being harmed in this war.  Many villages have been totally evacuated as a result," Yilmaz  said. He added that after he had given up his candidacy for  mayor of Uludere he had been subjected to great pressure from  local officials including "being dragged around the streets."  Indicating that such behaviour by the authorities had been  instrumental in causing people to flee their homes for northern  Iraq, Yilmaz said that around 6,000 had left from 14 villages in  the Uludere region alone because some of these villages had been  forcefully evacuated by the security forces and others bombed by  them.    Speaking to the TDN in the Bihere region Yilmaz said the  main  blame for the mass migration rested with the Turkish Security  forces.    "The state is pressuring us in every way possible. The PKK  is not pressuring us. We came here to get away from it all but  they are still firing artillery shells on us. Planes are flying  over our heads. We are being subjected to inhuman behaviour.  Our children are afraid. We can not make our voices heard in  the world. If international organizations do not take this  matter in hand many people will die" Yilmaz said.    Other sources said that recent village evacuations had been  concentrated in the Diyarbakir and Bingol regions. They named  Diyarbakir's counties of Kulp and Lica and Bingol's county of  Genc as examples.    The sources said that these regions were the scenes of  intense military activity over the past month and claimed that  special security forces were engaging in operations against  villages in the region in conjunction with bombing of these  villages. Other counties attached to Diyarbakir, such as Hani,  Dicle and Silvan have started to be targeted in the past few  days in the same way, these sources claimed.    Meanwhile some sources are saying that the exodus into  northern Iraq is much greater that the figures quoted to date  and indicate that up to 30,000 people may be involved.  According to some accounts reaching Ankara, villagers from  Hakkari's Cukurca region have also started to stream into  northern Iraq's Seranish and Sinaht areas.</p>

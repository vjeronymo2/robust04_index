			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Amateurs take centre stage RICHARD LUCE, they said, was the best arts minister because he came to the job 'without any preconceptions'. In other words, he knew nothing about the arts and did not pretend to. But he became the longest serving arts minister, and the forays he made into the cultural hinterland brought a missionary gleam to his eye. He found communities where the arts had a central social role, but the only arts available were amateur. After five years in the job Luce resigned, having ordered the most fundamental reorganisation of arts funding and the Arts Council since Lord Keynes set the ball rolling in 1945. What is not generally known is that the amateur was at the core of his thinking when he commissioned his former chief civil servant, Richard Wilding, to reassess the arts subsidy structure. Now Luce has become chairman of the Voluntary Arts Network (VAN), funded with money from the Gulbenkian Foundation, the Baring Foundation and the Arts Council. It will act as a catalyst for amateurs, with an information network and training advice, as well as lobbying for the voluntary arts. Peter Stark, the former head of Northern arts, is the director. 'I realised that it is entirely possible for people of all backgrounds and talents, wherever they may come from, to enjoy music, opera, drama and dance, or to learn to paint, write or become a craftsman' Luce said at the Royal Society of Arts recently. 'But I became increasingly aware that, despite all the advances made in the support of the professional artist, society was paying scant attention to the potential role of the amateur.' In the national arts strategy published last month the Arts Council has duly broken with Keynes's founding principle that the amateur was not a real artist. Research has found that more than half the population participates in the arts somehow, and the final document, A Creative Future, pledges support through practical help and funding for training. And when VAN was just a steering group it commissioned a report from the Policy Studies Institute which identified no fewer than seven million voluntary artists, and half a million of them members of 28 umbrella organisations like the National Federation of Music Societies. The NFMS has 1,350 member societies, and there are probably as many more which are not members. 'There is a remarkable resilience' said Russell Jones, director of the NFMS. 'With the recession, cuts in local authority funding, the difficulty of getting sponsorship, it's amazing they're not going under in droves, but our membership has increased steadily.' Their resilience may be that, unlike some professional bodies, amateur arts organisations have diverse sources of funds, so that the loss of one is not necessarily fatal. Some sponsors have recognised the voluntary sector's potential, however. Sainsbury saw it a decade ago, and the Choir of the Year competition - which ended its seven-week BBC television run this week - is one of their longest standing sponsorships, costing them about Pounds 250,000 a year. BT's new marketing head, Rodger Broad, has taken amateurs further with the BT Biennial, in which Little Theatre Guild amateur theatres get to put on a professional play specially commissioned, and now the new 'Making More of Music' programme with the NFMS, announced last month. And the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme started by Luce, whereby first time sponsors' largesse is matched by government money, is being modified to reach amateurs.</p>

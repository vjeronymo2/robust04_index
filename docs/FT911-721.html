			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Exceptional but hardly extraordinary - The reactions to the ASB's draft proposals for P&amp;L accounts IT IS NEARLY a month since the Accounting Standards Board published its working draft on the restructuring of company profit and loss accounts. First comments on the draft rules had to be submitted by Tuesday and the Board is now considering what modifications will have to be made before the proposals are reissued as a formal exposure draft. The original document envisaged a radical reworking of the profit and loss account. If adopted lock, stock and barrel as a formal financial reporting standard, as the ASB's rules are to be known, companies would have to provide far greater details of the source of income and expenditure than at present. They would also have to publish a prominent statement showing movements on reserves. Furthermore, they would not enjoy the same flexibility over non-recurring items as they do now. The distinction between extraordinary or exceptional would in effect be removed, and almost all unusual costs or revenues would have to be taken 'above the line', affecting earnings per share. Companies would also have to provide details of so-called discretionary expenditure, such as advertising and research and development. According to Prof David Tweedie, ASB chairman, the responses received by the Tuesday deadline were broadly in favour of the Board's plans. However there is much muttering in the accountancy world about the complexity of the proposals, a feeling shared by the technical committee of the 100 Group of top UK finance directors which met earlier this week to formulate its response to the ASB's initiative. Their worries focus on the appearance of the new P&amp;L account. There would be no fewer than eight columns, showing income and expenditure coming from businesses bought during the year, businesses sold, and businesses owned throughout the year, plus a total figure, for each of this year and the prior year. There are also worries about the complicated language of the draft rules. It is highly theoretical in tone and even technically literate accountants admit to being baffled at such concepts as 'components of comprehensive income'. Despite these objections, a spirit of compromise is in the air. There is none of the fierce confrontation between industry and standards-setters which characterised the 1989 debate over the draft rules on accounting for goodwill, issued by the Accounting Standards Committee, the ASB's predecessor. There is broad agreement among accountants, industrialists and institutional investors that fundamental reforms are required. 'Most of what the ASB is proposing is directly relevant to their declared objective of getting a better measure of a company's achieved performance,' says Mr Nigel Stapleton, chairman of the 100 Group's technical committee and finance director of Reed International. 'We support the principle of greater disclosure which underlies much of what the ASB is doing. We do, however, have some reservations about the details of the working draft. 'The 100 Group believes that the document provides a basis for discussion, but there are some areas where it is not completely to clear to us that the issues have been fully worked out. We hope that in a number of respects the exposure draft looks quite different to this working document.' Stapleton argues that there should be greater flexibility over the presentation of the new P&amp;L account. In principle he has no objection to the rule requiring a detailed analysis of income and expenditure. His doubts centre on the usefulness of such information once it goes beyond a certain level of detail. He says that what details there are should be relegated to the notes to the accounts, rather than clutter up the face of the P&amp;L account. He thinks that this should retain a degree of simplicity for the sake of greater usefulness. In addition he has doubts about the thinking behind the requirement to publish discretionary expenditure. The proposals which have attracted most attention from brokers and other analysts are those relating to extraordinaries and exceptionals. Stapleton is in favour of a general tightening up of the rules. However he adds: 'It is going a bit too far to forget about the distinction altogether as it would denigrate the earnings per share figure as a reasonable proxy of a company's basic performance.' The reason for the interest is clear, the two items account for a substantial part of UK companies total profits. If the costs of restructuring a business after a takeover, or the proceeds of a disposal, are all taken above the line reported profits will look very different. Just how different is evident from a number of pieces of research published in the last month. P-E International, a consultancy firm, has calculated that overall balance of extraordinary charges in the UK's top 250 companies amounts to a negative Pounds 2.9bn in the last financial year. Under the ASB proposals this would all be set off against reported earnings. At Goldman Sachs, the US investment house, Dr Sushil Wadwhani has calculated that companies in the FT-500 Index record extraordinary items in three out of five years on average, scotching the notion that extraordinary items are really that unusual. He suggests that share prices may be depressed as a result and argues that the new rules would reduce productivity growth. The essence of his argument is that the stock market is fixated on reported earnings per share. Companies would be reluctant to incur necessary restructuring expenditure because the costs would have to be taken above the line. The authors of Company Reporting, a monthly review of financial reporting practice, have looked at the latest accounts of 700 quoted UK companies. Of these, 53 per cent have classified certain items as extraordinary, that is taken below the line. More than half the items related to reorganisation and business disposals. 'If the changes mooted by the ASB result in a new accounting standard, it will have a resounding impact on financial reporting.'* The scene is set for some behind-the-scenes horse-trading. The more the formal exposure draft resembles last month's document, the more resounding the impact on UK financial reporting. If there are no changes at all, the finance directors are likely to be less polite than they are being this week. *Company Reporting May 1991, published by Company Reporting Ltd., 68 Dundas St., Edinburgh EH3 6QZ.

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAB INFORMANT HACKED TO DEATH  </P> <P> Hundreds of people gathered at a village square in the West Bank to watch  Palestinian militants hack to death an Arab man who admitted being an informer  for Israel, Arab reporters said Friday.  </P> <P> The body of the victim, Mohammed Khatatbeh, was left in the central square in  the village of Beit Furik, and his family was not allowed to bury him in the  town, the reporters said.  </P> <P> Well over 150 Palestinians have been killed by their brethren since the  uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began in  December, 1987. Like Khatatbeh, most were accused of cooperating with Israeli  authorities.  </P> <P> According to the Arab reporters, Khatatbeh was kidnaped Tuesday from his Beit  Furik home by six Palestinians. The following day, they took him to the village  mosque where he confessed over a loudspeaker that he had informed on fellow  Palestinians since 1968 and once led three Palestine Liberation Organization  guerrillas into an army ambush. Israeli officials say Palestinian activists  often use torture and violent interrogations to force such confessions from  suspected collaborators.  </P> <P> The militants then asked what should be done with Khatatbeh, and hundreds of  villagers poured into the streets and chanted, "Kill him! Kill him!"  </P> <P> Khatatbeh was hacked to death with axes and knives late Thursday as about 250  villagers looked on, the reporters said.  </P> <P> The army command confirmed that a body was found in Beit Furik and said the  case is being investigated.  </P> <P> In addition to the alleged collaborators, about 625 Palestinians have been  killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the uprising, and 43 Israelis have  died.  </P></p>

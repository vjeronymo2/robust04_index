			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other interim actions may include system and infrastructure upgrades, replacement of the cross-site transfer system, waste characterization, technology development and demonstration activities including a compact processing unit, and initial retrieval or pretreatment and immobilization activities. These activities, if undertaken, would also require preparation of independent NEPA reviews while the TWRS EIS is in preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Actions, New Tanks EIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed new tanks would provide waste storage space needed for resolution of tank safety issues and would not be used for storage of newly generated high-level waste. The new tanks would be improved versions of the existing DSTs. Each tank would be constructed of double shell stainless steel surrounded by a concrete liner, and would have a 1 million gallon capacity. All tanks would have leak detection monitoring systems and filtered ventilation systems. The EIS will address the construction of new tanks and associated new transfer lines, and the tank operations. For the purposes of this interim action EIS, operations considered would be limited to the retrieval, pH adjustment or alkalinity control, and storage of wastes from the Watchlist safety tanks. The primary focus of the EIS would be the resolution of safety issues related to the three tanks that are on the Watchlist because of hydrogen generation (241&hyph;SY&hyph;101, 241&hyph;SY&hyph;103 and 241&hyph;AN&hyph;104), but the tanks may also be used to alleviate safety concerns in other Watchlist tanks (50 tanks are currently on the Watchlist). Further decisions regarding the disposition of these wastes will be addressed by the TWRS EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives, New Tanks EIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new tanks EIS will evaluate all reasonable alternatives. Alternatives which have been tentatively identified for possible evaluation in this EIS include but are not limited to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> TPA Preferred Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The TPA preferred alternative is to construct two DSTs in the 200 West Area by 1997 and four DSTs in the 200 East Area by 1998. These new tanks would be utilized to store wastes retrieved from Watchlist tanks in order to resolve tank safety issues. Resolution of safety issues for these Watchlist tanks may include up to a three-to-one dilution of the wastes with water and/or caustic solutions. In order to achieve this dilution a combination of new and existing tank space would be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Construct Fewer Tanks <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this alternative, the need for additional tanks would be reduced using alternatives to retrieval for tank safety issue mitigation. An example would be the use of mixer pumps for mitigating the flammable gas safety issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> No Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EIS will also address the no action alternative, under which no additional underground high-level waste storage tanks would be built in the near term. No action would leave the safety issues for the Watchlist safety tanks unresolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Identification of Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The issues listed below have been tentatively identified for analysis in both EISs. This list is presented to facilitate public comment on the scope of the EISs. It is not intended to be all-inclusive or to predetermine the potential impacts of any of the alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Potential effects on the public and on-site workers from releases of radiological and nonradiological materials during normal operations and from reasonably postulated accidents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Pollution prevention and waste minimization;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Potential effects on air and water quality and other environmental consequences of normal operations and potential accidents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Potential cumulative effects of operations at the Hanford Site, including relevant impacts from other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities at the site;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Potential effects on endangered species, floodplain/wetlands, archaeological/historical sites;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Potential effects on future decommissioning decisions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

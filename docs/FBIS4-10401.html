			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio ACIR Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The most recent information supplied by the  authorities tasked with investigating the murder of Luis Donaldo  Colosio indicates that the authorities have so far arrested six  people who are presumably involved.... [pauses] accused of  co-participating or co-masterminding the assassination of  Colosio.    The last person to be arrested was Salvador Hernandez  Tomasini. He was identified as one of the individuals who  collaborated with the plot to assassinate Colosio. Sources at  the Attorney General's Office reported that Hernandez, according  to the Assistant Attorney General's Office in charge of the  case, was the person in dark glasses who was advancing on the  candidate's left flank, called his attention, and knelt on three  occasions; the last time when the Institutional Revolutionary  Party [PRI] candidate was hit by gun shots.    The arrest of another person who is assuredly involved in  the  plot is pending. He is the person who threw himself at the feet  of the candidate forcing him to stop and look down. At that  moment, Colosio was shot by someone holding a revolver,  apparently Mario Aburto Martinez, the confessed assassin and  presumed murderer of the PRI presidential candidate.    It is still said in Tijuana that it is shameful and grave  that the PRI recruited those involved in Colosio's assassination  to work as security guards. In other words, the party recruited  the hired assassins. Jesus Ruiz Barraza, former PRI leader  during 1986-89 in the State of Baja California, made this  observation.    Remember that elections were held in Baja California in July  1989 and that the PRI lost the governorship, which was won by  Ernesto Ruffo Appel of the National Action Party [PAN].  Henceforth, the PRI in Baja California started to dismember, to  disintegrate. There is resentment, profound resentment.    Thus -- and this is speculation, a theory that we were  noting  yesterday and that continues to gain force -- it appears that  the masterminds of this crime are PRI groups that resented Luis  Donaldo Colosio, because as national PRI president, he  recognized the PAN victory, that is, the victory of Ernesto  Ruffo Appel. PRI candidate Margarita Ortega de Villa lost that  election.    This is very serious, this former PRI leader in Baja  California said. It shows a lack of responsibility and  knowledge, but this was predictable a long time ago, because  these people were attacking the party ever since I was a leader,  Barraza pointed out. He added that they are the people with  whom I had frictions and disputes, because I did not want the  scourge of society to be part of the PRI. This is a very  serious and delicate issue. Barraza was interviewed at the  international airport in Tijuana.    Lazaro Cardenas, also a former political leader in Baja  California, said that the result of a disorganized party and  Political Council, in which each one of its 300 members have  gone their own way, is negligence in contracting those who  should have protected Colosio. This was undoubtedly an  important factor that affected his assassination.    The people involved in the assassination of Luis Donaldo  Colosio, according to the authorities -- and based on available  videotapes -- were identified as members of a group called  TUCAN. TUCAN, we reported yesterday and the newspapers noted  today, is an acronym whose expansion is: All United Against  National Action [Todos Unidos Contra Accion Nacional]. In other  words, this is a group struggling to recover the governorship,  power in Baja California. In this case, they resorted to  violence to protest against what Luis Donaldo Colosio had done,  at least that is what the evidence shows for the time being.    Thus, we are getting closer to what might be the truth. This  is why Ernesto Zedillo, who leads this effort, and leaders of  the industrial, commercial, and other sectors, and of the  political party demand that this investigation be completed at  all cost.</p>

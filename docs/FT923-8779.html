			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / NTT share fall pulls down Tokyo market THE ANGUISH of the Japanese government and the ire of individual shareholders intensified yesterday as stock in the semi-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dropped 7.6 per cent to a record low. This left NTT, Japan's most widely held share, down 13.4 per cent on the week - even though the issue was opened from last Saturday to ownership by foreign investors. Its decline dragged down the market, with a 408.17 fall to 15,518.27 in the Nikkei average of the country's 225 leading quoted companies, of which NTT is a crucial component. Shares in the company have been sliding for more than five years as profit expectations for the domestic telecommunications utility went unmet. From an original flotation price of Y1.197m each in early 1987 and an ascent to a peak Y3.18m that spring, NTT closed yesterday at just Y509,000 (Pounds 2,100), down Y42,000 on the day. NTT has 1.6m separate shareholders, many of whom have only one share each because of its high offer price. Mrs Nobuko Otake, a metropolitan housewife and one of the NTT's army of shareholders, said: 'The price right now is below half the price I paid. I can't see it ever getting back to the original price, because a second release of the shares is on the way.' The proposed sale is part of the problem for the government, which still owns two-thirds of NTT and is scheduled to sell a further tranche in the current fiscal year, which ends in March. Mr Tsutomo Hata, the finance minister, under pressure to prop up the market, yesterday stalled investors by saying he would decide on any sale only after 'closely monitoring stock market developments and other conditions for some more time'. The government wants to offload only another 3.2 per cent of NTT but the company's size means that, even if priced at yesterday's trough level, the sale would raise Y254.5bn. This, with the planned stock market launch of JR East, the first of the regional companies created in the breakup of the national Japan Railways, would help to finance promised measures to stimulate the economy. A supplementary budget due next month is expected to inject Y5,000bn to Y8,000bn into Japan's sagging economy. But in the face of dwindling growth in tax revenues, the government's funding plans are being thwarted. Mr Shimichi Kawamoto, a Tokyo office worker who bought two shares in the initial NTT sale, said he had sold one. Government moves to break up the company - a profitable unit in mobile telecommunications has already been spun off from the parent - had caused distress, he said. Shareholder Mrs Otake said she wanted to sell out by next year. 'I thought this share was different from the others, guaranteed by the government.' World markets, Page 19</p>

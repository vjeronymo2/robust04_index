			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Executives of the Japan New Party [JNP] and the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] met at a Tokyo restaurant on  the evening of 29 March. During the meeting, both sides agreed  that "the JNP, the DSP and Sakigake [Harbinger] share the same  political beliefs and policies," and they proposed that as a  first step toward realigning the current political parties "the  three ruling parties form a unified parliamentary group in the  House of Representatives."    The JNP and the DSP are trying to play a mediatory role  between the ruling coalition parties and to look for a way to  rally the ruling coalition parties to field their unified  candidates in the next general election at a time when Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Social Democratic Party  of Japan are increasingly feuding over a plan for a policy  research council.    Present at the meeting were five legislators from the JNP,  including Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka, and five legislators  from the DSP, including Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa.</p>

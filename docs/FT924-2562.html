			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (1): In for a rough ride - While the new administration's economic reforms have had some success, the foreign debt burden, proposed EC trade barriers and a fragmented congress mean that Ecuador's way forward will be long and hard THE government of President Sixto Duran Ballen has moved quickly on its election pledge to modernise the Ecuadorean economy. But as a result, in the four months it has been in power, the administration has been buffeted by dozens of strikes and by protests from squads throwing rocks. It has fumbled to find a coherent political voice and narrowly escaped losing two ministers to a Congress hungry for impeachment. All of this is standard fare in Ecuadorean politics, but the fact that the government, in which businessmen are spearheading the programme of economic reform, was not even granted the normal honeymoon period is an indication of how great a struggle the modernisation process will be. In spite of the optimism that accompanied the changeover from military to civilian rule in 1979, Ecuador lost ground during the 1980s: income per capita dropped by 7.5 per cent and at the end of the decade some 60 per cent of the population was living in poverty. The oil boom of the 1970s, administered by the military, had provided new roads, schools, hospitals and powerstations, but the subsequent price slide of crude combined with a heavy foreign debt left the nation stranded in the same inertia as many other Latin American countries. Most of Ecuador's 11m people are concentrated in the high Andean basins or on the tropical Pacific lowlands. For a country with such a complex climate and geography - ridges and valleys harbour plant and animal species inhabiting only a few square miles - it is surprisingly compact and accessible. Yet the highland-coastal division runs through many aspects of life, fostering rivalries that can undermine governments. Quito, which was once the northern capital of the Inca empire, houses much of the overblown bureaucracy that Mr Duran Ballen has promised to dismember. The 430,000 public sector employees account for over a quarter of employment and the state is so centralised that even the Galapagos regional development institute is located in Quito. While the Quito-based administration traditionally controls oil income distribution, Guayaquil is Ecuador's business capital and main port. It is also the biggest city, with more than half its 1.6m people packed into vast shanty towns where politicians trade sewerage pipes for votes. The atmosphere is tough and dynamic, the buildings squarely graceless, unlike the settled prettiness of Quito's church cupolas. Bananas, shrimp and cocoa products (Ecuador's main exports after oil) are shipped out through the port of Guayaquil - an enclave where customs inspectors fear to tread. This and other ports are on the government list for modernisation and a switch to a concession system has been proposed. Geography also dictates presidential formulae: Mr Duran Ballen is the highlander (although actually born in Boston), while vice-president Mr Alberto Dahik represents the coast. They appear complementary in other ways too. The president's 71 years and consensus-seeking concern is offset by Mr Dahik's young aggressive economic expertise. However, in discussions behind the scenes the president is reportedly no soft-hearted grandfather. The previous administration - Mr Rodrigo Borja's social democrat government  -began to open up the economy and liberalise trade over the past year, but it also bequeathed a significant budget deficit of 7 per cent of gross domestic product. The new administration has launched a predictably unpopular 'macroeconomic stabilisation plan' designed to cut the 52 per cent annual inflation rate, control public spending and replenish Ecuador's international reserves, which had fallen to Dollars 224m. At the same time the government has promised a package of structural reforms to reduce the size of the public sector, improve services and redirect funds into areas of social priority. However, to carry through these reforms, which involve privatisation, attracting foreign investment and undoing interminable red tape, the government must cajole a fragmented congress into passing large volumes of legislation. With the two government parties - the president's Republican Union and Mr Dahik's Conservative Party - between them lacking even 25 per cent of the legislature, Mr Duran will have to persuade other right-of-centre groupings to vote for official policy. He has moved quickly. At the beginning of the four-year term, when future candidates are as yet unconcerned about their electoral image, there is a better chance of getting their backing: Congress passed the first important government-sponsored law - changes in the regulation of the budget - two weeks ago. Many more legal reforms are still to come: these include privatisation, tax (including foreign investment), oil contracts, property rights, the stock exchange and public sector contracting procedures. Mr Dahik says he expects most of these to go through by next August. But the government is already tackling other problems such as the Dollars 12.3bn foreign debt, which includes Dollars 3.7bn in arrears. Talks with the commercial banks start this month and Ecuador will be negotiating for a global but realistic solution. Although the government has a strong economic policy, however, many cabinet members lack political experience. Instead of wooing the public and Congress and stressing the long-term effects of the structural reforms, the government has floundered in a mass of sometimes contradictory explanations about privatisation, creating uncertainty and exacerbating strikes and protests. The launching of a development strategy with the emphasis on social measures should help redress the balance - austerity has left the government little to spend. 'The priority in social policy is to lower inflation and have economic growth,' said Mr Pablo Lucio Paredes, general secretary of the National Development Council. 'The role of the state will be first to regulate markets and ensure competition, and secondly to have social programmes - for example, health and drinking water services - as well as justice and defence.' However, critics of the path chosen by the government argue that such policies are misguided in a country where more than half the population is outside the market, with low productivity, minimum education and no capacity to save, and the modernised industrial and agricultural sector is over-capitalised, over-protected and extremely inefficient. Mr Dahik is sanguine. 'It may not be the most efficient private sector but it is much better than the state.' Since the relatively benign military dictatorships of the 1970s, the armed forces have maintained an important role in Ecuadorean society. The army has shares in companies ranging from aviation to ecotourism. 'This began because the army needed certain supplies such as shoes, and also wanted to help industry take off when there was a weak business spirit,' said retired general Jose Gallardo, the minister of defence. 'Now we want to strengthen private shareholders - perhaps even privatise some companies completely - and reorient our resources.' In foreign relations, the government has already taken important steps towards free trade with Colombia and Venezuela and has begun negotiations with Chile. But while it is strengthening regional trade links, Europe and the US are still its main markets. As such, concerns are mounting over proposed EC import barriers to bananas, total exports of which brought in Dollars 715m last year. While a longstanding border problem with Peru eased after talks between the two presidents, guerrillas and drug traffickers have been under pressure in Colombia and Peru, and moving into frontier areas. Isolated incidents persist, but Ecuador has been successful in defusing incipient rebel groups in the past. However, the government recognises that drug trafficking has become a serious problem and realises that the country is no longer merely a transit centre. Both cocaine-making laboratories and poppy plantations have been found in recent months. Estimates of the amount of money which is being laundered have risen to Dollars 700-Dollars 800m a year, although stricter banking controls have been introduced. However, given the catching up that there is to do on so many fronts, many feel that the government is not moving fast enough. 'Ecuador - especially the social sector - has downgraded more than any other country in the continent except Peru,' said banker Mr Leon Roldos, former vice-president of Ecuador. 'A government that wants to put through structural reform must think ahead beyond the four years. It must get political forces working together and make people feel a long term commitment.'</p>

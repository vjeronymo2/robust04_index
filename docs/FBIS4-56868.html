			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "180 Minutes of News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has said some  of the additional resources the state is receiving in bolivares  from the oversupply of dollars could be earmarked for servicing  the foreign debt. Lucy Faustino filed this report from  Miraflores Palace:    [Begin recording] [Faustino] After confirming no changes to  the 1994 budget are expected as a result of the new value of the  dollar, Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez explained that the  inorganic money [dinero inorganico] generated by the devaluation  of our currency will contribute precisely to pay part of the  budget because, he recalled, the debt service has been  calculated in dollars.    Upon returning from his visit to the United States, the  finance minister indicated the mechanism for auctioning dollars  is convenient, adding that it must not be mistaken for imposing  exchange controls.    [Sosa] The very word auction means there are no controls. I  understand that auction means one person says two, I say three,  another person says three and one-half. To me that's not  control. Imposing controls would be for me to fix the exchange  rate at, say, two, and that would be that.    [Faustino] Julio Sosa Rodriguez also indicated that this  mechanism for auctioning dollars, which replaces the  mini-devaluations, will be permanent as long as the Central Bank  of Venezuela deems it appropriate.    Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez announced that the  Central Bank's decision to auction dollars could remain in force  for at least one year. Sosa Rodriguez reiterated that no  exchange controls have been proposed because such economic  measures are not part of the government's economic plan.    The finance minister termed as unfounded fears the rumors  that a black market for foreign exchange would emerge because of  the decision to auction dollars. Sosa explained that all  national sector must have confidence in the financial system.  The finance minister also asserted that it is absolutely false  that the government is studying a plan to levy a tax on the sale  of foreign currency. [end recording]</p>

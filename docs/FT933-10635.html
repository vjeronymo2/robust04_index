			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey National Abbey National's interim results are in stark contrast with those of Lloyds Bank which kicked off the current bank season on Friday. Whereas Abbey has been busy increasing both its loan book and its gross operating income, Lloyds has been cautious on the former with results that have disappointed the stock market on the latter. But Lloyds boasts a net return on equity of 21 per cent; at Abbey, the figure is a modest 10 per cent. In pushing Abbey's shares 2 per cent higher yesterday, the market appears to be signalling it is growth prospects which matter most. But Abbey's shares are partly rebounding after a period of weakness. Its increased mortgage market share has been achieved at the expense of greater recourse to wholesale funding with a consequent squeeze on margins. Since the mortgage market is highly competitive, this pressure could well continue. A lower tax rate as the need abates for provisions on French lending will help increase Abbey's return on capital. But Abbey's claim that it needs a generous capital ratio because of its unfamiliar name, particularly in international bond markets, is starting to look lame. That raises the strategic stakes. Management has not thus far covered itself in glory with its attempts to diversify - witness yesterday's blushes over French commercial property loans. If it cannot invest surplus capital wisely, Abbey should soon become bolder about returning it.</p>

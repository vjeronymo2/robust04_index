			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Doing Radio" program] </F>   [Text] Approximately 10,000 craftsmen registered as  self-employed workers in Havana will be reregistered this month  by the municipal labor committees and will be assigned new  categories, according to their work. Manuel Fernandez,  provincial labor and social security director, stated that the  labor committees and local industries are visiting every worker  included in this category to determine the veracity of their  employment and to assign the new categories.    The regulation requires that in order to be certified as  self-employed, the worker has to personally make the products,  without using middlemen and without employing salaried workers.  From now on, only those people who manually and singlehandedly  make items will be registered as craftsmen. These workers will  be required to acquire their raw materials and market their  products through the municipal enterprises of the local  industries sector.    The decision of the Havana's Administrative Council  established a monthly license fee of 100 pesos, but no  registration fee will be required.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Four die in third Natal massacre GUNMEN in South Africa's Natal province yesterday killed four supporters of the African National Congress. It was the third massacre in less than a week in an area where the ANC and rival Inkatha Freedom party are fighting for political power ahead of multiracial elections. Fears of political violence in the run-up to elections, expected to take place some time next year, were highlighted yesterday when Mr Justice Richard Goldstone, chairman of a government commission into public violence, said the commission would investigate ways of curbing pre-election unrest. He said a panel of local experts, helped by international expertise, would investigate issues such as the policing of polling stations, with some politicians concerned that the South African police could not monitor polling in an unbiased fashion. The role of international observers would also be investigated. Violence has worsened in recent days as popular expectations have focused on negotiations held last weekend to plan for elections. A local ANC official claimed that yesterday's attack, which targeted a group of ANC supporters travelling to a court hearing, was part of 'a planned strategy to destroy the ANC in the (Natal) midlands in the run-up to elections'. The attack follows the killing last week of six school children in Natal, and the massacre of 10 more people last Friday. The murders have sparked fears of a cycle of revenge attacks in the area, and have heightened criticism of politicians for failing to make more rapid progress toward a constitutional settlement. It has also raised serious concern over whether a free and fair election can be held in the key Natal province, the regional base of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of Inkatha, where territory is bitterly disputed with the ANC. Yesterday Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, condemned the attack and blamed local politicians for failing to control their supporters. 'Talk is not enough. Politicians must now take practical and visible steps. . . peace will not come by itself.'</p>

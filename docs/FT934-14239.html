			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries BAT Industries' shares are only a shade below the level from which they fell on Marlboro Friday in April. If Philip Morris can take the blame for the derating - thanks to its strategy of discounting - it is also partially responsible for the bounce. Investors have decided that the US company is cheap, dragging BAT up in sympathy. To the extent that US cigarette prices have stabilised it is certainly easier to take stock of the damage. BAT's operating margins in US tobacco have fallen by 10 percentage points. Profits from that business are likely to fall by more than half this year. It seems too much to hope that cigarette prices might soon be on the up. Even the reduced margins now being earned are respectable by the standards of other markets. President Clinton's proposed tobacco tax remains a threat. A tax anywhere near the Dollars 1-a-pack suggested would accelerate the shrinkage of the US cigarette market through the second half of the decade. While pricing pressures remain, it will be difficult to use the increased duty as cover for widening margins. The comfort is that US tobacco will probably account for less than 20 per cent of BAT's profits this year, down from 45 per cent at the end of the 1980s. The balance of risks now lies squarely in financial services, where BAT is enjoying better luck. Even at around 500p it might be argued that the shares do not reflect the full value of Eagle Star, Allied Dunbar and Farmers - but that seems an occupational hazard for a conglomerate.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: National Mutual unit issue totals HKDollars 1.08bn NATIONAL Mutual, the Australian insurance and investment group, is to receive HKDollars 765m (USDollars 98.6m) in direct proceeds from the flotation of its Hong Kong subsidiary. The HKDollars 1.08bn flotation of National Mutual Asia (NMA) will be the largest new issue in Hong Kong since Mr Rupert Murdoch raised HKDollars 2.26bn from the public offer and placement of 49 per cent of News Corporation's South China Morning Post newspaper group in June 1990. NMA has placed out existing shares representing 10.4 per cent of the company to institutional investors. A further 15.6 per cent of the enlarged company is being offered to the public, the majority in old shares. National Mutual will retain 74 per cent control. NMA was set up in Hong Kong in 1986 and has grown to be one of the two leading life assurance companies in the colony, along with American International Assurance. It has a 35 per cent market share. The company will receive HKDollars 297m from the share issue, to enable it to expand its business both in Hong Kong and the south-east Asian region. However, the flotation has been more beneficial to its parent. NMA paid out its first dividend, of HKDollars 154.4m, for the year to September 1992. This was in addition to the substantial proceeds from the sale of its existing shares. The pre-placement of NMA shares was well received by international institutions, and analysts expect the flotation to be fully subscribed. NMA recorded 169 per cent profits growth in the year to September 1991 and a further 27 per cent increase to HKDollars 355.6m in 1992. The prospectus forecast is for HKDollars 410m profit in 1993, putting the share offer on a prospective price-earnings ratio of 9.95.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE PRODS DEMOCRATS ON BUDGET  </P> <P> The White House expressed frustration with stalled budget talks and prodded  Democrats today to come up with their own plan to reduce the $169-billion  federal deficit.  </P> <P> "An agreement was made to simultaneously table proposals. We are ready. They  are not," Deputy White House Press Secretary Alixe Glen said after President  Bush's latest round of talks with the leaders of Congress. "That's where the  level of frustration is coming in."  </P> <P> Once the Democrats put a package on the table, "we can continue to move  forward, probably at a faster pace," she said.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody sandbagged anybody," Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), the  House majority leader, said after the hourlong Oval Office meeting.  </P> <P> Gephardt added: "There may have been some miscommunication about what was  supposed to happen."  </P> <P> "It's safe to assume that everyone is frustrated. . . . We've been at this for  83 days," Glen told reporters. "I think all sides would have hopes that we  would have been a little farther along by this point."  </P> <P> Gephardt said the two sides will decide "in the next few days" whether to keep  negotiating into August or wait until September to put their plans for slashing  spending on the table. If they decide to go ahead now, Gephardt said, it could  mean keeping Congress in session or calling the lawmakers back from vacation.  </P> <P> "The question is when is the best time to try to put together the final  disagreements, to bridge them and then to put a deal before the American people  and Congress," Gephardt said.  </P> <P> If the negotiators wait until September, it will allow Bush and the lawmakers  to take their summer vacations without embracing controversial packages of  spending cuts and revenue increases.  </P> <P> But pushing the showdown into September would bring the summit negotiators  closer to the Gramm-Rudman deadline of Oct. 1, when automatic cuts would be  inflicted on most federal programs if Bush and the lawmakers fail to produce  their own agreement.  </P></p>

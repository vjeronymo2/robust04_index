			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The two engines of a Boeing 737 jet that crashed in central England were  shipped to France, where they will be stripped down in an effort to determine  the cause of the crash. The British Midland Airways plane, flying from London  to Belfast, Northern Ireland, crashed onto an embankment of England's M1  highway last weekend, killing 44 people. Early investigations showed the left  engine had been on fire but that an apparently good right engine had been shut  down. The engines were manufactured jointly by General Electric and a French  firm.  </P></p>

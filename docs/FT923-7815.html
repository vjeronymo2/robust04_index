			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: Unreliable memoir - Fiction IT sounds harsh but it must be said. Michael Moorcock's 'Pyat' trilogy is the finest work to date of a 22nd-rate writer. But wait a second. Given a scale of literary excellence in which the top tier is occupied by Joyce, Dostoyevski and Proust, it is no mean achievement to be classified as 22nd rate. That corrected perspective is essential for the reader approaching Jerusalem Commands (Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 577 pages), because vastly inflated praise has been lavished on the earlier volumes, Byzantium Endures and The Laughter of Carthage. Consider these comments by the literary heavyweights. Robert Nye writes that this trilogy 'puts Michael Moorcock right into the front rank of contemporary English novelists'. Peter Ackroyd insists that these novels 'will be seen. . . as an imaginative record of our own time'. Angus Wilson had set the ball rolling as long ago as 1977 when he described the final novel of Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius tetralogy, The Condition of Muzak, as 'one of the most ambitious, illuminating and enjoyable works of fiction published in English since the war'. This work went on to win The Guardian fiction prize. All this does a disservice both to Moorcock and the reader. Michael Moorcock appears to have jettisoned the SF and Fantasy-powered vehicle on which he ascended to literary stardom. He has 50 or more books to his name, including the 30 volumes of the Eternal Champion romances; sword-and-sorcery formula titles which mined a rich, best-selling seam throughout the 1970s. His career has been almost as protean as that of his brain-child Jerry Cornelius. He has appeared in his time with the cult rock band Hawkwind and he edited the influential science fiction magazine New Worlds from 1964 to 1971. His metamorphosis from cult science fantasy writer to mainstream novelist and darling of the British literary establishment was effected largely by his book Mother London, a series of sharp contemporary cameos set in his native city, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize. So what can soberly be said about Jerusalem Commands? This latest instalment in the memoirs of Major Maxim Arturovitch Pyatnitski of the Don Cossacks, inventor manque, cocaine addict, genius and bigot, shows Moorcock at his most assured and entertaining. Its early backdrop, Hollywood in the 1920s, is minutely drawn and convincing (in sharp contrast to the vague St Petersburg setting of much of Byzantium Endures). Moorcock is a picaresque storyteller, at his best when evoking a colourful milieu of this sort (in The Laughter of Carthage, his prose creates a fine virtual reality of Istanbul which is sustained for page upon page). The author's comic deployment of his protagonist Pyat as an 'unreliable narrator' is also at its most sophisticated. Its funniest instances concern Pyat's ephemeral affair with Esme, the teenage whore he rescues from Istanbul's fleshpots and who follows him to the US, only to abandon him for a rich Mid-Western cattle tycoon as soon as her liner docks at the New York quayside. The black humour of all this is lost only on Major Pyat. The lonely ravings of the much-travelled, proselytising 80-year-old inventor (running a second-hand clothes store on the Portobello Road in his old age) which connect the narrative episodes are too frequent for my taste; there is only so much anti-Semitic and generally racist cant and rant I can take. These passages are meant to be heavy-handed and self-satirising, but their effect is finally tedious. The novel takes an unexpected and cruel turn, when it becomes clear that Pyat's film company on location in Egypt is bent on something far more sinister than making a movie about Tutenkhamun. thereafter, it was like a bargain-basement Nabokov at work, complete with the blood-spattered horror but without the crystalline purity of prose which alone renders it bearable. Jerusalem Commands and its companions together form a diverting, sometimes disturbing, often amusing series of novels. The hushed, reverential tones employed to describe them in certain literary quarters are completely undeserved.</p>

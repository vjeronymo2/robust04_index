			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Air France workers clash with police at Orly STRIKING Air France workers sprayed firehoses (see above), smashed vehicles and battled with police at Orly, the main domestic airport in Paris, yesterday, in protest at planned cuts in bonuses and jobs, reports David Buchan from Paris. After a morning of violence strike leaders opened talks at the ministry of transport, but there was no word of what progress had been made, if any. Aeroports de Paris, which runs Orly and the Charles de Gaulle international airport, said that by the early afternoon flights were back to normal for all airlines except Air France, and the runways and roads in and around the two airports were clear. Continued calm in the industry largely depended on the outcome of the talks at the transport ministry, officials said. Earlier some 3,000 strikers had attempted, in their fourth day of industrial action, to march out on to Orly's runways, but had eventually been stopped by French police using teargas. The strikers had caused a considerable amount of damage, Aeroports de Paris said. Mr Marc Blondel, leader of one of the two striking unions, had sent an appeal to President Mitterrand to intervene.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Immigration rules changed for wealthy Foreign millionaires willing to invest in Britain will be allowed to bypass the usual immigration rules to enter the UK, the government announced last night. Mr Charles Wardle, home office minister, said the government planned to create a new category for 'entrepreneurial investors' to boost investment in the UK. Overseas investors who prove they have Pounds 1m at their disposal and agree to invest Pounds 750,000 in government bonds, shares or corporate bonds will be allowed to enter the UK for a year. They will have the opportunity of extending their stay for three years, and then indefinitely, if they can prove they have invested the necessary funds. Investors and their dependants must also be able to live in the UK without taking employment, other than in their own businesses, or seeking public funds. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Wealthy potential immigrants willing to invest in Britain will be allowed to bypass usual immigration rules because it will be of direct benefit to the economy.' However, the changes, which come into force in October, were attacked by the Labour party which said they would benefit millionaires to the detriment of ordinary people. Mr Graham Allen, Labour's shadow home office minister, said: 'Under these arrangements, if you are a millionaire, you will get in. If you are an ordinary person, a husband trying to reunite with his wife, for instance, it is a lot tougher. 'I would like to know who these millionaires are. Who will be granted access to the UK? Will they include the drug barons . . . and those involved in financial scandals?' Minsters accused Labour of being 'fundamentally anti-business' in opposing the measures which they said were designed to promote investment. However, some Tory backbenchers privately voiced 'strong reservations' about the changes and said they would ask the Home Office for guarantees that it would not allow any millionaire to enter the UK irrespective of his or her background. The Home Office also denied accusations that the changes were aimed at allowing 'rich Hong Kong businessmen' a fast entry into the UK after 1997. It said wealthy Hong Kong businessmen would be able to take advantage of the new rules like anyone else.</p>

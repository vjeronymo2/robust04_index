			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman cuts interim loss to Pounds 0.98m JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, the Leicester-based machine tool company, yesterday announced pre-tax losses down from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 981,000 for the half year ended September 30, after making 'significant progress' with its new business strategy. The loss is struck on turnover of Pounds 6.27m (Pounds 6.71m). Losses per share were down from 17.7p to 8.2p and again there is no interim dividend. J&amp;S announced in July that it would end the machining of components for its grinding machines and dispose of non-core businesses. Mr Len Weaver, chairman, said yesterday that the new strategy had 'yielded improvements in our operating performances'. Good progress had been achieved with the outsourcing of machined components while partnership agreements with high-quality sub-contractors were being carefully negotiated. The company said in July that the main outcome of the completion of the new strategy would be the halving of its 500-strong workforce. It has already been reducedto 372 and would eventually fall to about 260. Mr Weaver said J&amp;S had contained its gearing at 44 per cent through control of working capital and the disposal of surplus machinery and plant. A heads of agreement had been signed recently for sale of the engineers' small tools business. On trading conditions, Mr Weaver said there had been no evidence of positive change in the deep recession engulfing much of manufacturing industry in the UK and overseas. 'Although orders on hand are Pounds 2.7m compared with Pounds 1.9m at the start of the period, the immediate outlook remains uncertain and frustrating.' Mr Weaver said full implementation of the new strategy would place the company in an excellent position.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE BENKE -- WAS SHE PUT ON 'MOMMY TRACK' ON WAY TO HIGH COURT?  </P> <P> Justice Patricia Benke is sitting at her desk, below a smiling, autographed  picture of Gov. George Deukmejian, insisting that she is not washed up. It is  odd that she feels compelled to do so.  </P> <P> Benke is, after all, something of a Wunderkind. Ever since Deukmejian named her  to the Municipal Court bench in mid-1983, Benke has powered through the  judicial ranks at a dazzling pace. Today, at age 39, she is the youngest member  and only woman on the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego.  </P> <P> But last month, Deukmejian bypassed Benke for a seat on the California Supreme  Court. The aftermath for her has been downright bewildering.  </P> <P> The trouble started when Justice Marcus Kaufman remarked that Benke -- widely  viewed as the favorite among four candidates for the prestigious post -- may  well have lost the job because she refused to uproot her family and move to San  Francisco, where the court is based.  </P> <P> Benke, who said she wanted to be "completely honest" with the governor's  appointments staff, also told them she would have trouble spending more than  three days a week away from home.  </P> <P> Benke conceded that managing the workload of a state Supreme Court justice  while spending just three days a week in the office would have been difficult.  But she said she would have "given it my darndest" and would have "patterned  myself after the men up there," two of whom spend shortened workweeks in San  Francisco because of long commutes.  </P> <P> The governor's office will not confirm whether Benke's unwillingness to  relocate was, in fact, the deciding strike against her, and the justice says  it's all a mystery to her. Nonetheless, the possibility that it played a  pivotal role has created quite a stir.  </P> <P> Indeed, Kaufman's observation provoked a rousing debate: Had Benke been  relegated to the "Mommy Track"?  </P> <P> "After Justice Kaufman made that comment, people from all over started sending  me articles on this 'mommy track' thing," Benke said in a recent interview. "I  had no idea the sensitive chord that was struck out there. It just exploded."  </P> <P> The "mommy track" concept was outlined in January in the Harvard Business  Review by veteran feminist Felice Schwartz, who suggested that some working  mothers might be willing to sacrifice a degree or career advancement and  compensation in exchange for flexible hours. The proposition has since been  subject to a bitter assault by those who contend that such a track would  institutionalize unequal treatment of women in the workplace.  </P> <P> After Kaufman's remark, Benke was deluged with requests for interviews, as well  as invitations to appear on television talk shows around California. A few  colleagues, believing that Benke indeed had been mommy-tracked, grumbled that  it was unfair. Women lawyer groups throughout the state also took an interest.  </P> <P> The hubbub over Benke all but stole the spotlight from the true woman of the  hour -- Court of Appeal Justice Joyce Kennard in Los Angeles, Deukmejian's  choice to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice John A. Arguelles.  </P> <P> Benke, meanwhile, was beginning to feel uncomfortable.  </P> <P> Initially, she said that if her desire to commute to the high court job had  tipped the scales against her, then that in itself was "an absolutely  legitimate" reason. Although Benke stands by that statement today, she said she  might have "given off the wrong signal" -- or led people to believe that she  has in fact been mommy-tracked and that it's just dandy with her.  </P> <P> "I woke up and said, 'Wait a minute. What's going on out there in the world? Am  I pushing myself into a position of saying, 'Well, I'm just going to raise my  children now and go to plays and bake blueberry muffins?'  </P> <P> "That's not where I see myself at all," Benke said emphatically. "I'm 39 years  old. I plan on being around for a long time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Committed to Husband  </P> <P> Benke calls herself "a fairly traditional mom" and said she is unswervingly  committed to her husband, Don, and two young sons. But all of the "mommy track"  talk made her uneasy -- worried that "people might think I was removing myself  from consideration for something else."  </P> <P> "The way this was being portrayed, I was afraid there was this perception I had  cut off my career," she said. "I can roll with the punches, but I'm certainly  not ready to sit back and retire."  </P> <P> As the news spread, speculation became contagious. Court watchers and feminists  -- who had tabbed Benke as the favorite because she was the only contender who  was on the governor's list when he last made appointments to the court in 1987  -- began offering their own, often conflicting opinions.  </P> <P> Some say the governor may have been justifiably leery of appointing another  justice whose home base was outside the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Arguelles, who stepped down after just two years on the court, says the burden  of commuting and being separated from his family in Orange County was  substantial.  </P> <P> Both Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice David N. Eagleson live in  Southern California and spend a shortened workweek in San Francisco, typically  arriving at the court Monday morning and returning home Thursday night. Some  scholars have warned that the strain of such commutes, coupled with the court's  heavy workload, could contribute to early "burnout."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge's Assessment  </P> <P> "It is a very onerous job, and many of those who have tried commuting have  found it does not work for them personally," said San Diego Superior Court  Judge Judith McConnell, immediate past president of the National Assn. of Women  Judges. "Clearly, the governor wants to appoint people who are going to stay  there for a significant length of time."  </P> <P> Given that goal, and given the governor's knowledge that commuters have  complained of "an unhappy marriage between work and home life," Benke's  decision not to relocate "may have been the telling mark against her,"  McConnell said.  </P> <P> "None of my contacts with the governor's office have indicated he's prejudiced  against mothers," McConnell said. "I'm unwilling to say there was a double  standard at work. I haven't seen it in other appointments."  </P> <P> Others have reacted angrily to the suggestion that Benke's desire to keep her  residence in San Diego might have stacked the odds against her.  </P> <P> The president of California Women Lawyers, Los Angeles attorney Janice  Kamenir-Reznik, said it would be "an inappropriate sort of invasion into  someone's personal life to mandate how close they live to their job if they are  in fact qualified for the job."  </P> <P> "The only question is, can they be at work and are they capable of conducting  the work they need to conduct," Kamenir-Reznik said. "That's the only thing  relevant."  </P> <P> Kamenir-Reznik stressed that she has no evidence other than "scuttlebutt" to  suggest that the governor chose Kennard because she was willing to move to San  Francisco and Benke was not. And she lauded Kennard, 47, as "an excellent  choice."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Kamenir-Reznik and others in feminist legal circlesargue that if  Lucas and Eagleson live outside the Bay Area and make long treks to work, Benke  could too.  </P> <P> After learning that Deukmejian had passed her over in favor of Kennard, Benke  spent a while pondering the episode alone in the quiet of her sixth-floor  chambers.  </P> <P> "It was interesting because the first time through, I was a long shot . . . and  this time there was this expectation out there (that I would be selected),"  Benke said. "I had to find a way emotionally to let go of it, to get rid of the  trappings."  </P> <P> It took a few days. There was a leisurely fishing trip with a son, lots of  second-guessing, a ton of "what ifs."  </P> <P> Would the job have been hers if she had persuaded her husband, a production  supervisor at KPBS-TV, to abandon their sprawling, custom-built home near San  Diego State University for a new life in the Bay Area?  </P> <P> "I don't know," Benke said, "I just don't know."  </P> <P> Was it wrong to tell the governor's office that, if appointed, she would be  reluctant to spend more than three days a week away from her husband and sons,  Michael, 7, and Pete, 5?  </P> <P> "I felt I had to be honest," Benke said. "If I were a different person, I could  say, 'No problem. I'll leave my kids with the housekeeper.' But that's not me.  . . . I just couldn't do that."  </P> <P> Did that place her at a competitive disadvantage from the outset?  </P> <P> No one said it was a liability, "but I think I knew from the beginning it was,"  Benke said. "If you've got somebody who says, 'My bags are packed and if the  call comes, I'm gone. I'll give 110%.' And you've got another person who says,  'I'd love the job. I'll do my best. But I need to tell you, this is my  limitation.'  </P> <P> "What do you do? Your highest priority has to be what's good for the court."  </P> <P> Finally, there's one other possibility to confront: "Maybe they just liked  Joyce better than me."  </P> <P> Benke is upbeat about her career, her life. It is time, she said, to "really  dig in here and concentrate," to develop a writing style and a judicial  philosophy, to make a mark on the Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> As for the future, Benke admits that she still has her eye on a state Supreme  Court job, which she calls "an incredible opportunity" and something that  "someone who loves the law just doesn't pass up."  </P> <P> "Will it happen? Maybe someday. I don't know. It's one of those things that  really is in the laps of the gods."  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Unigate/Hillsdown Hillsdown's purchase of Unigate's chicken business is a faintly depressing answer to a long-standing problem. Unigate's massive investment in poultry looked dubious from the outset. The outcome is a cumulative loss after the sale of some Pounds 60m, or roughly a year's net profits. Hillsdown will meanwhile pay an initial Pounds 19m for a business which lost Pounds 7m last year, chiefly as a means of protecting its own investment and reducing overcapacity. Assuming no objection from the Office of Fair Trading, Hillsdown will end up nearly doubling its share of the UK chicken market to 22 per cent, three times that of its nearest competitor. It will also leave itself dependent on the notoriously cyclical poultry market for a fifth of worldwide turnover. There will obviously be extensive closures, perhaps more among Hillsdown's older plants than Unigate's. The aim of adding value to several hundred thousand tonnes of chicken meat a year may prove more elusive. Taken all round, the deal is a sharp corrective to the view that food stocks are defensive because people have to eat. Since the onset of the recession 18 months ago, Unigate's shares have underperformed the market by 20 per cent, Hillsdown's by 45 per cent. In that period, Unigate has been increasingly forced back on its original dairy business. In the same period Unigate's chief competitor in that business, Northern Foods, has outperformed the market by two thirds. Whatever the industry, it seems, there is no substitute for management.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Contracting for public services - regulations not extended for first time, and employees' fears confirmed Sir, Contractors for local authority services may well have been confused by misleading reports in the FT and elsewhere about an amendment to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations proposed in the employment legislation now before parliament. These regulations provide for the transfer of employees' contracts where an undertaking is transferred to a new employer. Catherine Milton said in her articles on October 29 and 30: 'Until now the government has argued that the directive applies only to workers in the private sector.' That is not true. The government has always accepted that both public and private sectors come within the scope of the regulations. The amendments in the current bill certainly do not have the effect of extending the regulations to the public sector for the first time. However, the regulations do not normally apply where local authorities contract out in-house services in accordance with the requirements of our compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) legislation, since there is not normally a transfer of an undertaking in these circumstances. The amendment we are making to the regulations does not alter this position. CCT has led to both financial savings and improvements in the quality of local services, and it is in no one's interest to see its impact lessened by ill-informed reports. Nor has the Foreign and Commonwealth Office suspended its preparation for market testing, as your report stated. The White Paper published on November 25, as reported in your edition of November 26, contained a list of activities to be market tested in every government department, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The legal position on the regulations is one of a number of issues which have to be taken into account in the normal course of developing contracting out programmes, before tendering can proceed. The amendment we are making does not affect the government's plans for market testing or contracting out. Michael Forsyth, minister of state, Department of Employment Tothill Street, London SW1</p>

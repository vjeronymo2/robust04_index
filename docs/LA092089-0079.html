			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Nancy McKeon doesn't want to work in "Working Girl." The former "Facts of Life"  star has bowed out of the title role in NBC's midseason "Working Girl" series  based on the movie that won Melanie Griffith an Academy Award nomination.  McKeon left for "personal reasons," though she remains under exclusive contract  to Twentieth Television Corp. to develop and star in a TV series. Search for a  replacement is under way, and the studio hopes to begin filming next month as  planned. Meanwhile, McKeon will be seen in the TV movie "A Cry for Help: The  Tracey Thurman Story," Oct. 2 on NBC. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

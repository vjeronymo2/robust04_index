			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DAVIS, RAIDERS GO FOR BLOOD IN DRAFT, UPHOLD TRADITION  </P> <P> Give Los Angeles Raiders boss Al Davis the starring role in this version of  "Back To The Future III."  </P> <P> Trying to revive the mean-streets traditions of the Silver-and-Black, Davis  tried to move the franchise back to Oakland. That was an apparent failure.  Oakland doesn't want them.  </P> <P> A month ago, they signed former Raider Lyle Alzado to a player-coach contract  even though he is 41 years old.  </P> <P> Sunday's moves were Raider-like and risky. They drafted Arizona defensive end  Anthony Smith and Texas A&amp;M linebacker Aaron Wallace with their first two  choices.  </P> <P> Wallace was a top-five choice who dropped to the second round because of bad  work habits.  </P> <P> Smith, admittedly is a reformed thug.  </P> <P> Al, what are you doing? This was a rich draft filled with safer alternatives.  Why gamble on two of the riskiest players in the draft?  </P> <P> In his recommitment to Raider tradition, he might have grabbed the ultimate  Raider in Smith. Here is a guy who spent two years in a drug alcohol treatment  center. He's been arrested 14 or 15 times, mostly for theft and muggings.  </P> <P> "I almost got framed in an armed robbery," Smith said. "They were going to take  the money themselves and leave. They were holding a lady at gunpoint, She had a  heart attack and died."  </P> <P> For a while, he ran with the Black Spades gang. Sensing his need for a family  life during a Christmas, his friends in the gang broke into Macy's and stole a  train set for him.  </P> <P> As for the drug rehab, Smith said, "The serious time was when they put me in  the jackets and in the soft room when I was 14. It was a serious, serious  situation."  </P> <P> Just your typical Raider. But the Raiders might end up with a big zero if  Smith, a pass-rusher, and Wallace, a talented blitzing linebacker, fail. They  also might end up with two potential Pro Bowlers.  </P> <P> Still, there were safer picks that could have pushed the Raiders back to the  playoffs, so the Raiders might have had the strangest draft Sunday.  </P> <P> The big winner, though, was the Atlanta Falcons franchise. By sticking the  Indianapolis Colts with quarterback Jeff George, the man some consider the  $15-million Tony Eason, the Falcons gained Pro Bowl tackle Chris Hinton,  potential Pro Bowl receiver Andre Rison and a first-round choice next year.  They also drafted the perfect run-and-shoot halfback, Steve Broussard, and top  possible starters for their defense -- linebacker Darion Conner and defensive  end Oliver Barnett.  </P> <P> By trading up to get defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy, the Seattle Seahawks drew  positive grades. They also added two other starters to their defense --  linebacker Terry Wooden and strong safety Robert Blackmon.  </P> <P> The AFC West as a whole improved defensively. The San Diego Chargers plan to  use USC's Junior Seau as an inside linebacker on a defense that features three  of the best pass-rushers in football -- Burt Grossman, Leslie O'Neal and Lee  Williams. The Kansas City Chiefs grabbed solid inside linebacker Percy Snow.  Denver Broncos Coach Dan Reeves was relatively silent, but he revamped his  defense last season.  </P> <P> Other winners were the New England Patriots, who drafted two defensive starters  -- linebacker Chris Singleton and defensive tackle Ray Agnew -- and some  offensive help -- quarterback Tommy Hodson and wide receiver Greg McMurtry. The  New York Jets improved their offense with halfback Blair Thomas and wide  receiver Reggie Rembert.  </P> <P> Good grades also go to the Dallas Cowboys, Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants,  Detroit Lions and Miami Dolphins.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh Steelers Coach Chuck Noll, following a couple of impressive drafts,  reached for three choices that made him Sunday's second worst selector. In the  first round, he selected a tight end, Eric Green, for an offense that ignores  the position. And where did he come up with defensive end Kenny Davidson and  quarterback Neil O'Donnell?  </P> <P> Tampa Bay Buccaneers Coach Ray Perkins gambled his staff's future on two risky  players -- linebacker Keith McCants and halfback Reggie Cobb. McCants will need  knee surgery next week, but he is expected to be ready for training camp. Cobb  had drug problems at Tennessee but might be the best back in this draft.  </P> <P> Green Bay Packers General Manager Tom Braatz took two second-round players with  his two first-round choices -- running back Darrell Thompson and linebacker  Tony Bennett.  </P> <P> The Chicago Bears had a strange draft. They made the sixth choice the cheapest  player they could find. They took USC safety Mark Carrier because he agreed to  play for the same contract given to the sixth choice in last year's draft.  Coach Mike Ditka said the Bears decided last week to draft a player they could  sign.  </P> <P> But the goat of his draft was Indianapolis Colts General Manager Jimmy Irsay.  Irsay robbed two starters on his offense for George. Then, instead of repairing  his weak offensive line in the second round, he drafted fullback Anthony  Johnson of Notre Dame, which should push halfback Eric Dickerson into the  Turner Broadcasting System analyst chair.  </P> <P> Give the Colts a few months and fans will start wearing bags on their head  again. The Dolts are back.  </P></p>

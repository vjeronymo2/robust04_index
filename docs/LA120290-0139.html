			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'BRODERICK'S LANDING'  </P> <P> Dare we be encouraged? Is it wise to embrace the knowledge that San Diego's  legal profession can boast at least one attorney who questions Dan Broderick's  duality, and the San Diego County Bar Assn.'s fund drive in Broderick's honor?  ("San Diego at Large," Nov. 28)  </P> <P> Dan Broderick's "honor" prompts heated debate.  </P> <P> His very own writing declared a driven obsession for professional and material  success. His lust for power and greed clearly left his family on hold.  </P> <P> Please allow me to praise Joseph E. Driscoll for his lone and resonant voice.  Do his feelings and thinking truly stand apart from our legal community? Has he  no associates in his court?  </P> <P> DOROTHY BELKNAP, San Diego  </P></p>

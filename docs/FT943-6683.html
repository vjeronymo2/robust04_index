			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand tumbles to NKr36m at halfway A sharp fall in financial income arrested the recovery of Uni Storebrand in the first half, sending the Norwegian insurer's consolidated profits tumbling to NKr36m (Dollars 5m) from NKr689m. Bond market turbulence more than offset the improvement in underlying insurance business, the company said. Uni Storebrand almost collapsed in 1992 after a disastrous raid on Skandia, the Swedish insurer, but has retained its position as Norway's leading insurance group following reconstruction. The group's life unit saw operating profit slump to NKr1.09bn from NKr1.98bn as net financial income dropped to NKr2.43bn from NKr3.49bn. The underlying business showed a healthy trend with premiums rising 49 per cent to NKr3.34bn and market share climbing 2 percentage points to 30.7 per cent. Premiums were 7 per cent higher at NKr3.3bn.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian in its 1700 GMT newscast on 12 May  broadcasts the reactions of various political parties to the  Bosniak-Croatian accord reached in Vienna:    It is reported that "the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] is  hailing the Vienna agreement, considering it to be a huge step  toward peace. This agreement is also an important step toward  the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and  integral state. For various reasons the SDA has been of the  opinion that the first president of the federation should be  current President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, which the  public has been informed of with a statement from the 3 April  session of the SDA Executive Concil. However, on that occasion  already President Izetbegovic expressed the opinion that the  agreement and implementation of the federation's constitution  must not be put at risk on this issue, especially if the Croats  demonstrate willingness to embrace solutions that are in the  interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina. When the talks became  deadlocked two days ago, President Izetbegovic informed the  members of our negotiating team in Vienna of his position in  writing, and this, among other things, helped to overcome the  crisis. The Muslim people must have faith in the decisions of  President Izetbegovic and there is no reason for concern. The  SDA has an absolute majority in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly  and according to the constitution of the federation, the  Assembly has overall control over the work of the army and the  government. Besides, President Izetbegovic remains the president  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency until peace is restored.  Finally, President Izetbegovic remains the undisputed leader of  the Muslim people in the country and outside it," the SDA  statement declares.    "The Croatian Peasants' Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina believes  that the Vienna agreement is yet another step toward the goal  established by the Washington agreement. The party's opinion is  that all this represents a painstaking progress toward the goal  that is not as close as it would appear. The Croatian Peoples'  Party considers it most important that the war between the two  peoples has stopped." It is also reported that "the Croatian  Peasants' Party expresses hope that with the assistance of the  international community and the instruments that are at its  disposal, the Serbian side, too, will join the agreement of the  two peoples to preserve the integral Bosnia-Herzegovina within  the internationally recognized borders."    "The municipal committee of the Croatian Democratic  Community  Sarajevo expresses its satisfaction over the outcome of the  talks in Vienna, hoping that the implementation of this  agreement will be completed soon, secretary of this party  Stjepan (Dacic), stated for B-H PRESS. He expressed hope that  this agreement will give impetus to a resolution of all disputes  and promote the relations between the Croatian and the Bosniak  people. We expect that the constitutional assembly of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation will soon pass appropriate  decisions that will speed up the implementation of the Vienna  agreement."    The radio then goes on to report that "the Liberal Bosniak  Organization [LBO] is of the opinion that the creation of  situation that led to uncertainty in the implementation of the  provisions of the federation's constitution was unnecessary, LBO  Vice President Salih [word indistinct], said in light of the  [word indistinct] agreement on federation in Vienna. According  to him it is clear from this agreement that it involved a  conflict of a personal nature and the grand aspirations of some  individuals to assume certain posts. The LBO supports the  decision that the function of federation president be performed  by a member of one people and the post of prime minister by a  representative of the other people. In this sense the party  supports the president of the federation coming from among the  Croatian people, however, this candidate must be determined for  an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina. Regarding the cantonal setup,  the LBO does not consider it to be a firm territorial form of  demarcation but rather an administrative form of government."    In contrast to the above reactions, the radio reports that  Dragutin Zvonimir Cicak, head of the Croatian Civic Party of  Bosnia-Herzegovina from Zenica, "has said that the agreement on  cantonal [word indistinct] is causing the Croatian Civic Party  concern." Cicak adds that, "we cannot get into the heads of  those who are working on the Bosnia-Herzegovina state  constitution that the Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens are sovereign  over the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina territory." Cicak further  states that the drawing of internal borders with ethnic  connotations is "nonsensical." "We are once more creating an  atmosphere that will again lead to more conflicts in  linguistics, education, sport, culture, and so on, and which  will again lead nowhere." He assails the allocation of  ministerial and other functions on an ethnic basis as "idiocy  leading nowhere," because the country is currently suffering  from an acute shortage of capable cadres anyway.</p>

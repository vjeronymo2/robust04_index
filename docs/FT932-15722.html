			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Magnolia shows decline to Pounds 84,000 Magnolia Group, the manufacturer of picture frame mouldings and framing equipment, blamed difficult trading conditions for a sharp decline in 1992 profits. On turnover reduced to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 21.8m), pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 401,000 to Pounds 84,000 after exceptional charges of Pounds 208,000 for redundancies and reorganisation. Earnings fell from 4.65p to 1.89p. A nominal dividend of 0.1p for the year compares with a total of 5.4p for 1991.</p>

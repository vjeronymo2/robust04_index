			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hilclare incurs loss and makes cash call Hilclare, the USM-quoted company with interests in lighting and security products, is calling for Pounds 240,000 net via an underwritten rights issue. At the same time the company reported a loss of Pounds 70,000 pre-tax for the six months to September 30 compared with previous profits of Pounds 52,000. Turnover slipped to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.4m). Losses per share emerged at 1.7p (earnings 1.4p). There is again no interim dividend. However, the directors anticipate a 'satisfactory' outcome for the year and intend to declare a same-again full year payment of not less than 0.5p on the enlarged capital. The 2-for-7 rights issue at 35p per share is being underwritten by Wise Speke. The directors believe the proceeds of the issue will further assist plans to restore profitability to a more satisfactory level.</p>

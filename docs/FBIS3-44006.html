			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on AFrica" program] </F>   [Text] Kenema District, eastern Sierra Leone, is on a full  scale security alert at the moment. This follows a recent  threat by the RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels of Foday  Sankoh to infiltrate the town, and bearing in mind that the  rebels launched an attack just 80 miles from the town itself not  so long ago, the authorities are taking the threat very  seriously. Victor Silver has been in Kenema. He is now back in  Freetown from where he sent this report: [read by announcer]    Green tents have started dotting the Kenema township  landscape as part of operation keep Kenema safe. The  authorities have decided to take no chances. At six key points  across town, tents are manned by both military and police  personnel drawn from different sections of the two forces. Two  days ago, an offer from members of the region's civil defense  unit, known as Kamajowas or local hunters, to assist in the  operation was accepted. Telephone hot lines to report any  suspicious circumstances have not yet been established as in the  capital, Freetown, but mobile and static patrols work on a  24-hour basis. One top security officer told me that the  emphasis is first to stop rebel-attempted infiltration.  Secondly, to ensure that all soldiers are usefully engaged and,  thirdly, to reduce the crime rate in Kenema town and its  environs.    Given the recent spate of rebel attacks which came as close  as 18 miles to the town, it would appear that the residents are  taking nothing for granted. They remember the Kono takeover in  1990-92 and they form themselves into defense units to combat  any potential rebel threat. Life in Kenema is pretty normal,  business is as usual but you have to be close to the security  network to know that the military has thrown a ring of steel  around the township as government forces go into operation in an  area still occupied by rebels. One commander told me that the  continued occupation of (Noma Farmer) area by rebels was his  continuous nightmare and he predicted that once they were  flushed from this area, the rebels would have no base in Sierra  Leone. How soon this might be, he didn't say, but he believed  the morale of government troops was very high and he said that  even six soldiers are volunteering for frontline service.</p>

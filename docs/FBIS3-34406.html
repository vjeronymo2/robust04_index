"In addtition to arresting Kurosh Nik Akhtar, who was  apprehended because of the full awareness and prompt action of  our courageous people on the first of February, a large network  of his accomplices and cohorts have been identified," Fallahian  said.    According to the minister over 20 persons who have been part  of this network have been arrested so far.    The minister added that Nik Akhtar had changed his name from  Kamareh'ee [name as received] and that the investigations had  revealed that he and his accomplices had organized a meeting on  the night prior to the assassination attempt to fully discuss  the details of the plan to assassinate Iran's fourth president.    After the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran in the  February of 1979, the Islamic Republic was established.  Mohammad 'Ali Raja'i, the second president in the history of  this nascent republic, was killed along with Prime Minister,  Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Javad Bahonar, by a bomb that was  planted in their office by a terrrorist MKO member. Terrorist  Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), a group sponsored by  Saddam Hussayn, also targeted Iran's third president, Ayatollah  Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, now the supreme leader of the Islamic  revolution. During his term as the president Ayatollah  Khamene'i was injured while addressing a crowd at a mosque.    President Rafsanjani, the fourth president of the Islamic  republic who won his second term in the office by a landslide,  was the target of a failed assassination attempt by forghan  group in 1979, a group responsible for the death of many of the  ideologues of the Islamic revolution such as the late Ayatollah  Morteza Mottahari.    President Rafsanjani in an interview with Tehran radio after  the assassination attempt said that he did not recognize at  first what was going on, mistaking the gun shots for the  explosion of a light bulb in the mausoleum of the late Imam  Khomeyni.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Restrictive TV policy approved - European Court The European Court last week provided reassurance for member countries worried about judicial intervention in the European Community's internal broadcasting market. The Court said national legislation limiting licensed broadcasting stations' rights to invest in, or be involved in, the establishment, or operation of, foreign stations were permitted under the Rome Treaty's ban on restrictions on the free movement of capital and freedom to provide cross-border services. The Court's ruling was given in response to a reference from the Dutch Council of State, arising out of proceedings brought by the Dutch media authority against Veronica, a licensed Dutch television station which operated on a non-profit-making basis. The Dutch court found that Veronica had infringed certain provisions of the 1987 Dutch media law. However, it asked the ECJ to interpret the Rome Treaty's rules relating to capital movements and services so that the national court could decide on the compatibility of the media law with those provisions. Under the Dutch media law, air time is allocated by the Dutch media authority to broadcasting stations which must be associations of listeners and viewers established for the purpose of representing a particular social, cultural, religious or spiritual interest referred to in their constitutions. Their exclusive, or at least primary, purpose must be broadcasting and the satisfaction thereby of the Dutch public's social, cultural, religious or spiritual needs. Income must be used by the stations in connection with programme broadcasting. A large part of their finances comes from subsidies allocated by the media authority. Other income comes from listeners' and viewers' fees and advertising revenue. The provisions of the media law challenged by Veronica prohibited the broadcasting stations established in Holland from carrying on any activities other than those authorised by the media law or approved by the media authority. The authority accused Veronica of infringing the regulations by participating in the establishment in Luxembourg of a commercial broadcasting station planned to transmit into Holland and by providing effective support. The media authority relied on three grounds: Veronica's management had prepared a business plan and provided legal advice; Veronica had provided a bank guarantee in respect of the current account of RTL-Veronica; and it had agreed with another company to provide it with finance for the establishment of a new company which would take a minority stake in RTL-Veronica. The ECJ held that, in the circumstances of the case, the treaty rules concerning capital transfers and services did not preclude national media regulation which prohibits a broadcasting station established in its territory from carrying on the sort of activities Veronica was accused of. The Court appears to have reached its conclusions for two different reasons. First, referring to recent case law concerning Dutch broadcasting regulation, the ECJ said that Community law recognised as legitimate, objectives such as those pursued by the pluralist and non-commercial media and cultural policy implemented in the Dutch media law. Such cultural policy objectives were in the general good and could be legitimately pursued. Then the Court changed direction. It referred to earlier case law establishing that national rules may be enforced to prevent abusive reliance on treaty rights relating to services for the purpose of circumventing the national laws that apply to those established in that member state. For that reason, the court held that the Dutch media law could be enforced to prevent broadcasting stations from circumventing the national rules. While the ECJ seems to have extended the legal principles applicable to the free movement of goods and services to capital transfers, it is not clear to what extent the court is saying that the questions raised in this case are purely internal to the member state concerned and, therefore, that Community law rights are not relevant.

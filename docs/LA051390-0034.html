			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORIGINAL 'RUNNER'  </P> <P> Concerning Michael Wilmington's capsule review of "Blade Runner" in the May 6  list of special screenings:  </P> <P> I agree with Wilmington's criticism of "the tough-guy narration and a tacked-on  happy ending" in the version of "Blade Runner" that has been seen by millions  since 1982. But had he attended last Sunday's screening at the Cineplex Odeon  Fairfax, he would have been happy to be proven wrong, I believe.  </P> <P> Somewhere, the exhibitor obtained a print of what looked to be the director's  cut of the film.  </P> <P> It was obviously an audience test print, as it had no titles, and only half of  the music was finished. But it had no "tough-guy narration" by Harrison Ford,  no "tacked-on happy ending," and it was perfect.  </P> <P> Warners had cut all that was important out of this film, apparently trying to  make it a "Star Wars." A film about a sociopath who develops a sense of mercy  and, in dying, passes it to the hero with no conscience was made into a movie  about tall buildings and flying cars.  </P> <P> Warners should come clean and release a director's cut of this film, if only on  home video. Until it does, it will be denying the world a potential classic.  </P> <P> BRUCE WRIGHT  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P> <P>  Cineplex Odeon Corp. confirmed that the special print (70 millimeter) shown in  its Classic Film Festival was the cut of director Ridley Scott and that it  differed from the released version. A company spokesman said the publicity  material for the screening was sent out before this was known.  </P></p>

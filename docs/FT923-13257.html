			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (4): Forgers outsmarted - Security tops the list of technical priorities BANKS in Britain lost about Pounds 165m through card fraud last year, which explains why security is at the top of their list of priorities for progress in card technology. However, security has a price. The most secure technology of all, the smart or chip card, still costs significantly more than the humble magnetic stripe (mag stripe) card on which most charge and credit systems are based. The growth and acceptance of the chip card, however, has been dramatic. It is no longer a novelty pursued by the French (who invented it) for chauvinistic reasons. British Gas intends to use chip cards in place of hard cash in domestic meters; the new mobile telephone networks may use chip cards to add 'intelligence' to dumb handsets. Mobile telephones of the future will be inert boxes of electronics until the card is inserted, customising them for individual users. The chip card is undoubtedly the way of the future. Why is the chip card so secure? Because it is impossible for a criminal to forge, read or write to a chip card without access to sophisticated knowledge and equipment. There are only a handful of semiconductor manufacturers worldwide with the skills to build a complete microprocessor into the dimensions of a bank card. They include Siemens of Germany, Motorola of the US, Bull of France and Hitachi of Japan. The amount of processing power and memory which can be crammed on to a single sliver of silicon, however, is increasing each year, making possible a wider range of functions. On-card encryption - coding - of information, for example, adds a new dimension to security but is a heavy burden on the processing unit. New chips, not yet announced, will have a mathematics co-processor built in, a second microprocessor concerned entirely with the arithmetic processes of encrypting and decrypting information at an acceptable speed. The fundamental argument in card technology revolves around on-line or off-line working. On-line working means that each time a card is used, a conversation takes place over the telephone lines between the card reader and the card issuer's computer centre to establish that the card is genuine, that it is being used with the correct personal identification number (pin) and that the card has neither been lost, stolen nor used beyond its expiry date (the hot card list). Full details of the transaction are recorded as it is made and if, for example, the transaction limit was exceeded, it would be disallowed. Some argue that on-line is the only secure way. Off-line working using a magnetically-striped card means that only a few of these checks can be made. There is a limit to the amount of information that can be stored and manipulated on such a card. Chip cards, however, are able to store very large amounts of data in semiconductor memory, which is making possible another level of card security - photographic identification. Retail outlets, police and the Home Office all have an interest in the development of cards carrying a photographic image. The Trustee Savings Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland are carrying out limited trials with cards bearing their bearer's photograph. There are a range of technologies available for image capture and printing. DataCard Corporation, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of plastic transaction cards and related technology, making more than 500m cards a year, has developed a process which makes it possible to print a digitised colour image of the card holder on to the card in a single pass. The image and the information on the card is protected by a security overlay, which DataCard says is tamper-proof. The system produced high security cards, DataCard says, for situations 'in which a physical breach of security could be catastrophic'. A weakness, especially where the image is being used to protect a bank card, is that criminal rings may be able to find a member with a fair likeness. McCorquodale Smart Card Systems (MSCS), which claims to be the UK's only manufacturer of multiple-application smart cards, is working with a small computer company, CEM Systems of Belfast, to pioneer a new kind of visual smart card technology. Essentially, the image of the subject is captured from a colour photograph or video tape and stored in digital form in the card's memory. A clever data compression technique is used which squeezes the amount of information in the image into a thirtieth of the original space in two seconds. The image is regenerated using CEM's proprietary card reader which takes only seven seconds to reconstruct a recognisable image of the card holder. Mr Trevor Crotch-Harvey, managing director of MSCS, says that in volume the reader would cost only Pounds 500. One interesting advantage. People change in appearance with time. The MSCS system enables the image to be updated extending the life of the smart card and making the initial investment in the equipment a better proposition. For the foreseeable future, however, it seems likely that mag stripe cards will have the edge, in the UK, on smart cards. This is because of their familiarity, low cost and the investment in processing hardware and software. There are, for example, some 45m ATM (automated teller machines) cards circulating in the UK at present. The UK banks have more than 14,700 cash dispensers while building societies operate a further 3,200. Cash dispenser cards can be used overseas in 110,00 Visa and 76,000 Mastercard dispensers. These networks operate efficiently only because of the quality of the software underlying the system. Mr Steve Hilling, director of payment systems for Sema Group, the Anglo/French company which claims to handle 76 per cent of card management services for UK retail groups, argues that card technology has opened competition for the banks. 'To keep their competitive edge, banks will have to sharpen up on monitoring market trends and market positioning. This, together with the advantages of further centralisation of processing to trim overheads, will speed the integration of card management and electronic funds transfer at the point of sale (Eftpos) systems into mainstream banking'.</p>

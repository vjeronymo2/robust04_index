			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> VIOLINIST SHERYL STAPLES WITH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> With the seemingly endless proliferation of chamber orchestras, one needed a  good reason to attend a performance Sunday afternoon by our latest local  entrant, the Southern California Chamber Orchestra. But one wasn't provided by  founder Clyde Mitchell or his fledgling ensemble.  </P> <P> Fortunately, soloist Sheryl Staples turned what might have been a frustrating,  run-of-the-mill affair into a memorable experience.  </P> <P> Her performance of the Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor by Max Bruch gave every  indication that her enormous potential is nearing fulfillment. Except for  lacking the last measure of interpretive maturity in building the Adagio from  start to finish, one waited in vain for any sign that the young artist was not  taking the full measure of the work.  </P> <P> The incessant double stops of the outer movements never posed problems, and the  exceedingly rich, vibrant tone Staples produces perfectly matched the work's  lush phrases. Mitchell's accompaniment suited her impassioned approach without  any miscalculation of balances -- no small feat in the United University Church  at USC.  </P> <P> But the acoustical deficiencies thoroughly sabotaged the young ensemble in  their ensuing attempt at Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony. The cavernous hall made  the 42-member group seem twice as large with a resultant sound of half the  clarity one would hope for -- or else why perform this work with a reduced  size, modern instrument group at all?  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, neither Mitchell nor his orchestra (about half of whose  members are USC students) have garnered enough experience to provide any new  insights into this landmark work. They fared well though in an energetically  controlled Scherzo, and the last third of the Marcia Funebre gave ample  evidence that both orchestra and conductor may yet produce memorable  performances sans soloists.  </P> <P> The Overture to Mozart's "Don Giovanni" opened the concert, revealing that  Mitchell does possess a true gift for sustaining a legato line.

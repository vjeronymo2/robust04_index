			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Deutsche applies to be UK clearer DEUTSCHE BANK, the biggest bank in Germany, has applied to become a UK clearing bank. It wants to join Chaps, the electronic system for clearing and settling high-value bank payments. If Deutsche is successful - bankers said yesterday it was likely to be  - it would become the first continental bank to have a clearing account at the Bank of England. Banks' debts and credits to each other, resulting from Chaps transactions, are cleared at the end of each working day at the Bank. It also emerged yesterday that six other continental banks, including Credit Lyonnais, France's biggest bank, have made approaches to Chaps with a view to becoming clearers. A banker said two or three of these would probably become members. Foreign banks have traditionally done their sterling clearing by using UK banks as their agents. They have had the right to join Chaps for several years but until now only Citibank of the US has exercised the right. Deutsche's approval is likely in the next two months.</p>

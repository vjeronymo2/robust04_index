			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms sector weakens THE TWO companies representing the UK's telecoms duopoly, BT and Cable and Wireless, sharply underperformed the market. They suffered from increasing worries of competition in the UK and overseas from AT&amp;T, the biggest of the US telecoms groups. Earlier this month, AT&amp;T applied for a UK telecoms operator licence. BT was additionally weakened by news that Mr Barry Romeril, its highly regarded finance director, is leaving the company to join Xerox Corporation in the US so close to the sell-off of the government's remaining 21.8 per cent stake in BT. The share sale is expected in July. Telecoms analysts were largely unmoved by the AT&amp;T move. 'It is merely part of the ritual mud-slinging which should continue until AT&amp;T gets reciprocal access,' said an analyst, who nevertheless expressed surprise and disappointment at Mr Romeril's departure. 'He always had a high profile in the City and is seen as largely responsible for the cost-cutting that has transformed BT,' he added. BT shares dropped 9 1/2 , or 2.3 per cent, to 406 1/2 p on turnover of 15m, the highest for more than three months. Cable and Wireless, whose Mercury telecoms division is thought to be especially vulnerable to the threat of increased US competition, fell 18 to 684p.</p>

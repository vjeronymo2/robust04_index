			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz The decision by Daimler-Benz to seek a listing in New York implies a radical change in its attitude to investors. So it is natural for Deutsche Bank's 28 per cent stake in the company to come increasingly under the spotlight. There is a strong argument that such a blocking stake is incompatible with the more open approach implied by the New York move. But that does not mean that Deutsche Bank will rush to sell. However strong the forces of change, it cannot easily relinquish such an important symbol of its economic power. There are practical reasons, too, for waiting. Now is the bottom of the cycle. Deutsche might get a better price by holding on. That would also give it time to overcome the tax problems associated with divestiture. For its part Daimler has to cope with the uncertainty of the dissolution - in connection with its New York listing - of Mercedes Holding, which holds 25 per cent of its shares. The move could leave some Daimler stock overhanging the market. Yet these are only arguments for delay. At some stage the fundamental questions will have to be addressed. To German eyes Deutsche's alliance with Daimler brings long-term stability of management and purpose. Perhaps it also reinforces that sense of a corporation as having a broader social purpose - to benefit the community and its workers as well as just shareholders. But corporate Germany cannot cling to that and still solicit foreign equity. International investors want returns, not to subsidise someone else's social effort.</p>

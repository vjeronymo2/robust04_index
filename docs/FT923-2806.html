			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: The 'Other' Spoleto - Opera In the early 1950's, when Gian Carlo Menotti was seeking a home for his arts festival, he visited a number of small towns in Tuscany and Umbria: it had to be isolated, but within reasonable distance of Rome or Florence; it had to be beautiful, with an attractive theatre. He had almost settled on Todi, but then a friend took him to the historic, little-visited Umbrian city of Spoleto and Menotti's Festival of Two Worlds had a home. An important factor in his decision was the presence there of two working theatres: the charming Teatro Caio Melisso, and the larger, 19th century Teatro Nuovo, in perfect working order. Menotti soon learned that his would not be the only festival in the city; he had been preceded by the Teatro Lirico Sperimentale, an organisation created by an opera-loving Spoletino lawyer, Adriano Belli. It was largely through Belli's efforts that the Nuovo was in such good repair, and his Sperimentale had already attracted the attention of key professionals in the Italian operatic world. Founded to afford an opportunity for debutant artists to perform in a professional situation, the Sperimentale supported its youngsters with veteran conductors and producers from the Rome Opera, complemented by the Rome orchestra and chorus. Sets and costumes also came from the Rome house. In the cast of the inaugural performance of Don Pasquale were the tenor Cesare Valletti and the baritone Rolando Panerai, neither of whom had yet appeared on the operatic stage. The Sperimentale could hardly have had a happier launching. Chosen by a severe competition, Spoleto singers continued to maintain a surprisingly high level: in 1950 came Gian Giacomo Guelfi and Antonietta Stella. Then came the discoveries of Anna Moffo, Franco Corelli, Anita Cerquetti, Gabriella Tucci, Renato Bruson. But after several decades of glory, the Sperimentale fell on hard times. With the death of Belli, the direction faltered and the accord with the Rome Opera lapsed. In the past few years, under the artistic direction of the Roman critic Michelangelo Zurletti, the organisation has been assaying new directions, with mixed, but still encouraging results. Last year, an experimental Norma was unmitigated disaster, so this year's opening - Wiener Blut in Italian - hardly prompted an immediate trip to Spoleto. But then when the second offering, Un ballo is maschera, was announced, the idea of hearing a great opera with young artists made the journey seem worthwhile. And though the cast was extremely uneven, the performance was, on the whole, enjoyable; and there was the satisfaction of hearing three young voices - in the three female parts - of distinct promise. The casting also suggests the current state of Italy's vocal resources. Among the six winners of the 1992 competition there was no tenor. Even last year, when two tenors were selected, for the Pollione the organisation called on Mario Leonardi, a winner from a few years back. He returned this year as Riccardo, and has not improved. His performance seems to indicate that voice training in Italy is in big trouble. The natural instrument has volume and range, a clear ring, but Leonardi has little notion of expression, the sound is produced as if at random, pinched one moment, blaring the next. Yet, despite these glaring defects, since his first Spoleto appearance he has sung in a number of provincial houses, including the excellent Teatro Verdi in Trieste. The baritone, Demetrio Colaci (Renato) is also a winner from an earlier competition (in 1988) and has sung in Palermo's Teatro Massimo and in concert. Tall and imposing, he has a large and agreeable voice, but also lacks expression and has serious trouble with pitch. One is tempted to think also that the reason for the decline in quality among the Spoleto winners is that nowadays a truly gifted young male singer is not likely to encounter much difficulty in finding a theatre that will hasten to sign him up. Perhaps it is harder for sopranos and mezzos; certainly, the three debutantes in Spoleto made a much stronger case for themselves than the two males. The part of Ulrica does not give its interpreters much room. Daniela Ciliberti, young and handsome, made an immediate visual impression; nerves, however, diminished her vocal power at first. But soon she relaxed and revealed that, in addition to interpretative insight and musical taste, she possesses an instrument that, without being huge, carries well. The Amelia - Claudia Pallini - also began somewhat shyly, but by the end of her aria she too had gained confidence, and improved steading from then on. Next month she will be a finalist in the Pavarotti competition in Philadelphia. Lucia Scilipoti, though she looked the youngest member of the cast, made her professional debut in 1990 and has also participated in various contests with some success. She was a sweet, true Oscar, singing honestly and effectively. Borrowed from the Cagliari opera, the production was mostly acceptable, though there were some deleterious mimes here and there and some idiotic scenery. At the last minute the scheduled conductor was replaced by the chorus master Carlo Palleschi, who did an excellent job. Perhaps because of his presence the chorus - an Umbrian group called Umu-Sintesi - sang out splendidly. The Budapest Chamber Orchestra was better than serviceable. The Teatro Nuovo drew as big a crowd as any of Menotti's gala events does, and it was a good deal more attentive.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Setback, shaken and stirred: Experiences of recession have led to changes in corporate Germany's strategy Recession's fleeting but brutal invasion of west Germany swept away corporate profits and jobs on a dramatic scale. The engineering industry alone last year lost DM7bn (Pounds 2.8bn) - DM3,500 for every employee. More than a third of the 3m jobs created in the mid- to late-1980s have disappeared since the onset of the slump in the final quarter of 1992. Giants such as Daimler-Benz, the automotive and aerospace group, stumbled into their worst losses in postwar history. Dynastic family concerns such as the Kassbohrer group, which in exactly 100 years evolved from waggon-maker to bus-builder to break-up candidate, were dismembered. Towns such as Schweinfurt, home of the FAG Kugelfischer bearings group, tumbled from the peaks of prosperity to unemployment troughs as their mainstay industries crumpled. In the nation at large, recession severely dented popular confidence in the notion that 50 years of economic success and rising living standards automatically guaranteed more of the same. Yet, for all the corporate and personal distress, the outcome has not been entirely negative. Now recovery has taken hold it is clear that the shock of the precipitous crash from the 1991 peak of the post-unification spree has shaken industry and stirred it into action against underlying structural and competitive disadvantages. While recession created conditions which highlighted structural weaknesses, it also sparked a concurrent national debate which appears to have resulted in a broad consensus in favour of change. As Daimler chairman Mr Edzard Reuter admits, business found itself with an opportunity to take speedy, radical actions 'which would not have been possible in the past'. The most compelling evidence so far for the existence of a consensus for change has been the relatively friction-free acceptance of massive job cuts, reductions in real wages and the loss of traditional employee benefits and privileges. These trends have marked a frontal assault on the most obvious and most-discussed of Germany's competitive disadvantages: high labour costs. Employers and unions, starting in the chemicals industry, agreed new flexible work-time and pay structures which have started to improve unit labour costs and machinery running times. Although little post-recession data is yet ready, the scale of Germany's disadvantages compared with competitors can be judged by 1992 measures, which showed German factory plant was used for an average of 53 hours a week  -the lowest in the European Union. Unit labour costs in the automotive industry were about 40 per cent higher than those in France, Japan and the US. While a clear impression of the impact of last year's new labour agreements will not emerge until 1995, promising indications emerged at the weekend from the VCI chemicals industry association, which said average productivity in the sector had risen by almost 11 per cent in the first half of this year. Meanwhile, the job cuts are continuing, maintaining downward pressure on labour costs. Daimler, for example, said last week that a further 8,000 places are to go next year after 26,000 this year. Employers continue to lay a large proportion of the blame for lost competitiveness at the door of aggressive trade unions, but confessions of past 'mistakes' and 'arrogance' by senior managers such as Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank, reflect an unusual readiness within the establishment to acknowledge that management, financial institutions and politicians have made an even more telling contribution to Germany's international disadvantages. One such failing was the neglect of developing markets. Attempts are now under way to correct that fault, particularly in Asia, where potential demand for Germany's traditional industrial products is strongest. Against the global trend, industry has relied doggedly on exports out of its high-cost domestic factories, rather than establishing manufacturing bridgeheads abroad. At the same time, industry has focused most foreign investment and sales effort on virtually saturated markets in neighbouring European countries. The automotive industry, the country's leading foreign exchange earner, for example, relies heavily on the west European car market which is expected to expand only 1 or 2 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, Asia will generate 70 per cent of world market growth. Managers in broad sweeps of German industry who looked askance at Volkswagen's former chairman, Mr Carl Hahn, when he started investing in Chinese assembly plants in the mid-1980s, are now clamouring to follow as VW continues to build its market leadership in the People's Republic, with sales up 14 per cent in the first half of 1994. While it was not the only factor at work, the 1993 recession will also be remembered as the catalyst which prompted Mercedes-Benz and BMW to break with conservative tradition and set about building their first car manufacturing plants in the US. Reacting to global health reforms, the big three chemical groups, Bayer, BASF and Hoechst took up positions in the fiercely contested international market for cheaper out-of-patent generic drugs. Such relatively radical changes have helped dispel German industry's reputation for aversion to risk, complacency, tunnel vision and leaden-footedness. But these failings are not the sole preserve of management: they extend deep into the cultural and political structure. Over-regulation at federal, Land and local government level militates strongly against innovation. German planning procedures and system of approvals for new factories and products, particularly in new technologies, consume years of management time. According to Mr Utz-Hellmuth Felcht, research director at Hoechst, the catalogue of 2,000 laws and regulations governing the chemicals industry sprawls over 16,000 sheets of paper. Bureaucracy has meant his attempts to open a plant manufacturing genetically-engineered insulin near Frankfurt are only now approaching success - eight years after the project started. Raising public awareness of Germany's institutionalised bias against innovative industries will be a long haul. For now, restoring the health of the traditional industrial base remains in the forefront of management's concerns. In the past few months recession has turned to recovery, and the profits stream is flowing again. Last month the chemicals sector, traditionally the first into and the first out of slump, published a swathe of ebullient interim reports. BASF, for example, announced a 40 per cent earnings boost. But welcome as the recovery is, its effect on company earnings is less vigorous than some in corporate and political lifewould have the world believe. For example, BASF's earnings of DM680m on sales of DM22bn in the six months to the end of June pale beside profits of DM2.2bn on DM24bn turnover in the first half of 1989. Moreover, though companies are clearly coming round, the apparent scale and speed of the upswing is exaggerated by latest financial results which do not include the huge provisions set aside last time for redundancy payments and restructuring charges. Interim figures and accompanying statements from company chairmen also betray the effects of ferocious international price competition in export markets which have contributed most of the momentum to the recovery so far. There are no indications of any relaxation in competitive pressures, and although the most dramatic of industry's restructuring measures have been implemented or announced, the shake-out has some time to run before it can be considered complete. The short 1993 recession marked only the starting phase of repairs to structural flaws which took 50 years to develop.</p>

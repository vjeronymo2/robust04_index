			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVER STORY: THE FIRE BEHIND 'HEAT WAVE'  </P> <P> What was amazing to Michael Lazarou is that the Watts "insurrection" 25 years  ago didn't happen long before. He said the rage had long been in place.  </P> <P> Lazarou, the 29-year-old screenwriter of "Heat Wave," premiering Monday at 5  p.m. on TNT cable, has had a passionate amateur's fascination with history --  but especially the flaming anarchy that engulfed South-Central Los Angeles in  1965. He has been obsessed with it since he was 4 and living barely two miles  from the riots.  </P> <P> To research the movie, Lazarou talked with people who were in the riot areas --  rioters, bystanders, police officers, members of the National Guard. Lazarou  recalled an interview with an officer and a rioter "sitting side by side,  reminiscing on how it changed their lives."  </P> <P> He was driven to keep his script within the tightest confines of truth. His  interest in dramatizing the story was sparked when he learned about the  existence of the young classified ad messenger, Robert Richardson (played in  the movie by "L.A. Law's" Blair Underwood); it was through Richardson's  experience that the story of Watts could be constructed.  </P> <P> The story around Richardson was mostly invented -- although the characters and  their lives were based on real people, events and emotions (some names have  been changed because the people couldn't be located and clearance obtained).  But Lazarou said he was obliged to get a true reenactment of the riot itself.  </P> <P> He tried to put it into perspective:  </P> <P> "After World War II, L.A. was painted as the new paradise," Lazarou said. "It  was the boom town. Newspapers from here to Birmingham (Ala.) were filled with  (Los Angeles) job ads. This and the fact that L.A. was viewed as a color-blind  dream -- the most racially progressive city in America -- brought  African-Americans here by the hundreds of thousands."  </P> <P> But the promise was hollow.  </P> <P> Lazarou said what evolved was a prison without walls: Public buses didn't run  through Watts. There were few jobs available in the community and jobs outside  were hard to get to. People with skills who were eminently employable were  shunned from the work force, he said.  </P> <P> One scene in the script suggests the dreadful isolation: Richardson and his  friend happen across Alameda Street into Lynwood, acclaimed as an All-American  city in 1961, and they're chased by white toughs called the Spook Hunters,  which was a real gang.  </P> <P> "If you crossed Alameda, if you were caught in Lynwood and were black, you  literally took your life in your hands," Lazarou said. "We're talking about de  facto segregation -- even more cruel than that they left behind."  </P> <P> Lynwood -- then referred to as "Lily White Lynwood" -- was nearly all-white and  proclaimed by the Chamber of Commerce as "The Best Place to Live Best." Today  it's about 20% white.  </P> <P> To Lazarou, these root-cause realities help explain the ferocity of the mobs  when they finally unloaded.  </P> <P> "Finally, on the night of Aug. 11, whatever patience there was left, ran out,"  Lazarou said.  </P> <P> "There were a number of circumstances at play that led to so many people being  at Avalon and 116th Street. It was uncharacteristically muggy and hot.  Everybody was outside on their stoops."  </P> <P> The rioting itself seems to be meticulously re-created in the script,  especially the confrontation at that intersection between a young black driver  and a Highway Patrol motorcycle officer who stopped him for a sobriety test.  Lazarou recounted it, based on his interviews:  </P> <P> "Marquette Frye was with his stepbrother Ronald and was pulled over. He was on  parole and riding a lucky streak. Things were going well; his life was turning  around.  </P> <P> "He was bound and determined to talk his way out of this jam and he was  downright ebullient, friendly, cooperative. The patrolman responded in kind. He  was very, very, very cooperative. The rapport couldn't have been better. Frye,  a little bit drunk, was putting on a show and the crowd, continuing to grow,  was eating it up.  </P> <P> "Even Officer (Lee) Minikis commented to him, 'You're quite a comedian.'  </P> <P> "They were hitting it off. Of course, the Highway Patrol in those days didn't  have the rep for brutality that the LAPD and the county sheriffs had.  </P> <P> "Then Frye's mother showed up and was absolutely furious at her son for driving  while drinking and proceeded to yell at him. The crowd by this time had grown  to several hundred and Frye started to get upset, realizing that he might be  going to jail. He was fighting back tears, then lost his temper and pushed his  mother out of the way, pointed to the officer and said, 'I'm not going anywhere  with that white -- -- -- -- -- -- -- !'  </P> <P> "And just like that, the mood of this crowd went from jovial to very tense and  very chaotic. He was subdued by force and his mother and stepbrother came to  his aid -- and they too were arrested.  </P> <P> "The crowd started getting nasty and the partner of the officer called an 1199,  which is CHP car code for 'officer needs help!' Then came Code 3, the sirens.  </P> <P> "They were soon joined by LAPD -- a convoy practically -- all coming from the  north while CHP and sheriffs were coming from the south, while the sirens in  turn were attracting more people like a magnet. The more police, the more  hostile the crowd.  </P> <P> "A young lady barber, Joyce Ann Gaines, was pulled from the crowd and arrested.  Her smock gave her the appearance of being pregnant -- which she wasn't.  Someone screamed, 'Those whitey cops are beating on a pregnant woman!'  </P> <P> "That's what really sent the crowd ultimately into abject rage.  </P> <P> "That was the spark. Within 36 hours the riots encompassed 54 square miles of  L.A."  </P> <P> The official toll was 35 killed, with 1,200 reported injuries and 4,000 people  arrested and 600 buildings burned and looted in six days of rioting.  </P> <P> Said Lazarou, "It's so important that the viewer understands the context,  understands why it happened.  </P> <P> "It's important to point out that this (the Frye-Gaines arrest) was just the  spark, nothing more. I mean it could have been anything. What was amazing is  that it happened then and not much earlier."  </P> <P> It was not a happy story then, and Lazarou said that it's not a happy story in  South-Central Los Angeles now: "There, when the smoke cleared, little was ever  done to improve the situation. Recommendations for improved education, housing,  jobs, fell by the wayside. Let's face it, you can't look at what's going on  down there and put a happy face on it."  </P></p>

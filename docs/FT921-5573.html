			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Director quits top post at Ashley Group SHARES IN Ashley Group, the window blind distributor and food retailer in Spain, jumped 8p to 50p yesterday following the resignation of Mr Anthony Butler, the chief executive. Mr Butler resigned following disagreements over group strategy. Ashley has been under pressure from some institutional shareholders to make changes since it released a profits warning in October, leading to a fall in the share price from about 100p to 32p last month. Yesterday's steep rise was also due to bid speculation concerning Ashley's break-up value. But Mr Chris Tipper, finance director, said: 'We've had no form of notification of any stake building in the company and we have not seen any evidence.' Mr Butler's successor has not been named and Mr James White, chairman, said the senior management structure of the group was now under review. The company is also concentrating on trying to improve its supermarkets business in Spain, Mr White said. Mr Butler built up Ashley through acquisition after joining in 1988 from Dee Corporation, which later changed its name to Gateway. Ashley moved into food retailing in Spain with the acquisitions of Digsa in 1988 and Dismo in 1990. Ashley also built up its window blind network with acquisitions in the UK, Germany, France and the Netherlands. But after rapid growth in the late 1980s, Ashley's pre-tax profits for the year to end-August were flat at Pounds 13.7m.</p>

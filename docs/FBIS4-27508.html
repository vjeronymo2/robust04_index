			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- An estimated 15,000  teachers affiliated with the National Teachers' Union  (Chongyojo) held a national teachers' rally for educational  reform on the plaza of Tongguk University in Seoul on May 29, a  Seoul- based radio reported.    Chairwoman of Chongyojo Chong Hae-sok in her opening address  said "the educational sector has gone backward as the present  'regime' that had advocated an 'educational reform' when coming  to power, has not worked up details for reform."    She criticized the "government" for trying to disorganize  Chongyojo, not recognizing it, and repeatedly urged the  authorities to legalize Chongyojo.</p>

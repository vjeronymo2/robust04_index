			<p>BFN     [Text] During 1992 Russia received 10.5 billion dollars in  the form of foreign credits allotted by different countries,  banks and companies. Among Russia's biggest creditors are  Germany (4.5 billion dollars), the US (1.8 billion dollars),  Italy (1.05 billion dollars) and France (554 million dollars).    This information was given in a paper circulated among the  State Duma deputies on Wednesday. Today the State Duma will  consider the draft law on state foreign borrowings on the part  of Russia and on state credits given to Russia by foreign  countries and on the upper limit of foreign borrowings and  credits which may be granted to Russia by a foreign country in  1994.    The paper underlined that the total sum of the received  credits had been reduced to 4.46 billion dollars during 1993.  Germany remained the biggest creditor (2.4 billion dollars).  France had second place with 680 million dollars. The US was  the third biggest creditor - 671 million dollars. Italy was the  fourth - with 228 million dollars.    During this year Russia expects to receive 2.8 billion in  foreign credits, including 850 million dollars from Germany, 525  million dollars from Italy, 485 million dollars from the US, 350  million dollars from Japan. Great Britain will allot 190  million dollars, the EEC 150 million dollars and France 85  million dollars.    In 1993 the foreign credits were distributed among different  sectors of the Russian economy as follows: the agriculture and  the food industry received 2.02 billion dollars; industry - 817  million dollars; the transport and communications 724 million  dollars; the municipal economy and environment 482 million  dollars and the medical industry 295 million dollars. A total  of 120 million dollars were spent on purchasing medicine.    In 1994 the foreign credits are expected to be distributed  as  following: the agriculture and the food industry will receive  490 million dollars; industry - 1.97 billion dollars; the  transport and communications - 450 million dollars; the  municipal economy and environment - 140 million dollars and the  medical industry - 280 million dollars. A total of 370 million  dollars will be spent on purchasing medicine.    Another paper cited the terms of credits allotted by the  former USSR and Russia to India, Cuba, Algeria and Pakistan.  For instance, India was allotted 830 million dollars in 1992  for the delivery of Russian "special property" and services.  The term of the credit in 1994-1995 proceeds from a 5  pct-annual rate. Repayment of the credit by India provides for  a ten pct-advanced payment. A total of 90 pct of the sum will  be repaid over seven years through the delivery of goods from  India.    In accordance with the agreement on economic and technical  cooperation between Russia and Cuba signed in July 1993, Cuba  received 350 million dollars under a 4 pct-annual rate. The  credit is to be paid in 1993-1995. Cuba must pay the credit  through goods deliveries over 10 years.</p>

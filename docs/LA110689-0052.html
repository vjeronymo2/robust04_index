			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAO URGES CLOSING COSTLY LOOPHOLE IN U.S. WATER LAW  </P> <P> Congress should close a loophole in the law that regulates use of federally  subsidized water supplies, the General Accounting Office said in a report  released Sunday. The congressional watchdog agency said that the government is  losing millions of dollars in revenue because some farmers are taking advantage  of the law to qualify for cheap irrigation rates.  </P> <P> The 1982 Reclamation Reform Act, designed to help states where water is scarce,  primarily in the West, allows farms of 960 acres or less to receive water at  low, subsidized rates. Some owners of large farms, particularly in California,  have circumvented the size limit by reorganizing their holdings into smaller  parcels so that they qualify for the cheap water.  </P> <P> "Congressional expectations have not been met," the report said in recommending  that the loophole be closed.  </P> <P> In one case study cited in the report, Alpha Farms, one of California's leading  cotton producers, reorganized its 12,345 acres into separate landholdings  through 18 partnerships, 24 corporations and 11 trusts. The GAO said there were  indications that the smaller holdings, all in the Central Valley, continued to  be operated as one large farm.  </P> <P> In another case, the GAO said, a father, son, daughter and her husband each  owned parts of a 4,638-acre farm and applied for the subsidized water as four  landholdings of less than 960 acres each.  </P> <P> "However, the family continued to operate the four landholdings as one farm,"  the GAO said.  </P> <P> In the sample cases it reviewed, the GAO found that owners or lessees in 1987  paid about $1.3 million less for federal water than they would have paid if  their respective multiple landholdings had been considered collectively as  large farms subject to the legal size limit.  </P> <P> "Reduced revenues likely will continue to occur annually unless the act is  amended," the GAO said.  </P> <P> Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Interior and Insular  Affairs subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, blamed the  Interior Department for allowing farmers to get around the law.  </P> <P> "Wealthy farmers in California's Central Valley have subverted the intent of  federal water laws and top Interior Department officials, aware of the abuse,  declined to take corrective action," he told the Associated Press.  </P> <P> Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Interior Department, said Sunday that  Interior officials had not yet seen the report. "However, if Rep. Miller  believes the law should be changed, that is certainly within his purview as a  member of Congress," he said. "The secretary has a responsibility to carry out  the law as it is written."  </P> <P> The law does not "preclude multiple landholdings, each of which is within the  act's 960-acre limit, to continue to be operated collectively as one large farm  while individually qualifying for federally subsidized water," the GAO said.  </P> <P> "Some farmers have taken advantage of this loophole by reorganizing their farms  into multiple, smaller landholdings to be eligible to receive additional  federally subsidized water . . . using various partnerships, corporations,  and/or trust arrangements," the report continued. "For all practical purposes,  these smaller landholdings continue to be operated collectively as single large  farms, much as they were before being reorganized."  </P> <P> The GAO emphasized, however, that "these reorganized farms do not violate the  act's language" and that audits "have found and will likely continue to find  them to be in compliance with the act's 960-acre limit."  </P> <P> The GAO said in its report that the Interior Department "agreed that some  farmers have reorganized their farms into smaller holdings to maintain large  farming operations while complying with the act's acreage limit . . . .  However, Interior cautioned that it is not convinced that the Congress expected  to apply the 960-acre limit to land being operated as one unit."  </P></p>

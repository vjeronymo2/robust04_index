			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Withdrawal losses leave Whitecroft Pounds 42m in red WHITECROFT, the Cheshire-based mini-conglomerate, reported deepening losses of Pounds 41.8m pre-tax for the year ended March 31, against a previous Pounds 3.65m, restated in accordance with FRS 3. Turnover was Pounds 125m (Pounds 149m), a drop of 16 per cent. However, there was a trading profit of Pounds 2.64m on sales of Pounds 108m in the group's four remaining core activities. Losses were from property and the discontinued home improvements operations. Losses per share increased to 94.5p (9.6p). The new chairman, chief executive and finance director - all of whom have taken office since the departure of Mr Peter Goold as chairman in March - are not recommending a dividend. Whitecroft, which expanded quickly in the latter half of the 1980s on the back of the property boom, has been restructuring and struggling to get out of the sector since the recession began. The bulk of losses follow the hiring of Hillier Parker as property consultants and a consequent savage additional write-down of values. The results show a Pounds 29.3m loss on disposal of the home improvement businesses and a net Pounds 11.4m of property write-downs. These total more than the Pounds 38.1m of losses before interest payments, supporting the claim yesterday of Mr Mike Derbyshire, the new chief executive, that Whitecroft's four core businesses were now profitable and should see it back to health. The four core businesses are now industrial, commercial and street lighting; building products, mainly high-specification fire doors; medical cotton fibre, where Edward Hall, a subsidiary is European market leader; and textiles, where the group specialises in bleaching, dyeing and coatings. Mr Derbyshire said a string of small to medium-sized office developments, were now realistically priced in the books at Pounds 14.4m, compared with Pounds 25m last year. Sales brought in Pounds 3.7m during the year. He said future sales would represent a financial gain to the group and one was nearing completion. The group, now down to 18 operating centres against 30 last year, has put its Wilmslow headquarters up for letting and will relocate to more modest offices. During the year the group shed another 10 per cent of jobs and now employs 1,860 people. Gearing is 150 per cent, with borrowings of Pounds 35m (Pounds 36.4m). Mr Derbyshire said borrowings were falling with property sales and had peaked at Pounds 43m at Christmas.</p>

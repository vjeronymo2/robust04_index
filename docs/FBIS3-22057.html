In the  coca producing zones in Peru, the number of consumers is  gradually increasing. Thus, the myth has ended.    An epidemiology poll on drug consumption conducted by the  Cedro [Information and Education Center to Prevent Drug Abuse]  in Iquitos, Tarapoto, and Tingo Maria, has found that 8 percent  of those polled said they had tried marijuana sometime in their  lives, while 25.1 percent said they knew of the substance. At  the national level, marijuana consumption is estimated at 7.8  percent and those who know about it at 24.7 percent.    Regarding cocaine base, 14.7 percent of city dwellers in the  jungle regions said they use it. This is way over the 5.6  percent registered at the national level.    The same trend was found when people were asked if they knew  the substance: 37.3 percent of those polled in those cities said  yes while at the national level showed 19.5 percent.    On the other hand, 1.7 percent of those asked said they had  tried cocaine at least once, which is under the 2 percent at the  national level.    Also 7.8 percent of those living in the jungle regions said  they knew about cocaine. This is below the average at the  national level (8.2 percent).    The poll showed that 26.9 percent said getting marijuana was  easy while 57.7 percent said it was difficult.    Regarding cocaine base, 30.8 percent said it was easy to get  while 53 percent said it was difficult. Regarding cocaine, 26.4  percent said it was easy to get and 53.6 percent said it was  difficult.    More than one fourth of the people living in the jungle  regions have more or less free access to illegal substances.  This does not mean they use it, but it shows in one way or  another they know about the links between the community and drug  trafficking.    The Cedro poll is interesting because it shows that 51.3  percent of the people in that region said that consumption was  caused by factors related to individual drug users (personality,  emotional problems, inability to face daily problems, lack of  family communication, etc.).    A worrisome 34.2 percent said consumption was prompted by  factors related to pleasure and being lured into addiction.  They thus considered that consumers were not directly  responsible.    In conclusion, 4.6 percent of the Peruvian Amazon region  inhabitants understand that consumption is caused by factors  unrelated to individuals--like fashion, curiosity, poor choice  of friends, and so on.    There are reasons for an increase in consumption, but the  problem lies in determining which of these reasons is the most  significant. Many minors are handling large amounts of money,  given to them by their parents: So they may squander it on drugs.    The experts say another reason paradoxically involves the  gradual withdrawal of traffickers, seeking new centers of coca  production.    Cities like Tocache, Uchiza, and Juanjui--which used to be  trading and operation centers for drug money--have become ghost  towns where the inhabitants ``drown'' their sorrows in drugs.</p>

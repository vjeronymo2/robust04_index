			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Eight Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon bomb attacks PRO-IRANIAN guerrillas inflicted the worst casualties in five years on Israeli troops in southern Lebanon yesterday, prompting retaliation and plunging the Middle East into violence for the second time in a month. At least eight Israeli soldiers were killed and four wounded in two separate attacks by the Islamic fundamentalist Hizbollah (Party of God) militia. In response to the first attack, eight Israeli warplanes bombed guerrilla positions in Lebanon's Bekaa valley, killing two Hizbollah fighters. The US said it deplored the attack on the Israelis and described it as a 'calculated attempt by extremists to derail the Arab-Israeli peace process'. Hundreds of Lebanese civilians, fearing another Israeli offensive, fled their homes in the south, and the Lebanese army was placed on maximum alert. Observers in Jerusalem said the Israeli air strike on targets 3km west of the Syrian border was also meant as a warning to Damascus, which has thousands of troops in the Bekaa valley, and which Israel blames for allowing the Hizbollah attack. Gen Ehud Barak, chief of staff, said last night that Israel retained its right to retaliate further. In the first Hizbollah attack, Israel said seven soldiers from the Golani infantry brigade had been killed and two wounded in a dawn roadside bombing in the western sector of Israel's self-declared 'security zone'. The second incident, which left one soldier dead and two wounded, occurred when an Israeli patrol returned to the same area in the evening after the Israeli air raid. The Hizbollah raid was the deadliest since a suicide car bomb attack killed eight people and wounded seven in October 1988. The attacks brought Israeli casualties in the zone this year to 17 dead and 31 wounded. It came less than three weeks after a US-brokered ceasefire ended a seven-day Israeli air and artillery bombardment of villages in southern Lebanon. The Israeli offensive, aimed at curbing Hizbollah rocket attacks against northern Israeli towns, left 130 dead, more than 600 wounded and 1,500 homes destroyed. The informal ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria, which acts as a conduit for Iranian-supplied weapons to Hizbollah, did not cover attacks against the so-called security zone. Sheikh Naim Qassem, deputy general secretary of Hizbollah, said yesterday's operation was 'a new lesson for Israel'. Israel's persistent enemy, Page 3</p>

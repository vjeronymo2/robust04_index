			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / German inflation to drop markedly, says Bundesbank INFLATION in Germany is set to fall 'markedly', the Bundesbank's chief economist said yesterday, in a surprisingly upbeat assessment of the outlook for German prices. However, he dismissed arguments for an early cut in interest rates. At the same time Mr Otmar Issing, member of the policymaking directorate at the German central bank, cautioned that inflation would fall slowly and be influenced by factors beyond the Bundesbank's control, such as tax increases. Mr Issing also argued for maintaining the wider fluctuation bands of the European exchange rate mechanism, noting that although currencies were stable at present scope for change may be needed in future. He said on German television prices were moving in the 'right direction', adding that the fall in the annual inflation rate from 4.3 per cent in July to 4.2 per cent in August concealed a much sharper month-on-month decline in the rate of price increases. Mr Issing also said monetary policy was taking its cue from the German recession - a comment in sharp contrast to the Bundesbank's usual insistence that combating inflation has to take priority over 'counter-cyclical' attempts to stimulate the ailing economy via cuts in the cost of money. His remarks came the day after the Bundesbank council decided - contrary to market expectations - to leave interest rates unchanged. Mr Issing said the question remained open as to when the central bank could cut rates further. On the markets, however, the effects of the tight monetary policy were felt by most European currencies yesterday as they drifted down against the D-Mark. The French franc fell below the FFr3.51 level against the D-Mark, but later strengthened to close at FFr3.499. The Danish krone and Belgian franc came under pressure and ended at their lowest for the day. Mr Issing sought yesterday to play down the importance of growth in money supply in July. M3 grew at annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 7.5 per cent, the third month in a row in which the 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range was missed. The main cause was growth in bank lending which he dismissed as an 'inexplicable spike'. In a separate interview with the AP Dow Jones news agency, Mr Issing said the increase in money supply had made it impossible to cut rates on Thursday, leaving the discount and Lombard rates at 6.75 and 7.75 per cent respectively.

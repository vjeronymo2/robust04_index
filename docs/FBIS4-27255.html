			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cambodia's elder statesman has emphasised that  he opposes a proposal for military assistance to the Cambodian  army.    "Samdech Son Sann does not support military assistance to  the  Cambodian Army as he has always believed that it serves only to  prolong the war," his assistant, Son Chhai, said in a statement.    The statement came after Son Sann was reported to have  expressed support for Thailand's position on Cambodia including  the matter of military aid.    Thailand has repeatedly made clear that it is against  military help for the Cambodian army. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Revival of investor interest in Latin America AN APPETITE for extra yield, at a time when low interest rates are squeezing returns, has encouraged investors to return to the market for Latin American bonds. Although the market is noted for its volatility, the relatively strong economic performance of the region in the last few years has ensured a steady tightening of yield spreads relative to the US Treasury market. The market suffered a setback at the end of last year, when oversupply caused yield margins to widen substantially. However, those wider margins, reviewed at the start of the year, started to attract investors back to the market. The range of investors has already broadened considerably. Initially dominated by flight capital - funds invested by Colombian nationals - the market has been taken up by a growing number of specialist funds. Institutions are starting to dip their toes in the water, buying Latin American securities as a small part of large and diversified portfolios. In the meantime, the number of sovereign borrowers able to tap the market continues to grow, as the re-entry of Latin American countries to the international capital markets progresses, in the wake of the debt crisis of the early 1980s. Uruguay, which completed its first Eurobond last year, is about to return to the market with a five-year deal, arranged by Chase Investment Bank, which is expected to yield about 295 basis points over the five-year US Treasury. Colombia will make its debut in early April, with a Dollars 100m issue of five or seven-year Eurobonds, via Bankers Trust. The deal for Colombia, which never rescheduled its debt, has already attracted strong investor interest, bankers said. Some bankers believe that Peru - or a government-owned company - may also tap the market this year, after having implemented a number of economic reforms last year. Ecuador is also cited as a potential new borrower. However, bankers have become increasingly frustrated in their efforts to bring Chilean borrowers to the market. The government has clamped down on foreign borrowing, barring banks from tapping the market and restricting all but a few companies. 'Every time you get a mandate, the Chilean authorities change the rules, effectively blocking the market,' complained one banker. Chile has an active domestic market, where funding of up to 20 years is available, but the amounts are small. In addition, banks are keen to raise dollars in the international market to on-lend to companies for their export business. However, CTC, the Chilean telecommunications company, is said to be preparing a convertible bond issue via Goldman Sachs. Borrowers are also beginning to tap markets other than the dollar market. Venezuela is said to be planning a DM350m-DM400m issue of five-year bonds via Commerzbank (having just issued three-year dollar bonds in the domestic Colombian market). Apasco, a foreign-owned Mexican cement company, is also planning to tap the D-Mark sector, via Dresdner, according to bankers. A number of deals are also in the pipeline in the dollar market, including issues for Argentine and Brazilian banks. There is still some bad news about, however. Sentiment on Brazil is increasingly negative, although last week's change of finance minister did not worry the market. Bankers are concerned about the financial position of the country and some companies, and fear the signing of the Brady plan on debt restructuring may still be some way off. In addition, although spreads can tighten dramatically in this market, when they become too narrow the incentive to buy riskier paper disappears. In recent weeks, corporate paper, which had been trading at rather wide spreads, has prompted most interest. For example, seven-year Cemex paper tightened from 450 basis points to 380, because it was perceived to offer a high yield. The market's volatility still scares off some investors. Part of the problem, according to some specialists, is that relatively few banks are active in this area, and they may not allocate substantial capital to dealing in Latin American bonds. However, there are signs that more banks are deciding that Latin American business is worth getting. For example, Deutsche Bank, which has not been an active arranger of Latin American bonds, recently managed a D-Mark issue for Mexico.</p>

The commentary applies and interprets the requirements of Part 707 and is a substitute for individual staff interpretations. The proposed commentary incorporates much of the guidance provided when the regulation was adopted, and addresses additional questions that have been raised about the application of its requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be postmarked or posted on the NCUA electronic bulletin board by September 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments to Becky Baker, Secretary of the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314&hyph;3428. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Martin S.

TISA requires credit unions to disclose fees, the dividend or interest rate, the annual percentage yield, and other account terms whenever a member requests the information and before an account is opened. Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement the credit union sends to the member. Rules are set forth for share and deposit account advertisements and advance notices to account holders of adverse changes in terms. TISA restricts how credit unions must determine the account balance on which dividends or interest are calculated. TISA is implemented by part 707 of the NCUA's Rules and Regulations (``part 707'') (12 CFR part 707), which becomes effective on January 1, 1995, for most credit unions. TISA authorizes the issuance of official staff interpretations of the regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board is publishing a proposed commentary to Part 707. The proposal is designed to provide guidance to credit unions in applying the regulation to specific transactions and is a substitute for, and a supplement to, individual staff interpretations. The Board contemplates updating the commentary periodically to address significant questions that arise. It is expected that this commentary will be adopted in final form in the fall of 1994, with an effective date of the compliance date of Part 707. Due to the special needs of small, nonautomated credit unions, and for the reasons explained by the Board in the Final Rule adopted at the July Board meeting, the Board has decided to extend the compliance date of part 707 until January 1, 1996 for credit unions that are not automated and are under $2 million in assets as of December 31, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> (2) Proposed Commentary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notices containing the regulation that implemented TISA and notices for subsequent amendments set forth a large amount of supplementary material interpreting the new regulation. (See final rule published on September 27, 1993 (58 FR 50394), and final rule, corrections and correcting amendments, published on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13435).) In large measure, the proposed commentary incorporates the supplementary material from those rulemakings, and reflects the views expressed therein without substantive change. A number of issues that have arisen since the publication of the regulation have also been addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 6, 1993, the Federal Reserve Board (``FRB'') published a proposal to amend the regulation's rules for calculating the annual percentage yield for accounts that pay dividends or interest prior to maturity (58 FR 64190). (See also the notice extending the comment period published on January 13, 1994, 59 FR 1921.) This FRB proposed rule was withdrawn on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24376). In its place, a new FRB proposed rule was published on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24378), as amended on July 11, 1994 (59 FR 35271). The FRB amendments focus on two issues: a desire for the annual percentage yield to reflect the time value of money, and the concern of compliance costs and the impact on depository institutions if the proposed rules is adopted. The comment period on the May 11 and July 11 FRB proposed rules has been extended until September 6, 1994. Credit unions are encouraged to sent comments to the FRB. For further information on the FRB proposed amendments credit unions may contact Jane Ahrens, Senior Attorney, Kyung Cho or Kurt Schumacher, Staff Attorneys, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at (202) 452&hyph;3667 or 452&hyph;2412. The NCUA Board is delaying action regarding any adoption of similar amendments to part 707 until the completion of the FRB's rulemakings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

One of them is in critical  condition and the other two in moderate condition. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports that as a Subaru passed the  three men's car at the entrance to Halhul from the direction of  Hebron, some 20 bullets were fired from it. A leaflet signed by  the 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam squad was found on the site. The  Subaru was later found abandoned in Hebron. The security forces  have imposed a curfew on the area.

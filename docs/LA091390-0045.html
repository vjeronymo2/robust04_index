			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O'MALLEY: WILL TRY TO HELP RAIDERS, TROJANS  </P> <P> Although football has never been staged at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers would  consider the Raiders and USC as short-term tenants under certain conditions,  team President Peter O'Malley said Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "If the Coliseum is being remodeled and the two teams that play there need a  place to go, we'd consider it if it didn't disrupt the baseball season,"  O'Malley said from Pittsburgh, where he is attending the baseball owners'  meetings. "Scheduling would be the key to this."  </P> <P> O'Malley delivered a statement Wednesday, saying if Mayor Bradley asks the  Dodgers to accommodate either football team, the Dodgers would try to help.  That could come in the fall of 1992, depending on the reconstruction of the  Coliseum.  </P> <P> Sources said the Dodgers' assurance was given before Tuesday's announcement the  Raiders would stay in Los Angeles, provided the Coliseum undergoes substantial  renovation and the stadium's private managers live up to the terms of an  undisclosed agreement.  </P> <P> O'Malley, a member of the board of directors of the L.A.-based Amateur Athletic  Foundation, has been a long-standing supporter of the Southland athletic  community. He has close associations with those involved in the agreement that  will keep the Raiders here.  </P> <P> The Raiders and USC welcomed O'Malley's statement but said it is premature to  discuss where they might play in 1992. Also being considered are the Rose Bowl  and Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> O'Malley said neither the Raiders nor USC has contacted the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Mike McGee, USC athletic director, said the school wants to investigate all  situations before discussing any proposals.  </P> <P> "Peter has always been a community-minded person," said Al LaCosale, the  Raiders' administrative executive. "I think everyone appreciates the statement  he made. But where we might play in 1992 is something for down the road."  </P> <P> Although football has never been held in Dodger Stadium, Bob Smith, director of  stadium operations, said the facility could accommodate the game.  </P> <P> In the 1960s Dodger officials laid out a football field, "just to see if it  would fit," Smith said.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't be easy, but it could be done," he said. "It would probably entail  moving the outfield fences back." The football field would stretch from home  plate to straightaway center field. "I think it would look good for the  viewer," Smith said. "The left and right sidelines would be good seats."  </P> <P> He said the football stadium would hold about 50,000, which could present a  problem for USC. The Trojans will play Notre Dame at home in 1992. That game  has drawn more than 90,000 at the Coliseum in past seasons.  </P></p>

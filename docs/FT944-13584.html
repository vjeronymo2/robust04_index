			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Nissan Motor loses court appeal Nissan Motor, the Japanese car manufacturer, yesterday lost its appeal against a High Court ruling that it should pay Pounds 6m to Nissan UK, its former importers and distributors. The Court of Appeal upheld a ruling of March last year that Nissan Motor had entered into an agreement with Nissan UK to pay the Pounds 6m as an incentive for taking 12,700 Bluebird cars shortly before they went out of production in 1990. Nissan Motor had denied that such an agreement had been negotiated with Mr Octav Botnar, Nissan UK chairman.</p>

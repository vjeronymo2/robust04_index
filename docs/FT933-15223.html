			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Novell plans multimedia for PC networks NOVELL, the software developer, is to add full-motion video capabilities to its widely-used Netware network operating system, which manages and controls networks of personal computers. Novell aims to make multi-media capabilities, currently limited to stand-alone desktop computers, available on PC networks. Applications may include video conferencing and 'live' broadcast of, for example, business presentations and training or education sessions. Networked multimedia would also provide real-time updates of stored video files, overcoming the limitations of desktop CD-Rom systems that can only be updated with new CDs. Novell will make network services for multimedia available in phases beginning in 1994. The company also announced it had bought Fluent, a small software developer specialising in multimedia, for Dollars 17.5m. Novell will integrate Fluent's applications into Netware. It said the purchase would probably result in a one-time write-off of assets of up to Dollars 15m during Novell's third quarter.</p>

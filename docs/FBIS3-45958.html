Wang Maolin, provincial party committee secretary and  provincial military district party committee first secretary,  delivered a speech at the meeting in which he emphatically  stated that the principle of the party running the Armed Forces  is essential and fundamental to consolidating and developing the  People's Armed Forces. Therefore, we should make redoubled  efforts to strengthen rather than weaken the party leadership  over the Armed Forces under the new situation of reform and  opening up.    Comrade Wang Maolin said: Since the party should run the  Armed Forces, we should make every possible endeavor to  successfully manage the Armed Forces, this being at once a  traditional CPC system and an important duty of local leaders.  To this end, it is imperative to enhance a sense of the  people's militia. I hope that party committees and governments  at all levels in Hunan will strive to successfully manage the  Armed Forces and contribute more to province-wide reform,  opening up, economic construction, and national defense reserve  forces building.    Chen Bangzhu, provincial governor and chairman of the  provincial armed forces work committee, also delivered a speech  at the meeting in which he called on party committees and  governments at all levels in Hunan to fully understand the  importance of stepping up people's militia and reserve forces  building under the new situation of building a socialist market  economic structure; attach great importance to and tackle  practical problems hindering people's militia and reserve forces  building; strengthen unity between the Armed Forces and the  people, between the police forces and the people, as well as  between the Armed Forces and the police forces; and carry out  Armed Forces work under CPC leadership in a responsible manner.    Major General Pang Weiqiang, provincial party committee  standing committee member and provincial military district  commander, delivered a work report at the meeting presided over  by Major General Deng Hanmin, provincial military district  political commissar.    The meeting was attended by a number of provincial party,  government and military leaders, including Yang Zhengwu; Liu  Fusheng [provincial people's congress standing committee  chairman]; Chu Bo; Hu Biao; Wang Keying; Zhu Miaoquan; Xiao  Qiuru; He Yaodong; Wang Zhushi; Liu Shiying; and Ma Chongbiao;  all prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party  committee secretaries; all military subarea party committee  first secretaries, and all city mayors, autonomous prefectural  administrators, and prefectural commissioners who are  concurrently city, autonomous prefectural, and prefectural Armed  Forces work committees chairmen.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: VIDEO REVOLUTION HAS CREATED A MONSTER  </P> <P> If Mary Shelley had been brainstorming in the summer of 1990 instead of the  summer of 1816, I'll bet she wouldn't have made poor Victor Frankenstein go  through all that mess of animating a corpse composed of various purloined body  parts.  </P> <P> To drive home her point about the unthinkable horrors that can grow out of  technological progress, even when administered with the best of intentions, she  simply could have sent the good doctor to an electronics-parts junk yard to  concoct an even more frightening and all-invasive creature: the portable video  camera.  </P> <P> Allow me to explain.  </P> <P> The video explosion indeed has revolutionized our already mind-boggling  Information Age. In less time than it took for the telegraph to give way to the  telephone, the newsreel of old, with its musty pictures from the battlefield  arriving days or weeks later for audiences to ponder, has been supplanted by  live mini-cams descending on the scene of any news event within hours,  sometimes minutes.  </P> <P> If this has been a boon in allowing us to immediately connect and empathize  with victims of a natural disaster halfway around the world, or to witness  momentous historical events literally as they happen, it also has become the  bane of anyone who wishes to conduct his or her affairs out of the public  arena.  </P> <P> Excepting certain people like Richard Nixon and Ollie North who have, by their  violation of public trust, given up any right to conduct affairs out of the  public arena, the rest of us might reasonably expect to enjoy events without  being subjected to prying electronic eyes.  </P> <P> But the video revolution, which egalitarian minds had hoped would lead to an  informed, enlightened and concerned citizenry, has degenerated into an arena of  bread and circuses. To wit: When the porta-camera gave us a chance to witness  firsthand the dismantling of the Berlin Wall last year, Americans tuned out in  droves. Yet what is this season's surprise ratings hit on network TV? ABC's  "America's Funniest Home Videos," which capitalizes on everyone's desire to  play Allen Funt and to turn every aspect of life into a coast-to-coast  sideshow.  </P> <P> From actual childbirth to birthday parties, weddings and funerals, virtually  every aspect of life has become fodder for video voyeurism.  </P> <P> All of which brings us to a concert presented in Santa Ana last weekend to  raise money for the homeless. As it turned out, the promoters claim to have  lost $400 on the event. That's partly because the show was poorly planned and  abysmally executed (there wasn't even so much as a cheap-o Radio Shack PA  system for the performers).  </P> <P> Even so, the fiery performance by veteran R&amp;B saxslinger Big Jay McNeely  would have been a pleasurable enough experience in itself. But even that was  compromised by the intrusion of not one but two self-styled David Lynches who  set about indulging their video appetites all night long.  </P> <P> McNeely is renowned as one of the most animated performers of the early rock  era, and with his first song he was living up to his reputation, roaming not  just the stage but the entire room, sometimes sitting in a fan's lap, other  times falling down on one knee while continuing to blow his heart out.  </P> <P> Not content to be firsthand witnesses to such a freewheeling show, the video  freaks followed McNeely around, sweeping in from various corners of the room as  if they were cinematographers on a Steven Spielberg film shoot.  </P> <P> Get that close-up! Swing around for a side shot! Zoom in on his fingers! Now  get the audience reaction!  </P> <P> Actually, their behavior made me wonder whether these folks were really ardent  fans of Big Jay or just waiting, 12-to-1 zooms in hand, for his pants to fall  down so they could get big bucks and yuks from Bob Saget.  </P> <P> It's appalling how any no-talent Joe with the money to plunk down for a clump  of microchips and tape heads can quickly direct an audience's attention away  from the rightful owner -- be it a musician, an actor, a newlywed or an amateur  athlete -- and co-opt it for himself.  </P> <P> Besides which, all this reinforces the already too-prevalent attitude that the  only aspects of life with any validity are those that show up on the TV screen.  </P> <P> Did I have a good time at the fair? How was Uncle Bob's 90th birthday? Did  Jenny look pretty at her graduation? Gee, I won't know till I rerun the video.  </P> <P> Just as evidence about the dangers of secondhand smoke shatters the myth about  cigarettes affecting only the smoker, the video intrusion touches all of us  sooner or later.  </P> <P> Come to think of it, if Mary Shelley was updating her book for the '90s reader,  she would have to come up with a new subtitle as well. Instead of referring to  Frankenstein as "The Modern Prometheus," she could dub her video monster "The  Modern Narcissus."  </P></p>

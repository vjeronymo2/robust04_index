			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Whirlpool of Agreements"] </F>   [Text] When the Arab-Israeli negotiations began in  Washington, it seemed to observers, and even to ordinary people,  that the two negotiating sides were in a heated race to achieve  peace. Many believed that attaining this objective was not a  matter of years or months, but of a few weeks, and then  everything would be settled.    The negotiations moved to Washington, then returned to the  region. The nonpolitical negotiations continued to be held  behind closed doors, making it impossible to know much about  their results. However, what is leaked indicates that the  experts are making great progress in all nonpolitical fields.  This is a dangerous sign because it emphasizes that the  Israelis want to get everything before even thinking about  implementing the Security Council resolutions.    The agreement that was signed in Cairo last Wednesday, and  the subsequent Israeli statements, are merely naive attempts to  extract butter from water. Reading the texts of this agreement  does not satisfy the Arab citizen, in general, and the  Palestinian citizen, in particular, that an achievement was  attained, but that the exact opposite was realized.    The Arab-Israeli negotiations are creeping slowly on their  knees after their feet have become too tired to carry them.  These negotiations are so slow that one can speak about many  years before we see a real Israeli acceptance of Resolutions 242  and 338. Therefore, the nonpolitical Arab-Israeli negotiations  and the agreements reached in these talks on water and  environment, narcotics and smuggling, and school and university  syllabuses, radio and television programs, tourism, and many  other issues, represent something very dangerous. We hope that  the Arab negotiator will refuse to sign anything before  something is achieved on the political and military tracks,  which have become marathon roads full of thorns, nails, and  banana skins.</p>

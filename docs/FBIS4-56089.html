			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 26 -- The Yugoslav Army has  successfully completed the first stage of its transformation,  says Deputy Chief of Staff General Ratomir Milovanovic. Taking  part in a panel discussion on the Yugoslav Army's public image,  General Milovanovic said that the army had preserved its unity,  maintained the necessary level of combat preparedness,  consolidated its ranks and dismantled the territorial defense  force. He explained that the process of consolidating and  transforming the army had been embarked upon despite a  exceptionally unfavourable situations in the world and the  country's immediate neighbourhood, and an adverse legacy left  behind by the old federation.    The chain of command has been streamlined and the efficacy  of  the command and logistic apparatus enhanced, he said. The chief  of the information department of the army's General Staff,  Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, who spoke about the new identity  and public image of the Yugoslav Army, said that the new image  had been conceived as far back as 1992 and that it envisaged for  a new professional organization, equipped with sophisticated  equipment, non-political in character and based on the glorious  militayy traditions of the Serbian and Montenegrin people.    The assistant defense minister for the military industry,  General Savo Pustinja, said ttat the Yugoslav military industry  had oastered the technology for the production of more than 400  weapons systems, 30 percent of which had been exported before  the United Nations clamped sanctions on Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) in 1992. The sanctions were imposed because  of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in civil war raging in  neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina and their lifting is being made  conditional on an end to the war.    The Yugoslav Army will have changed the insignia on the  uniforms by Army day, June 16, which will be observed for the  first time this year.</p>

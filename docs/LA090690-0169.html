			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK 'N' ROLL'S MAIN EVENT: A LOSS OF $1.5 MILLION;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: POOR ATTENDANCE AND FINANCIAL WOES FORCED THE PROMOTER TO SCRAP THE  FINAL DAY.  </P> <P> The promoter of last weekend's Rock 'n' Roll's Main Event at Glen Helen  Regional Park in San Bernardino County said on Wednesday that he lost more than  $1.5 million on the aborted festival.  </P> <P> Michael Scafuto, the Montclair club owner who produced the outdoor affair, said  he generated only $15,000 in ticket sales on Saturday and Sunday. As a result,  he canceled the third and final day of the festival Monday, but promised to  refund the price of admission to those who purchased tickets in advance.  </P> <P> Despite crowd projections of 30,000 per day, attendance figures never rose  above 2,000 on Saturday and 4,000 on Sunday. Scafuto said he realized the depth  of his fiscal crisis when he was forced to ask his bank to open its doors  Sunday afternoon to provide him with enough cash to pay the acts he hired.  </P> <P> Scafuto, who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in promotion, said he could  not understand why so few attended.  </P> <P> But Moss Jacobs, general manager of Avalon Attractions, Southern California's  largest independent concert company, attributed the event's poor attendance to  a combination of factors.  </P> <P> Jacobs said he thought the hot and dry weather associated with San Bernardino  County probably played an important part in the concert's low draw. He also  pointed to the "mix-and-match" roster of artists as a possible setback.  </P> <P> "The promoter did not direct his lineup at any specific audience," Jacobs said.  </P> <P> Another factor, Jacobs speculated, was the fact that September is typically  considered to be a slow month in the concert industry. He also said business  has been down across the board in the concert industry.  </P> <P> While Scafuto said he still owed at least one government agency additional  money for permit fees, he maintained that all the artists who performed  Saturday and Sunday were paid in full.  </P> <P> Still, some entertainers scheduled to play on Monday have yet to receive half  of their fees. Geoffrey Blumenauer, who represents John Sebastian and Brewer  and Shipley, two acts scheduled to perform on Monday, said Scafuto told him he  had no money at this time to complete the transaction, but offered to sign a  note promising payment.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> FINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS AT MARYLAND  </P> <P> The people at the University of Maryland had grown all too accustomed to these  mid-week afternoon news conferences. Into a room they would march, grim-faced,  braced for bad news. Really bad news. News conference concerning Len Bias's  death. News conference concerning Lefty Driesell's forced resignation.  Concerning Bob Wade's forced resignation. Concerning NCAA probation and  sanctions. Concerning Jerrod Mustaf passing up his final two years of  eligibility. Concerning the school's appeal regarding probation. Concerning Lew  Perkins's resignation.  </P> <P> The people at Maryland had developed a Pavlovian response: There's a news  conference, oh my God, what's wrong now? In College Park the last four years,  the only good news was no news. Until Tuesday. Maryland called a news  conference concerning its basketball team and people actually smiled. Nobody  was sanctioned, suspended or forced to resign.  </P> <P> Walt Williams, who could have called this little meeting to announce he was  leaving Maryland for Georgetown, UNLV or Georgia Tech, instead proclaimed he  was staying put at Maryland for the rest of his college days. "Can you believe  one of these gatherings with people smiling? This is the first time we've had  good news in so long," Coach Gary Williams said.  </P> <P> The first reaction to his announcement in many quarters will be, Say what?  Let's get this straight: He could have gone to Georgetown and played with  Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo; he could have gone to Georgia Tech and  played with Kenny Anderson; he could have gone anywhere he wanted, immediately  played on live TV and in the NCAA tournament, but he chose to stay at Maryland?  </P> <P> Certainly, no one could have blamed Walt Williams if he had said, "Thanks for  the memories, please forward my mail to McDonough Gym."  </P> <P> But the decision he made apparently was in his best interests (not to mention  Maryland's) and it may dramatically help the immediate future of Maryland  basketball. It wasn't a decision Walt Williams required a lot of help making  and it wasn't one he rushed. Someone asked why it took him almost all summer to  decide and he said: "This is the biggest decision I ever had to make in my  life, so I wanted to get it right. If I had another year, I'd take 364 more  days. ... I really enjoy the people here. I was aware of how many credits I  would lose and I want to keep on track for graduation in four years. ...  </P> <P> "When I first started thinking this over, it wasn't hard to picture myself in  other uniforms. But it got harder the longer the process went on. I'm an easy  person to get along with, and I think I could have made the adjustment, but you  still have to prove yourself to a new coach and a new team. There's a lot of  uncertainty. It wasn't just out of loyalty that I decided to stay; first of  all, you've got to be loyal to yourself before being loyal to anyone else.  Maybe it does send a message that some of us feel a lot of good feelings about  Maryland. ... But I'm not getting down on anyone who did leave this  university."  </P> <P> Williams didn't name any names, but clearly he was talking about friend and  former teammate Mustaf, sitting a few rows away, who came to lend moral  support. Mustaf, who made himself a first-round draft choice, appears to have  done the right thing for him. Williams feels he made the right decision for  himself.  </P> <P> How, you ask, can that be when he can never test himself in that crucible of  the national tournament because of Maryland's NCAA-imposed two-year sanction?  </P> <P> Nowhere is it written that a kid can't play professional basketball -- that is  Walt Williams's stated goal -- if he doesn't shine in the NCAA tournament.  Robert Parish did nicely for himself. So did Jeff Malone. "Maybe for a person  who's not going any further in basketball than the college level, the NCAA  tournament and big TV games would be the ultimate goal," Williams reasoned this  week. "But I have higher goals set for myself than TV and the NCAA tournament."  </P> <P> Toward that end, Gary Williams can be counted on to help. Without Walt  Williams, his team would be in a mess. With him, Maryland can be reasonably  competitive.  </P> <P> Without exacting an out-and-out promise, Walt Williams wanted to find out  exactly what he'd be getting for this sacrifice. "He's not going to have TV or  the tournament," Gary Williams said. "But what he will have is the opportunity  to play a position that will help him prepare for an NBA career. There's a  million small forwards at 6-8; there's even a lot of off guards that size. But  there aren't many point guards with his size and ability, and there are a lot  of things we can do to get Walt involved."  </P> <P> This is the deal: Walt Williams stays at Maryland for at least one year, maybe  two. He will learn how to play the point position, probably very well. He will  be The Man. Gary Williams and Walt Williams make a nice combination. Maryland  will not be a patsy with both of them.  </P> <P> This is not the scenario many people expected. They would ask Walt, when he got  to the playground, where he was going to school. He'd say very honestly, "Don't  know." People would ask Gary Williams, who was recruiting his head off, and he  would say, "Don't know."  </P> <P> One night last week, when Walt had made up his mind, Gary was scared to take  the call. Well, apprehensive if not scared. It was a state of anxiety Gary  Williams had not experienced in many, many years. "I'm usually a very, very  positive person," he said. "Before a game against the best team in the country,  I'm convinced when I walk on the court my team will win. But this team had been  beaten up more (last year) than any team I've been around. I was kind of  disappointed in myself too, because I had let that same feeling change me to  some degree. You lose confidence that anything good can happen to you.  </P> <P> "We've been hit so many times, it's tough to believe something good will  happen. Hey, this is one of my better recruiting jobs."  </P></p>

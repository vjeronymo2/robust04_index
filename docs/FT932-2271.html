			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Local government - no change may be best Sir, Your leader, 'Local Counsel' (June 17), concerning the review of local government structure hits the nail on the head. The Local Government Commission has clearly got off to a difficult start. This is perhaps unsurprising in view of the strong historical identity of many local authorities and the vitally important functions they perform, especially - from the point of view of the Council for the Protection of Rural England - those concerning environmental protection, such as minerals, transport and land use planning. CPRE believes the 'no change' option - one which the commission assures us remains on the table - deserves much more careful consideration. Apart from obvious problems with some of the more recent creations, the case for a radical review of local government structures has not generally been well made. As your leader recognises, the existing two-tier structure of districts and counties, far from resulting in a duplication of responsibilities, combines to provide locally sensitive service delivery and accountable strategic decision-making. The early signs are that the commission is attaching insufficient weight to the status quo as an option. The final decision, remains, of course, in the government's hands. The environment secretary, John Gummer, could with advantage remember the environmental benefits of the current system. Fiona Reynolds, director, Council for the Protection of Rural England, Warwick House, 25 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 0PP</p>

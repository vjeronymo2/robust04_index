			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bad debt disposals hit Japanese banks Substantial bad loan write-offs reduced recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - at Japan's long-term credit banks and trust banks in the six months to the end of September. However, most banks were able to report higher operating profits in a more favourable interest rate environment. The three long-term credit banks, which are principally wholesale lenders to Japanese companies, saw combined pre-tax profits fall by 20.1 per cent. The decline was largely the result of the disposal of bad debts accumulated during the collapse of asset prices in recent years. Write-offs reduced outstanding non-performing loans to Y1,800bn (Dollars 1.82bn), a fall of 19 per cent on a year earlier. However, these figures do not include restructured loans, where interest rates have been cut to assist borrowers in severe trouble. Analysts estimate that if these were added to the total, bad loans would be approximately double the disclosed levels. The long-term credit banks used gains from sales of equities to offset the write-offs, but these were not enough to cover the full charge and pre-tax profits declined as a result. There were mixed fortunes in operating profits. The Industrial Bank of Japan, the largest of the three, managed to take advantage of lower discount bond rates to record a 32 per cent increase in operating profits, but the two smaller banks both saw operating profits fall. They attributed the decline to lower profits on government bond investment income than last year, when they benefited strongly from sales of bonds as interest rates fell. For the full year to the end of March the three banks expect combined pre-tax profits of Y126bn, up by 18.6 per cent from 1993 - 94. The trust banks, many of which have had severe difficulties during the period of falling asset prices and resulting problem loan increases, also pursued an aggressive policy of writing off bad loans. As a result, they reported combined pre-tax profits lower by 23 per cent at Y48.7bn. But operating profits for most of the banks were sharply higher - by an aggregate of 57 per cent. The trust banks said the improved operating profits were the result of the fall in interest rates in the previous six months - September 1993 to March 1994 - which, because of the structure of their assets and liabilities, was not reflected in margins until the first half of the current financial year. Most banks reported declines in outstanding non-performing loans, with one exception - Nippon Trust. The bank was taken over two months ago by Mitsubishi Bank in an attempt to rescue it from its enormous burden of bad loans. At the time of the takeover, Mitsubishi warned that bad loans were set to rise for some time. The increase in Nippon Trust's bad loans accounted for the fact that aggregate disclosed non-performing assets rose by 1.1 per cent between March and September this year, to Y2,700bn. However, like the long-term credit banks and the city banks, the trust banks said that they expected to clear their bad debt problem within three years. Sumitomo Bank: In last week's tabulation of the Japanese city banks' half-year results, the figure for Sumitomo Bank's increase in non-performing loans should have been 7.5 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        LONG-TERM CREDIT BANKS: SIX MONTHS TO SEPTEMBER 1994 (YBN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                  Operating   Change on   Operating   Change on                        revenues    year (%)    profits     year (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IBJ                    1,482.9      +2.6        85.8        +32.7 LTCB                   1,123.6     +10.2        43.2         -8.8 Nippon Credit            600.0      +0.7        33.4        -10.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trust banks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mitsui                   513.8      -0.2        28.4        +47.5 Mitsubishi               542.1      +9.1        77.3        +74.0 Sumitomo                 582.5     +13.8        83.4        +93.0 Yasuda                   341.1      -2.6        23.4        +31.2 Toyo                     221.7     -17.1        18.5        +18.1 Chuo                     142.3      -5.0         6.1        -30.9 Nippon                    35.5     -18.6        -0.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                  Recurring   Change on      Net      Change on                        profits*    year (%)    profits     year (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IBJ                       27.9     -16.3        15.4         -0.1 LTCB                      18.6     -12.8        13.0         +0.2 Nippon Credit             11.5     -36.0         6.6         -0.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trust banks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mitsui                     9.2      -6.6         5.7         -0.9 Mitsubishi                14.0     -15.1         8.0         -8.2 Sumitomo                  10.5     -36.9         7.9         -7.5 Yasuda                     7.9     -21.1         4.8         +5.0 Toyo                       4.6     -14.7         3.5         -5.7 Chuo                       3.0     -12.4         1.6         -8.9 Nippon                    -0.5                  -1.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                                Non-performing        Half-year                                    loans             change (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IBJ                                 514.3             -24.5 LTCB                                726.8             -18.2 Nippon Credit                       600.8              -3.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trust banks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mitsui                              595.8              -0.3 Mitsubishi                          494.8              -5.9 Sumitomo                            521.2              -3.3 Yasuda                              425.7              -3.3 Toyo                                297.0              -5.1 Chuo                                176.5              -2.2 Nippon                              231.3             +61.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * before extraordinary items and tax  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Sales increased by 78 per cent to Dollars 246m (Dollars 138m). Mr James Davidson, chairman, said North Sea activity was high. Growth achieved, combined with a strengthened balance sheet, had placed the company in a position to exploit opportunities which were expected to present themselves in the near to medium term.

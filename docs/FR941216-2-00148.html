Beginning on January 1, 1995, Federal agencies may not require an SF 171, Application for Federal Employment. Instead, applicants may apply for most jobs with a resume, the Optional Application for Federal Employment, or any other written format of their choice. For unique jobs with specialized requirements or jobs filled through automated systems, agencies may have been authorized to require special forms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new OPM flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, describes what applicants should include in their resumes or applications. The flyer and the Optional Application for Federal Employment are being printed for distribution in December. Applicants can get copies beginning in December from local OPM Employment Information Offices, by calling OPM's automated telephone system at 912&hyph;757&hyph;3000 or by TDD at 912&hyph;744&hyph;2299. These items will also be available in December in electronic format from OPM's bulletin board at 912&hyph;757&hyph;3100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By February, OPM plans to make the flyer available in alternative media formats (Braille, large print, audio tape, and computer disk) for persons with disabilities. In addition, beginning in December any applicant may use the electronic Optional Application file and any word processing software to produce and print a completed application form. (See question 6 below). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before appointment, agencies will ask individuals to complete a Declaration for Federal Employment to determine their suitability for Federal employment. The Declaration for Federal Employment replaces the SF 61&hyph;B, Declaration of Appointee, and will also be available in December.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Concerning the application procedures: Richard Whitford or Stephen McGarry on 202&hyph;606&hyph;2605 or TDD at 202&hyph;606&hyph;0023.

OMB has approved the new application procedures to take effect on January 1, 1995, the day after the OMB authorization for the SF 171 expires on December 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the SF 171 expires, Federal agencies may not require applicants to submit it. Applicants may file for most jobs using a resume, the Optional Application for Federal Employment, or any other written format of their choice, including an SF 171. Agencies are authorized to use this process for positions in the competitive service, the excepted service and the Senior Executive Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following Questions and Answers give more information on the new application procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Why did OPM develop the new procedures? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its September 1993 report, Creating a Government that Works Better &amp; Costs Less, the National Performance Review recommended that OPM eliminate standard application forms because their length and complexity discourage applicants from seeking Federal jobs. OPM agreed to eliminate the SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, and associated forms, the SF 171&hyph;A, Continuation Sheet for SF 171, and the SF 172, Amendment to Application for Federal Employment as of December 31, 1994. An interagency task force recommended new application procedures that let applicants choose the format of their application. In addition to giving applicants more flexibility (but also give Federal agencies the material needed for evaluation), another goal was to separate the qualifications and suitability information. Suitability information will be collected on the Declaration for Federal Employment. (See question 22.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) What groups were involved in developing the new procedures? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interagency task force representing 16 Federal agencies recommended the new application procedures. OPM then sought comments from the National Partnership Council, the Interagency Advisory Group (representing 90 agencies), unions with national consultation rights with OPM, and organizations representing major constituent groups. The new procedures were published in the June 22, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is the final application process basically the same as the June 22, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proposals? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yes, although there are some editorial and stylistic changes in the flyer and forms. Samples of the final materials are appended to this notice. One change, in response to comments received, was the deletion of birth date from information applicants are required to submit with their job application or resume. Several commenters noted privacy issues, the potential for age discrimination, and that for the vast majority of jobs, it is sufficient for agencies to obtain the date of birth only from job finalists. For the few positions such as law enforcement where age is a factor, agency vacancy announcements can ask applicants to give their age. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) What provisions have been made for applicants with disabilities? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, will be available in Braille and large print and on audio tape and computer disk. (The flyer tells applicants what to include in their resumes or applications for Federal jobs.) Beginning in February, individuals who want these alternative formats may request them by calling 912&hyph;757&hyph;3000 or TDD 912&hyph;744&hyph;2299. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in December the flyer and the Optional Application for Federal Employment will be available through OPM's electronic bulletin board. See question 6 below for specific instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) How will the OPM publicize the new application process? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM has planned a major publicity campaign including news releases and mailings to Federal offices, State Employment Service offices, State Vocational Rehabilitation Services offices, colleges and universities, and other major constituency groups. The mailing will include the new application materials, as well as a poster and a flyer describing OPM's automated employment information systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) How will the applicants get the new application materials? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning in December, copies will be available from several sources. Applicants may call or visit local OPM Employment Information Offices or they may call OPM's automated telephone system at 912&hyph;757&hyph;3000 and listen for the message on how to request forms. Information is also available by TDD at 912&hyph;744&hyph;2299. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants can also get the materials through OPM's electronic bulletin board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Call the Federal Job Opportunities Board (FJOB) at 912&hyph;757&hyph;3100,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) At the main menu, select ``Opportunities for Federal Employment,'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Select ``Application Information and Forms,'' and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Read or download the files. Note: applicants may use the electronic ``Optional Application file'' and any word processing software to produce and print a completed application form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) May applicants use commercial PC software to prepare their resume, the Optional Application for Federal Employment, or application in another format? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yes. See question above. Also, applicants may use any PC software to help prepare their application, but they are responsible for making sure that their application contains <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the information requested in the flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the vacancy announcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) In August 1994, OPM issued a bulletin giving agencies the opportunity to order the new application materials by ``riding'' OPM's printing request to GPO. If an agency did not order then, how may they obtain the new materials? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Services Administration (GSA) will stock the new forms some time in February. Agencies may order the forms through the GSA Supply Center Catalog. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The stock numbers of the new materials are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Applying For a Federal Job (OF 510), NSN 7540&hyph;01&hyph;351&hyph;9177 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Optional Application for Federal Employment (OF 612), NSN 7540&hyph;01&hyph;351&hyph;9178 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Declaration for Federal Employment (OF 306), NSN 7540&hyph;01&hyph;368&hyph;7775 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9) OMB approved the new application procedures for a 3-year period.

Once Again About Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons"]    [Text] Ever since the question of eliminating Ukrainian  strategic weapons arose, a song that I heard sung on the beach  by a little girl has been haunting me: "The old woman took care  of her old man as long as he had lard [Ukrainian traditional  staple food]."    Nuclear weapons constitute our lard.    These are 46 SS-24 launchers, 130 SS-19 units, and about 40  heavy bombers TU-160 and TU-95 MS, for which 670 cruise missiles  equipped with nuclear warheads are stored.    The availability of such quantities of powerful weapons has,  in fact, placed Ukraine at the center of worldwide attention, to  an extent that even the U.S. President overcame his reluctance  and made a visit to Boryspil airport -- our capital's air gate  -- to meet with President Leonid Kravchuk.    Some people triumphed on this occasion -- a victory of our  diplomacy -- major foreign leaders are coming to us cap in hand.  However, we should not be so naive! They will come to us and  will try to please us as long as our "old man" president has  that same "lard" that everybody wants. Since, as long as we  have it, someone's [Russia's] hands are securely bound.    Isn't this clear? Who would care about us today and who  would remember about us in this time of economic troubles, if,  by virtue of fate, we had not become heirs to those same  strategic forces, which, over the long years of the "Cold War,"  helped maintain peace and quiet?    It is of interest to recall the evolution in U.S.-Ukrainian  relations from the very beginning of the process of nuclear  missile disarmament. At first, the frenzied pressure upon us:  Give away all of your missiles or things will be bad for you!  We gave away tactical weapons.... The world silently accepted  our gift to Russia, but for us this only meant losses.    The pressure built up. At long last, we came to our senses  and put forward conditions: security guarantees, financial  assistance, and compensations. At first, nobody would even  listen to us. Just behold that enfeebled Ukraine putting  forward conditions! Even the first U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine  Roman Popadyuk started threatening us: You are inviting fire.    We were not scared. We had enough common sense to uphold our  position.    This time, the Tripartite Statement was signed in Moscow.  However, here, too, we only got great promises in words and  nothing specific in practice.    UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has written about all of these sudden  changes around our lard, which is presently referred to as  "Ukrainian snickers," since its first issue. It also stated  that nuclear weapons have too much influence upon the world  climate and that it should not be treated too lightly.    Even though we had been led to that same borderline where,  it  might seem, one could already echo Hemingway's "Farewell to  arms!" our parliament had enough brains not to make the last  step leading to the abyss: The deputies voted against Ukraine's  joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    Oh, how much excitement this caused in the Russian press,  radio, and television! There was more mayhem about this in  Russia than in the United States.    Why did Russia raise that outcry? Is it interested in our  disarmament more than the United States is?    It appears so. How can it be otherwise? Belarus handed over  its missiles and so did Kazakhstan. Stubborn Ukraine alone  prevents Russia from becoming the only nuclear-missile queen on  the territory of the former Warsaw Pact. There is enough in it  to cause one to go out of his mind!    One important circumstance rendered the Russians  particularly  anxious: In 1995, the validity of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty expires. The future of this document will depend upon  the decisions of an international conference. Unless Ukraine  joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty now, this question may  become irrelevant in its own right.    Russian papers write that, in such a case, the "domino  theory" will work and quite a number of states will remain  nuclear.    For my part, I want to ask: Why are you so concerned about  the future? Don't you see that, today, Israel, China, and North  Korea are becoming nuclear powers? Or let faraway countries arm  themselves, while nearby Ukraine must give away its nuclear  warheads?    Incidentally, a few words about the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty. It was approved by the UN General Assembly in 1968.  Today, 158 states are signatories. The main objective of the  treaty is to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons and  to ensure international control over the fulfillment by the  states of their obligations. For those who are signatories to  the treaty and have nuclear weapons, these obligations mean that  nuclear weapons or nuclear detonators should not be passed on to  any other country, and nonnuclear states should not be  encouraged to acquire nuclear arsenals. Those, who do not have  such weapons, undertake not to receive them from others and not  to manufacture them at home.    As one can see, there is not a single word on the relations  of nuclear states among themselves. It follows from this that  they may pass these deadly weapons to one another.    However, there is not a single allusion at the situation,  which has taken shape in our country after the disintegration of  the USSR. Ukraine was not a nuclear state, and strategic forces  of the Union were deployed on its territory. Ukraine never was  a participant in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, because  there was no need for it to be one. It appears that it made a  bad error by signing the Lisbon Protocol, having thereby driven  itself into a kind of trap. Had there been good will on the part  of the world community, Ukraine's signature would have simply be  canceled as legally invalid.    However, nobody cares now and everybody keeps demanding:  Ukraine, get yourself into the noose that you have prepared for  yourself. They are demanding, because they know that the  unfortunate year 1995 will come, the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty will become ineffective, and Ukraine will have to declare  itself a nuclear power and join the nuclear club.    It is true that our parliament ratified Article 5 of the  Lisbon Protocol recommending Ukraine to join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty as soon as possible. However, a  question arises: On what terms? As a nuclear power or as a  nonnuclear state?    Academician I. Yukhnovskyy stresses in UKRAYINSKA HAZETA  that  we are owners, but not masters of strategic complexes. This  situation is also not provided for in the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. Why then should we join it and in what  capacity?    In my opinion, we must state our position once and for all.  Here, all international bodies should have helped us, if they  had sincere and open intentions. We can see that all they do is  making fabrications and trying hard to swindle us and bring us  to our knees, so that they could then deal with a secondary and  obedient state. What will then remain from our independence,  which we have gained through such a painful process. Just  recollections?    I do not believe that there is no way out from this  extremely  complicated situation, a way out that will be acceptable for  everybody.    Is the Ukrainian state with such a great scientific and  technological potential unable to deal with its own missiles?  If there are too many of them, we must only leave the quantity  we need and ensure their proper servicing, without aiming them  at anyone. Let them remain on stand-by. The rest of the  missiles must be dismantled, the fuel must be used for peaceful  purposes, and the silos and frames of the launchers for economic  needs. I fully agree with Ihor Rafayilovych [Yukhnovskyy].    All of this must be done by our own efforts. We are capable  of doing this. Our scientists have already found a way to  neutralize the extremely harmful component of nuclear fuel --  heptyl. At the same time, Americans proposed their assistance  in processing the highly enriched uranium into low-grade uranium.    What else do we need? Money, perhaps? Right, and let Bill  Clinton fulfill his promises.    It is hard to understand why we remain poor when we have  such  wealth. Other states put in much effort to extract uranium, and  they sell it. We have nuclear fuel as the stuffing of warheads.  Is it really more difficult to extract it from there than from  mines?    I also have a question for new U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine  Mr.  W. Miller. If his country is really capable of providing us  with considerable monetary assistance (on credit, of course),  why doesn't it do it now instead of simply declaring its  intentions?    Give us the necessary capital and we, jointly with U.S.  entrepreneurs, will very quickly organize the processing of  highly enriched uranium into low-grade uranium, will repay you  with it, will provide our atomic plants with fuel, and will also  sell it to Russia or exchange it for something there. This is a  perfectly realistic project from which everybody will benefit.  However, no way, Washington does not accept such a variant. It  only has one demand: Give away your missiles, Ukraine. Then we  will wipe our feet on you. Isn't it so, Mr. Miller? Please  explain this to our readers and to our people. Explain honestly  and openly.    Nuclear fuel is now in very short supply. In Russia -- at  the Smolensk, Leningrad, and Kursk atomic electric power plants  [AES] -- fuel reserves are coming to an end. At the Chernobyl  AES, one power unit has already been halted. An energy collapse  has set in. Or, perhaps, we are being deliberately pushed into  such a situation in order that we would later buy that same  uranium, at any price, from the United States?    Answer this question, too, Mr. Miller.    Our president intends to ask between $600 million and $800  million from the United States. This capital might help us  emerge from the crisis. However, there is little hope that this  money will be obtained. Who needs a strong and powerful Ukraine?    As for those missiles that still remain in their combat  positions, they could serve as a counterbalance until Ukraine  joins the nuclear club and becomes, on that basis, a participant  in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Following that and  together with all other nuclear powers Ukraine will start  disarming.    Between 3 and 8 March, L.M. Kravchuk will meet with Bill  Clinton in the United States. Bill Clinton's letter, announced  by our president at the Supreme Council session, led our  parliamentarians to vote for removing reservations from the  Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol. In that letter, the U.S.  President promised to double all types of assistance to us and  even to take care of our missile officers. The latter is very  important. Because, today, our commander of a rocket division  gets 2.2 million coupons and a lieutenant in the Russian Army --  190,000 rubles [figures as published].    However, will everything be the way we would like it to be?    Doubts, doubts.... That is why we would very much like our  president to adopt the right line of conduct, so that all of us  would not have to sing "the old woman took care of her old man  as long as he had lard...."</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAMMER GETS A PACEMAKER  </P> <P> Industrialist Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum, was  hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center on Friday and underwent surgery for  insertion of a cardiac pacemaker, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "He is alert and talking, and his cardiologist, Dr. Jan Tillisch, expects him  to be released from the hospital in a few days and to return to normal  activities," Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley said.  </P> <P> Within hours of the elective operation, the feisty Hammer granted a telephone  interview from his hospital bed.  </P> <P> "I just got out of the operating room (and) had dinner," said Hammer in a low,  scratchy voice. "There is no question that it was not a heart attack."  </P> <P> Hammer explained: "Recently, I had fallen and had some rib trouble. . . . The  doctor recommended I have a pacemaker put in. He said I would function better  and that the pacemaker would protect me from future problems.  </P> <P> "During the trouble with Watergate, people told me I was faking with my heart,"  Hammer said. But nearly 20 years later, Hammer said there is finally some  public evidence that "I have had problems with my heart."  </P> <P> Hammer had pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions to President  Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign, and after a decade-long quest, he was  pardoned earlier this year by President Bush.  </P> <P> Hospital spokesman Richard Elbaum said the procedure that Hammer underwent was  elective.  </P> <P> "He did not come in under an emergency situation," Elbaum said.  </P> <P> A pacemaker regulates electrical activity in the heart so that it beats  normally in a person who suffers abnormal heart rhythms.  </P> <P> According to a hospital source, Hammer had been in Hawaii where he had been  involved in a marathon negotiation and had become exhausted.  </P> <P> Trading in Occidental stock was suspended Friday on the New York Stock Exchange  with news of Hammer's hospitalization. When he has been ill in the past, the  price of the firm's stock has surged, because the firm is considered a likely  takeover target without Hammer.  </P> <P> The 91-year-old philanthropist is known worldwide for his collection of art,  endowment of museums and tens of millions of dollars in contributions to  charities and medical research.  </P> <P> In his long business career, spanning seven decades, he developed a remarkable  relationship with the Soviet Union. Going to Russia at age 23, he made a deal  with Lenin to supply surplus U.S. wheat. He has met every Soviet leader since.  </P> <P> Hammer, who was born in the Bronx, N.Y., and educated as a medical doctor,  never entered practice. Instead, he took over his father's faltering  pharmaceutical business and made it a success.  </P> <P> He acquired Occidental Petroleum in 1956 and turned it into a conglomerate of  fuel, chemicals and food with $20 billion a year in sales.  </P> <P> Staff writer Allan Parachini contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD WILL ADD 60,000 RESIDENTS, GROUP PREDICTS  </P> <P> Oxnard will grow by 10 square miles and about 60,000 residents by the year  2020, according to a report released this week by a citizens group at work on a  blueprint for Oxnard's future.  </P> <P> The city will stretch to Ormond Beach on the south and as far east as Victoria  Avenue, nearly half a mile past its existing eastern boundary, the final draft  of the group's update on the city's General Plan projected.  </P> <P> The report, which culminates nearly two years of work by the 22-member General  Plan Advisory Committee, also recommends converting three square miles of  agricultural lands to urban uses and changing the zoning on much of Oxnard's  undeveloped area from residential to commercial. The amount of land zoned for  open space, which could be devoted to parks or farming, would be boosted to  1,099 acres or nearly two square miles.  </P> <P> Negative effects of growth would be held in check by more stringent  growth-management policies, which would bar development unless the roads and  schools in the area could support it. The approach also requires developers to  build in established neighborhoods before breaking ground in less-populated  areas.  </P> <P> The plan, which is expected to be adopted at a May 25 meeting of the committee,  is aimed at allowing more Oxnard residents to work and shop within the city,  thus increasing the city's tax base, committee Chairman Ralph Schumacher said.  </P> <P> "GPAC made a commitment to jobs for Oxnard's residents," he said. "To do that,  more jobs had to be created."  </P> <P> The committee envisions Oxnard's population growing from about 125,000 today to  184,197 in 2020. The number of homes that could be built on property zoned for  residential uses would drop from 11,596, under the city's present General Plan,  to 6,447. Property zoned for commercial and industrial purposes would climb  from 3,624 acres to 5,148 acres.  </P> <P> According to the committee document, much of Oxnard's growth would be centered  at Ormond Beach, where an Orange County developer has proposed a marina-based  residential and commercial community.  </P> <P> Baldwin Co. of Irvine had hoped to develop 2,900 acres of Ormond Beach, but the  committee has recommended that no more than 900 acres be developed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recommendations  </P> <P> GPAC recommends converting nearly a square mile of agricultural property on the  northwest end of the city to residential uses, with land set aside for a high  school, an elementary school and a junior high school.  </P> <P> The property was offered to California State University two years ago by a  Somis developer as a site for a Ventura County campus. The developer, David  White, has since offered to donate a site for a high school in exchange for  development concessions.  </P> <P> "GPAC took this into consideration when we decided to move the urban limits  line," Schumacher said.  </P> <P> GPAC's proposal would also open up agricultural land north of La Colonia for  residential development and three school sites, in keeping with a request by  trustees of the Oxnard School District, said Richard Maggio, Oxnard's community  development director.  </P> <P> But the document, which will be considered by the Oxnard Planning Commission  and the City Council in coming months, drew criticism from several quarters.  </P> <P> Scott Bollinger, a GPAC alternate who has long advocated strict limits on  growth, said the proposed plan's protections can too easily be ignored by city  officials.  </P> <P> "If the council were to honor the Growth Management Element, you've got  something that would work," he said. "But I have serious doubts that the  council would honor it. The pressures for growth have always been there and  they're becoming more intense."  </P> <P> Bollinger also questioned the document's population projections, which he said  failed to take into account population growth due to immigration because it was  based only on anticipated new housing.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Oscar Karrin, another GPAC alternate and an advocate of affordable  housing, criticized the plan for sidestepping the issue of affordable housing.  </P> <P> "Nobody can afford to live here as it is," he said. "Businesses are already  subsidizing housing for their workers."  </P> <P> An environmental impact report released with committee's recommendations raised  several other concerns.  </P> <P> The report predicted that growth would deplete aquifers, increasing the risk of  their contamination by seawater.  </P> <P> The report also predicted a loss of $10 million in agricultural revenue as a  result of the proposed conversion of three square miles of agricultural land to  urban uses. But it also noted that the losses could be offset by businesses  moving in.  </P> <P> In addition, the development planned for Ormond Beach would damage much of the  area's most productive wetlands, the impact report said. While Baldwin plans to  protect 50 acres of wetlands, only three acres have been designated as highly  productive by biologists. The development, meanwhile, would impact 110 acres of  wetlands that have been designated highly productive.  </P></p>

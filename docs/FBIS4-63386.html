			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Finance Ministry believes that it is too  early to discuss Tajikistan's joining the ruble zone, Deputy  Russian Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin told the Financial  Information Agency.    He emphasized that this issue could be considered only in  the  distant and not in the near future as Tajikistan would prefer.    By the end of 1993 Tajikistan was the only republic of the  former USSR where old issue rubles were still in circulation.  This led to the complete collapse of the Tajik monetary system.  Trying to remain in the ruble zone, Dushanbe made quite a risky  decision and seized old issue rubles without introducing its own  currency units.    This resulted in crisis. To overcome it the Russian  government agreed to allot a credit of 120 billion cash rubles.  Tajikistan has already received 80 billion rubles of it.    The Russian Finance Ministry believes that Tajikistan must  focus on restoration of its own monetary system. Tajikistan  must introduce its own currency together with Russian rubles.  This seems to be the most reasonable alternative in the present  situation, Kazmin pointed out.    He referred to the April memorandum of the Russian  government  and the Central Bank submitted to the International Monetary  Fund. The memorandum said that the merging of the Russian  monetary system with the monetary systems of the CIS states  could be carried out only if the economic systems of these  states would suit the purpose. The economic potential of  Belarus, which has signed such an agreement with Russia,  significantly exceeds that of Tajikistan. However, many  problems must be settled before the Russian-Belarussian treaty  is implemented.    Russian Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin has recently  recommended that Tajikistan introduce its own national coupons  and cover its expenditures without Russian credits. Dubinin  announced that Russia had already printed coupons for Tajikistan.</p>

(Cozac) had arrived in  Port-au-Prince over the weekend for the purpose of holding  conversations with personalities involved in finding a solution  to the crisis. Mr. (Cozac) termed the situation in Haiti  encouraging. He made the Haitian military responsible for the  reimposition of the sanctions. He explained that if the military  respected their commitments within the scope of the Governors  Island agreement, the sanctions would be lifted. He further said  that the U.S. Government wants the Haitian Army to be  professional and apolitical.    Furthermore, Mr. (Cozac) said that the Haitian  parliamentarians' plan is a good and serious effort to  disentangle the democratic process. In his opinion, the plan  must not replace the Governors Island agreement, and the United  States does not wish to impose a plan on President Aristide or  to require from him actions not provided for by the 3 July  agreement. Finally, Mr. (Cozac) gave the following warning,  quote: The U.S. Government will not have relations with any de  facto governments in Haiti, unquote.</p>

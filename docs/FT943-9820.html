			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Observer: Daley round Twenty six years of penance is obviously deemed to be sufficient. Chicago is being allowed to host a Democratic National Convention once again which should give the current Mayor Daley a chance to do something towards setting the family record straight. For it was when his father, 'Boss' Daley, was in the mayoral office that city police charged unarmed anti-Vietnam war protestors at the infamous 1968 gathering. Daley junior has enjoyed nothing like the immense political power wielded by his father, but on this occasion he did have a man in the right place. With his former campaign manager David Wilhelm now chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Daley's city was more than well-placed to secure the prize in 1996. But was he a bit optimistic when he forecast, echoing the words of the late 1960s protestors, that the 'whole world will be watching'?</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Government may curb spread of GPs' companies THE GOVERNMENT is considering action to halt the spread of private companies being set up by GP fundholders under National Health Service reforms. Fundholders are general practitioners who purchase hospital and other care on behalf of their patients from government-allocated budgets. The introduction of fundholding last year has led to some fundholders providing extra services as well as purchasing them. Some bring specialists to their surgeries to carry out consultations and treatment that would normally involve patients going to hospital. Some fundholders have set up private companies to handle the financial arrangements for these activities, which fall outside the normal scope of GPs' remuneration. The government's concern about this activity emerged at yesterday's conference of the National Association of Fundholding Practices in Birmingham. Mr Bill McCarthy, a Department of Health official responsible for fundholding issues, said there were 'real concerns about accountability' involved in the use of private companies. He said ministers were looking for alternative arrangements to make their use unnecessary. The attempt to restrain the use of private companies by NHS doctors coincides with government moves to persuade fundholders, who made windfall surpluses on their budgets during the first year of the scheme, to repay them. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, who addressed the conference earlier yesterday, said there were 'quite a few cases where very high savings were clearly due to the wrong budgets set in the first place'. Fundholders must 'place long-term achievements above short-term gain'. She said the responsible approach would be to agree to return any savings that were due to incorrect budget settings rather than their own efficiency. Some fundholders have returned money that arose from inaccurate budget-settings when the scheme was launched. But regional health authorities have no legal right to demand it back, and some GPs say they intend to use surpluses for developments such as improvements to surgery premises. Mrs Bottomley described fundholding as an 'innovative and dynamic scheme' that would remain a permanent cornerstone of the NHS. She stressed that fundholders must demonstrate accountability and responsibility. In addition to financial concerns, ministers are grappling with the problem of ensuring that fundholders spend their budgets in ways that accord with the government's overall health priorities. Mrs Bottomley said the challenge was to ensure that fundholders' plans were consistent with national priorities 'without sacrificing innovation and change'.</p>

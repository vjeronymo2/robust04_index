			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON ALEXANDER; HEALTH IDEAS STIRRED FUROR  </P> <P> Don Dale Alexander, controversial nutrition theorist, lecturer and writer who  advocated taking cod liver oil and orange juice for the treatment of arthritis,  has died. He was 70.  </P> <P> Alexander, who was one of 11 California gubernatorial candidates in 1966, died  Friday at Veterans Administration Hospital in Westwood of heart complications.  </P> <P> A popular lecturer at health and nutrition seminars for four decades, Alexander  achieved international attention in the 1950s with his first book, "Arthritis  and Common Sense," which was excerpted in the Los Angeles Times in 1959.  </P> <P> The book, written in 1951, became a best seller in 1957 and ultimately sold  more than 1 million copies in six languages.  </P> <P> Alexander appeared on national network television shows including Johnny Carson  and Merv Griffin, and his theories were described in Life and other national  magazines.  </P> <P> "Through study, logic and common sense we have decided that arthritis is  basically an oil deficiency in the human body and a lack of Vitamin D,"  Alexander wrote.  </P> <P> "To restore the proper amounts of Vitamin D to your system -- the right kind of  vitamins and lubricating oils -- we recommend the use of cod liver oil mixed  with orange juice."  </P> <P> He also advocated a precise sequence in which foods should be eaten.  </P> <P> The Federal Trade Commission accused Alexander of making false and  unsubstantiated claims and at one point issued a cease-and-desist order against  his publishing company, Witkower Press Inc., of Hartford, Conn., to halt  further publication of the book.  </P> <P> An FTC examiner found an "impressive lack of medical or other training or  education which would fit Alexander to write a book on such a recognized  subject as arthritis."  </P> <P> The examiner characterized Alexander's statements in radio interviews as  "merely a hodgepodge of scientific falderal and medical mumbo jumbo."  </P> <P> Alexander wrote four other books on nutrition and health, all published by his  Witkower Press: "Good Health and Common Sense," "The Common Cold and Common  Sense," "Healthy Hair and Common Sense" and "Dry Skin and Common Sense."  </P> <P> A resident of Los Angeles for the last 30 years, Alexander filed as a candidate  for governor in the Democratic primary election of 1966, challenging incumbent  Gov. Edmund G. Brown, who was renominated but lost the election to Ronald  Reagan.  </P> <P> Alexander's 21-plank platform opposed fluoridated drinking water and advocated  nighttime pari-mutuel racing and a state lottery to help finance a rapid  transit system for Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Born in Norwich, Conn., on July 18, 1919, Alexander attended the Norwich Free  Academy and Trinity College in Connecticut and Columbia University, New York.  </P> <P> He is survived by his second wife, Ida Fischer Alexander, two sons and one  daughter from his previous marriage, and two grandchildren.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli troops and allied Lebanese militiamen traded artillery fire with  pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim guerrillas in south Lebanon. Police said three  civilians and three militiamen were wounded. They said the brief exchange  flared after a 75-strong armored Israeli force and fighters of the  Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army entered the village of Dallafeh, just beyond  Israel's self-designated security zone, in search of pro-Iranian guerrillas.  Elsewhere, Muslim militiamen fired at least 20 rockets at Lebanon's Christian  port of Juniyah, radio stations reported. Security sources said the rockets  were aimed at stopping the passenger ferry service between Juniyah and Cyprus.  </P></p>

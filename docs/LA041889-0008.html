			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT VIOLATED RULES 69 TIMES, ETHICS PANEL SAYS  </P> <P> In an unprecedented action, the House Ethics Committee Monday unanimously  accused Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) of 69 violations of House rules for  allegedly accepting $145,000 in improper gifts from a Texas businessman and  using sales of a 1984 book to evade limits on outside income.  </P> <P> While leaders of the panel emphasized that Wright is yet to be proved guilty of  any wrongdoing, the 12-0 bipartisan vote to bring serious charges against the  Speaker was a heavy blow to his chances of retaining his leadership post.  </P> <P> As Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana,  the committee's ranking Republican, declared that partisan considerations  played no role in the decision, nine of the 10 other members of the panel sat  behind them on a podium with somber expressions.  </P> <P> It was the first time that a Speaker of the House, the nation's third-highest  elected official, has been charged with ethics violations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reasserts Innocence  </P> <P> A confident Wright, however, reasserted his innocence and asked the committee  to let him "confront these allegations head on, face to face" as soon as  possible. But in the wake of the panel's unanimous decision on the action, he  no longer could dismiss the charges as the work of Republican extremists, as he  tried to do a year ago.  </P> <P> "I know in my heart I have not violated any of the rules of that institution,"  Wright told a labor union convention after the report was released.  </P> <P> Dixon's announcement of the committee's conclusions completed the investigative  phase of an inquiry that was started last summer when Rep. Newt Gingrich  (R-Ga.) and Common Cause, a citizens' group, requested an examination of  Wright's conduct.  </P> <P> Based on testimony of 73 witnesses and thousands of documents, Dixon said, the  panel supported charges in these areas:  </P> <P>  -- Book. Wright allegedly schemed to avoid House limits on outside earnings by  promoting bulk sales of his 1984 book, "Reflections of a Public Man," to groups  that sought him for speaking engagements. In lieu of speaking fees, which are  restricted by House rules, Wright arranged bulk book sales to the groups and  then received royalties, which are not restricted. In at least one case, the  panel said, all the books bought were not even delivered to the purchaser.  </P> <P>  -- Gifts. From 1979 to 1988, the committee charged, Wright accepted nearly  $145,000 in gifts from Ft. Worth developer George A. Mallick Jr. in the form of  an $18,000 annual salary for his wife, Betty, for four years; use of a free or  reduced-rate apartment in Ft. Worth totaling another $53,488, and use and  upkeep from 1983 to 1988 of a 1979 Cadillac.  </P> <P> At the Capitol, Wright's attorney issued a point-by-point rebuttal of the  charges that acknowledged only possible "technical violations" of House  reporting rules and claimed that the committee was misinterpreting key  precedents.  </P> <P> One issue was not resolved by the panel's special counsel and was left open for  further investigation. It involves a complex oil well deal in which money  raised from a Texas firm was used to buy out Wright's share for $350,000, or  nearly six times his original investment.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that lawyers in the Justice  Department's criminal division are aware of the allegations and will review the  panel's entire report "line by line" to determine whether a criminal inquiry  might be warranted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Muted Reaction  </P> <P> Reaction in the House generally was muted, with Wright's Texas Democratic  colleagues brushing aside the allegations as frivolous and most Republicans and  Democrats noncommittal.  </P> <P> "I think it really is premature to start dancing on the Speaker's grave," said  Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.). "I think we all want to maintain a sense of  scrupulous fair play in this highly charged political situation."  </P> <P> But Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) urged that Wright step aside as Speaker while  the charges are pending, and Rep. Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) predicted that  Wright will be out of office by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Only the Speaker's Texas Democratic colleague, Rep. Charles Wilson, called the  announcement "a very positive" development for Wright. "Everybody expected it  to be very salacious and juicy -- and it wasn't," Wilson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defers Comment  </P> <P> Gingrich said he would hold a news conference later in the week to comment on  the results of the investigation that he initiated.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to have anything to say until I've read the full report," he  said.  </P> <P> His non-reaction was in keeping with the lower profile he has assumed in  connection with the Wright investigation since his Republican colleagues last  month elected him House minority whip.  </P> <P> The committee made public a 279-page report by its special counsel, Chicago  attorney Richard J. Phelan, summing up evidence gathered in a 10-month  investigation and listing other charges that the panel decided to dismiss.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Disclosures  </P> <P> It contained new disclosures that Wright's partnership with Mallick -- known as  Mallightco -- often was penalized for being late in paying its federal income  taxes and reported that the Speaker got more benefits from it than Mallick did.  </P> <P> Dixon indicated that the panel would follow regular procedures in hearing the  case against the Speaker before inviting him to make a personal defense of his  conduct over the last decade.  </P> <P> But negotiations were under way between the committee and Wright's attorney,  William C. Oldaker, to expedite the proceedings as the Speaker has requested.  </P> <P> Under House rules, the six Democrats and six Republicans on the committee  normally would conduct a public trial of Wright and decide whether the charges  that they have found "reason to believe" are true indeed are supported by  "clear and convincing evidence."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Set Penalty  </P> <P> If they find that the charges are proved, the committee then would decide what  penalty to recommend to the House, if any. Punishment could range from a fine  or reprimand to censure and, the ultimate sanction, expulsion from Congress.  </P> <P> Many members of the House, including senior Democrats, have said that they do  not believe the Speaker could keep his powerful leadership post if he received  a formal reprimand from his colleagues.  </P> <P> No Speaker has been the sole target of such an inquiry since the late 1800s,  although Wright's predecessor in the office, Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr.  (D-Mass.), was one of many persons mentioned in the 1977 Korean lobbying  scandal. He was not charged with an ethics violation, however.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wife Did Little Work  </P> <P> While Wright has maintained that his wife earned her pay and the other benefits  from her job with the Mallightco partnership, the committee said it found that  she did little work for the money.  </P> <P> "The issue is not whether a spouse can work but whether she did work and earned  the money," Dixon said.  </P> <P> By failing to disclose the gifts, the panel alleged, Wright broke House rules  concerning financial disclosure. It also found that Mallick's extensive  interests in real estate, oil and gas ventures and involvement with savings and  loan associations provided reason to believe that he has a "direct interest in  legislation" before Congress. Persons with such interests are barred from  bestowing gifts worth more than $100 a year to a member of Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Panel Split, 8-4  </P> <P> A list of votes released by the committee showed that the decision concerning  Mallick's "direct interest" was one of the most divisive, splitting the  committee, 8 to 4, with Democrats Chester G. Atkins of Massachusetts and  Bernard J. Dwyer of New Jersey joining the six Republicans to form the  majority.  </P> <P> On a later vote, however, all 12 members of the panel went on record in favor  of supporting the charge.  </P> <P> "Members of Congress do not exist in a vacuum and should be expected to have  personal friends with whom gifts can be exchanged," Dixon said in a statement  read at a news conference. "However, the nature and extent of the apparent  gifts from Mr. Mallick indicates that Rep. Wright did not exercise reasonable  care to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, which is the hallmark of the  House gift rule."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closest Vote 7-5  </P> <P> Other preliminary votes on whether bulk sales of Wright's book were improper  were decided mainly by 10-2 margins, with Democrats Alan B. Mollohan of West  Virginia and Joseph M. Gaydos of Pennsylvania in the minority. The closest vote  was 7 to 5, on a count related to a sale of books to the Fertilizer Institute.  There was a 12-0 vote, however, on the committee's finding that Wright  allegedly violated House rules by not reporting his wife's salary and other  benefits from Mallightco as gifts.  </P> <P> Dixon also noted that most of the allegations originally leveled against the  Speaker were dismissed by the committee, including some on which the special  counsel had recommended that charges be filed.  </P> <P> Wright was absolved for his controversial intervention with federal bank  regulators on behalf of two faltering Texas savings and loan associations, as  well as his intervention with other federal agencies on behalf of Texas oil and  gas companies.  </P> <P> "While the congressman's dealings with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may  have been intemperate, the committee was not persuaded that there is reason to  believe that he exercised undue influence in his dealings with that agency,"  Dixon said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use of Campaign Funds  </P> <P> The panel also threw out a charge that the Speaker used campaign funds to pay  for publishing his 1984 book and another contention -- raised by its special  counsel -- that Mrs. Wright allegedly benefited from a below-market interest  rate on a $75,000 loan from Mallick's wife through the partnership.  </P> <P> Another original charge against Wright when the panel began its inquiry last  June 9 -- that he improperly used a staff aide to help write his book -- also  was tossed out by the panel. It said that the aide only edited Wright's text  and could have done the work on his own time.  </P> <P> The remaining allegations were shaped primarily by the special counsel, Phelan,  who submitted his massive report to the panel on Feb. 21. He and Wright's  attorney spent nine days in briefing the committee on their differing views of  the case and the 12 members took another eight days to reach their conclusions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Reason to Believe'  </P> <P> "The statement of alleged violation . . . represents a determination by the  committee that in 69 instances, there is reason to believe that Representative  Wright violated the code of official conduct and other House rules which apply  to him as a member of Congress," Dixon said.  </P> <P> While the committee's major decisions were leaked in press accounts last week,  the number of alleged violations and the total amount of gifts did not come to  light until Monday, and they surprised some members.  </P> <P> Also surprising to many House members was the strong show of bipartisanship by  the committee, potentially complicating Democrats' hopes of limiting the  political damage and preserving Wright's speakership.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALK LIKE A MAN  </P> <P> Unfortunately for us all, women still do struggle to fit into a man's world.  But Littwin's use of an aerobics class to condemn this struggle further  exemplifies a self-defeating attitude. Is it that women do aerobics and men  make decisions in the board room? By her attacking her male counterpart in an  aerobics class (on her turf, so to speak) at best defies the basic concept of a  symmetry between men and women and at worst exemplifies a further separation of  the sexes, and by a woman, yet.  </P> <P> THOMAS CAMACHO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

According to Fujimori, the letter of intent to be signed  with  the IMF must contemplate the special emphasis the government  will give to investment in the social area.    He said: "Investment in the social area refers not only to  investment in the fields of health and education, but also to  improving the country's infrastructure, for example, by building  highways."    For this reason, we must hold discussions with the IMF, he  said. He added: "I am sure the IMF will understand the  government objectives because we have pointed them out very  clearly."    He said the first step was to implement an economic  stabilization program, and the second step was to establish  peace in the country. To implement these programs, however, "we  also must seek social stabilization," as already has been  explained to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus.    Fujimori said the social program is supported by the IMF,  cooperating countries, and international financial  organizations. This is why we want these issues to be included  in the letter of intent, he added.    The Peruvian president made these comments on 16 March while  visiting 1,400 members of the Ashaninka jungle tribe recently  rescued from the Shining Path terrorist group at Satipo, in  Peru's central jungle.    Economy Minister Jorge Camet pointed out that the government  plans to invest $450 million in the 1994 social support program.  He added that the IMF fears this large amount of money may force  the dollar rate down and reactivate inflation.    A three-member IMF delegation arrived in Lima on 17 March to  meet Fujimori and Camet.    Spanish Jose Luis Ruiz, a member of the delegation who will  stay in Peru for 15 days, said the delegation will analyze the  structure of the expenditures to be made by the government in  social programs.</p>

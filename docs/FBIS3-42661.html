For Now the Future Looks Better  Than the Present"]    [Text] Trade and economic cooperation with the United  States is the most politicized sphere of Russia's foreign  economic relations. The roots of this go back to the times of  the Cold War. In recent years quite a few attempts have been  made to rid ourselves of this heritage, and Bill Clinton's visit  to Moscow on Saturday may be considered one of the most  productive steps along this path. There is reason to hope that  the stereotype of relations between Russia and the United States  that has developed since the collapse of the USSR and is  characterized by various forms of economic assistance (for more  about this see KOMMERSANT for 14 January) from the United States  while Russia retains discrimination in trade, shall be replaced  by macroeconomic cooperation with equal rights. The term  "unstable balance" is quite appropriate for a more precise  definition of its current condition: This cooperation could  become significantly more active in the near future or it could  lapse into a condition of stagnation or even decline. The  situation before and after Clinton's visit to Moscow is analyzed  by KOMMERSANT observer Georgiy Bovt and correspondent Svetlana  Sukhova.  <H5>  Trade Has Not Yet Been Liberated From the Legacy of the Past </H5>   The condition of trade and economic cooperation between  Russia and the United States today leaves something to be  desired: America's share of Russia's foreign trade is only 2  percent. Commodity turnover at the end of 1993 reached $2.42  billion (Russian exports--$1.007 billion, imports--$1.418  billion). The basis of Russian exports is made up of raw  materials and certain agricultural products (grain, nonferrous  and precious metals, oil, and certain chemical commodities).  Imports are dominated by food and equipment. The figures for  1993 are not the worst of the indicators for recent years. The  deficit of the USSR and then Russia is an old affliction of  trade with the United States: In 1992 Russian imports exceeded  exports as much as 4.2-fold.    True, positive tendencies have also appeared recently. This  pertains to the gradual elimination of discriminatory  restrictions in trade with Russia. For the first time since 1951  Moscow was offered most favored nation status (MFN), and bans  and limits on credit through the Commodity-Credit Corporation  and Ex-Im Bank were removed, as were restrictions on services of  the federal Overseas Private Investment Corporation--OPIC. It is  permitted to use preferential credit under the program "Food for  Progress" and the Law "On Contributing to Reform in New  Democratic Countries" has been adopted (70 restrictions  established for "communist countries" have been removed). With  input from the United States the reform of Cocom [Coordinating  Committee on Multilateral Export Controls] began--albeit late.  This makes it possible for Russia to hope to gain access to  science-intensive technologies. During the summer Clinton  promised (and Moscow again repeated this promise) to extend to  Moscow the Generalized System of Preferences, which will make it  possible to abolish customs duties on 5,000 kinds of goods.  Russia is also promised certain advantages by the creation of  the North American Free Trade Zone (NAFTA) and the promise from  the United States (documented in Moscow) to contribute to its  entry into GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade].    Restrictions on American agricultural exports have been  removed more dynamically. Since 1991 grain has been delivered to  Russia under special credit programs which, as distinct from the  five-year agreement between the USSR and the United States of  1990 (strict minimal volumes of annual purchases were stipulated  there), leaves a great deal of freedom for the importer to  maneuver. True, last year Russia ran up a heavy debt for  agricultural credit (at one time the debt exceeded $500  million). Active discussions in Moscow about the need to curtail  agricultural imports in general moved the United States to make  a number of compromises and in June 1993 conclude four new  agreements for the delivery of agricultural products to Russia  within the framework of the "Food for Progress" program.  Deliveries began in September 1993.    At the same time many discriminatory restrictions are still  in force. The infamous Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which links the  granting of most favored nation status to free immigration, has  not been abolished. Although the President has suspended it  since 1992 (and since 1990--with respect to agricultural trade),  Congress can restore it fully at any time. And there are also  many other obstacles to trade. The United States has one of the  strictest systems of antidumping legislation in the world. In  1993 a quota was introduced on imports of ferrosilicon from  Russia and there is the threat that similar measures may be  introduced for aluminum, steel, and potassium chloride. True,  the negotiations at the Moscow summit give certain justification  for assuming that the U.S. administration will not be in any  hurry with such measures. And among their experts, voices are  being heard ever more loudly (while, true, they have not  prevailed) saying that antidumping provisions concerning "unfair  competition" should not be applied to Russia at all during the  transition period. There is a precedent already: A decision was  adopted in Moscow to give Russia guaranteed access to the  American uranium market for 20 years (the planned profit from  this transaction is $12 billion). And even earlier, in December,  as a result of the work of the Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission many  disputed issues related to interaction between the two countries  on the space services market were resolved.  <H5>  Investment Cooperation </H5>   Still the future of economic cooperation between Russia and  the United States lies not in the sphere of basic buying and  selling and, of course, not in the expansion of assistance to  Russia from the United States. It is no accident that during the  course of the summit in Moscow a leitmotif of the speeches of  Russian representatives was the idea of the need not only for  Russia's access to the U.S. market, but also for an increase in  private American investments in Russia. Their actual level today  cannot be called satisfactory. According to figures of the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia, U.S.  businessmen have invested only $400 million in the Russian  economy. And in the Hungarian economy--$2.5 billion. The  Americans explain their passivity by the "high risk related to  the political instability." Although firms from the United  States are even the leaders among Western investors in the  creation of joint ventures in Russia--there are already 1,400 of  them.    But capital investments in Russia cannot even be called  completely private because they are backed by the federal  government in the form, for example, of the OPIC or the Ex-Im  Bank. When granting guarantees (like the federal OPIC) or credit  (like, again, the state Ex-Im Bank--$2 billion for the  development of the petroleum and gas complex) they protect the  private investor from that very "political risk in Russia." And  therefore--with such a marked role of the  administration--economic cooperation is still far from being  completely depoliticized. Obviously it will still depend for a  long time on decisions made within bilateral governmental  commissions--such, for example, as the Gore-Chernomyrdin  Commission. A great deal will also depend on representative  associations of businessmen of a lobbyist bent--like the  American Chamber of Commerce that was opened in Moscow during  the summit (it unites 150 U.S. firms operating in Russia).    The potential for investment cooperation looks quite  optimistic. According to information from the data bank of the  EAST EUROPEAN INVESTMENT MAGAZINE, the overall volume of  declared American private investments during the past four years  exceeded $4 billion (of the $8.9 billion for the 10 leading  Western countries). This sum was distributed among 207 bilateral  projects. The most widespread form of introduction of U.S.  businessmen to the Russian market is the creation of joint  ventures (70 percent of all the projects and 90 percent of the  volume of declared investments). True, it is alarming that the  growth rate of the number of declared projects was highest in  1992 and then dropped off. Obviously, in the near future it will  become clear how successful they are at dispelling the  misgivings caused by the political instability in Russia.    In 1993 several U.S. firms included on the FORTUNE 500 List  simultaneously announced their intentions to make investments:  Cummins created a joint venture with KAMAZ for producing  engines; Exxon, Amoco, and Conoco began to penetrate the Russian  petroleum and gas complex. It inspires hope that in 1993 they  announced the largest number of projects in the areas of  computers and telecommunications in recent years (the removal of  the Cocom restrictions makes conditions even more favorable for  new ones). Investors' interest in the Russian aerospace complex  also increased last year (nine projects were earmarked).    But the petroleum and gas complex continues to be as juicy a  morsel as it was before. According to estimates of the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations, Russia's minimum need for credits  for its modernization is now no less than $18 billion, and the  maximum (spread over 10 years)--up to $300 billion. After the  abolition of the Byrd-Stevenson Amendment in 1992, which set a  ceiling of $300 million on the overall volume of credits to  Russia from the Ex-Im Bank (with 40 million--for energy  projects), the Ex-Im Bank along with the World Bank has already  allotted more than $2 billion for the development of the  petroleum and gas branch.    The realization of the potential for economic cooperation  will depend, of course, on the success of the reforms in Russia.  The question of creating favorable tax and other conditions for  foreign companies is still crucial. So far guarantees from the  Russian government to Americans are being replaced by guarantees  of the OPIC, which intends to help in the creation of an  independent Russian organization for insurance against political  risk.    The United States has not freed itself (and is not likely to  free itself) from the "missionary component" in its foreign  economic policy. Questions of human rights and also political  interaction with Russia on such global problems as the  conditions for nonproliferation of missile and dual-use  technologies, actions with respect to "terrorist regimes," etc.  will inevitably influence economic relations with Moscow. At  least until the purely economic interests and investments of the  United States in Russia reach a level that would enable them to  rise above the political conditions.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) of 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. Sections 1401  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , gives the Administrator of EPA authority to designate sites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where ocean dumping may be permitted. On October 1, 1986 the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator delegated authority to designate ocean dredged material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal sites (ODMDS) to the Regional Administrator of the EPA Region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which the sites are located. The SF&hyph;DODS designation action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being made pursuant to that authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR 228.4) state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ocean dumping sites will be designated by publication pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR part 228. This site designation is being published as final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking in accordance with &sect;228.4(e) of the Ocean Dumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations, which permits the designation of ocean disposal sites for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredged material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The center of the SF&hyph;DODS is located approximately 49 nautical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate and occupies an area of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depths within the area range between approximately 8,200 to 9,840 feet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates of the oval-shaped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site are: 37 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;39.0 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; North latitude by  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 123 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;29.0 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; West longitude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> width (west-east axis) dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 kilometers),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. EPA Region IX now designates SF&hyph;DODS as an ocean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredged material disposal site for continued use for a period of 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, with an interim capacity of 6 million cubic yards of dredged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material per calendar year until December 31, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Site use is subject to implementation of the specific site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management and monitoring requirements contained in this Final Rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are now identified as the Site Monitoring and Management Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SMMP) for the SF&hyph;DODS. The Proposed Rule designating the SF&hyph;DODS did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not set forth specific management and monitoring requirements in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule itself. Instead, Region 9 had proposed that provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning site management and monitoring would be contained in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate Site Management and Monitoring Plan (SMMP) document. Though  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this separate SMMP document would not, strictly, have been part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule designating the SF&hyph;DODS, Region 9 did signal its intent in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preamble accompanying the Proposed Rule that implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the SMMP document would have been mandatory. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule specifically would have required that the SMMP be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented as a condition of site use. Comments received on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed Rule have convinced Region 9 that the mandatory nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site management and monitoring would be placed on a clearer legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> footing if the SMMP were made a part of the Rule instead of being set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in a separate planning document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SMMP provisions in the Final Rule are closely related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Region 9's previous proposals on site monitoring and management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposals have been put forth for public review and comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least two occasions. First, Region 9 outlined its proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning site monitoring and management in the Preamble accompanying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Proposed Rule designating the SF-DODS. Region 9 published the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 7952), and held open a public comment period on the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until March 18, 1994. Second, Region 9 completed a draft of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate SMMP document and made this document available for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review and comment. Region 9 published this SMMP document as an EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Notice on April 20, 1994 and accepted comments on this document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until June 6, 1994. The SMMP provisions in the Final Rule were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafted after considering the public comment received in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Proposed Rule Preamble and the SMMP document.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Responses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments, Section F. below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Region 9 is also preparing a Site Management and Monitoring Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation Manual (SMMP Implementation Manual). This manual will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide detailed guidance on practical aspects of implementing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SMMP provisions in the Final Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. EIS Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 102(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1969, 42 U.S.C. Sections 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., requires that Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on proposals for major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment. The object of NEPA is to build into the agency decision-making process careful consideration of all environmental aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed actions, including evaluation of reasonable alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS was published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 11, 1992 discussing EPA's intent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designate a deep water ocean dredged material disposal site off San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Francisco (57 FR 58805). The Draft EIS, titled: Draft Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact Statement (EIS) for San Francisco Bay Deep Water Dredged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Material Disposal Site Designation, evaluated a range of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative disposal sites as summarized below. The comment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed on January 25, 1993. EPA received 35 comment letters on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draft EIS and incorporated changes where appropriate. On September  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10, 1993, notice of availability for public review and comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Final EIS was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 47741). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period for the Final EIS closed on October 29, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> EIS Alternatives Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several million cubic yards of dredged material are generated annually in the San Francisco Bay area. Traditionally, most of this dredged material has been disposed at sites within the San Francisco Bay estuary. However, existing upland and in-bay sites have limited capacity for disposal of large volumes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dredged material, and concerns about the potential environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of continued large-scale disposal within the estuary have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grown steadily in recent years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's analysis of alternatives included detailed examination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several potential ocean dump sites for dredged materials from San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Francisco Bay and a preliminary, less-detailed review of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative means of handling these dredged materials other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal at an ocean dump site. For EPA's present purposes, a limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of alternatives to ocean dumping of dredged materials was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. EPA needed only to determine whether alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ocean dumping now appear to offer sufficient capacity for all dredged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material that will be generated in the future. Greater detail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning alternatives to ocean dumping of dredged material is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary at this stage because designation of an ocean dumping site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 40 CFR part 228 is essentially a preliminary, planning-like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure. The practical effect of such a designation is only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that if future ocean dumping activity is permitted under 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 227, such dumping should normally be consolidated at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated site. Designation of an ocean dumping site does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize any actual dumping and does not preclude EPA or the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Army Corps of Engineers from finding that alternative means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managing dredged materials from San Francisco Bay are available and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally preferable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sunset + Vine Sunset + Vine, the television programming and video group, reported profits of Pounds 329,000 pre-tax for the six months to December 31 - a decline of 9 per cent on the comparable Pounds 363,000. Mr Colin Frewin, chief executive, blamed the shortfall on reduced interest income - down from Pounds 89,000 to Pounds 18,000 - and 'temporary adverse cashflows' on sponsored series. These had since been reversed, he added. Cash balances at the period-end were in excess of Pounds 1.1m. Turnover dipped to Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 2.46m). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p, payable from earnings of 4.2p (4.6p).</p>

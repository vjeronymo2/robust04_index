			<p>BFN     [Text] An ASEAN meeting next month will discuss North  Korea's refusal to let international inspectors into its nuclear  plants, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said yesterday.    Speaking to reporters upon arriving at Don Muang Airport  from  a visit to South Korea, Chuan said leaders of the ASEAN  (Association of Southeast Nations) countries will convene a  meeting next month and will discuss the issue.    Chuan he said the tension would ease now that South and  North  Koreas had agreed in principle to conduct a meeting over the  issue.    The United States has accused North Korea of using its  nuclear programme to produce weapons, a charge Pyongyang has  denied.    A growing international crisis over the nuclear programme  eased after North Korea promised to halt the programme in return  for a resumption of high-level talks with the United States.    On Friday, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said a  meeting between President Clinton and North Korean leader Kim  ll-song was possible if North Korea's behaviour merits it.</p>

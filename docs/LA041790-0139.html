			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MIKE WALLACE TO TURN ZESTFUL 72  </P> <P> Mike Wallace, veteran correspondent for CBS' "60 Minutes," turns 72 on May 9  but says, "I've got the zest, the energy I've always had."  </P> <P> And age can help, he told TV Guide in its April 21 issue.  </P> <P> "I'm old enough and experienced enough so that people are more willing to talk  more openly to me than they used to be," he said.  </P> <P> "There's been a strange difference in the last few years in the manner an  interview with me is perceived. I'm considered less of a threat."  </P> <P> He said he can feel sorry for colleagues trying to start a television news  magazine: "When I started with '60 Minutes' in 1968, no one was watching. That  took away a lot of pressure."  </P></p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / 53,000 council jobs 'lost last year' ABOUT 53,000 local government jobs were lost last year, statistics prepared by the Local Authority Joint Staffing Watch show. Moves to save jobs this year, such as the deal between unions and Sheffield City Council, where unions traded a pay cut for jobs, are likely to be limited because most councils have set their budgets and made their plans for 1993-94. But the labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said yesterday that more councils and unions might move in that direction in 1993-94. In Sheffield nearly 20,000 employees voted to take a pay cut in exchange for shorter working hours to stop the city council making 1,400 of them redundant. According to the Local Authority Joint Staffing Watch's statistics more than 31,000 jobs were lost to local authorities in 1991 and 39,000 last year. In 1989 there was no real change. It is understood that a greater percentage of last year's job losses were white-collar than in the past. Mr Stephen Bubb, secretary of the AMA, said that last year's job losses confirmed his worst fears. 'We believe that up to 100,000 more local government jobs will be lost in the next 18 months,' he said. Most councils have now set their budgets and made plans for redundancies based on the government's desired 1.5 per cent pay ceiling for public sector workers. The Local Government Management Board, the employers' organisation, said it did not believe that Sheffield would set a precedent. 'There were unique circumstances in Sheffield,' it said. It is understood that a majority of councils have had informal talks with unions over pay freezes, but no agreements have been reached. According to the Local Government Chronicle the 1.5 per cent pay limit is forcing councils to renegotiate contracts with employees who have index-linked pay. A number of councils, including Bracknell Forest Borough Council, introduced index linked pay for some groups of workers affected by compulsory competitive tendering.</p>

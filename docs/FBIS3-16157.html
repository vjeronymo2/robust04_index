His automobile was shot at and  then blown up. Fortunately, Borovoy managed to get out of the  automobile before the explosion. Sergey Dadyko with the details.    [Dadyko] Two hours ago and straight after his arrival from  Yaroslavl, Konstantin Borovoy gave the details of the attempt to  kill him. Shots were fired into the right-hand side of the  windshield of his Mercedes, after which Borovoy, who was at the  wheel, veered left into a ditch. A second later he jumped out  into the snow, and after that came the explosion.    Police have begun an investigation, and in the burned-out  automobile found eight bullets from an automatic weapon and  grenade fragments. But the question of who fired on him remains  unanswered.    [Borovoy] You understand, there are not many people like me,  if you take an unbiased look at me. I have often spoken out in  various ways. You know what I said about the exchanges. I was  very outspoken about Lipetsk. But I do not think this was a  political event. I reckon it was just small-time thugs.</p>

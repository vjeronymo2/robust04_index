			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD SELLS OFF ROUGE STEEL, CREATES HOLDING COMPANY  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that it agreed to sell its Rouge Steel Co. to an  investor group that includes a retired chief operating officer of Weirton  Steel.  </P> <P> Few details of the deal, including the price, were released. Ford Vice  President Peter Pestillo said he hoped that the deal could be completed by the  end of the year.  </P> <P> Separately, the auto maker said it has formed a holding company to dull the  potential tax sting of its pending acquisition of the Associates finance  company.  </P> <P> The value of the move can't be determined precisely, but an analyst says it may  be worth millions to the nation's most profitable auto maker.  </P> <P> The creation of Ford Holdings Inc. and the sale of 25% of it for $800 million  to institutional investors should deflect some of the taxes related to Ford's  acquisition of Associates, Ford officials said.  </P> <P> In a complicated procedure involving seldom-used provisions of the 1986 tax law  and foreign tax credits, Ford is avoiding the potential taxes by owning less  than 80% of the holding company.  </P> <P> Rumors about the potential sale of Rouge have been circulating for years,  intensifying in the past several months.  </P> <P> Pestillo said Rouge Steel operations would continue "substantially as we know  them today." He said he anticipated no change in size of the work force --  about 3,300 hourly employees and 750 salaried workers.  </P> <P> A Ford statement said the auto maker signed the agreement with Marico  Acquisition Co. Marico, formed solely for the acquisition of the 65-year-old  steel-making business, is headed by Carl L. Valdiserri, the former Weirton  Steel executive. Valdiserri could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Ford and Marico would be among a small number of equity partners, Ford  spokesman Bill Carroll said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by </F> unidentified STANDART NEWS reporter; place and date not given:  "International Community's Sanctions Against Serbia Must Also  Affect Kosovo, Krajina, and Sandzak...."]    [Text] [STANDART NEWS] What is Albania's policy regarding  Albanian minorities in other countries?    [Serreqi] Albania issued several official announcements to  the fact that it respects the borders of its neighbors and  opposes any change in them by force. However, we are greatly  concerned by the conditions under which the Albanian minorities  in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM], and especially in Kosovo, live. We demand that their  normal human and national rights are respected. They must have  the democratic possibility to express their opinion.    [STANDART NEWS] If the conflict in Bosnia is resolved, will  Serbian aggression in Kosovo follow?    [Serreqi] I think that the crisis in the former Yugoslav  Federation has many aspects. The fighting in Bosnia is the  gravest and most tragic aspect, but the conflict also has other  dimensions. One of them is Kosovo. If the conflict spreads  there, it will affect the entire Balkan peninsula.    This is precisely why we insist on the deployment of  international observers in Kosovo. They would prevent the  expansion of the conflict and facilitate the discussion about  Kosovo's official status. We think that the first thing that  must be done is to return to the Albanians in Kosovo the rights  and autonomy that the Constitution of 1974 guaranteed them.    [STANDART NEWS] Do you want the restoration of that  constitution?    [Serreqi] No. The Albanians in Kosovo must discuss the  future of their region, but this is where the discussion must  start. It is unacceptable to speak about another autonomy,  which will not even guarantee the conditions provided by the  older constitutions.    Thus, if the peace process progresses, then the sanctions  and  all measures of the international community vis-a-vis Serbia  must be connected not only to Bosnia but also to the other  crisis areas -- Kosovo, Krajina, Vojvodina, Sandzak....    [STANDART NEWS] What could you say about the Serbian protest  against your proposal? They think that Kosovo is their internal  matter.    [Serreqi] Kosovo is not an internal Serbian problem, because  it is not an integral part of their country. This is not even a  regional, but rather an international issue. An Albanian  Government cannot decide whether there should be an intervention  or not. However, the Albanians will react on a national basis,  because the people in Kosovo are a physical part of Albania.    [STANDART NEWS] Do you maintain any contacts with Rugova --  the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo,  recognized only by Albania?    [Serreqi] We maintain constant contacts. The Albanians in  Kosovo demonstrated their civilized character by silently  withstanding the terrible pressure and the violation of human  rights. The tension reached a critical level about one year  ago, when the Serbian expelled the CSCE observers from the  region. Despite this Rugova and the other leaders continue to  control the situation. However, we are concerned, because the  people there feel abandoned.    [STANDART NEWS] Could you comment on the rumors that Albania  supported a coup attempt on the part of the Macedonian  Albanians, revealed four months ago by the government in Skopje?    [Serreqi] Albania was among the first countries which  recognized Macedonia. We are convinced that this country's  sovereignty is in the foundation of the region's stability. We  are prepared to help Macedonia to endure more easily the  consequences of the Greek sanctions.    However, it is obvious that our relations with Macedonia are  connected with the situation of the Albanian minority there,  which is about 35 percent of the population. I am sure that the  Macedonian Government could and should do more for the  Albanians' rights.    [STANDART NEWS] Could you nevertheless compare the rights of  the Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo?    [Serreqi] Of course, the situation is not identical. The  Albanians in Kosovo are subjected to horrible repressions.  Nevertheless, I think that the Albanians in Macedonia must  acquire the status of "first class" citizens -- as all the rest.  Macedonia should be declared a multinational status. It is  very suited for this. After all, Bulgarians, Macedonians,  Albanians, Serbs, and Greeks live there.</p>

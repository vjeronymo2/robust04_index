			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Insolvency ruling 'puts jobs at risk' The administrators to Paramount Airways, the insolvent charter airline, are set to fight an Appeal Court ruling which could jeopardise tens of thousands of jobs at companies in financial difficulties. Insolvency practitioners warned yesterday that the ruling was likely to lead to substantial job losses for employees in the thousands of companies entering administration or administrative receivership each year. The Appeal Court has ruled that where an administrator or receiver continues for more than 14 days after his appointment to employ staff and pay them, he in effect adopts their existing contracts of employment. Insolvency practitioners said the ruling could result in substantial additional claims on the assets of an insolvent company to meet the employment costs, which would have to be paid before any money would go to other creditors. Practitioners warned that they were likely to lay off many more staff rather than risk being held personally liable for additional costs of meeting redundancy or unfair and wrongful dismissal claims. Mr Robin Tutty a partner of City solicitors Fox Williams said the ruling 'drives a coach and horses through receivership practice over the past five years'. The 1986 Insolvency Act makes administrators and receivers personally liable on all contracts 'adopted' by them. Since 1987 they have relied on the Specialised Mouldings case as authority for saying they can avoid liability if, during the 14-day period, they write a letter to employees disclaiming liability for existing contracts. Paramount's administrators, Mr Roger Powdrill and Mr Joseph Atkinson of accountants Touche Ross, wrote such a letter within the 14-day period, but Lord Justice Dillon said their assertion that they were not adopting the contracts was 'a mere wind with no legal effect'. The judge said where administrators and receivers 'substantially continued after 14 days to employ staff and pay them in accordance with previous contracts, they would be held impliedly to have adopted those contracts'. Mr Tutty said the ruling could result in claims against receivers stretching back over seven years and running into millions of pounds. The immediate effect of the judgment would be that receiverships would dry up. Receivers would not risk liability by continuing to trade and as it was unlikely that banks would want to indemnify receivers against potential liability, receivers would have little alternative but to lay off staff. Mr Powdrill refused to comment on the details of the case but said it was a 'terrible decision' for the 'rescue culture' - the recent emphasis in legislation on creating mechanisms to prevent companies from failing. He added: 'There are very big sums involved.' It is believed that the Paramount creditors' committee will next week be asked to approve a decision to apply for leave to appeal to the House of Lords. In the Paramount case, the costs of taking on existing employees' rights of the pilots to the company are estimated to add Pounds 600,000 to be paid out before other creditors could receive any money.</p>

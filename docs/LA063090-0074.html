			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: LAKE CASITAS;  </P> <P> PLANT PROPOSAL WORRIES NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> A proposed water treatment and hydropower plant below Lake Casitas Dam is  alarming some area residents who fear changes to their quiet, rural  neighborhood. Others are concerned about the plant's cost.  </P> <P> About 20 people expressed their concerns at a Casitas Municipal Water District  meeting earlier this week on the proposed $25-million plant, which would cost  about $600,000 annually to operate. The meeting was held in Oak View to gather  input on what issues should be studied in the environmental impact report and  economic analysis of the project. The $117,000 report is expected to be  released in November.  </P> <P> Richard Barnett, the district's chief engineer, said the CMWD has exhausted all  other ways to treat the lake water and must build the plant as soon as  possible. The state Department of Health Services ordered the CMWD three years  ago to meet state and federal water quality standards by 1992.  </P> <P> Sediment in the lake water, which is used for drinking water, has topped  allowable levels for three months a year since 1988, Barnett said. The dirt and  clay particles pose a health hazard because they insulate bacteria from the  current chlorine disinfection method, he said.  </P> <P> The new plant would filter 32 million gallons of water a day. Pat Baggerly of  the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County asked CMWD scientists to, among  other things, keep ozone and other chemical discharges from the plant from  polluting the environment.  </P> <P> Casitas Springs resident Barbara Garcia Weed said her neighbors are forming a  task force to monitor the project's studies. "The plant's going to be sitting  there basically in our back yard," she said, voicing concerns about noise,  heavy truck traffic, earthquake safety and wildlife disruption.  </P> <P> The water district sells water to 14 other agencies to serve 55,000 residents  throughout the Ojai Valley, western Ventura and the northwestern corner of  Ventura County.

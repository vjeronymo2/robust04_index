			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Serious setback for Major as Clarke drops fuel tax rise The government's Budget strategy was in disarray last night after a rebellion by more than a dozen backbench Conservatives forced the abandonment of the planned second stage of value added tax on domestic heating fuel. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced the humiliating climbdown after Labour won a majority of eight for a motion paving the way for a fresh debate on VAT during the passage of the finance bill, which implements the Budget. In an attempt to forestall an adverse reaction from the financial markets, Mr Clarke said he would announce tomorrow how the government plans to plug a Pounds 1bn hole in the Budget arithmetic opened up by the vote. 'On Thursday I will announce a package of spending and taxation measures designed to keep borrowing on course and to maintain confidence in the strong recovery of this country,' he said. Financial markets had been nervous ahead of last night's vote and in the aftermath of the government's defeat sterling edged lower against the dollar. In early Asian trading today the UK currency was at Dollars 1.5585 after finishing in New York at Dollars 1.56225 and in London at Dollars 1.5631. The British Chamber of Commerce urged market caution, saying the vote need not derail recovery. The defeat is a serious blow for Mr John Major, who had hoped the vote would mark the beginning of a period of political calm. Some MPs said it cast doubt over the government's ability to last a full parliamentary term. Labour demanded Mr Clarke's immediate resignation. Shouting over cheering opposition MPs, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the Commons had 'spoken for the country against a government that is both discredited and no longer in control'. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the chancellor's decision to abandon the second stage increase, which would have raised the rate from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent, was the 'absolute minimum' he could have done. 'Even that will not be enough to persuade the people of Britain that this is anything but a divided, discredited and dying government,' he said. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Major had 'lost the confidence of the House, the support of his party and the trust of the country. There is only one way for them to go and that is out'. The opposition victory followed a desperate late night Commons offer by Mr Clarke of an extra Pounds 120m in compensation for pensioners. However, the gesture persuaded only a couple of rebel Tories to fall back into line. After a rowdy debate, marked by frequent interruptions from the chancellor's own side, seven Conservatives voted with Labour and eight abstained. The 10 unionist MPs from Ulster, who normally back the government, voted with the opposition. In a sign of deepening backbench bitterness, eight of the nine Tory MPs who lost or resigned the party whip after last week's revolt on UK contributions to the EU rebelled again. Mr Nicholas Winterton, one of the suspended MPs, said he had no regrets. 'It was not a pleasant thing to do but it was the right thing to do. This measure was going against the Conservative party's policies.' Mr Richard Shepherd, another rebel on both issues, said the VAT rise was 'a regressive tax, which means that poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. That is against Tory philosophy'. Mr John Carlisle, a right-winger who voted against Labour, said the government's position was 'extremely' serious. 'In shooting terms it is a winged bird, waiting to be picked up or put out of its misery. We are in a crisis,' he said. Other senior Tories put a brave face on the defeat. Mr Kenneth Baker, a former party chairman who attacked the cabinet's handling of recent events at the weekend, said the government's position was 'difficult' but not irrecoverable. However, Mr Baker said the result emphasised the need to bring the Euro rebels back inside the parliamentary party. 'They must be reconciled to the party as soon as possible,' he said. The revolt followed a day of frantic efforts by senior ministers and government whips to rally support for the VAT changes, as contradictory rumours about the extent of the rebellion swept the corridors of Westminster. Amid rising fears in Downing Street that Labour would succeed in forcing the withdrawal of the increase, Mr Major flew home early from the European security conference in Budapest to direct the government's fightback. The prime minister saw Mr Clarke immediately on his return to London as Tory whips warned that the outcome of the vote was 'on a knife edge'. Mr Clarke and Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, spent most of the afternoon locked in meetings with rebellious backbenchers. In a highly unusual move, the chancellor even telephoned Mr Geoffrey Dickens, a seriously ill Conservative backbencher, to gauge his support. In the end, Mr Dickens was paired with an opposition MP. As the day wore on, even government loyalists grumbled about the handling of the VAT controversy. One MP, normally a strong supporter of Mr Major, said the issue had been handled with 'all the guile of a newt'. Few were willing to go as far as Sir George Gardiner, the rightwing MP for Reigate, who claimed in an article in The Times that the cabinet had brought the Conservative party 'to the brink of disaster'. Mr Major's supporters had hoped that victory in last night's vote would clear the way for a less febrile period after recent rebellions on Europe and Post Office privatisation, and speculation about a leadership challenge.

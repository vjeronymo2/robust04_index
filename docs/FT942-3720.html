			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Mexico peace plan starts in south The Mexican government will begin unilaterally to implement the local economic programmes proposed in its peace offer to the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas, despite their overwhelming rejection of the plan at the weekend. Efforts to try to implement the programmes, aimed at improving the lot of the indigenous people in the impoverished southern state, will be made in areas not under rebel control. The move is seen as an attempt to show the Zapatistas that the government is serious about making good on its offers, as well as to isolate the rebels from potential supporters in surrounding areas. The rebels are already in a very weak position militarily, virtually surrounded by the Mexican army which has been ordered to reinforce its patrols in the area. In rejecting the government's peace offer and seeking a new round of talks, the Zapatistas said their main concern was that their national demands for a democratic transition in the country had not been met. Since the beginning of negotiations, the government has said such issues would be taken up not with armed insurgents but with the country's political parties. A recent overhaul of the nation's electoral system, spurred by events in Chiapas but negotiated by the government and political parties in Mexico City, seems not to have satisfied the Zapatistas. The problem of the rebels is thus unlikely to be resolved before the national elections in August, as the two sides appear to disagree on the basic issue of how much say the insurgents should have over issues of national scope, principally democracy. 'We still do not have definitive accords, but the ceasefire has been consolidated and the commitment to search for a political decision in favour of peace is maintained,' said Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the government's peace negotiator. However, the government has failed in one of its main objectives - to disarm the rebels before the elections - and it will be up to the next president to grapple with the problem.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Newspapers focus their  attention today on the social and economic problems of Russia.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Sergey Glazyev,  chairman of the State Duma committee on the economic policy. He  believes that "the president's new economic policy was left  unnoticed by the government." He writes: "A draft agreement on  the establishment of civil peace, submitted for discussion by  the working group, does not contain any specific proposals in  the economic sphere, which threatens to turn the crucially  important process of achieving accord in society on the key  directions of the country's home and foreign policy into another  formal function, which can only discredit the idea of the  establishment of civil peace in Russia, for which our society  has suffered so much."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an article which explains to the  readers such notions as the subsistence level, the poverty line  and the minimal consumer breadbasket. "The cost of the consumer  breadbasket in Russia was 40,000 roubles in March this year,  while the per capita subsistence level was about 60,000 roubles  in the same month. In January 1993 35.5 per cent of Russian  citizens had money incomes below the subsistence level. The  figure for December 1993 was 26.7 per cent, and for March 1994  -- 17.5 per cent. In 1993 13 per cent of the country's  population had incomes, which were smaller than the cost of the  minimal set of basic foodstuffs. The figure for the first  quarter of 1994 was 6 per cent."    The newspaper explains such a wide range of criteria for  determining the living standards of Russians by the fact that at  present there is no law on the subsistence level. "Four versions  of the draft law on the subsistence level, which explain the  term in this or that way, have been submitted for consideration  to the State Duma committee on social issues. Meanwhile, our  incomes are compared either with the subsistence level, or with  the cost of the consumer breadbasket, when our living standards  are determined," the newspaper writes.    TRUD carries an article dealing with the economic reform in  Russia, which is entitled "delayed-action mine". "The excessive  stratification of society is creating a serious threat for the  reform. When the difference in wages between the `upper' and  `lower' groups reaches 40 times, it will mean the end to the  Russian reform. The growing non-payment of wages is aggravating  the situation. A total amount of the non-paid wages, which was  increasing from one month to the next, reached two trillion 374  billion roubles by April 1. Some 20 million people have not  received the wages that are due to them."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publishes an article under the headline "How  the Black Sea Fleet should be divided." It analyses the  agreement on the stage-by-stage settlement of problems of the  Black Sea Fleet, which was signed recently. "Will the agreement  boost cooperation, or will it become a mine laid under  Russian-Ukrainian relations? Ten days, set by the agreement  which was signed on April 15, are expiring, but there is no  mechanism of the division of the fleet in a new proportion.  Dificulties are sure to emerge when the sides start to  determine what part of the fleet will go to each of the sides.  First, it is difficult to say how many of the fleet's ships will  make 15-20 per cent. Second, Ukraine is not going to take into  account in the negotiating process the part of the fleet, which  it has already appropriated unilaterally and which includes  several ships and about 60 units and facilities of the Black Sea  Fleet."    PRAVDA carries an article about the Bosnian crisis. It  criticises Russian diplomacy in the Balkan peninsula and points  out that "the proparanda uproar about the recent accomplishments  of Moscow diplomats in the Bosnian conflict is intended for  naive people. The game has long been played on a different  field... Russia actually has no policy in the Balkan peninsula."    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA frontpages an article about the birth  anniversary of Vladimir Lenin. The newspaper writes that the  Lenin mausoleum will be opened on April 22.</p>

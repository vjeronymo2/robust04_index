			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] There was no peace in the Travnik municipality  today. The Serb-chetnik aggressors are firing shells of the  largest caliber at civilian targets in the town and its suburbs.  The aggressors also shelled defense lines in the Turbe area and  launched combined infantry and artillery attacks on the Vlasic  plateau. Five civilians were killed and a number wounded by  howitzer and tank fire from enemy strongholds. As we file this  report at 1850 the combined artillery and infantry attacks are  still going on at 1850. [passage omitted]</p>

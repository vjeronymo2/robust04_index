			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / MEPs aim to bolster animal test curbs MEMBERS of the European Parliament will vote today to toughen rules on cosmetics testing on animals. MEPs want to prevent EC cosmetics manufacturers conducting such tests from the year 2000. But the European Commission has said it will not back the parliament's attempt to strengthen a delicate compromise on the issue, agreed by member states last November. EC ministers agreed unanimously to ban cosmetic tests on animals from January 1 1998. However, if alternative testing methods have not been developed by 1997, the ban could be postponed for at least two years. That deal has not satisfied many MEPs and animal welfare groups. They believe it could lead to a ban being postponed indefinitely. Today's vote is on amendments which would toughen the directive by restricting any delay to a maximum of two years, and extending the measure to prevent duplication of animal testing. For example, cosmetics companies would not be allowed to test ingredients on animals if such tests had already been carried out for other purposes, even under non-EC legislation. The parliament introduced the idea of a ban last summer, by amending a directive on the free movement of cosmetics. But without the support of the Commission it will be unable to force a change to last November's compromise. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, consumer affairs commissioner, told MEPs yesterday that the Commission would try to make the process of assessing alternative tests more transparent. But she said Brussels could not support proposals to limit any delay to two years, as they would jeopardise ministerial agreement on the rest of the measure.</p>

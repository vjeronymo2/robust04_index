At a news conference today on the results of the trip, the  minister stressed he came to Sakhalin to acquaint himself with  the work of the Interior Ministry bodies in the island oblast  and to resolve the question of giving aid to the leadership of  the oblast's directorate of internal affairs. The minister  announced that in accordance with the results of a check that  was carried out prior to his visit by an Interior Ministry  commission, a number of responsible officials of the oblast  directorate had been punished and measures were worked out to  strengthen law and order on Sakhalin and in the Kurils.    In connection with the Putina-94 operation that is being  carried out in the Russian Far East, Viktor Yerin described it  as very expedient in the struggle against organized  international crime. The minister believes concrete contacts  between the island's Interior Ministry bodies and the police of  Japan's most northerly island, Hokkaido, could be very  beneficial.</p>

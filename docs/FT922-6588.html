			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: US partner in prospect for Syncordia BT may take a US partner into Syncordia, its global communications venture, Mr Iain Vallance said yesterday. Syncordia, formed last year with the aim of providing communications services to multinational corporations, had a difficult birth. BT's original plan to sell a stake to Deutsche Telekom was abandoned when the German state-owned telephone company formed an alliance with France Telecom, its French counterpart. The idea that Syncordia may take a US partner runs counter to BT's original intentions. Mr Vallance previously argued that Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, could serve the US market on its own. Mr Vallance refused to say which US companies BT was talking to except that IBM, the computer giant and now a Syncordia customer, was not one of them. In the past, MCI, the long-distance telecommunications group, has expressed an interest in joining. Mr Vallance said that, as the European telecommunications services market was being progressively opened up to competition, BT did not need German or French participation in Syncordia. He said he was still hoping to involve Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in the venture.</p>

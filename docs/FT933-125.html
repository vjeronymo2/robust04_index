			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Frank Usher Frank Usher Holdings, the USM-traded womans' wear group, saw profits before tax advance 14 per cent over the 12 months to May 31. Nevertheless, Mr Christopher Norland, chairman, described the increase from Pounds 1.07m to Pounds 1.22m, achieved on turnover of Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 15.6m) as 'slightly disappointing'. Gross margin for the year as a whole fell below expectations, he added. A recommended final dividend of 3.5p brings the total for the year to 6p (5p), payable from earnings of 11.3p (10.2p).</p>

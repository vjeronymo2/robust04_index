			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: Girobank telephone banking designed to complement network Sir, I was interested to read John Gapper's article, 'Banks dial M for money' (April 6), but I would like to comment on some of the points he made about Girobank. As the pioneer of telephone banking, Girobank has never had to 'support small branch networks' as he stated. Unlike other direct banks all our 1.5m customers have access to both Link cash dispensers and the nationwide Post Office network, which we use on an agency basis, as well as our Telecare telephone banking centres at four regional locations. This combination gives our customers a truly convenient service. We regard the country's 20,000 Post Office outlets as a big asset, especially as, with the growing number of bank closures to which John Gapper referred, they are now the sole provider of banking services in an increasing number of communities. This is important because, although the telephone can handle information, it cannot deliver the cash that customers still need. Girobank's cost/income ratio is indeed higher than those of its competitors but this reflects the make-up of our interest and fee income which is not comparable with the other high street clearers. More significantly, in 1992 Girobank achieved a return on shareholders' funds of 44 per cent, higher than any of the other clearers. Our telephone banking service is very cost-effective and complements the convenience of the biggest network of outlets of any bank or building society. We are not convinced customers should be forced into a strait-jacket of telephone banking simply because other banks are trying to recover the costs of some of their worst excesses of the 1980s. Girobank, I am pleased to say, continues to attract new customers at an encouraging rate. Richard Banks, senior general manager, personal banking, Girobank, Bridle Road, Bootle, GIR 0AA</p>

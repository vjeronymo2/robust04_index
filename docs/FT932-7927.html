			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Nadir escape was 'ridiculously easy' THE ESCAPE from the UK of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Turkish Cypriot businessman, was 'ridiculously easy' to organise, in spite of police surveillance, according to the Hampshire businessman who helped him jump his Pounds 3m bail. 'Anyone in the street could have done what I did,' Mr Peter Dimond, a former aeroplane dealer, said. The two-plane journey had been planned in a matter of days. 'It was so simple it was unreal.' Speaking from northern Cyprus, Mr Dimond said he had no regrets about his part in the affair. He said his role had been in arranging the flight from the Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset which took Mr Nadir to Beauvais near Paris. Mr Dimond, a long-time family friend of Mr Nadir through his wife, Hope, says he became involved in the escape through frustration at the treatment of Mr Nadir by the Serious Fraud Office. 'We have watched very closely the way the situation has been handled,' he said. 'There was a time when it was time to go and so his friends said 'OK, let's do it'. It was just an act of friendship - like giving a friend a lift in a car.' A regular user of Compton Abbas airfield, Mr Dimond approached the owner, Mr Clive Hughes, a friend of several years standing, a week before Mr Nadir's departure to book a plane for himself and a friend. He said Mr Hughes had agreed to pilot the twin-engined Piper Seneca plane to Beauvais as a favour to him. 'The pilots did not know who they were carrying,' Mr Dimond said. 'My part of the operation was that. The owner and pilot knew me - they wouldn't just go off and take anybody.' Early on the morning of May 4 Mr Nadir left his flat in London's Belgravia, arriving with Mr Dimond at Compton Abbas airfield in the late morning. Mr Hughes said yesterday that Mr Nadir, in dark glasses and a hat, was introduced to him as an 'aviation friend' of Mr Dimond. 'I did it as a private flight for a friend,' said Mr Hughes. He said the plane's intercom had been broken during the hour long flight and he had not spoken to Mr Nadir, who had sat, facing backwards, in the rear of the plane. The only payment he had received was Pounds 300 to cover the cost of petrol. Mr Clive Vleiland-Boddy, owner of the Piper plane, registration number GBSPG, yesterday said he had not known who was using it. Under new EC regulations, Mr Hughes says he had not been required to carry out any customs check, apart from handing out a leaflet explaining passport regulations for leaving England. When the plane arrived in Beauvais, Mr Dimond and Mr Nadir had hurried across the airfield to join the second aircraft, a Citation Cessna, registration N-11HJ, which had flown from Hatfield to meet them. 'I left them at the aircraft side. Peter knew I had to get back in a hurry,' said Mr Hughes. Mr Dimond yesterday denied that he had arranged the second aircraft which later took Mr Nadir and Mr Dimond from Beauvais to Cyprus, via Vienna and Istanbul. Mr Hamlin, owner of Hamlin jets, which manages the Hatfield airfield where the Citation is based, yesterday confirmed the plane had travelled to Beauvais and then on to northern Cyprus, but he had no idea beforehand what the purpose of the flight was. Mr Dimond said he had no intention of returning to England. If he was found aiding Mr Nadir to jump bail, he could face charges under British law, although, in practice, it would be impossible to extradite him without the co-operation of the north Cypriot authorities. 'I do not intend to become a fall guy for the frustration and anger of the people who were told to look for us,' he said. A former car dealer, and licensed pilot, he set up Southcoast Aviation, an aircraft trading company, in 1987. After this folded at the end of the 1980s, Mr Dimond had, he admitted, been facing financial difficulties. Mr Dimond denied that he had been paid for his role in the affair. 'I did it because I was sick of the system. I thought this man deserves to get out and have a right to free speech - there was no payment.'</p>

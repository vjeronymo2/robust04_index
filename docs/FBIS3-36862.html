			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The First Bankrupt Industry"] </F>   [Text] V. Semenyuk, Ukraine's minister of power engineering  and electrification, has stated that since January 1994 the  industry has become unprofitable: The debit balance constitutes  2.3 trillion karbovantsi [K] and the overall debt about K6  trillion.    Power engineers have no money to pay for the energy sources  and for the electricity supplied by nuclear power stations. For  that reason, incidentally, four power units, producing millions  [of kilowatts] will be closed down.    Every day, between 40 and 45 power units at thermal electric  power stations are standing idle. The inability to pay has  paralyzed the operation of about 2,000 enterprises in this  sector.    The minister appealed to heads of oblast state  administrations and to heads of councils of people's deputies  with a request to provide maximum assistance to local power  engineering enterprises. The enterprises and organizations must  both repay debts for the electricity consumed and strictly  adhere to the rules of electricity consumption.</p>

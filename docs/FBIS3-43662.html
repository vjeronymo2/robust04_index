Fighting broke out between the police, hurling teargas, and  the opposition leaders' bodyguards after the security forces,  "without explanation," stopped the politicians from boarding  their flight here late Tuesday, the spokesman said.    A delegation of seven people, including four men who ran  against President Omar Bongo in elections that returned him to  office last December, turned up at the airport to carry out a  briefing tour to France and the United States, the spokesman  said.    The four were Jules-Aristide Bourdes-Ogouliguende, Alexandre  Sambat, Jean-Pierre Lemboumba and Pierre-Claver  Maganga-Moussavou.    The incident was the first of its kind since the December 5  poll, sources said. In recent weeks, several leaders of the  opposition in the West African country have travelled abroad,  notably to Paris.</p>

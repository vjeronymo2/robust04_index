			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Ronten [point at issue]" column by Hisahiko Okazaki, </F> former Japanese ambassador to Thailand: "Requests Concerning  the Revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines]    [Text] The most important thing in reviewing the National  Defense Program Guidelines is "not to do anything harmful to  patients" as stated by the great Greek doctor Hippocrates.  Also, the following saying by Yaritsu Sozai, a Mongolian  premier in the 1200's, may teach us something: "You have to  remove one harmful thing to gain an advantage. You have to stop  doing one thing to start doing another thing."    The present guidelines have the most serious defects in  situation assessment and strategic ideas. Although they should  be flexible and be adapted to circumstances, there are only  fixed assessment and strategic ideas in Japan because of a rule  that defense matters should be decided on by the cabinet.    From the beginning, the situation assessment and strategic  ideas have been merely nominal.    A U.S. military expert once said: "Japan's defense program  guidelines do not mention any strategies placing military  importance on the north. Has Japan reviewed the guidelines?"  Without answering the question, Japan steadily built a system  to defend the northern part of Japan. By the mideighties, it  gained confidence that it could repel foreign aggression in  cooperation with the United States.    At that time, no one paid attention to the idea demonstrated  in the guidelines that Japan should repel an aggression on its  own at the initial stage, and wait for U.S. help. Instead, an  operational plan was formulated on the assumption that Japan and  the United States jointly defend the nation against an attack by  the Soviet Union.    A clause in the guidelines says that Japan should maintain  basic defense power in peacetime and should expand it when  necessary. In actuality, however, nobody expects that the  defense power will be expanded in accordance with this clause.  Working-level officials all know that the thinking that there  should be enough time to compile a new defense budget even when  a crisis is imminent is far from realistic. They know that  because this is the time all the world is seeking peace, it is  impossible for Japan to expand its military power based on the  defense program guidelines even if a crisis is imminent. In  fact, the guidelines do not explain when the expansion is  possible and what the procedures are. Also, both Japanese and  U.S. Government defense officials are thinking only of defending  Japan with the existing military strength.    In this context, ideas demonstrated in the defense program  guidelines are merely words. However, this has not caused  actual harm. The only harm is the rule saying that the Cabinet  should decide defense matters. This rule prevents the  development of strategic ideas.    Because there are not many strategists in Japan, this nation  has to depend on working-level Defense Agency officials for  defense ideas. However, the adoption of their ideas is limited  because of the aforementioned rule, and this has caused  incalculable harm. Although we Japanese waged the Pacific war,  we did not learn strategies from it. We also failed to learn  strategic ideas from the Cold War, although we fought it  throughout.    From now on, the government should try to avoid deciding on  situation assessment and strategic ideas at the cabinet level.  It is desirable that it allow changes in defense ideas and show  the changes in annual defense white papers as other  industrialized nations do.    If the government needs to continue deciding on defense  matters at the cabinet level, it should adopt realistic defense  policies (as other countries do) in line with the Japanese-U.S.  alliance, or it should adopt slogan-like policies which cite  ideas in Article 9 of the Constitution and can be flexibly  interpreted.    Revising the table attached to the guidelines is the  centerpiece of the review of the defense program guidelines.  When the government revises the table, it should seek the  counsel of experts, especially of working-level officers in the  Self Defense Forces [SDF]. This is the most important. In that  instance, the government, with high political judgment, should  take two things into consideration.    One is that after making sure the SDF officers' advice is  not made based on the interests of each force, the government  should come up with an all-around judgment for the nation and  the security of the Japanese people.    The other is that it should consider avoiding a situation in  which Japan falls behind the progress in military technology and  changes in defensive tactics as a result of its adherence to  conventional ideas, such as a big-battleship-and-cannon-ism this  nation once advocated.    Since the Gulf war, military authorities in the world have  opened their eyes wide to the power of advanced technology.  Some countries have drastically reviewed their defense systems.  Taking this into consideration, the SDF should also actively  introduce advanced technology in their defense plans. They  should not be satisfied with their already-high-level technology.    Based on this idea, the government should calculate entire  defense expenditures. It should not intend to cut the defense  budget from the beginning.    The argument that the defense budget should be cut "because  the world is moving toward arms reduction" rests on slender  authority. The military balance surrounding Japan, which  influences the security of this nation, is changing. Other  Asian nations are expanding their armaments, and the military  power of the Russian Army in the Far East has greatly been  enhanced over the past 10 years. It is meaningless to compare  Japan's defense budget with those of the United States and  Europe, where the threat of Warsaw Pact forces composed of more  than 100 divisions has gone and the threat of Russia has  diminished.    The Far East region is facing many issues seen in a  transitional period. They include those concerning the DPRK's  alleged nuclear arms development, who will succeed President Kim  Il-song, North-South unification, who will succeed Chinese  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, long-range plans to strengthen  military power, Taiwan-related matters, and the fluid political  situation in Russia. It will take at least 10 years to know how  these issues will be settled.    The most important thing in a transitional period is not to  launch policies that will prevent flexible defense plans for  many years. As Yaritsu Sozai says, Japan has to remove one  harmful thing (to eliminate meaningless ideas from the present  defense program guidelines) to gain one advantage.</p>

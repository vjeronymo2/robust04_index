			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Ivanov report: "The Bottom Line of a Political </F> Scandal. An Ordinary Russian Speaker Who Has Led Everyone Down  the Garden Path"]    [Text] Ivan Rybkin, who became a State Duma deputy on the  ticket of the Agrarian Party and was elected speaker at the  initiative of the communists, has definitely broken with the  opposition. This week he announced that he would step down as  deputy chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF]. Yesterday,  the plenary meeting of the CPRF Central Executive Committee  plenary meeting readily met his request.    There are various opinions regarding Ivan Rybkin, current  State Duma chairman and former second secretary of the Volgograd  Oblast Communist Party committee. Some see him as a man coming  from the people who has been elevated to the high post by sheer  happenstance. "The milestones of my working biography are pretty  simple," Rybkin said, justifiably so, in a recent interview.  Indeed, the speaker has a typical agrarian-staff background:  quiet work at the organization departments of first district,  then oblast, party committees; and finally the Central Committee  of the RSFSR Communist Party. It should be added that Rybkin's  appearance is fully in line with his biography: a short  stature, a quiet voice, pleasant manners in conversation, and a  complete absence even of outward signs of willfulness, let alone  charisma. Nonetheless, unlike most of his colleagues who have  quietly settled down in all kinds of businesses, not only has  Rybkin made a brilliant career by assuming one of the highest  state posts, but he is by right considered one of the ten most  influential Russian politicians.    What appears to be more pertinent is another view whereby  the  role of a "gray politician," a "mediocrity," is just a role the  State Duma chairman sometimes thinks necessary to play.  Meanwhile, Rybkin did not seem a mediocrity at all at the  Supreme Soviet, where he carefully but uncompromisingly  criticized the "Yeltsin regime." Yet more proof of his firm  political convictions is the fact that in October he was one of  the last to have been escorted out of the burning White House at  gunpoint.    When Rybkin started talking about loyalty to the president  and commitment to the course of reform upon having been "pushed  through" by the communists and agrarians as State Duma chairman,  the speaker's former supporters accused him of opportunism and  "working for the democrats." However, those who are closely  familiar with Rybkin are certain that no metamorphoses have  occurred in him: "It is not he who is changing, but  circumstances, and Rybkin is just adapting to the circumstances  so as to work effectively." In fact, Rybkin can well go to the  president (for whose impeachment he voted in September) with a  bunch of flowers on his birthday, or to appoint Andrey Voykov, a  democrat, who formerly was deputy chief of the presidential  administration, as chief of the State Duma's staff. All this is  essentially trifles, but Ruslan Khasbulatov's recent experience  has shown fairly convincingly that it is trifles (inappropriate  words or gestures) that can help one fall out with the president  for good. As regards matters of principle, however, the speaker  acts decisively and quite independently. After all, it is  precisely Rybkin's staffers who quickly and promptly formalized  the release of the "Lefortovo inmates," thus making it  impossible for the president "to reverse" the amnesty decree.    Clearly, Rybkin's apparently scandalous departure from the  Communist Party leadership should not be overestimated. While  heading the lower chamber, Rybkin has not become a pawn in the  hands of the opposition. But seeing him as the president's man  would also be ill-advised. He is playing his own game. His  short-term program is quite clear: not to repeat the sad  experience of Anatoliy Lukyanov and Ruslan Khasbulatov. As for  his long-term program, many deputies believe that the wise and  careful Rybkin with an image of "a mediocrity" may turn out to  be a compromise figure suiting political forces as a  presidential candidate who will be easy to manipulate in case of  his victory. But what Rybkin himself thinks on the subject is  still anyone's guess.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: BBV falls 7.5% after losses in bond market Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), the Spanish retail bank, posted a 7.5 per cent fall to Pta57.7bn (Dollars 461.8m) in third-quarter pre-tax profits after heavy trading losses at its treasury department. This compared with Pta62bn for the same period last year. BBV reported losses of Pta20bn in financial operations, mainly linked to the volatile bond market, for the nine-month period. Over the same period last year the bank posted profits of Pta29.8bn from financial operations. The bank also reported losses of Pta7.7bn on restructuring its security portfolio against income last year of Pta6.4bn. The cost of BBV's trading business was partially offset by a 3.9 per cent rise to Pta252.8bn in the bank's net interest margin and by 17.6 per cent rise to Pta83.6bn in fees from commissions, most of which were related to investment funds managed by BBV. Slightly lower costs allowed the bank to lift its operating profit by 21 per cent to Pta137bn. BBV said this pointed to the 'excellent performance' of its pure banking business. BBV said it expected a moderate improvement in its year-end results. Banco Popular, the tightly-managed Spanish bank that has been the most profitable in the domestic sector, lifted third-quarter net-profits 0.9 per cent to Pta41.1bn in spite of a 3.4 per cent fall to Pta83.2bn in operating profit.</p>

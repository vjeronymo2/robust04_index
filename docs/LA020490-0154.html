			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TOP DRIVER RETURNS TO CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> The story sounds familiar, one that is right out of a Bing Crosby vehicle of  the 1930s or '40s. Going My Way, maybe?  </P> <P> The characters include a young boy who loves animals, horses in particular.  Then there is the local priest who is presented a horse by a wealthy  parishioner. Naturally, the beast is uncontrollable until the youngster is  given the opportunity to care for him.  </P> <P> And the priest takes the kid to the track, yes, the racetrack, and everyone  lives happily ever after.  </P> <P> Well, in the case of Marc Aubin, it may indeed have been that good father who  instilled a love for racing horses that hasn't diminished in more than 40  years.  </P> <P> "We only went once," says Aubin today of that trip to see the trotters and  pacers in his native Quebec City. Once, in this case, was enough.  </P> <P> Today, Aubin, 56, has established a reputation as one of standardbred (harness)  racing's finest horsemen.  </P> <P> And after an absence of more than three years, he has returned to Los Alamitos  with seven horses for the spring meet that continues through April 14.  </P> <P> The reason? That's easy. It's the same one that is pointed to time and time  again by newcomers competing at Los Alamitos these nights.  </P> <P> "When Lloyd Arnold bought the place, he didn't have to call me about coming  back. In fact, I called him when I heard the news," says Aubin. "He's an  excellent promoter and the man for us.  </P> <P> "The outlook for us is better than ever," he enthuses. "I foresee us getting  back on top again."  </P> <P> The newly-found optimism at Los Alamitos takes different shapes. For instance,  Aubin has been approached by potential new clients who wish to purchase racing  stock. And twice he has claimed -- attempted to buy a horse out of a race for a  stipulated price -- only to lose a "shake" to another claimant.  </P> <P> A few years ago, any claim at a Los Alamitos harness meeting was about as  common as a local summer thunderstorm.  </P> <P> The star of the Aubin shedrow is a three-year-old colt named Tommy Mohawk, who  won five of seven races in 1989. It is possible the young pacer will compete  before the Los Alamitos stand concludes, but the main objective is a rich  series of races for Illinois-breds later in the year at Sportsman's Park, near  Chicago.  </P> <P> Aubin purchased the colt at a yearling auction for just $3,000. It took  precisely two minutes -- the time Tommy Mohawk required to record a win in his  first start -- to convince one Chicagoan to offer Aubin $150,000 for the horse.  There was no deal, and the colt will carry a rich reputation into action this  year under Aubin's direction.  </P> <P> That early trip to the races with the priest and his affinity for horses  notwithstanding, the racing bug didn't bite Aubin right away. This is not the  story of a kid who hung around the track. Instead, he opted to join the  Canadian Air Force while still in his teens and remained there for 14 years.  </P> <P> Aubin stayed close to horses whenever possible while in the service. He showed  horses for friends at county fairs, but his career path was determined during  another eventful trip to the racetrack.  </P> <P> "There was an old man, trying to sell a mare," he recalls. "I bought her and  was on my way."  </P> <P> The racing newcomer obtained his driving and training licenses and began  competing in the sulky world of the mid-1960s -- in Quebec during the summer  and Montreal during the spring and fall.  </P> <P> Aubin crossed the border into the United States for good in 1971, traveling to  Florida, Michigan and Chicago with noted horsemen Billy Haughton and Henri  Filion.  </P> <P> Striking out on his own, he came West in 1972 and his red, white and blue  colors were a Southern California staple for more than a dozen seasons.  </P> <P> Of the many fine pacers and trotters campaigned by Aubin over the years here,  he calls Spry Sam the best. Another pacer, La Valaise, also was double-tough  against invitational stock, the best horses competing at the track.  </P> <P> But hard times hit the sulky industry in Southern California and Aubin left in  1986. "I just couldn't make a living here," he explained, and back to Chicago  and other environs he went, seeking a year-around schedule.  </P> <P> Now, plans call for him to split time between California and Illinois. After  the current meet ends, he'll take his stock to Maywood Park for about a month,  "to let the horses acclimate." Then comes a summer assault on Sportsman's Park,  a five-eighths oval like Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Then back here for the second harness meeting, scheduled to begin in  mid-August. Hopefully by then Tommy Mohawk really will have made a name for  himself.  </P> <P> Aubin has started something of a family tradition in the game. Son Matt works  alongside his father while brother Gene and his son John toil for competing  barns here. Marc's wife Kimberly edits an Illinois standardbred magazine and  has her own trotter, which she drives in competition.  </P> <P> Those patriotic colors keep turning up in the bike, and as long as harness  racing thrives somewhere, fans figure to be seeing them for some time yet.  </P></p>

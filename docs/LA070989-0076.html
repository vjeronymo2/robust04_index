			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALMS SPRINGS ETERNAL  </P> <P> "Outraged" is the word for my feelings while reading of how Palm Springs shows  its indifference to California's water needs as it blithely constructs more and  more lakes, lagoons, waterfalls and pools at the expense of the rest of us who  are being asked to conserve. Are we conserving for Palm Springs?  </P> <P> "Outraged" also describes my feelings about The Times as it hypocritically  preaches environmental concerns and water conservation on its editorial pages  while at the same time, in its Travel Section, it provides color pictures and  other glamorous hype for Palm Springs and its obscene water usage policy.  </P> <P> ALAN B.

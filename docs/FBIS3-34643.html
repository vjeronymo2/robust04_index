Yasir 'Arafat made the following statement after the audience:    [Begin 'Arafat recording] I held a good, positive and warm  meeting with the president. I acquainted him with all that has  recently been agreed upon in Cairo between us and the Israelis,  and the agreement which we signed. On my arrival in Tunis I  sent the president a copy of this agreement so that he would be  totally informed of its details. I also pointed out to the  president the significance of our continuing consultations and  contacts so that we could reach a final agreement, which we  expect at the end of this month, God willing. This would enable  us to precisely and faithfully implement what we signed in  Washington last year -- last September.    I listened to the advice and directives of the president,  which I value highly. I thanked him, in my own name and in that  of the Palestinian people, for all that Tunisia -- president,  government and people -- gives to the Palestinian issue and to  the Palestinian people.

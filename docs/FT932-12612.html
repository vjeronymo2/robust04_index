			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Attali pressed to get on with main task: The EBRD board wants focus fixed on helping ex-communist states MR JACQUES ATTALI, the flamboyant and controversial president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, remains at the head of the institution he helped create. But after this week's very public expressions of concern by bank governors over reports of the EBRD's high spending on its new building, he cannot yet be sure that he has the unreserved support of his main shareholders. That will hang on the outcome, probably in a few weeks' time, of the investigation by the bank's audit committee into the allegations of extravagance in fitting out its London headquarters. In the meantime, the countries that set up the bank will be pressing Mr Attali not to delay the organisational changes he has promised including the appointment of a strong budget director. The ministers from the industrialised and former Communist countries that make up the bank's board of governors signalled they want it to press ahead with its task of helping eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union develop market-based economies by steering clear of EBRD management issues in the closed session of the bank's annual meeting on Monday afternoon. Indeed, the session, which was devoted to the fostering of small and medium-sized enterprises in former Communist countries, could mark a new chapter in the bank's activities, if, as Mr Attali believes, it results in a more decentralised and responsive mode of operations. But Mr Attali is not completely out of the woods. Although Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister and this year's chairman of the EBRD board, said governors had not discussed this week appointment of a chief executive to strengthen management of the bank, officials said Bonn was prepared to revive the idea if necessary. Under the Clinton administration, the US, which holds 10 per cent of the EBRD's capital and is its largest shareholder, has been far more supportive of the bank's aims than previously. But Washington is keeping its options open at least until the audit committee reports. Mr Roger Altman, US deputy treasury secretary, praised the bank for providing financial support to the private sector in the new market economies. But he was careful not to endorse Mr Attali personally. On the other hand, officials from the bank's member countries acknowledge that Mr Attali has achieved a great deal in the two years since the EBRD was inaugurated. He has kept the problems of the former Communist countries in the public eye and has been prominent in support of more open markets in the west for the products of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He is recognised as a source of dynamism and ideas from which the bank has profited. There is also a realisation among many shareholders that the EBRD has a difficult task to perform that is not made easier by the statutes agreed by member governments at the time of its foundation. It was at the insistence of those founding members that the bank was saddled with an unwieldy 23-person board of directors, each with an alternate and office. The bank must lend on good bankable deals but also must not be doing things that a normal commercial bank must do. As one official observed, such a condition, if taken to a logical conclusion, is a formula for inaction. Economic and administrative problems in the former Communist countries have been another factor behind the much criticised slow disbursement of funds. This was acknowledged on Monday by Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the Russian governor, in an otherwise critical speech. Member governments have sought this week to lend support to the bank's efforts and to prevent a decline of morale among its staff. The EBRD can take heart from the fact that its biggest shareholders, the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, keep finding new tasks for it to perform. The multilateral nuclear safety fund, which the bank will help administer, will be operational this week. Another sign of confidence in the bank is the proposed Dollars 300m fund to foster small and medium-sized businesses in Russia. The bank has been asked to create and manage the fund.</p>

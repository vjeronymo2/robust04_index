			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Watchdog's deregulation call - At a Glance The Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog, this week proposed greater deregulation in the unit trust industry with a series of measures which are to come into effect on November 1. Unit trusts will be able to impose exit charges and will not have to publish the cancellation price - the lowest price at which units can be sold - in the national press. In addition the terms 'offer' - the price at which units are bought - and 'bid' - the price at which they are sold - have been removed from the regulations in an attempt to move towards more user-friendly terminology.

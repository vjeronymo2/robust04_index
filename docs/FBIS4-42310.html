			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["agr/vp" report: "Minister Rexrodt Wants To `Open the </F> Door' in Airbus Marketing"]    [Text] Berlin -- With his British, French, and Spanish  colleagues, Economics Minister Rexrodt wants to "open the door"  for the international marketing of Airbus. At a meeting with  the economics ministers of the above three countries on the  sidelines of the Berlin International Air and Space Show -- the  meeting also attended by representatives of the Airbus  consortium, including German Aerospace Director Juergen E.  Schrempp -- Rexrodt said that state support for the sale of top  German technologies abroad is a key component of foreign and  economic policy, and is not limited just to the Airbus project.    However, talks at government level should not be used to  apply political pressure or impose financial restrictions, it  was said. The four ministers agreed to combat unfair financial  dealings and political malpractice on the aviation market.    Rexrodt said the European enterprises involved in the  construction of the Airbus had complained of being at a  disadvantage compared to their main U.S. competitors. He said  there are indications that the American competition is  advertising its aircraft in a very determined and unconventional  manner, availing itself of help from the U.S. Government.  Specifically, Rexrodt criticized distortions in competition,  something that violates agreements reached with credit instance  companies. Observers view this as a clear indication of the  Americans' business dealings with Saudi Arabia.    Rexrodt said the initial German contribution to the Airbus  program amounts to a "refundable 6.5 billion German marks [DM]."  A general increase in the financial contribution for the  purpose of research into future technologies can be expected in  the medium term, he said.    Wolfgang Piller, president of the Association of German Air  Industry, told HANDELSBLATT that the state is providing the  German aviation industry with DM6 million for the purposes of  aviation research. In the United States, on the other hand,  $2.7 billion has been provided for air research indirectly  through NASA and the Pentagon.    While government aircraft orders in the United States  constitute 64 percent of all such orders, in Germany government  aircraft orders only amount to 38 percent, said Rexrodt. In the  United States, 30 experimental projects have been commissioned,  compared to only one in Europe -- in the Netherlands. This  provides a springboard for U.S. moves to distort competition.  The supportive words of European politicians should finally be  followed by deeds, according to Rexrodt.    In the meantime, the absence of the four-engine long-range  Airbus A-340 on the air show's opening day is viewed as a bone  of contention on the sidelines of the economics ministers  conference. The Airbus had to remain on the ground at Toulouse  because an agreement between Lufthansa and German Aerospace  about who should pay for the flight collpased at the last  moment. Apparently, German Aerospace withdrew its financial  involvement in Airbus.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. OIL DEMAND FALLS OFF 2.6%  </P> <P> Overall U.S. oil demand dropped 2.6% in November from year-ago levels in face  of higher fuel prices and the slowing economy, the American Petroleum Institute  said today.  </P> <P> The United States is the world's largest oil-consuming nation and the No. 2 oil  producer after the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Demand for most major petroleum products, such as gasoline and home-heating  oil, declined in November, the oil industry trade group said in its monthly  report, but deliveries of kerosene jet fuel reached record levels for this time  of year.  </P> <P> Domestic crude production slipped 6% in November from a year ago, partly  reflecting an ouptut slowdown from Alaska's North Slope caused by stormy  weather at the Port of Valdez.  </P></p>

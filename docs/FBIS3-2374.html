			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Azerbaijani  President Gaydar Aliyev said here today that his country desires  to establish direct economic and trade ties with large-sized  Chinese enterprises.    He made the remark at a meeting with the leaders from more  than 20 large Chinese companies here this morning.    The president said that during his visit to China he had  exchanged views with Chinese leaders on a wide range of issues.  The two countries also signed a series of important documents  aimed at promoting the growth of bilateral ties, economic  co-operation and trade in particular, he said.    Aliyev said these agreements should be fully implemented  through concerted efforts by the relevant departments of the two  countries.    He said China is a big country while Azerbaijan is a young  country, and both of them have great potential for economic  development.    Azerbaijan, situated at the junction of the continents of  Europe and Asia, has enjoyed traditional contacts and ties with  the Asian countries including China. So it can play the role of  a "bridge" in linking these two continents.    Viewed from Azerbaijan's geographical position, there exist  good conditions for furthering bilateral economic co-operation  and trade.    in his speech, Aliyev also briefed the Chinese entrepreneurs  on his country's advantages in industry and agriculture, which,  he said, will lay a basis for bilateral economic co-operation  and trade.    Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade, noted that a good beginning  has been made for the pursuit of China-Azerbaijan economic ties  and trade.    He expressed the hope that the entrepreneurs of the two  countries would frequently exchange visits and deepen their  mutual understanding so as to further promote such a  relationship.</p>

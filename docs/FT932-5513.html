			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Siebe Now that Siebe's results are out, it is difficult to see why anyone thought the company might need a rights issue in the short term. Thanks to further rigorous cost cutting, particularly at Foxboro, net cash flow is up 19 per cent. Strip the intangibles from the balance sheet and gearing would be 102 per cent instead of 60, but that matters little with interest cover of 4.3 times and a further drop in the interest charge expected this year. More important is whether Siebe can follow up its efficiency gains with increased volume. That looks a tall order in Europe and Japan, less so in the UK and US. Without Foxboro's contribution the results would be much less impressive. Turnover elsewhere in the controls division fell markedly and margins were slightly down. Thanks to its operational gearing, Foxboro should again help group results this year; it has room to increase output by 25 per cent without hitting bottlenecks. What that will do for the shares is another matter. Siebe is already at a slight premium to the market and on a yield of less than 3 per cent. Besides, it will need something to sustain momentum in the medium term. That might eventually involve a rights issue, but it will be lucky to find an acquisition as lucrative as Foxboro on which to spend the money.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms buzz Telecoms shares were active ahead of the publication on Tuesday of Oftel's consultative document on interconnection charges. BT dipped 6 to 370p in 5.3m turnover and Cable and Wireless shed 3 to 376p. Interconnection charges are the fees paid to BT by users of its network. Hoare Govett sees any changes as relatively neutral for BT but potentially profitable for C&amp;W, boosting profits at its Mercury subsidiary by around a fifth from 1996. On Vodafone - down 1 1/2 to 198 1/2 p - Hoare Govett expect interconnection charge moves to lead to a big jump in volume through reduced charges for incoming calls. Otherwise, talk in the sector centred on prospects for C&amp;W expanding its services side. It is widely thought to be in talks to buy 25 per cent of Amadeus, Europe's airline reservations network. Turnover in the shares was 2.3m. Regional electricity companies continued to see keen demand with dealers expecting sharply increased dividends as more companies report figures. Dealers were also hoping for further news on the flotation of the National Grid, which is owned by the 12 generators. The sector was further enlivened by speculation that international conglomerate Hanson, or Scottish Power, was about to launch a bid for one of the recs. Northern appeared to be the favourite to be on the receiving end of such a bid. Shares in Northern put on 10 to 853p, though Scottish eased 2 to 355p. Hanson was steady at 237p. One of the sector's best performers was Southern which improved 11 to 805p. National Power improved 4 to 497p. Hard-hit Royal Bank of Scotland recovered 9 to 409p as some analysts felt the stock had been too harshly treated after top-of-the-range results. Lehman Brothers told clients that RBoS remained one of its two favoured stocks in the banking sector and the recent setback presented a buying opportunity. Also Panmure Gordon was recommending the stock for which it has what appears to be the highest profit forecast in the City so far - Pounds 650m. NatWest Securities also increased its estimates. Lloyds Abbey Life shed 5 1/2 to 321p with some analysts arguing that the stock was overvalued. SmithKline Beecham added a penny at 425p in the 'A's after some US investment banks bought the Units actively. Oil group Burmah Castrol improved 3 to 821p as Lehman Brothers turned more positive on the stock. The house moved to a buy on the stock in order to reflect the strong growth forecast for the chemicals industry. Paper and plastics group Bunzl gained 4 to 167p after a successful visit by analysts to its cigarette filter plant in Jarrow and some upgrades. A 3.8 per cent increase in full-year profits from brewer Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley was below market expectations and the shares eased 2 to 526p. Several brokers marginally downgraded current year profit expectations - among them, Hoare Govett shaved Pounds 1m off its forecast to Pounds 41m. Nervous trading in Taunton Cider ahead of Tuesday's interim figures left the shares 2 lighter at 155p. However, Mansfield Brewery, which reports interims the day after, were in demand and the shares rose 6 to 228p. A big seller of Scottish &amp; Newcastle was seen early in the session, bringing a decline to the stock. The shares tumbled 13 to 498p, with traders attributing part of the decline to nervous trading ahead of Monday's interim figures. Ladbroke closed 5 lighter at 153p as talk started to circulate that the group was about to sell Texas, its DIY subsidiary. International trader Lonrho saw 4.8m shares change hands on the back of two boardroom appointments which analysts interpreted as a further step in the company's process of normalisation. The shares ended 1 1/2 lower at 155 1/2 p. In building materials Blue Circle and Rugby, the two groups at the centre of a wrangle with the European Union over cement cartel fines, fell 10 to 291p and 3 to 119p respectively. In each case turnover was nominal. Lilleshall became the second windows business casualty in two days, sliding 18 to 123p following a forecast of little or no profits growth this year. Underlying profits were 66 per cent ahead at the interim stage when the shares stood at 155p. Anglian dipped 4 to 171p having turned in weak interims on Thursday and warned of lower full-year profits. Jeans maker Vivat Holdings jumped 27 to 65p, the biggest percentage gain in the London market, as Chiefco Holdings, a newly incorporated consortium led by NatWest Ventures, made a 65p-a-share offer. Waste management group Attwoods saw its shares rise 3 to 120p, matching the value of the Pounds 391m hostile bid from Browning-Ferris Industries. An 11th-hour counter bid by Ikotek of Canada, set at 130p a share, arrived too late. Improved figures from luxury products group Vendome had already been discounted and the shares relinquished 17 to 483p. Concerns about Christmas trading continue to overhang the retail sector. Talk that several retailers may be forced to reduce prices in the run-up to Christmas, also affected Boots, whose shares fell 6 to 488p, their low of the year.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Electricity suppliers face tougher pricing TOUGHER controls on electricity prices will be announced today by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator. The controls will apply to the electricity supply business, which accounts for as much as 20 per cent of the profits of the regional electricity companies. The controls form the first part of a two-year review which will eventually cover the entire electricity supply and distribution business. Today's 64-page report is expected to give the regional electricity companies more flexibility in calculating the costs they can pass on to customers, for example by taking account of market features such as the size and distribution of the population. But Prof Littlechild is also expected to introduce an 'X factor'. This would be subtracted from the inflation rate to give the amount by which electricity prices could rise in any year. In their recently announced results many electricity companies said they had launched a vigorous attack on costs in order to be in a better position to absorb the effect of tighter regulatory controls. Today's report will be a prelude to a much larger review of the distribution business lasting until next summer.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Russian voucher sale of big industrial plants RUSSIA is to sell stakes in two of the country's biggest industrial enterprises in a nationwide auction tomorrow, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. Mr Eduard Karlov, a spokesman for the State Property Committee, said yesterday that 28.5 per cent of Uralmash, an engineering plant, and 60 per cent of the First Ural New Tube Plant, both based in Yekaterinburg, would be offered to the public in exchange for privatisation vouchers. This will be only the second auction in which bids can be accepted around the country, rather than just in the place where the enterprises for sale are located. The shares in the two companies will be offered in eight regions, plus Moscow and St Petersburg.</p>

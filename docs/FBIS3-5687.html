The BOJ considers it an encouraging  indication that there are signs the economy has hit bottom, as  seen in increased shipments of electric appliances. But  Kagehide Kaku, chief of the BOJ Research and Statistics  Department, said: "It is difficult to predict precisely when  the economic recovery will start." This means that should the  economy deteriorate further because of worsened labor conditions  and the yen's sharp appreciation, the BOJ intends to take prompt  measures to induce lower short-term rates.    The reason why the BOJ is cautious about the economic future  is because while there are some favorable economic factors like  increased investments in equipment and expansion of public works  projects, there are also unfavorable factors such as those seen  in unemployment problems and the yen's appreciation. In other  words, the BOJ thinks: "The current situation is a mixture of  contrasting factors." The BOJ is particularly nervous about the  trend of high yen value and labor conditions. The fact that the  private sector's investment in plants and equipment are not  expected to grow even in 1994 is also contributing to its  thinking that "no clear indications have been identified to  confirm the economic recovery."    Meanwhile, the financial market is rather optimistic  compared  with the BOJ, believing: "The economy is recovering after  having hit bottom." The BOJ wants to watch how current  long-term interest rates will increase in the future. Should  the increase be too sharp, thus bringing about a negative impact  on the recovery, it will act to further ease the monetary market.</p>

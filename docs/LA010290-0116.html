			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LOPEZ ASKS LATINO COMEDY ROLES  </P> <P> Stand-up comedian George Lopez, who plays up his ethnic roots in his act, is  dismayed by the lack of comedy roles for Latinos.  </P> <P> The 28-year-old comic, who plays a ski patrolman in the upcoming movie, "Ski  Patrol," said in a recent interview that Latinos "are being totally left out"  of television sitcoms.  </P> <P> "When you look ethnic it's that much harder," he said. "Everyone is thin and  Caucasian, and I don't look like that. . . . I'd like to play a professional,  an attorney, a guy who just works for a living, a 'thirtysomething'-type  character."  </P> <P> He steers clear of ethnic stereotypes in movie and television roles.  </P> <P> "In sitcoms, there's no one Hispanic, and I don't think that's right. When the  first sitcom comes down that doesn't have 12 people in the family and there's  not a rooster in the living room, then I'm sure writers will go back to the  typewriters and say, 'Oh, that's how you're supposed to do it!' "  </P></p>

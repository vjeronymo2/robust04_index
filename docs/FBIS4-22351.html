			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report based on data of the Russian Federation Committee on </F> Metallurgy: "Analysis of Work of Nonferrous Metallurgy  Enterprises in January 1994"]    [Text] Production of output from nonferrous metallurgy  enterprises continued to drop in January 1994. Thus, as compared  with December 1993, production of tungsten concentrate declined  by 79.3 percent; of hard alloys--by 67.0 percent; of refined  copper--by 41.5 percent; of sponge titanium--by 32.2 percent; of  zinc--by 13.6 percent; and of primary aluminum--by 3.9 percent.  There was increased production of only molybdenum  concentrate--by 0.6 percent--and lead--by 12.4 percent. A  similar picture is observed when compared with production in  January 1993.    In January 1994, some plants remained "on vacation" because  of insolvency caused by rising prices for coal, raw materials,  and transport and the decline in consumption of metal output.    On Russia's domestic market, consumption of aluminum  declined  by half and consumption of copper, zinc, lead, and tin declined  by 25-30 percent in 1993 as compared to 1992. Export of  nonferrous metals did not compensate for the reduced domestic  consumption largely because of higher prices for energy  resources and fuel; their proportion in the prime cost of  nonferrous metals is higher than for ferrous metals. The  effectiveness of exporting nonferrous metals at present is the  result of revising and lowering export duties.    The financial status of enterprises continues to be  difficult. If we compare the balance assets and liabilities of  enterprises for industrial activity, a general trend is  identified: the proportion of real estate in assets is  declining, while the proportion of sources of inhouse capital in  liabilities is decreasing. And in contrast, in both assets and  liabilities debtor and creditor indebtedness is rising, which  prevents enterprises from operating normally.    For example, the proportion of sources of inhouse capital  declined by a factor of 1.4 of its former level, and creditor  indebtedness increased by a factor of 1.8 in polymetal industry  enterprises during the first nine months of 1993.    In December 1993, in terms of the level of labor payment,  the  nonferrous metallurgy of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian Committee  on Metallurgy] was sixth among the sectors of industry (182,000  rubles [R] as opposed to an average level in industry of  R145,700). The highest average monthly wage remained in the  aluminum industry and the lowest in the solid alloy industry,  while the number of people working in those sectors increased by  6.5 percent and decreased by 7.1 percent, respectively.    Of the total amount of work time losses because of  production  stoppages at nonferrous metallurgy enterprises which presented  reports in 1993, special metallurgy enterprises accounted for  two-thirds (more than 2 million worker days), and of that the  Belokalitvinskiy MPO [Metallurgical Production Association]  accounts for almost 1.2 million worker days. Significant losses  of work time occurred at enterprises of the solid alloy industry  too, for the most part because of the lack of sale of output:  the Pobedit plant had downtime almost every month which totaled  about 140,000 worker days during the year, while the figure was  61,700 worker days at the Kirovograd Plant. Wages at both  enterprises were low.    The number of people working at Roskommetallurgiya  nonferrous  metallurgy enterprises in 1993 declined by 0.5 percent, and PPP  [industrial production personnel]--by 1.0 percent. At  enterprises which are working well and expanding by producing  output different from their specialization the figure actually  increased: it more than doubled at the Nadvoitsy Aluminum Plant;  it increased by 22.5 percent at the Kyshtym Copper Electrolyte  Plant; and it increased by 18.5 percent at the Bratsk Aluminum  Plant.    At enterprises with low labor payment, the number of  employees as a rule declined: by 25.3 percent at the Dzhida  Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine; by 20.3 percent at the Samara Steel  Mill; by 20.1 percent at the Vishnevogorsk Mine Administration;  and by 15.6 percent at the Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant.    According to the 1993 results, most nonferrous metals were  sold at the MBTsM [Moscow Nonferrous Metals Exchange] (86.8  percent of all sales). The dynamics of growth in exchange prices  for virtually all nonferrous metals were positive. Their level  is still lower than the level of prices on the London Metals  Exchange.</p>

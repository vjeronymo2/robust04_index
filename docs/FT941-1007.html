			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Black pepper prices were again firmer because of the limited availability, reports Man Producten. The harvest is almost over in India and Brazil and Indonesia have not been eager sellers. White pepper prices also remained steady, although demand for nearby positions was slow. Buying interest for new crop positions was picking up in Europe, however. Muntok/Sarawak faq was quoted at USDollars 2,900 a tonne for spot supplies, with March-April shipment at Dollars 2,875 and July-August at Dollars 2,700. Nutmeg prices were firmer on the local market in Indonesia, where carryover stocks are smaller than usual and estimates of the new production low. Grenada certainly will not spoil the market, so there is room for firmer prices again. Cassia was still weak, as were pimentos and cloves.</p>

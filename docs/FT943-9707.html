			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Key court ruling for German N-industry Germany's nuclear industry won a vital court victory yesterday in its bitter campaign to keep open the long-term prospects for nuclear power generation in the country. The Supreme Administrative Court in Berlin gave the green light for building work to continue on the plant being built by Siemens, the power and engineering group, to manufacture mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel elements from plutonium for atomic power stations. The court dismissed the challenge by environmental campaigners to three key licences in the building authorisation for the plant, overruling the decision of the state administrative court in Kassel. However, six further legal challenges remain to be cleared before the MOX plant at Hanau, near Frankfurt, can go into production. The plant is the most important missing link in the nuclear fuel chain in Germany, needed to enable atomic power stations to re-use plutonium reprocessed under contract in Britain and France. It is already 95 per cent complete, at a cost of DM1.1bn (Pounds 450m), but building work has slowed to a snail's pace because of the environmental battle. The court decision was hailed by the Siemens management at Hanau, where a spokesman said that 'building work can now proceed on a secure legal basis'. It was flatly condemned by Mr Joschka Fischer, Green party environment minister in the state of Hesse and the leading opponent of the plant. He said it was irresponsible, and promised to continue his campaign against any processing of plutonium in the state. In contrast, Mr Klaus Topfer, the federal environment minister in Bonn, welcomed the decision, saying that Mr Fischer's campaign against Hanau had caused 'irreparable damage' to Germany's economic competitiveness. Two more building licences for the Hanau plant face similar challenges to the three approved yesterday, as do four licences required before uranium can be processed there. Siemens said yesterday that it had no indication when the cases would come to court. The company said that if all the licences were swiftly approved, given that the environmental objections - on the grounds of health threats to local residents - were similar to those rejected yesterday, the plant could be in production within two years. According to its original contracts with Cogema in France, and BNFL in Britain, the Siemens plant is supposed to receive 40 tonnes of plutonium reprocessed abroad up to 2002 which would be turned into 900 tonnes of MOX fuel elements. It is understood that the German electricity utilities who signed the original contracts are now negotiating to have up to 300 tonnes of the MOX elements manufactured abroad, because of the delay in bringing Hanau on stream. The Siemens plant would still be responsible for 600 tonnes.</p>

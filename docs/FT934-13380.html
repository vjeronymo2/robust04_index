			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Brussels plan for 20m jobs needs more than ideas: Flynn proposals may mark a turn in Europe's social agenda IT IS not often that EC commissioners receive spontaneous ovations from their peers at Commission meetings. But Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC's social affairs commissioner, received one last week after spelling out his ideas for creating jobs without dismantling labour protection. These ideas will form the basis of the labour market section of Mr Jacques Delors' White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, to be published next month. Most of the innovations  - such as shifting employers' non-wage labour costs on to the state and paying for them with an EC energy tax  - lie outside the Commission's competence. So it is primarily an exercise in exhortation and setting targets. Reaching the target of 5 per cent EC unemployment by the year 2000, down from the current 10.4 per cent, will require the creation of 20m jobs and looks over-ambitious even if the Commission's proposals are widely adopted. What lies behind the Commission's new thinking on job creation? The labour market reformers around Mr Flynn do not like to use the concept of deregulation  - they see it as being tainted by association with the easy hire-and-fire laws of Britain. But some of Mr Flynn's ideas, articulated in Brussels this week, are not so far away from the views of Britain's Conservatives. Member states should encourage increases in hourly wages below the rate of productivity growth. Member states should reduce the cost of less-skilled labour, especially in the labour-intensive service sector, by cutting taxes and social security contributions and making them more progressive. Competition policy should be reviewed to remove distorting general subsidies to employment. Officials also talk privately about shifting industrial subsidies from large companies  - which now receive the lion's share  - to small and medium-sized businesses. To suspicious European trade unionists much of this will sound like using the language of the left  - solidarity between the employed and the unemployed  - to implement a policy usually associated with the right - restraining labour costs. Mr Flynn's aides would argue that the coupling together of 'solidarity and competitiveness' transcends left and right. 'There is a bit in the White Paper for everyone and there is quite a lot that we do not expect the unions to like. But the key point is how to achieve equity and welfare goals in ways that do not price people out of jobs,' said one official. However, many questions remain unanswered. For example, by what mechanism in a market economy can wage restraint or a reduction in working time by the securely employed be effectively translated into new jobs for the unemployed? Neither does Mr Flynn spell out his idea of 're-regulation' - as opposed to deregulation - to take account of the demise of the steady job for life. He has talked about adapting benefit systems in line with the fact that many new jobs are part-time. But beyond that he has offered only vague generalisations about how working time should be reorganised to respond to workers' new expectations and to fully exploit new capital equipment. Critics concede that more employment intensive growth and a wider sharing of jobs and incomes are laudable goals. But action to reach these goals requires intervening in national labour market regulations, pay-setting systems and welfare regimes, which all have long histories and are not easily disturbed by national governments, let alone the European Commission. British critics would point out that the EC's immediate legislative agenda in the social field - the working time directive and works council - has little to do with job creation. By the year 2000 Mr Flynn will no longer be in Brussels and people will probably have forgotten his 5 per cent unemployment goal, but they might just remember his package of ideas as marking a new turn in Europe's social agenda.</p>

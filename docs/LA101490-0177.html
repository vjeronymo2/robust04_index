			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Azumah Nelson of Ghana used a left jab to keep Juan LaPorte at bay and retain  the WBC super-featherweight title with a unanimous 12-round decision at Sydney,  Australia.  </P> <P> Nelson was pinned on the ropes four times by LaPorte, who had held the title  from 1982-84.  </P> <P> Nelson, who raised his record to 32-2, never hurt LaPorte, who seemed more  annoyed that he couldn't get close enough to do any serious damage to the  champion. Still, Nelson connected often enough to win, 116-112, 116-113 and  115-113, on the three judges' cards.  </P> <P> LaPorte, a 30-year-old, New York-based Puerto Rican whose record fell to 36-11,  felt he had won. But he praised Nelson's successful tactics.  </P></p>

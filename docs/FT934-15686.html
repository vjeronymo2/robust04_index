			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Ministers veto early return to old ERM: Wider bands to remain in place for foreseeable future THERE WILL be no early return to the old European exchange rate mechanism European Community finance ministers agreed after two days of talks this weekend. The talks among EC ministers, central bank governors and top Treasury officials ended with a consensus that the wider fluctuation bands in the ERM will remain in place for the foreseeable future. The agreement that the old ERM will remain unworkable for a time was the main conclusion of a two-day assessment of the consequences of the August 2 European currency crisis. That led to the de facto suspension of the ERM through the introduction of 15 per cent currency fluctuation bands. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, warned ministers meeting in Genval, near Brussels, that the European economy faced low growth and high unemployment until 1996. Although Europe remained capable of a strong rebound, a recovery depended on a fall in EC interest rates, lower employment costs and a stronger dollar. The sober outlook for the EC economies emerged along with signs that the European Commission has abandoned hopes that a 'hard core' of currencies built around the D-Mark might be ready for economic and monetary union by 1997. The ministers, central bank governors and senior Treasury officials rallied behind the goal of greater economic 'convergence' on inflation, budget deficits and interest rates as the precondition for a single European currency. But the UK, France and Germany resisted efforts by the Commission to set specific performance targets to measure the success of their efforts to return to convergence. The 'Big Three' told Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, that they could support only general guidelines on convergence at the EC summit in Brussels in December. Their resistance set back hopes in Brussels that the Commission might be able to use the impending ratification of the Maastricht treaty to draw member states into a more formal co-operation on macro-economic policy. Ministers appeared anxious to avoid the recrimination that has bedevilled relations in the past 12 months, and steered clear of earlier suggestions that capital controls should be considered as a means of strengthening the ERM against speculators. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, said he was still convinced of the need to reinforce the ERM. 'But we also think there are some preconditions to be met before we talk of a return to narrow margins, and one of those is greater convergence.' In an effort to shore up the credibility of the Emu project, ministers expressed support for the introduction by the end of the year of the national legislation for Emu to take effect. The legislation would allow Emu 'stage two' to begin on time on January 1 1994; and it would create the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European central bank. The legislation would ban governments from borrowing indirectly from central banks; bar privileged access by governments to financial institutions; encourage governments to rein in excessive budget deficits and debt; and set out the various contributions of central banks to the EMI.

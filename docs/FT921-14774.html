			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Japanese critical of skill levels in Britain BRITAIN is likely to lose its dominant share of European inward investment from Japanese companies as they start to produce more sophisticated products away from home, according to a report commissioned by the Department of Employment. The report, leaked to the magazine Personnel Today, says that personnel managers in Japanese companies are highly critical of UK skill levels and the poor quality of job candidates. The report was drawn up by the National Training Task Force, the voluntary body set up in 1989 to advise on the establishment of Training and Enterprise Councils. It says 85 per cent of personnel managers in Japanese manufacturing companies in the north-east found that candidates had serious skill shortcomings. In the Midlands and south Wales the figure was about 70 per cent. In Scotland it was five out of 10 and in north Wales four out of 10. According to the report, literacy, numeracy and technical skills are in particularly short supply. Mr Clive Morton, personnel director at Komatsu, said: 'Where investors run into trouble is in starting up with the existing level of skills in Britain. We have a long way to go before we meet the standards of Germany and France.' According to the Japanese External Trade Organisation, 137 Japanese companies are considering investment plans in Germany, compared with 107 in the UK. Britain has so far attracted more than Pounds 12bn in Japanese inward investment, almost half of Japanese investment of the total for Europe. Recently, though, Mitsubishi Electric decided to build a Pounds 500m semiconductor plant in Germany rather than the UK. A separate report in Personnel Today says that Asda, the supermarket group, is reviewing its participation in the government's National Vocational Qualification scheme. Asda, which was a pioneer of the scheme, is reported as saying that the system has become too costly and bureaucratic.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Monday Profile: Whitehall's youngest mandarin - Peter Marsh on the rise of Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the UK Treasury Ahead of next month's Budget, Mr Norman Lamont is not the only person feeling the pressure. While the chancellor will make the important decisions, he will rely heavily for advice on Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury and the great survivor of UK economic policymaking over the past decade. The soccer-loving Sir Terry has been a leading influence on four chancellors since his appointment as the Treasury's chief economic adviser in 1980 by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister. He was promoted to the top Treasury job last April. Views differ over his record. Some see him as the Mr Fixit of the government's economic service, who, through his pragmatic approach and presentational skills, helped lay the ground for a string of election victories for the Tories. Indeed, he has been so closely involved with the Conservative government that some have criticised him for abandoning the traditional non-partisan approach of the civil service. Others say Sir Terry made crucial mistakes in judging the direction of the economy. According to critics, the errors included the failure first to foresee the 1986-88 economic boom, and then to choke it off quickly enough, through monetary or fiscal tightening. The long period of high interest rates which were eventually brought in to dampen the demand explosion almost certainly exacerbated the current recession - the longest since the second world war. Some of the forecasting mistakes seem large - even allowing for the difficulties of economic management and that many of the errors were shared by non-government economists. In November 1987, for instance, the Treasury predicted a 1988 current account deficit of Pounds 3.5bn; it turned out 342 per cent higher at Pounds 15.5bn. The Treasury's mistakes around that time were based on an underestimate of demand and inflationary pressures. But at the start of the recession, it misread the economy in precisely the opposite direction. Thus in November 1990, the Treasury said gross domestic product in 1991 would grow by a modest 0.5 per cent. In the event, as figures last week showed, output slumped by a steep 2.5 per cent, the biggest annual drop since the 1930s. Viewed in terms of the economic developments of the past five years, Sir Terry's record looks less than impressive. But in the debate about what went wrong, he has emerged largely unscathed. Among the less reverent, he is called Teflon Terry. This is not a sobriquet which would appeal to Mr Lamont, who is thought to have a good relationship with his senior official. The chancellor will find Sir Terry's skills invaluable in packaging the March 10 Budget, which is expected to unveil tax cuts that could cheer voters up in time for the general election. But one former Treasury official - with good political connections - is negative about Sir Terry. He says: 'Choosing Terry as permanent secretary may have been a mistake. The things he's good at - macroeconomics and forecasting - are the things that have gone wrong in the past five years. The questions for the 1990s are in microeconomic areas like training, education and public services, where he lacks expertise.' As the recession has dragged on, Sir Terry has undoubtedly been feeling the heat. Lord Croham, who worked as Treasury permanent secretary in the 1970s, says: 'I'm sure Sir Terry feels responsible (for some of the problems of the UK economy), but not enough to push him out of his stride.' Indeed, Sir Terry has in recent months been looking his normal sprightly self - and has told friends he is enjoying his new job. As well as being resilient, Sir Terry is adaptable. Mr Geoffrey Dicks, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School, where Sir Terry once worked, says: 'He's the ultimate insider. Give him the clothes and he'll play the part.' This is despite the fact that in many ways Sir Terry is the antithesis of the traditional, smooth-talking Treasury mandarin. With a working-class background in the industrial north-east and a Geordie accent, Sir Terry is one of only five of the 23 people at permanent-secretary level in the government who did not attend Oxford or Cambridge. At 47, he is also the youngest. On several occasions, Sir Terry has demonstrated flexibility on economic principles. While working in the 1970s as an economist at the LBS - which he joined after an economics degree at Manchester University - Sir Terry followed an approach to the economy based on the then-dominant Keynesian orthodoxy of managing demand through fiscal and monetary tuning. Later in the 1970s, he caught Mrs Thatcher's attention because of his move to a monetarist approach - which emphasised the control of inflation by limiting monetary growth. In the early 1980s, when this policy did not seem to be the answer to Britain's problems, Sir Terry switched to support for the semi-fixed exchange rates of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). He was a leading influence backing ERM entry in October 1990, a step that at one time he had opposed because of the rigidities it would impose on monetary policies. Sir Terry also has a gift for presentation. He lent his name, for example, to the so-called Burns doctrine - according to which the balance of payments is a problem for government, only if the public sector is borrowing. Otherwise it is a problem for the private sector. Sir Terry is also believed to have formulated the argument that many of the Treasury's forecasting mistakes of recent years can be laid at the door of faulty statistics - sharing the responsibility with government statisticians. Some go so far as to say that, under Sir Terry, the Treasury's 100-strong economics unit has become less a dispassionate provider of economic analysis as an uncritical cheer-leader for government policies. One former colleague says: 'By tarring (the economic service) with a Tory brush, he's brought it into disrepute.' By this he means that the unit has not done enough to ask questions about underlying trends in the economy - such as persistent current account deficits and the impact of financial deregulation in the early 1980s in boosting inflation - where the answers might have jarred with ministers' overall laisser-faire approach. Perhaps the key quality about Sir Terry is his management skills, and ability to get on with people. Inside the Treasury he is given credit for an ability to push through decisions and to link up well with other parts of Whitehall. The unpretentious side to his nature is apparent in his support since the 1960s for Queen's Park Rangers, the London soccer club. Mr Richard Thompson, QPR's chairman, says Sir Terry is 'down-to-earth and intelligent'. In spite of Sir Terry's charm, a view has gained ground recently among some Tory MPs and industrialists that Treasury officials have escaped lightly in the debate about the inadequacies of economic policies in recent years. According to this view, Mr Nigel Lawson (chancellor between 1983 and 1989) has taken too much of the responsibility for the errors. One former Bank of England official says: 'I don't see why chancellors should carry the can for poor advice from their officials.' Sir Douglas Hague, a former economic adviser to Mrs Thatcher, says he brought to Sir Terry's attention early in the 1986-88 boom the rising house prices that he felt could trigger a surge in inflation. 'I don't think Terry was wary enough (about inflationary pressures) early enough,' he says. A senior industrialist adds that last year he told Sir Terry that Britain was facing not just a mild recession but a serious one. 'He didn't listen.' Many outside economists find it difficult to square the Treasury's inaccurate forecasting in recent years with Sir Terry's good record at the LBS and in his early days as economic adviser to the Treasury. At the LBS, says one former co-worker, Sir Terry often worked into the small hours, twiddling his computer equations to get predictions that 'felt' right. This person says Sir Terry has lost much of his zeal for accuracy by working too long in the public sector. An intriguing question concerns Sir Terry's future if Labour forms the next government. The official view from Labour is that it would be happy to work with Sir Terry. But some Labour sympathisers - such as Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief European economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house - think Sir Terry is too closely identified with Tory policies to remain in office if Labour won the election. Should this happen - and bearing in mind the different approach that Labour would take to policy areas such as industrial policy and training where the Treasury has a vital say - Sir Terry might once more be called on to make a switch in direction.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1944 Born March 13.

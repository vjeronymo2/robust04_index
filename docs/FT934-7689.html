			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (39): Headlong dash for growth - Profile: China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) MR HUANG JICHEN, vice-president, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) is in an expansive mood - 'we expect total assets to be Yn60bn by the end of 1995 and to reach Yn100bn by the year 2,000,' he says. Size counts in China. Reflecting the central planner's concern with 'output,' rather than profitability or the efficient use of capital, Citic executives still prefer to talk about growth in assets, rather than profits. The company has increased in size greatly since its founding 14 years ago with Mr Rong Yiren - the son of one of China's leading business families of the pre-1949 era - at the helm. At the end of 1992 - the latest year for which financial data is available - Citic's balance sheet had swelled to Yn50.7bn, almost wholly on the basis of borrowings. If the company's first 14 years of operation is any guide then Citic has a good chance of fulfilling its headlong dash for assets growth. Profits, however, are a different matter. At the end of last year the company made a profit of Yn380m, giving it a return on all those assets of just 0.74 per cent - 1 per cent on overseas assets and 0.4 per cent on domestic assets. Losses during the 1980s, especially on US investments in forestry and steel, eroded a grant of Yn5bn made by the Chinese government at Citic's incorporation in 1979. By the end of 1992 the company's total equity (the sum of paid up capital, reserves and retained earnings) was Yn24m greater than the original Yn5bn capital injection. Although Citic appears to the outside world as a western-style company it is really a development bank. Its main role is to bring western technology and business methods to bear on the pressing need to modernise the Chinese economy. Hence the dominant role played by its overseas operations. According to Mr Huang, Citic's foreign operations earn two-thirds of the company's profits and account for half of Citic's assets. Citic is China's largest overseas investor, owning 18 per cent of the country's total investments abroad. Citic has investment in aluminium in Australia, forestry and steel in the US, pulp and paper in Canada, and through Citic Pacific, its listed Hong Kong company, telecommunications, aviation and trading. Not all its investments abroad have gone well but, as Mr Huang, explains it, from adversity valuable lessons in business management have been learned. 'In September, when I was in the US, I met a banker who has had a relationship with our forestry business (Citifor) since the beginning,' he says. 'He had seen the whole process from the start; from when all our equity had been lost to when the company made a profit. With effort Citifor has become profitable, recouped its losses and is now offering up profits to Citic.' Mr Huang said that difficult as these experiences abroad have been they were good for managers. He likens it to a school, adding, 'to train people without practice is just empty words.' He says Citic is paying closer attention to the development of its staff, slipping into language that would warm the heart of any western 'human resources' manager - 'we offer a lot of opportunity to the people here. We are paying a lot of attention to training and offering staff opportunities to play a full role, especially in overseas business.' Citic is also discovering that management and financing techniques used in the west for building large infrastructure projects, such as power stations, are now ripe for use in China. The company is discussing with GEC of Britain and National Power, the UK privatised electricity generation monopoly, the construction a 4 times 600MW power station in Jiaxia City on Hangzhou Bay, based on the 'build, operate and transfer' method so common in Hong Kong. 'The main reason for applying this model is because of China's stage of development,' says Mr Huang. 'We couldn't do it years ago, the fact that we can talk of doing it now shows that reforms and market development have been realised at a higher level. If we look further at the model it will only work if the price of electricity fluctuates according to the market.' Although the early years of the 1990s has witnessed an explosive growth in opportunities for foreign investors in Chinese companies, it is unlikely that Citic itself will ever be listed on a stock exchange. Citic reports directly to the Chinese government's State Council, or Cabinet. It is closely linked with both government and the Communist party at the highest level. Foreigners can gain an exposure to some of Citic's mainland assets through Citic Pacific in Hong Kong. Next year they will also be able to buy equity in Yizhang Chemical Fibre, one of China's biggest synthetic fibre makers in which Citic has a 30 per cent share. This is one on of the nine big Chinese state companies which will be listed in Hong Kong during the first half of next year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CITIC  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CITIC'S total assets in 1992 were Yn50.7bn.

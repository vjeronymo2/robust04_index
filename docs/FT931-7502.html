			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Cottoned on to Benetton pricing Sir, In Haig Simonian's article on Benetton (International Company News, February 17) he quotes Mr Luciano Benetton as saying '. . . important raw materials, such as wool and cotton, have not gone up in price in spite of the lira's fall'. One year ago the price of cotton (Cotton Outlook A Index) was 55.60 cents/lb; currently it is 61.95 cents/lb. The lira-US dollar exchange rate a year ago was L1,218, today it is L1,560. This makes the cost of 1lb of cotton L677 a year ago and L960 now; a rise of 42 per cent. The fall of the lira against the dollar commenced in September 1992 and cotton prices started to rise towards the end of 1992. Certainly it will take time for the full amount of the increase to work through manufacturing costs, because of futures, US dollar covering and inventories. It will be impossible to ask an already shattered cotton textile industry to absorb such an increase. Unless, of course, Mr Benetton would like to see the industry stripped naked too.

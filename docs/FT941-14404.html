			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Net income at Intel soars to Dollars 2.3bn Intel, the US semiconductor maker whose microprocessors are used in most of the world's 100m personal computers, reported sharply higher earnings and revenues for 1993. However, Wall Street regarded the figures as shy of expectations and yesterday the shares closed down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars 62 1/2 . Net income for 1993 was Dollars 2.3bn, the first time the company has broken the Dollars 2bn barrier and more than double the Dollars 1.07bn reported in 1992. Earnings per share more than doubled to Dollars 5.20 compared with Dollars 2.49 last year. Revenues were Dollars 8.78bn, a 50 per cent improvement on the Dollars 5.84bn in 1992. Fourth-quarter revenues and net income, at Dollars 2.39bn and Dollars 594m respectively, were records, although the company said the results had been affected by heavier than usual start-up costs for chip factories in California and Ireland. The figures confirm Intel's position as the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer, ahead of NEC of Japan, and the strength of demand for its most powerful microprocessors, including the new Pentium chip. The company said it intended to maintain momentum with the launch within weeks of a product capable of transforming a conventional PC into a personal videoconferencing system. The kit, including television camera and sound system, would be easily affordable by companies. It would soon be cheap enough for home use. According to Dataquest, a US market research company, Intel's share of the world semiconductor market grew to 9.6 per cent, against 7.8 per cent last year. Mr Andrew Grove, Intel chief executive, said that during 1993, the company had increased production of its leading edge 486/DX2 and Pentium processors and cut prices: 'In 1994, we plan to do more of the same. Our goal is to double the performance of the processors used at key price points.' Intel said strong orders in the fourth quarter should support revenue growth in the first quarter of 1994 and that demand continued to be strong in the PC market place. Europe, which accounted for 28 per cent of sales, last year emerged as the company's fastest growing region with sales of Dollars 2.4bn, up 66 per cent on the 1992 figure of Dollars 1.44bn. Intel has moved ahead of Philips of the Netherlands as Europe's leading semiconductor manufacturer. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec said today Prague espoused both the goals of the  European stability and security pact and the apprehension that  developments in Europe be not affected by tension between  individual states over various problems, including ethnic  minorities.    Speaking after a meeting with his Danish counterpart Niels  Petersen, Zieleniec stressed the need to treat the pact most  responsibly and cautiously. It is necessary to realize that  ill-prepared moves can be "counterproductive" and that they  could unleash processes leading to instability instead of  stability.    The security and stability pact for Europe was submitted by  French Premier Edouard Balladur in June 1993. It is designed to  secure stability and security in Europe, to protect economic and  trade interests of individual countries and to produce  agreements on good neighborhood and respect for ethnic  minorities's rights. The pact would be signed by European  states, the United States and Canada.    Petersen said his government considered the pact a good and  constructive idea. European countries need to solve some  problems with their neighbors and this is a sort of  "preventative diplomacy," he said. Admitting that this may not  be easy, Petersen added the pact could be a valuable  contribution to stability in Europe. He recalled that the  conference on the pact is to open in Paris at the end of May and  that the pact could be signed in Paris in the spring of 1995.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing for Cranbrook THE MERCHANT Navy Officers' Pension Fund will take control of Cranbrook Electronic Holdings, the USM-traded distributor of electronic components, under refinancing proposals put forward by the board, writes Paul Taylor. The proposals require shareholders to write off most of their equity investments. The share quote would also be cancelled. Following the refinancing, which would include the injection of more than Pounds 1m of new equity capital, the pension fund will own 103.8m new shares, or 99.3 per cent of Cranbrook's new equity. Existing other shareholders will end up with the balance. The package was made necessary by Cranbrook's deteriorating financial position which was blamed on 'extremely difficult trading conditions'. A move to call in a receiver was forestalled by the pension fund agreeing to provide Cranbrook with a total of Pounds 150,000 in secured loans.</p>

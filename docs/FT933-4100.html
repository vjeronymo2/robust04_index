			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Canary Wharf set for go-ahead on funding THE JUBILEE Line underground extension to Canary Wharf in east London is almost certain to go ahead, after months of negotiations between banks and the government over the private sector's promised Pounds 400m contribution to the project. A banker to the project said that all material disagreements with the government have now been resolved. The extension was first mooted in 1989. Following the agreement on funding, 11 commercial banks led by Lloyds will today announce details of a complicated financial reconstruction of Canary Wharf, which has been in administration under insolvency procedures for more than a year. The 11 had lent Pounds 600m to fund its construction. The rescue of Canary Wharf - which was built by Olympia &amp; York of Canada, the world's biggest property developer until it collapsed last year - has been dependent on an agreement being reached with the government on building the extension. Banks have been prepared to inject new funds into Canary Wharf only if they could be confident that the Jubilee extension would be built. They regard an underground link to Canary Wharf as vital to its future commercial prospects. As part of the reconstruction, Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants acting as administrators to the project, are providing creditors with details of a proposed settlement of claims. If creditors accept, Canary Wharf would come out of administration under a Company Voluntary Arrangement. It would be the first time that a big company has emerged from administration as a going concern. The European Investment Bank, owned by the European Community, is providing Pounds 98m so that the first two tranches of the private sector's contribution can be made.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [DPA report: "Bundesbank Lowers `Third Prime Rate'"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- The Bundesbank is again loosening  the interest reins in small steps. At its latest security  transactions under repurchase agreement, the Bundesbank  allocated to the banks 14-day money at a marginal interest rate  of 5.41 percent. This is 0.06 percentage points less than last  week. A total of 77 billion German marks [DM] were allocated,  which were set off by expiring transactions of DM79.2 billion.  The overwhelming majority of the allocation was at interest  rates between 5.41 and 5.43 percent. The rate for security  transactions under repurchase agreement is considered to be the  third prime rate of the Bundesbank. Because of the large volume  of these deals it is more important for the money market than  the classical prime rates, the discount and the Lombard rate,  which have been at 5 and 6.5 percent respectively since 15 April.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUNMAN SURRENDERS AFTER 6-HOUR STANDOFF  </P> <P> A distraught man who was apparently upset with his wife held Orange city police  at bay for more than 6 hours Sunday before giving up his revolver and  surrendering, police said. The couple's two small children were with him in the  house, but no one was injured in the incident.  </P> <P> Officers said Robert Stark Jr., 24, was held on a charge of child endangerment  after he surrendered late Sunday morning. The children were temporarily placed  in Orangewood, a county facility for children, police said.  </P> <P> Stark's wife Carol, 22, had returned to their East Washington Avenue apartment  to find that her husband had locked her out. She went to a neighbor's apartment  and called him on the telephone, police said, and Stark told his wife that he  was going to kill her and himself.  </P> <P> She called Orange police, who deployed a Special Emergency Response Team, which  is designed to cope with hostage and barricade situations.  </P> <P> For nearly 5 hours, team members negotiated with Stark, who finally placed his  revolver in the hallway outside the apartment and surrendered with the two  children, a boy 2 years old and a 1-year-old girl.  </P> <P> "He would have never hurt those kids," a neighbor who would not identify  himself said of Stark. "That would be the last thing in the world he would do."  </P> <P> Neighbors said a baby-sitter was watching the children Saturday night. Stark  returned about 10 p.m. and appeared distraught over the whereabouts of his  wife. The baby-sitter told police that Stark had waved a revolver around.  </P> <P> At one point, police heard a shot come from the apartment Sunday.  </P> <P> Several occupants of the apartment complex were evacuated.  </P></p>

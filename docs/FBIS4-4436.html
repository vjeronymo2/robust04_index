			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok] </F>   [Text] The armed ethnic Mon group announced yesterday there  had been "slow progress" in its ceasefire talks with the Burmese  junta and several more rounds of meetings will be needed to  reach a truce.    The second round of negotiations took place from March 20 to  28 at the Burma Army's Southeast Command Headquarters in  Moulmein, capital of the Mon State in southern Burma.    While the five-member Mon delegation tabled a 14-point  agenda  at the first meeting which ended January 3, both sides  eventually agreed to concentrate first on a ceasefire  arrangement.    The Mon announcement came amid strong speculation that talks  between the New Mon State Party (NMSP) and the Burmese junta,  known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc),  had broken down.    The Mon is one of the three remaining ethnic guerilla  movements, which the Slorc has urged to enter peace negotiations.    While the Slorc has already met with the Karenni group, It  has not yet opened talks with them.    The Karenni, the largest armed ethnic group of Karen, have  insisted that ceasefire talks take place outside Burma.    In an interview on Wednesday after their return from  Moulmein, two members of the Mon negotiating team, Nai Tin Aung,  NMSP foreign affairs chief; and Nai Soe Myint, NMSP governor of  Thatun District. said both meetings focused on the military  demarcation line separating territories controlled by Mon forces  and Burmese troops.    They specified five particular areas where the group wants  to  have full control --- the central area of NMSP near Tavoy,  Moulmein, Mergui District, Tavoy District and Thaton District.    The identified territory is home to several hundreds  thousand  ethnic Mon, many of whom support the armed movement.    Although "different points of view" over the demarcation  still existed, Nai Tin Aung said he believed the two sides "can  overcome" their differences.    "The ceasefire is linked to demarcation of Slorc and NMSP  troops. We are still dealing with this.    "So far no agreement has been reached, but slowly we have  made some progress," he said.    A date for the next meeting has been fixed. Nai Tin Aung  said his team has to report back to the NMSP central committee  before a new round of talks could be convened.    The Mon team was led by Maj-Gen Htaw Mon, NMSP secretary of  the war commission.    It also included Col Kaw Rot, a member of the war commission  and Nai Lavi Mon, education department chief.    Burmese Commander for Southeastern Command Maj Gen Ket Sein  headed the Burmese delegation to the two peace forums.    Other delegates were Deputy Commander for Southeastern  Command, Col Aung San, Col Kyaw Win, deputy director of the  powerful Directorate of Defence Services Intelligence (DDSI),  Burmese Military Attache to Bangkok, Col Thein Swe; Lt Col Kyaw  Thein of the DDSI; Southeastern Command Chief of Staff, Lt Col  Soe Htay, and Maj Myo Myint, a senior officer of Military  Intelligence in Moulmein.    After the talks were inaugurated on March 20, the meeting  was  suspended while the Mon negotiators took two days to visit  relatives and local Mon, Nai Tin Aung and Nai Soe Myint sald.    "We explained to them the necessity to enter separate talks  with the Slorc to end the civil war which has been going on for  45 years ...militarily, that is why we entered talks with Slorc  separately," Nai Tin Aung said.    He said political turmoil in Burma needed a two-pronged  approach, first to get a military ceasefire with various armed  ethnic forces, and second to settle political problems with the  participation of all parties concerned.    "But to have peace in Burma, we have to have a political  settlement which must be done collectively by all parties  together," he said.    Despite its pledges to adhere to the principle of collective  peace negotiations with the Slorc laid down by the Democratic  Alliance of Burma. [paragraph as published]    It is a loose umbrella organization of a dozen armed ethnic  and dissident Burmese groups, the NMSP central committee agreed  last November to engage in separate talks with the Slorc.    Nai Tin Aung said the Mon decision was in response to  overtures by Burmese junta leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and that the  group wanted to "test his sincerity."    We considered very deeply his invitation. We think since he  was talking about peace we should accept it.    "We need to test his sincerity," he added.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING RED LIGHTS  </P> <P> Within weeks of moving to Los Angeles I realized that there are only two rules  that govern traffic flow on the streets here:  </P> <P> 1. Red lights and green lights are optional.  </P> <P> 2. Yellow means speed up.  </P> <P> Anarchy reigns on the streets of Los Angeles and Frankel was absolutely right  to question our ability to comply with the more invasive forms of regulations  on the horizon. Traffic and police authorities should heed well his call for  enforcement of existing laws.  </P> <P> But as individual drivers we must also make a commitment to obey these laws, no  matter how much it hurts our pride and our drive time.  </P> <P> KETA HODGSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

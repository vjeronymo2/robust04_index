			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Tec offers loans for training A TRAINING and Enterprise Council is offering interest-free loans to employers and employees making a joint investment in training. Stockport and High Peak Tec, based in Greater Manchester, is offering the loans to finance individuals in small companies who ask employers to contribute towards off-the-job training. Mr Trevor Jones, chief executive of the Tec, said the scheme was aimed at companies employing fewer than 50 which often did not have much money for training. The Tec hopes the initiative will come from individuals who want to enhance their skills. With the approval of their employer they would seek a contribution of at least 20 per cent towards the cost of the training. After an application has been approved by the Tec, the individual will receive a voucher to pay the training provider for the course. The individual and their employer would pay back the cost to the Tec over 18 months. Mr Jones said that if successful the scheme had national relevance at a time when the use of vouchers, or entitlements, was being extended.</p>

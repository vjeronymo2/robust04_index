			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Banks' Bombay exposure raised THE total problem exposure of banks involved in the Bombay securities market scandal is Rs40.2bn (Pounds 873.9m), or Rs4.8bn larger than originally estimated, according to a report published at the weekend by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank. The reserve bank, in its fourth report on the affair, raised its estimate after months of investigations of the books of banks and stockbrokers involved in the scandal. The affair, which erupted last April, has prompted the resignation of a cabinet minister, the arrest of about 20 people and heavy losses for some banks, including Standard Chartered Bank of the UK. The banks lost money mainly through extending credit to brokers in the fast-growing and lightly-supervised inter-bank securities market. The four foreign banks most active in the market were Citibank and Bank of America of the US, ANZ Grindlays and Standard Chartered. The report published at the weekend confirmed previous findings that banks knowingly evaded reserve bank guidelines by giving brokers wide freedom to invest borrowed funds in the stock market - both for banks' own accounts and for clients. The report concentrates on the roles of Standard Chartered and ANZ Grindlays, having singled out the two American-owned banks for detailed treatment in an earlier study. The investigators say Standard Chartered surrendered discretionary control of funds to Mr Hiten Dalal, a broker, in return for guaranteed returns on their money. The report says the arrangements were made in full knowledge of senior management at Standard Chartered. 'Standard Chartered has been carrying on its securities transactions in total contravention of reserve bank guidelines and in violation of the norms of prudent banking,' says the reserve bank, in one of the strongest criticisms contained in the report. Standard Chartered has previously admitted breaking guidelines and violating prudential norms. It has put the blame principally on relatively junior executives and on inadequate supervision by their immediate superiors. Grindlays for its part was closely involved with Mr Harshad Mehta, another important Bombay broker nick-named Big Bull for his perpetual optimism. The report says the extent of Grindlay's connection with Mr Mehta was camouflaged by the fact that payments from other banks were deposited directly into Mr Mehta's accounts at Grindlays without specific instructions to do so. This created the impression that the transactions involved banks only, when in fact they involved Mr Mehta. All four foreign banks named in reserve bank reports have moved senior managers out of India since the scandal erupted.</p>

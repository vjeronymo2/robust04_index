			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cathay makes Pounds 28m placing to fund Beijing development CATHAY International, a China-based property developer formerly known as Stonehill Holdings, yesterday announced a Pounds 28.4m placing to fund developments in Beijing and Shenzhen. The company is spending Pounds 19.6m to buy a 60 per cent stake in a joint venture to upgrade a hotel and build office, retail and residential space on a 500,000 sq m site in the Haidian district of Beijing. The Beijing Xiyuan Hotel, owned by the Beijing municipal government, will have a 35 per cent interest in the joint venture, in return for supplying the site. Beijing Jin Peng Property Development, a financial arm of the Beijing municipal government, has agreed to subscribe about Pounds 1.6m in cash for a 5 per cent stake in the company. Mr James Buchanan, chairman of Cathay International, said the deal was 'a rare opportunity' to obtain an interest in land use and development rights over a large site in central Beijing. He said its attractions were enhanced by the growth in the number of visitors to Beijing, the rapid increase in direct foreign investment there and the economic potential of the area. The project, expected to be completed in 1999, will begin with the construction of two office towers providing 70,500 sq m of floor space. The Xiyuan Hotel and site have been valued at Pounds 53m and Pounds 171m respectively, after taking account of its development potential. The rest of the proceeds, some Pounds 8.8m, will be used to help fund Cathay's existing development, the Fuyuan Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen. The placing and open offer involves 48.8m shares at 62 1/2 p per share. The open offer is on a 4-for-19 basis.</p>

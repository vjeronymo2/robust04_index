			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Foreign Policy Program of the </F> Hungarian Christian Democratic People's Party -- a Lasting and  Just Peace"]    [Text] With the approach of the parliamentary elections,  the parties are presenting their foreign policy programs, and  our newspaper is trying to regularly inform its readers about  these programs.    The national minority policy of the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP] is determined by the key words of equality  in chances, positive discrimination, collective rights, and  autonomy, Attila Zalan Csenger, head of the KDNP Department of  International Relations, said in a lecture at the Hungarian  Foreign Affairs Society on 16 March.    According to the program, in formulating its foreign policy  guidelines, the KDNP aimed at supporting a lasting and just  peace in Europe as a long-term goal, a peace based on the  infallibility of man's dignity acquired through creation, human  rights, and the right of all nations to self determination.  Respect for man's basic rights is one of the starting points of  Christian democracy, and this is the common basis of mankind's  coexistence. The autonomy of nations is one condition for this  and also the need to respect the personal conviction of other  communities and the members of their own community.    Therefore, no country is allowed to violate the human and  freedom rights by referring to sovereignty. The KDNP regards  these principles as particularly important to "middle" Europe  because this region will remain one of the biggest sources of  danger until the end of this century and, at the same time, we  must take into consideration the fact that the interest of  Western Europe toward us will decrease proportionally with the  instability of our region.    The security policy of the KDNP aims at avoiding wars and  military conflicts and preserving peace. Therefore, we must try  to fully make use of the possibilities given by the Partnership  for Peace and the European Stability Agreement. Of course, the  final goal of the Hungarian foreign policy continues to be the  obtaining of full NATO membership.    According to the KDNP, Hungary does not have an outstanding  border issue in the traditional sense of the word because our  borders are determined by international agreements, but we still  have to to a lot together with our neighbors to make our borders  more open. The KDNP considers the stipulations included in the  Helsinki Final Document as relevant to our borders. The  Christian democrats are of the opinion that based on our common  interests and values, we must become full members of the  European Union, as the political, economic, and security corner  stone of the new Europe. For this, we must give content to our  association agreement and Hungary should submit its request for  full membership as soon as possible.    Regarding the national minorities, the political and social  organizations of the ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders  have been created and have become stronger in the past two  years. In connection with these minorities, Hungarian foreign  policy should strive to support their principled and political  goals with its moral weight.</p>

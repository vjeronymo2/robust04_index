			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Bekker report in the "Projects" column: "Boris </F> Fedorov Has Appealed to Boris Yeltsin. The Ex-Minister Proposed  to Use the Law to Protect Consumers' Rights in the Sphere of  Financial Services"]    [Text] The recently proliferating "instances of collapse  and outright fraud on the part of such financial establishments  as the Independent Oil Concern, Fisko, and Impulsinvest" has  prompted State Duma subcommittee chairman Boris Fedorov to turn  to Boris Yeltsin. The former finance minister drew the  president's attention to the fact that apart from material  losses, thousands of defrauded citizens are losing trust in the  reforms and the policy pursued by the head of state.    The emergence and collapse of "scam" companies is the result  of weak legislative regulation; moreover, state bodies, in Mr.  Fedorov's opinion, have shunned decisive action. This situation  is used by the media, spreading advertisements for a multitude  of dubious firms.    Invoking his right to initiate legislation, deputy Fedorov  officially submitted to the State Duma a draft law On Protecting  Consumers' Rights in the Sphere of Financial Services. The  author subsumes under the category of financial services  soliciting deposits, conclusion of contracts on any forms of  monetary fund management, and any form of mediation in  securities operations. Said services may be provided both in the  Russian national currency and in foreign exchange. These  services may be provided only based on a license issued by the  Central Bank, the Finance Ministry, or another regulating body.    To make sure that the consumer does not make a blind choice,  an article in Fedorov's draft obligates the provider of  financial services to present all the relevant information, an  unambiguous description of his services, and the actual interest  rate on income or fixed dividend at an annual rate, if such is  guaranteed. For its part the Central Bank and government  institutions, in order to curb the activity of bogus firms,  shall verify, on requests from private citizens or corporate  entities, the authenticity of financial services offered by  their organizers.    The Central Bank and the Finance Ministry must regularly  publish both "black" and "white" lists of firms that have  received licenses and forfeited the right to operate on the  financial services market. "Violators of the convention" are to  be fined to the extent of 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage.  Punishment is also to be apportioned to directors of media  outlets that have advertised subsequently banned firms providing  such "services." The fine, however, is envisioned at only half  the above rate. It is extremely important that "in the event  that the activity by an organization offering financial services  is suspended...the body responsible for this decision...be  obliged to take all possible measures to protect the impounded  funds, including from inflation...by temporarily investing them  in reliable and sufficiently profitable financial market  instruments."    Noting that its passage through the Duma can drag out, Boris  Fedorov asked Boris Yeltsin to use this draft in preparing a  corresponding presidential edict.</p>

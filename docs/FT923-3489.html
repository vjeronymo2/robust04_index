			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bunzl on recovery road with 8.5% gain BUNZL, the paper and packaging group under new management for the last year, reported a 8.5 per cent increase in profits for the half year to June 30. The rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20m to Pounds 21.7m, was the first since 1988. A series of disposals led to a fall in sales to Pounds 619.2m (Pounds 693.4m). Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said: 'This is the first solid step to the road to recovery. After a year we have rationalised the businesses, disposed of the margin companies and made a few selective acquisitions.' Trading profit before exceptionals increased to Pounds 27m (Pounds 26m) with margins rising from 3.7 per cent to 4.4 per cent. Bunzl's biggest earner, the paper and plastics division, reported increased profits of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 12.6m). A cost reduction programme in its key US subsidiary helped push margins up by 1.4 percentage points to 5.2 per cent. Profits from fine paper fell from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 7.6m. The group is expanding in Germany but the overall fine paper market is declining. Building supplies profits were Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 700,000) helped by closing lossmaking plants. However, return on capital was 4.3 per cent, significantly lower than the double figures achieved by the other divisions. Mr Habgood said the business still had to prove itself. Cigarette filters fell slightly to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.2m). The division is to open a US plant next year. Plastic products rose to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3m), as the improved performance from US businesses offset disappointing results in Brazil. Borrowings over the year to June 30 were reduced from Pounds 126m to Pounds 97.7m, representing gearing of 47.8 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 2.7p to 3.2p. The dividend is maintained at 1.8p. COMMENT It is not often that a company which disappointed the City in the roaring eighties produces better-than-expected results in the difficult nineties. A well executed disposal programme has enabled the group to concentrate on its core-businesses. Mr Habgood has made it clear that the weakest parts of the group, such as building materials, remain on trial. In the meantime paper and plastics will continue to expand. With forecast pre-tax profits for the year of Pounds 44m, giving earnings per share of 6.5p, the shares, up 2p to 89p, are on a slightly higher than average prospective multiple of 13.5. This factors in the weak dollar, affecting a little more than half of pre-tax profits. It still does not look like a strong buy but the potential to move forward means the shares are, at the very least, fairly valued.</p>

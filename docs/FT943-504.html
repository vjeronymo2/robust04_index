			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / 'Favours' blamed for putting Indonesia in second division: Accusations of politically motivated protection Most economists agree that Indonesia is poised to join its neighbours in the newly industrialised economy ranks. Average annual economic growth of 6.6 per cent over the last 25 years has earned the country a reputation for stability and promising growth. However, disgruntled Indonesians say public and private monopolies that enjoy high tariff protection are an impediment to faster growth. With nearby Thailand and Malaysia averaging growth rates of between 8 and 10 per cent a year, and an even faster pace in China, they are saying that 6.6 per cent is not good enough. Most recently, they point to a presidential decree giving tariff protection to a Dollars 1.7bn petrochemical plant in West Java, called Chandra Asri. The plant, due to come on stream next year, will produce olefin products for the first time in Indonesia. The decree prevents cheaper olefin products from entering the country. It emerged that the plant is jointly owned by Mr Prayogo Pangestu, a well-connected tycoon with a majority stake in the big timber company PT Barito Pacific Timber, and President Suharto's son, Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo. Private-sector economists and opposition parties complain that decisions on protection are arbitrary, with policy-makers favouring their close contacts. Protection, they complain, depends on political favouritism rather than economic logic. Economists point to several of the country's largest industries, such as food processing, petrochemicals and pulp and paper, all of which have been protected for decades by tariff barriers and import bans. They say that this could be costing the economy as much as 2 per cent in annual growth. 'In the context of Indonesia, which is seeking to become a more competitive exporter, these barriers have a very important knock-on effect because they increase the cost of raw materials to downstream industries,' says a Jakarta-based economist. The government has stood its ground on protection for the Chandra Asri plant. Mr Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, state minister for investment, says the tariff protection is necessary because industries such as Chandra Asri take a long time to make adequate returns on their investments. President Suharto says protection for industries is a temporary measure. The issue is made more sensitive by the fact that most of the largest Indonesian conglomerates are controlled by ethnic Chinese and there is growing resentment at their dominant role in private business. There is also a more general assault on the role of 'big business' in Indonesia's economy. Monopolies in key sectors are being seen as preventing smaller companies from setting up, thus limiting the benefits of growth to a small portion of Indonesia's 187m people. 'It should be a level playing field but those who are benefiting the most are the big players,' says Mr Laksamana Sukardi, a prominent member of the opposition Democratic Party, the PDI. 'That has accelerated the accumulation of wealth in a few hands.' The government is not immune to these criticisms. Efforts have been made to reduce tariffs and liberalise the economy. Earlier this year a trade liberalisation package cut import duties on 739 goods, lifted non-tariff barriers on 27 commodities and removed import surcharges in 108 items. Many market-skewing measures remain, however. In the food-processing industry, for example, the government controls the price of sugar, which keeps the cost of a key raw material artificially high. The pulp and paper industry is another that comes under intermittent attack. The domestic industry is dominated by the Sinar Mas group, Indonesia's second-largest conglomerate. The influence of Sinar Mas and other Indonesian paper manufacturers has been sufficiently strong to ensure a 40 per cent tariff on imported paper. Indonesian printers complain that paper accounts for 70 per cent of their production costs, and many smaller printers have been forced to close. 'There needs to be further deregulation but this has been met with a lot of resistance in the government because (many) areas of the economy deliver huge profits to key economic players,' says a Jakarta-based economist. The government is aware of the complaints and ministers advise patience: 'We are going in the right direction,' says Mr Tunky Ariwibowo, minister of industry. But economists complain that there is no timetable for phasing out tariffs. 'It does moves slowly here compared with other south-east Asian economies but deregulation has been a consistent policy,' says a Jakarta-based consultant. 'You have to remember that in a 10-year period Indonesia has moved from a highly-protected import substitution economy to an export-oriented economy.'</p>

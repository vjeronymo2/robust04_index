			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Loss and dividend cut sinks Fairline shares SHARES IN Fairline Boats, the leisure power boat group, yesterday lost a quarter of their value after falling demand pushed the Peterborough-based group into losses and forced a cut in the interim dividend. In the six months to end-April, Fairline incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 613,000, against profits of Pounds 2.1m, on sales down 36 per cent at Pounds 12.3m. The interim dividend is halved to 3.575p as earnings per share of 41.9p gave way to losses of 11.8p. The share price fell 103p to 325p. 'People need to start making money in the their small businesses again for demand to pick up,' said Mr Sam Newington, chairman. While there were signs of renewed interest, the turn down in the German economy, where the group had 30 per cent of its sales, was worrying. The fall in demand had been most noticeable in the smaller boats and appeared to be internationally spread. According to Volvo, there had been a 60 per cent decline in marine engine sales in the US and a 40 per cent fall in Europe since 1988. Demand for the most expensive models, costing about Pounds 600,000, was most resilient. Mr Newington said he was also concerned about changes to European Community VAT rules. From next January, anybody buying in one EC country and exporting it to another will no longer be able to claim VAT exemption. Member state governments would individually decide whether to levy VAT on boats already based in their countries, a move which would lead to disruption in the market. The net cash balance was nearly halved from Pounds 3m at the same period last year before taking into account the June tax payment. Mr Newington said the group was not altering its strategy of having gone up market with larger boats. In the short term there was no option but to batten down the hatches and wait for the recession to pass.</p>

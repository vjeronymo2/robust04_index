			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, April 25 (AFP) -- A man hijacked an Ethiopian  airliner as it took off from Saudi Arabia for Addis Ababa on  Monday, but freed all 148 passengers and surrendered when the  plane landed in Yemen, the interior ministry said here.    Blaya Mashasha, an Ethiopian, entered the cockpit  immediately  after take-off at dawn in Jeddah and demanded that the pilot fly  to London, a ministry statement quoted by the official Yemeni  news agency SABA said.    The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 757 had been scheduled to fly  to the Ethiopian capital.    Authorities in Jeddah and Djibouti refused it permission to  land, but after two hours the Yemeni authorities said it could  land at Sanaa airport "for humanitarian reasons, because the  fuel was in danger of running out," the ministry said.    "After great efforts and discussions between the Yemeni  authorities and the hijacker all the passengers were freed. The  pilot and co-pilot remained on the plane, but were finally freed  at 1:00 p.m. (1000 GMT)."    The authorities started questioning the hijacker, but no  details were released about his motives nor the circumstances of  his surrender.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Pergau dam row forces spending protocol change The government has made an important concession in the wake of the Pergau dam scandal by ruling that an independent accountancy watchdog must be informed of any disagreement between a cabinet minister and permanent secretary over expenditure plans. The ruling, which was revealed in an official document prepared by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, follows a disagreement between officials at the Foreign Office in 1991 over whether Britain should contribute to the Pergau project. Mr Dorrell's decision will mean that any minister officially overruling a top civil servant on expenditure matters will have to inform Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor-general. This will in effect mean that such a disagreement could quickly be debated by MPs on the Commons' public accounts committee, which first asked the government to examine procedures in such cases. The change to procedure, which came to light in recently published Treasury minutes, follows a disagreement at the Foreign Office in February 1991 over whether money from Britain's aid budget should be sent Malaysia. Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, told Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that he would not authorise spending on Pergau. Mr Hurd issued a ministerial direction, overruling Sir Timothy's advice and in effect forcing him to sign the cheques for the deal.</p>

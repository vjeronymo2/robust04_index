			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 18 (MTI) -- "We believe that those who  voted for the Socialist Party in the first round of  parliamentary elections on May 8 wanted a change and considered  us to be a predictable, open and expert party," Hungarian  Socialist Party (HSP) [MSZP] deputy chairman Imre Szekeres told  a press conference in Tiszaujvaros (E Hungary) on Wednesday.    The HSP would like to see Hungary ruled by a coalition  government pursuing three major foreign-policy aims: rapid  integration with European structures, including NATO; normalized  relations with neighbouring countries; and ensuring autonomy for  cross-border Hungarian minorities.    "It would be good if the country had a fully-formed new  government by late June or early July. The HSP is ready to  conduct expeditious coalition talks in public," Szekeres said.</p>

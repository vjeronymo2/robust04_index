			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> COMPUTER COMPANIES FIGHTING A LEGAL BATTLE OVER MICROPROCESSOR PATENTS  </P> <P> Gilbert Hyatt, the La Palma researcher who shook the computer industry two  weeks ago when he announced that he had received a patent for inventing the  microprocessor after a 20-year legal fight, isn't the only one seeking  royalties on microchip technology.  </P> <P> Stan Victor, spokesman for Texas Instruments Inc., said the company is seeking  to enforce nine microprocessor-related patents that cover basic functions such  as how a computer's overall system interacts with a microprocessor -- the  "brains" of a computer and many other electronic devices.  </P> <P> Unlike Hyatt, TI is seeking to enforce patents covering specific microprocessor  functions rather than a patent on the basic device itself.  </P> <P> "We do not think the Hyatt patent will have any effect on our litigation with  Zenith Data Systems Corp.," Victor said. TI sued Zenith Data in December for  patent infringement.  </P> <P> And on Friday, Tandy Corp. filed suit against TI, alleging that the  Dallas-based firm has violated antitrust laws and has charged excessive fees to  companies that want to license TI's patented microprocessor technology. Victor  said the suit is a "typical counterclaim" without merit.  </P> <P> Victor added, however, that TI claims to hold the basic patent on the invention  of the microprocessor through a patent granted to TI engineer Gary W. Boone on  Sept. 4, 1973.  </P> <P> He said the company is not yet challenging Hyatt's patent claim in court. But  with TI unwilling to accept the ruling by the patent office, the two sides  could be headed for a showdown.  </P> <P> Tandy contends TI's patent is invalid because TI's version of the  microprocessor was invented after other parties had already invented it.  </P></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Disney to offer theme holidays on cruise ships Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, announced yesterday that it was to enter the cruise vacation business by offering holidays afloat as part of a package with its Florida theme parks. It said it hoped to launch the first Disney cruise ship in 1998, with a second following soon after. Each would be a 'mega ship' carrying about 2,400 passengers, indicating a purchase price of about Dollars 300m a vessel. Disney said cruise holidays were a popular and growing segment, and that operating its own cruise line would allow it to bring a new dimension of entertainment to its guests. The ships will offer a variety of entertainments featuring Disney characters and themes. During the voyage they will also call at an exclusive Disney island for a day-long excursion. Cruises will be offered as part of one-week holiday packages comprising three or four days aboard the vessel and the balance of the week at the Disney World theme parks in Florida. Departure points and ports of call have not yet been established, but Disney said the vessels would visit various places in the Caribbean. On their return to Florida, passengers would be provided with transport direct to Disney World hotels. Disney said it had no plans at present to offer cruise vacations except as part of packages with its theme parks. However, it might consider linking cruises with other Disney theme parks.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Labatt says it might sell some entertainment units John Labatt, one of Canada's two big brewing groups, has raised the possibility of selling parts of its CDollars 1bn (Dollars 700m) entertainment businesses. These would include the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club, the Toronto Argonauts football club and broadcasting assets. The remaining interests would then be packaged in a new company, 49 per cent of which might be sold to the public, said Mr George Taylor, president of Labatt. The timing of any such offer, however, would have to await improved stock market conditions. Mr Taylor told analysts in Toronto that the proceeds from the asset sales, around CDollars 500m, would be put in to brewing and other entertainment acquisitions. Labatt has been unhappy with the performance of its sports, broadcasting and entertainments businesses. The company earned CDollars 155m, or CDollars 1.53 a share, in the year ended April 30, up from CDollars 133m, or CDollars 1.32, in fiscal 1993, from continuing operations. Sales rose 9 per cent to CDollars 2.32bn. Brewing earnings were ahead by 19 per cent, while the broadcasting, sports and entertainment units contributed CDollars 32m, against CDollars 56m.</p>

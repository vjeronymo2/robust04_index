			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Investment banks resign as advisers to Shandwick SHANDWICK, one of the world's biggest public relations firms, has been hit by the unexpected resignation of two leading UK investment banks as its advisers. Morgan Grenfell resigned as Shandwick's merchant bank and Warburg Securities quit as its stockbroker just as the City was setting off for its Christmas holidays. 'Morgan and Warburg felt they had not been kept properly informed about Shandwick's worsening financial performance', said a financier with a close knowledge of the deteriorating relationship between the firms. 'We think we kept people properly informed', commented Mr Peter Gummer, Shandwick's founder, who has been giving public relations advice to Mr John Major, the prime minister. Three weeks ago, Shandwick's market value more than halved during a single day when it announced that it expected to make a Pounds 1m loss for the 15 month period to October 31. However, only six months ago Shandwick was much more optimistic about its prospects and announced that interim profits had risen by 12 per cent to Pounds 8.12m. Shandwick's share price has plummeted from 145p in late November to 43p last night, wiping more than Pounds 80m off its market capitalisation. The financier added that the relationship between Shandwick and the City firms had been difficult for some time. 'There was a history to their decision to quit,' he said. A year ago, Mr Gummer came in for intense criticism from shareholders over a proposal he put forward to sell 2m of his own Shandwick shares to a scheme for rewarding his employees - or Esop - at 90p a share. Shareholders felt the Esop should have offered to buy shares from all of them, not just from Mr Gummer. In the event, Mr Gummer sold 1.25m shares to the Esop at the lower price of 51p a share. Mr Gummer, brother of Mr John Gummer, the Conservative cabinet minister, said he had already found a replacement for Morgan in the form of Lazard Brothers and expected to appoint a new stockbroker 'within a matter of days'. He blamed a worldwide recession for the deterioration in the firm's financial performance. In order to cope with the drop in business, he had had to reduce staff numbers by 200 'very recently', out of 2,000 in total. Shandwick's rivals are all braced for a difficult year, following the rapid expansion of their industry during the 1980s. It is understood, however, that Warburg retains confidence in Mr Gummer's ability to groom its image and is keeping the firm as its own public relations adviser.</p>

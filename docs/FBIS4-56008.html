			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak National Party Chairman Jan Slota and </F> Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes by Bohumil Olach; place and date  not given: "Is the Slovak National Party Going Back?; Possible  Background of a Surprising Recommendation"]    [Text] The Slovak National Party [SNS] Central Council  made two important decisions on 14 May, albeit only in the form  of recommendations for the delegates to the forthcoming party  assembly. The first recommendation concerns an amendment to the  SNS statutes, which should make it absolutely clear that the SNS  is a national party. This would actually represent a return to  the SNS statutes in the form in which they existed before  Ludovit Cernak's chairmanship. The proposal that only a Slovak  be allowed to be party member aroused particular interest.    SNS Chairman Jan Slota expressed this in the following  terms:    "....we have clearly laid down that only a member of the  Slovak nation can be member of the SNS."    [Olach] No one of a different nationality can join the  party?    [Slota] Probably not, assuming that the assembly approves  the statutes in this form. The SNS is a national party and it  is its national character that we must guard first and foremost.  We are one of the purest national states, with 85 percent of  the people living in Slovakia being Slovaks.    [Olach] Will this not be damaging to the party's reputation?    [Slota] This will be used as an argument by people who wage  a struggle against everything national. When France passed a  law enforcing French in a tough way, no one from the Council of  Europe protested.    [Olach] How do you intend to check the Slovak nationality of  your members?    [Slota] You are now taking me at my word. When someone says  that he is a Slovak, we will believe him. We do not have the  staff to investigate those things.    [Olach] SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes, who lost to Jan  Slota the contest for SNS chairmanship after the post had been  vacated by Ludovit Cernak, is more tolerant regarding the  requirement for party members to be of Slovak nationality.    [Prokes] In no case will there be any nationalist  tendencies. We want to uplift the Slovak nation, which does not  mean that we are going to suppress anyone.    [Olach] However, the fact that only a member of the Slovak  nation can join the party limits the rights of other  nationalities.    [Prokes] This depends on the definition of terms. The  proposal for changes to the party statutes refers to members of  the Slovak nation and to Slovaks respectively. When a citizen  of the Slovak Republic fills in a form in a Western country, it  is common for him to write "Slovak" in the "nationality" [last  word in English] column.    [Olach] Hence, the SNS is not closing its doors to  minorities, in your opinion?    [Prokes] In my opinion, it is not.    [Olach] It thus seems that the demand [that SNS membership  be restricted to Slovaks] is aimed more at satisfying the  membership base than as a declarative demand aimed at the  general public and that no one will be expelled from the SNS  because of his non-Slovak nationality. And, indeed, why should  he, given the fact that -- according to pre-election polls --  the SNS must fear for its place in parliament (in the last poll  it received 4 percent). All the more surprising was the second  recommendation of the SNS Central Council to the forthcoming  assembly, namely that the SNS enter the elections independently.  It was expected that the SNS would form a coalition with the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], which would  automatically guarantee its place in parliament. According to  Jan Slota, this decision was not rash but the result of many  rounds of talks and many analyses. It should supposedly benefit  both the SNS and the HZDS.    There is talk about Vladimir Meciar's objections to you on  the ground of your excessive nationalist radicalism.    [Slota] I raised also this issue in my talks with Vladimir  Meciar. He always replied that he did not have any  reservations. I realize, however, that a coalition with our  party is unacceptable to some HZDS supporters. We have figured  out that both the HZDS and we will gain more if we enter the  elections on our own.    [Olach] Are you not afraid of failing to cross the 5-percent  threshold needed to get into the parliament?    [Slota] Not in the least. The Slovak spirit is not dead.  Developments in southern Slovakia will help us.    [Olach] Mr. Slota is alluding here to the prepared bills on  [birth and marriage] registers and bilingual signs, which,  according to the SNS, are the product of a secret pact with the  ethnic Hungarian political parties. Slovaks living in  ethnically mixed territories along with citizens of Hungarian  nationality are to be the main "target" of the SNS campaign.    [Slota] Those 800,000 Slovaks are totally endangered. The  state-forming nation must fear on its own territory for its bare  existence. The Magyarization continues uninhibited.    [Olach] Jan Slota also mentions the argument, heard before,  about "Hungarian money from Budapest," for which 60 to 70  percent of the property [in ethnically mixed areas] in the first  wave of privatization was privatized. This can supposedly be  proven in the pertinent companies. The SNS expects much from  its educational policy. According to Jan Slota, the party's  idea of tackling the problem of education in southern Slovakia  is: "I swear by God, if we gain a fair percentage of the vote,  we will resolve this problem in a fundamental way."    [Olach] But a solution at the expense of already existing  schools with Hungarian as the language of instruction would  surely be of no benefit!    [Slota] Believe me, we are going to resolve this as a  priority and at any price. In every little village in which  there is only one little Slovak pupil, this Slovak pupil must be  taught in Slovak.    [Olach] Well, the SNS is obviously playing the "Hungarian  card." But so does the HZDS, which will not be to the benefit  of peaceful inter-ethnic relations. It is scarcely imaginable  that the two parties will not compete [for the same type of  voter]. It seems, however, that something like a little faction  of Jozef Prokes is taking shape within the SNS, which supports a  coalition with the HZDS. During the vote on the proposal to  enter the elections independently, this faction abstained. How  does Jozef Prokes, as a member of Vladimir Meciar's shadow  cabinet, see the situation?    [Prokes] In my opinion, the sum total of votes would be  greater if we formed a coalition with the HZDS.    [Olach] Everything will be decided at the SNS assembly in  Komarno on 4 June. It seems, however, that SNS deputies have  already become used to cooperating with the HZDS and some of  them, such as Jozef Prokes and Marian Andel, also to posts in  the cabinet, even if today it is only a shadow one. They  perceive the chance of winning seats in the government as more  realistic when the SNS enters the election in tandem with the  HZDS.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTHY DODGERS WIN, 3-0;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: MORGAN NO-HITS PHILLIES INTO THE SIXTH INNING, THEN WITHSTANDS  EIGHTH- AND NINTH-INNING RALLIES TO RUN HIS RECORD TO 4-1.  </P> <P> Surely the Dodgers, being a group of sensible millionaires, aren't buying Tom  Lasorda's constant, impassioned rhetoric about how they can survive despite  injuries to the heart of their team.  </P> <P> Or are they?  </P> <P> The Dodgers won again, 3-0, Saturday over Philadelphia and left their manager  hoarse again in the process. The victory included:  </P> <P>  -- A pitcher, who entered the season with three shutouts in 197 major league  appearances, throwing his second shutout in two weeks.  </P> <P>  -- Two hitters, who had not hit a home run in the previous two weeks,  combining to hit the Dodgers' first back-to-back homers in nearly a year.  </P> <P>  -- A center fielder making the defensive play of the game near the left-field  foul line.  </P> <P> "I've reminded them and reminded them, and I'm going to keep reminding them,"  Lasorda said quietly. "We will battle. We will not stop believing. No matter  who we lose, we can still win."  </P> <P> Before 25,290 at Veterans Stadium, Mike Morgan showed he believes. In winning  for the fourth time in five starts while lowering his earned-run average to  1.40, he held the Phillies hitless until Len Dykstra singled with one out in  the sixth inning. Then Morgan cooly survived eighth- and ninth-inning rallies  for his second shutout in 12 days.  </P> <P> "In the past, he would be looking over his shoulder down at the bullpen,  looking for help," second baseman Willie Randolph said. "But now, he knows can  he it himself. He knows he can shut it down himself. So he does."  </P> <P> Morgan was probably the only person in the park not visibly moved by the two  outside forces that helped him to his victory.  </P> <P> In the second inning -- after Eddie Murray's single off starter and loser Ken  Howell -- Hubie Brooks and Mike Scioscia unloaded consecutive home runs. It was  the Dodgers' first back-to-back homers since May 14, 1989. Those home runs also  were in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> It was Brooks' first homer and only his third and fourth runs batted in since  April 20. It was Scioscia's first homer and only his fourth RBI since April 17.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I start to think about it, and it bothers me when I am leaving guys on  base," said Brooks, who leads the team with five home runs and 15 RBIs.  </P> <P> Remember last winter when Juan Samuel said it bothered him to play center  field? He betrayed that opinion Saturday in the Dodgers' other big play, one  that made Lasorda marvel.  </P> <P> "Did you see that?" Lasorda asked. "Did you see him hustle?"  </P> <P> It was in the seventh inning, when Morgan found trouble after Ricky Jordan beat  out a slow roller to third base. John Kruk followed with a fly ball to the  left-field wall. Kal Daniels leaped in vain as the ball bounced off the wall  and back over his head toward the infield.  </P> <P> It was a certain double that may have scored Jordan . . . except Samuel was  there to catch that bounce. He ran over from center field to a spot less than  30 feet from the left-field foul line.  </P> <P> Jordan, rounding second and heading for third, was stunned. Samuel threw to  third baseman Lenny Harris, who began a rundown play in which Jordan was tagged  out. Dickie Thon followed with a single to right field before David Hollins  flied out to end the inning.  </P> <P> After giving up a one-out double by Jordan in the ninth inning, Morgan retired  Kruk on a line drive and Thon on a grounder to end the game.  </P> <P> "It was just instinct, I see the ball and I run after it . . . and I guess I  got a little help from the runner," said Samuel of his play.  </P> <P> Said Lasorda: "Can you imagine what would have happened if he did not make that  play?"  </P> <P> It's almost like imagining the Dodgers without outfielder Kirk Gibson, third  baseman Jeff Hamilton, bullpen stopper Jay Howell and starting pitcher Orel  Hershiser.  </P> <P> Without Gibson all season, they are 14-11. Since Hamilton went down with  shoulder problems, they are 10-8. Since losing Howell with knee problems, 6-5  with six complete games from the starting pitchers.  </P> <P> And since Hershiser went out with a torn shoulder after his April 26 start,  they have gone 5-3.  </P> <P> "At first the injuries were in the back of everyone's mind. We were all trying  not to bring it up," infielder Mike Sharperson said. "But now it's like,  baseball is not going to stop. So we're not going to stop."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson ran the bases for the first time since the end of spring training.  He ran them just four times and at less than full speed. Batting practice will  begin as soon as he can run the bases hard, which could be in a week. Plans are  to return him to the lineup within three weeks after he begins taking batting  practice.  </P> <P> While Jim Gott was not perfect in his first rehabilitation start for Class-A  Bakersfield Friday (he gave up two runs -- one earned -- on four hits in three  innings), the Dodgers were satisfied enough that he will make a second start  Monday against Palm Springs. He remains on schedule to join the active roster  when the team returns from the trip May 14.  </P></p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: An unexpected sector of bright sparks / Analysis of the electricity companies' success in outperforming the market Cast your mind back three years. Imagine you had Pounds 1,000 to invest on the stock market, and you wanted your money to grow extremely fast. Chances are you would have spurned suggestions to put it into the regional electricity companies floated by the government in December 1990. Utilities were seen as safe but dull - but the regional companies and the generators which were floated four months later have proved to be one of the stock market's brightest sectors. By the end of last week - the conclusion of another successful interim reporting season for the sector - Pounds 1,000 invested in a typical regional power company three years ago would have been worth Pounds 2,960. The same sum invested in PowerGen in March 1991, when it and National Power, the other English generator, were floated, would be worth Pounds 3,005; Pounds 1,000 invested in Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric three months later would be worth Pounds 1,940. What lies behind this share price growth? And, in view of some potentially damaging regulatory reviews in the offing, how long can it last? Since privatisation, power companies have benefited from both luck and judgment. In the former category, low interest rates have prompted fund holders to switch from low yielding government stocks into utilities, while electricity sales have been helped by the country's economic recovery. But the power sector has also impressed the market by cutting costs - including labour costs - far quicker than an arguably naive government expected, albeit from a high and inefficient base. It has also avoided the pitfalls of diversification that several water companies, for example, have fallen into. Most of the 18 privatised electricity companies have diversified, but usually into areas, including generation in the UK and overseas, in which they have at least some expertise and knowledge. As a result, the financial results of the last month have yielded no great horrors. 'It is difficult to pick the highlights, but nor have there been any obvious lowlights,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett. All of this has meant that the sector has been able to expand profits and dividends far faster than expected. The average underlying rise in dividends, one of the main gauges by which the market evaluates utilities, was about 15 per cent at the half year and the full year out-turn for England and Wales is likely to be similar. Even for the Scottish companies, floated after the government had learned the lessons of earlier privatisations which critics said were give-aways, the expectation is for 10 per cent plus. But for both the generators and the regional companies in England, Scotland and Wales, there is a blot on the horizon: Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. National Power and PowerGen, the main England and Wales generators, are first in line after he said last week that he would decide around the middle of January whether to refer them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Reaching an accommodation with the generators will be difficult, but the market seems confident that a deal will be struck. If this is right, the generators are judged by analysts to be in reasonable shape to grow profits and dividends further. Mr Nigel Burton, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says there is scope for both companies to continue cost reductions and to benefit from increases in the price of electricity in the wholesale trading pool. 'They can also grow dividend faster than the market because of their policy of reducing the cover provided by earnings.' For the regional electricity companies the threat from Prof Littlechild comes in the form of his review by next summer of the distribution businesses which provide the bulk of their profits. But it may be less of a danger than pessimists believe. According to Mr Simon Williams, analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the review will cut earnings substantially because rates of return at about 12 per cent are considered too high. 'But dividends are a different matter.' Like the generators, most regional companies' dividends are covered about three times by earnings. Mr Williams says this could go much lower, particularly as the companies have extremely strong balance sheets and cash flow. One of the notable features of the interim results was that several companies are now cash positive and most are on course to achieve surplus cash within the next year or so. Mr Hawkins, of Hoare, says companies in the strongest position in the review are those which have already cut costs - but not so much that there will be nothing left for them to attack after April 1995, when the results of the review will be implemented. He puts Northern, Manweb, South Western and Southern in that category. But in any case, he says, most regional companies in England and Wales will be able to increase dividends by 12 per cent in real terms before 1995 and by 5 to 6 per cent thereafter. For National Power his estimates are for 12 per cent to 1995 and up to 9 per cent thereafter until the end of the century, and for PowerGen 14 per cent until 1995 and then 9 per cent. He expects the two Scottish companies to increase by at least 6 per cent in real terms. Most analysts believe that the spectacular share price growth of the last few years is unlikely to continue, but that the sector is not about to fall from grace. According to Mr Williams of Kleinwort: 'By the end of the century the electricity companies may be typical utilities with earnings and growth profiles to match. But they are not that while they are pumping out dividend growth of 15 per cent.'</p>

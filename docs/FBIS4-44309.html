			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by Gerhard </F> Spoerl and Dirk Koch in Berlin; date not given: "Often We Were  Not Ready To Risk Anything"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, are you an unorthodox  thinker?    [Weizsaecker] I do not know what an unorthodox thinker is.  The term is used in such a way that one could only choose  between thinking and obeying. I do not consider this contrast  very useful.    [DER SPIEGEL] According to Chancellor Kohl, an unorthodox  thinker is a "very well disguised conformist."    [Weizsaecker] In that case, an unorthodox thinker would not  be a thinker at all.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that you did not assume that  the chancellor's statement was addressed to you?    [Weizsaecker] Why should I?    [DER SPIEGEL] Because it might have been addressed to you.    [Weizsaecker] There is no reason for that. We are not  fixated on each other. We assume our joint responsibility in  different roles, as is our duty.    [Weizsaecker] You have often expressed controversial views  in your statements and speeches during your term of office.    [Weizsaecker] Thinking and adaptation do not belong  together. Someone can adapt himself or contradict constantly  without having any ideas of his own. Thinking is linked with  the task of being and remaining independent.    [DER SPIEGEL] Federal presidents mainly deliver speeches.  Should they be given more power in the future?    [Weizsaecker] I do not consider this a major issue. We are  living in a period of change after the end of the Cold War --  not only in Germany but in the whole world. The former rigid  fronts that determined our thinking and actions no longer exist.  We need a new orientation. Whoever can should contribute to  this. It will have an impact, no matter what constitutional  power he holds.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you advocate upgrading the president's  office?    [Weizsaecker] It would not be a bad idea to strengthen  suprapartisan elements in our constitution. The president's  office might be enabled to submit proposals for nominations of  judges of the Supreme Court, for example. It would be useful to  provide the president with instruments that make it possible for  him to discuss issues concerning the orientation of the liberal  democracy with independent public figures and to submit  proposals -- naturally without infringing the responsibility and  the competence of the other constitutional bodies.    [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the melancholy of the farewell, do you  get an uneasy feeling when you look at the country's situation?    [Weizsaecker] Generally, we are going through a period of  change -- in both parts of Germany, in united Germany, in  Europe, and in other parts of the world. We are facing new  opportunities, but it is also more difficult to find a path.  This is a big challenge.    [DER SPIEGEL] Complaints about too much narrow-mindedness  and reluctance to carry out reforms are widespread. For  instance, this applies to the relationship between the Germans  and the foreigners living here whose naturalization is difficult  and who are deprived of the right to vote.    [Weizsaecker] In this respect, too, we are living in a  transition period. During the Cold War, the borders were  largely closed for immigrants. Only citizens from the European  Community were exempted. This has changed completely. Habits  change in our country. This process cannot take place  overnight, but progress is noticeable.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does the required progress include the right  of foreigners to dual citizenship?    [Weizsaecker] I remember an exemplary case from my term of  office as Berlin mayor, which shows the importance of this  problem. If young Turkish girls are born in Berlin who undergo  vocational training and who prepare themselves for a life here  and who have neither the intention nor the practical opportunity  of returning to Anatolia, they will sooner or later have the  desire to participate not only in the obligations but also in  the rights of the citizens living here. At the same time, they  live with their parents or grandparents who still know their  home country and long to see it again, and who are often worried  about he future of their daughters. It would be painful for  them if their daughters would simply give up the citizenship of  their ancestors. This should be prevented.    Is this understandable from a human viewpoint? Does it do us  any harm if young Turkish girls hold both citizenships? I do  not claim that one can generalize here. However, against the  backdrop of a generalizing, rigid, and administrative tradition,  we should also see specific human fates and adapt our rules in a  more efficient manner to them than in the past.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you satisfied with the implementation of  the asylum law?    [Weizsaecker] What was particularly important was not to  reduce and limit the immigration issue to the asylum issue, as  we have done for a long time. Immigrants may include  asylum-seekers, civil war refugees, resettlers from the former  Soviet Union, or people who have other motives. Thus, not all  possible immigrants are asylum-seekers. A discussion on this  topic has been initiated. We will adopt rules that serve the  goal of regulating immigration in accordance with our interests  and obligations. This is what other countries with whom we have  very close relations have been doing for a long time on the  basis of their experiences.    [DER SPIEGEL] You were opposed to amendments to the asylum  law. Now you have had to sign an asylum law that practically  abolishes the basic right to asylum. Does this tarnish your  term of office?    [Weizsaecker] The constitutional idea embodied in the asylum  law will be implemented more effectively once it is part of an  overall immigration law. It is being drafted but has not yet  been completed.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why not?    [Weizsaecker] In no country in the world has the  relationship between emigration and immigration changed so  quickly within such a short period. We have accepted more  people than any other country. Thus, we are in the middle of a  longer public discussion to which I am also contributing.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are the Germans also learning from their  neighbors how a relaxed nation should behave, as your successor  Roman Herzog has suggested?    [Weizsaecker] In my view, this topic is not as serious as it  sometimes seems in discussions. Every nation has its  peculiarities. One of our special features is that, situated in  the middle of the continent, we are surrounded by more neighbors  than all other European nations. On the other hand, Germany has  more inhabitants than any of our neighboring countries.  However, we are not different from the people of other nations.    The nations will continue to exist and be needed in the  foreseeable future --for the democratic control of the path  toward Europe on which we have embarked, for example. This path  leads us to joint institutions of European cooperation that are  based on a secure legal foundation.    This is not in contradiction with the concerns of our  nation.  Quite the contrary: It is in our national interest for this  process to continue. Particularly because we are situated in  the middle of the continent, it is more logical and easy for us  Germans to link the well-being of our country with the progress  of European unification.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is the strong emphasis on the national element  intended as a cohesive factor, as suggested by some parties? Is  it possible to hold the diverging society together?    [Weizsaecker] There are different aspects. First: There is  no doubt that the distance between the state and the citizens  has increased, that a process of privatization is under way.  Second: As far as the rights of the laender vis-a-vis the  government are concerned, federalism is a completely undisputed  and healthy element of our state structure. Third: Only  appealing to national feelings with the aim of shutting  ourselves off from the outside and of developing a special  political role of national isolation because of our central  geographical position would be dangerous. However, such ideas  fortunately do not stand a chance of being realized.    [DER SPIEGEL] How would you define the term nation?    [Weizsaecker] It is the joint responsibility for the past  and the joint will to live, and the will to tackle the problems  of the present and the future. Spiritual elements form the  basis of a nation, not skin color or even the language.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, views on the joint basis in  united Germany differ greatly. There was a vehement controversy  at the Bundestag recently when the commission of inquiry  presented its report on the dictatorship of the Socialist Unity  Party of Germany. It was sparked off by a member of the Party  of Democratic Socialism who reported about the antifascism at  the beginning of the German Democratic Republic that inspired  the resistance fighters and emigrants. Was he not right?    [Weizsaecker] In any event, such debates are urgently needed  and very useful. Everyone should tell his biography. Then we  will learn how to make the necessary differentiations. There  were certainly die-hard Stalinists whose antifascism must not be  seen as an excuse for the prolonged suppression of freedom with  other instruments. On the other hand, there were emigrants who  returned to divided Germany and made a new beginning with  sincere convictions on the soil of the old GDR. Just think of  Hans Mayer or Stefan Heym.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that the demonization of the  GDR leads to a nostalgia for the former east German state, as  Pastor Friedrich Schorlemmer stated?    [Weizsaecker] Those who have lived all their lives in the  West are well advised to listen to Friedrich Schorlemmer. They  can learn a great deal.    [DER SPIEGEL] The central topic during your 10 years of  office was the German past. Your views focused on guilt, shame,  and responsibility. One always noticed your personal  commitment, which may have been the reason for the positive  response. You, born in 1920, were a soldier after 1938. You  knew some of the men who attacked Hitler on 20 July 1944. In  retrospect, do you wish you had been more courageous?    [Weizsaecker] We did not hold very important positions. We  were constantly exposed to one-sided propaganda. However, often  we were not ready to risk anything and not courageous enough to  really open our eyes and follow the signs of injustice. I was  most impressed by the students of the White Rose in Munich or  the Quangel workers in Berlin-Wedding who did nothing but name  the traces of Nazi crimes and give evidence for the truth while  risking their lives.    [DER SPIEGEL] Did you feel guilty because you survived?    [Weizsaecker] There were such moments. But then one wants  to continue to live as decently as possible.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, at the end of their terms of  office, politicians usually think about what will be written  about them in the history books. Willy Brandt used to say: "I  tried hard." Helmut Schmidt said in an equally dry manner that  he would like to read the following about himself: "He carried  out his task in a decent manner." What do you want the  historians to write about you?    [Weizsaecker] If the historians are interested, they should  do this job.    [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you very much for the interview.</p>

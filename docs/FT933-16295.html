			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / China to sell 'peaceful' N-power plant to Iran IRAN SAID yesterday that it had signed an agreement to buy from China a 300MW nuclear power station, a development which is certain to be vigorously opposed by the US. Although Iran and China both stressed that the nuclear plant would be used only for peaceful purposes, US officials have claimed several times in the past year that Tehran is seeking a nuclear weapons capacity. The Clinton administration has described Iran as the world's foremost sponsor of international terrorism, and the US is encouraging its allies to reduce economic links and other co-operation which might assist the Tehran regime. Washington sees Iran and its neighbour Iraq as two of the biggest threats to international stability, and has said that the policy of 'containment' should apply to them equally. Iran's deal with China, which also involves a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 666m) line of credit for the purchase of rolling stock for Tehran's part-built underground railway, is the biggest bilateral accord Iran has been able to announce for some time. President Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has sought to improve Iran's international image, in an effort to improve access to western finance and technology. However, his efforts have been undermined by accusations of terrorism and by the failure of Iran to meet payments on letters of credit which has led several countries to reassess their trading relations with Tehran.</p>

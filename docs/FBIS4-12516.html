			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mona Salem] </F>   [Text] Cairo, April 11 (AFP)--The PLO chief negotiator  acknowledged here Monday that it was now impossible to meet the  target date for launching Palestinian self-rule with just two  days to go, despite progress in talks with Israel.    "I don't think we can resolve (the outstanding issues) by  April 13," although there has been "progress Sunday in talks on  jurisdiction" in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of  Jericho, Nabil Sha'th told AFP.    Sha'th said the Israeli delegation had presented new  proposals for jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho "which could open  the way to real progress."    Under the Declaration of Principles signed between Israel  and  the PLO in September, Israel was to have started its withdrawal  from the two areas on December 13 and was to complete it by  April 13.    PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has insisted that Wednesday's  deadline should be met.    In a phone call to US Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  he urged Washington to step up efforts to ensure the success of  the talks, warning a failure to meet the target date would harm  the credibility of the peace process.    Talks reopened Sunday in the Egyptian capital after a  four-day break and are due to continue until Tuesday in a bid to  wrap up an accord on implementing Palestinian autonomy.    Sha'th added there had been progress both on prisoners and  on  security matters, including the deployment of a 9,000-strong  Palestinian police force to take over from the Israeli army when  it withdraws.    Security issues have bogged down over a date and timetable  for an Israeli pull-out, and the deployment of the Palestinian  police.    He also said the two sides had "come close" to agreement on  the release of around 10,000 Palestinian prisoners being held in  Israeli jails.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation is demanding the  release of all prisoners, including Islamic militants.    But Israel has refused to free members of militant  organisations such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) or  the Islamic Jihad, and those responsible for bloody attacks on  Israelis.    Asked Monday if Islamic militants would be included in an  agreement, Sha'th said: "All the prisoners are going to be  scheduled for release one day or another. We represent all the  Palestinian people."    Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin charged that  Arafat was to blame for the delay in implementing Palestinian  autonomy.    "Israel did not suspend the negotiations after the car-bomb  attack in Afula unlike Yasir 'Arafat did after the Hebron  massacre," Rabin told state radio.    "That is why we are not to blame for the loss of time in the  negotiations," he said, after the Palestinians expressed  exasperation at the failure to launch autonomy on time.    Sha'th added that the committee negotiating the transfer of  civilian matters had on Sunday decided on all the agenda items  under discussion, except for the thorny issue of water resources.</p>

Using the  "Information Super Highway Project," which the United States  plans to introduce by 2000, as a model, the group confirmed that  it will study the possibility of promoting a similar project  aimed at easing regulations and creating new projects in the  field of information and telecommunications.    In the United States, Vice President Albert Gore has played  a  major role in promoting the "National Information Infrastructure  (NII) Concept" (also known as the Information Super Highway  Concept). This is designed to create optical fiber  communication networks throughout the nation and link ordinary  households to various places -- such as schools, hospitals, and  libraries -- and enabling people to exchange data through  screens. To popularize this system under the private sector's  leadership, the U.S. Government has studied the easing of  regulations, give preferential tax treatment, and grant  subsidies to promote technological renovation. From the same  viewpoint as that of the United States, Japan will promote its  own project.    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and NTT [Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] have already showed a  concept designed to construct optical fiber communication  networks by 2010. However, at the 14 May meeting, the working  group of the headquarters for promotion of administrative reform  clearly launched a plan to study the concept from the viewpoint  of easing government regulations.    The prime minister gave a speech at this meeting and said:  "Deregulation is one of my cabinet's biggest tasks. I would  like you to tackle this task to bring about tangible results.  Although time for this work is limited, I would like to ask for  thorough and in-depth discussions on this matter." In this way,  he explained that he expects the working group to present  concrete measures to ease regulations in the information and  telecommunications sector.    The group comprises five ministers, including the prime  minister, the international trade and industry minister, and the  posts and telecommunications minister, as official members and  four experts from the private sector, such as Takeo Shiina,  chairman of IBM Japan. The group aims at reviewing the current  regulations to help the industrial sectors create new projects  in the information and telecommunications sector.    This is the administrative reform headquarters' second  working group following the first 1 March one on housing and  land transactions. The headquarters plans to form another  working group for expanding imports, opening up the market, and  improving the distribution system late March. By starting these  three working groups, the headquarters intends to work out  comprehensive measures for deregulation, hopefully by late June.</p>

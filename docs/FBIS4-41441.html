			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- The director of Russia's  External Intelligence Service (EIS), Yevgeniy Primakov, is  already several days into an unofficial tour of North Africa,  ITAR-TASS learned in the EIS press bureau. The EIS  representative reported that Primakov had met with Yasir `Arafat  in Tunis, and had also had a series of conversations with other  political figures in various countries.    While the EIS director's tour is unofficial, his  peace-keeping mission seems to be fully official. One of the  most important questions discussed by Primakov during his  meetings was the Middle East peace process. Primakov was  assigned the job of talking to leaders in the troubled area not  so much due to his position as EIS chief, but because he is one  of Russia's top Middle East experts.    At the end of this week, Primakov is expected to return to  Moscow.</p>

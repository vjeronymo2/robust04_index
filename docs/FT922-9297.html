			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: MTM results expected next week MTM, the troubled speciality chemicals group, is expected to publish its delayed final year results in the middle of next week. A date will be finalised today or Monday, writes Paul Abrahams. The company is also planning to announce the appointment of new merchant bankers and brokers, following the resignation of Robert Flemings last month. Four candidates have recently been interviewed for the role of broker. Smith New Court is understood to have turned down the position because it already represents Hickson. Mr Ken Schofield, the new chief executive, is understood to want to split the role of broker and merchant banker. The group is also in final stages of negotiation with a candidate for the role of chairman. Analysts believe the most likely candidate is Dr David Swallow, who recently resigned as deputy chairman from Hickson. He was formerly managing director of RTZ chemicals and worked closely with Mr Schofield when he was Hickson's chief executive. Analysts fear that when MTM's results are announced its debts may be as high as Pounds 100m rather than the figure of Pounds 70m previously estimated.</p>

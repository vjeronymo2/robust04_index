			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Talks on North America trade accord gather pace NEGOTIATIONS on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), linking the US, Canada and Mexico, are moving at a rapid pace, but President Bush's brief reference to the talks in his State of the Union message sent a signal to political observers that he is still keeping his options open. In an effort to secure a draft agreement before the end of the month, trade negotiators from the three countries have planned an almost non-stop series of meetings, culminating in a possible head-of-state reunion at the end of February. On Sunday, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, will head a delegation to Mexico of congressmen and businessmen, and Mrs Hills will meet with President Carlos Salinas. Next Tuesday, the chief trade negotiators will meet in Ottawa, Canada; and next weekend the three trade ministers will meet in Annapolis, Maryland. A further ministerial meeting has been pencilled in for the end of February in Dallas, Texas. Reports from Mexican newspapers suggest that negotiators have completed 15 draft chapters of a total of 18.</p>

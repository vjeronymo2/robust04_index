			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GRAF PUSHED, BUT NOT VERY FAR;  </P> <P> SHE BEATS BUNGE, 6-1, 6-2, WILL MEET GARRISON IN FINAL  </P> <P> A glance at the score would seem to show that top-ranked Steffi Graf had an  easy time Saturday against Bettina Bunge in their semifinal match of the Great  American Bank tennis tournament at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club.  </P> <P> And maybe she did. The 6-1, 6-2 victory over her West German compatriot seems  remarkably similar to Graf's first three victories in the tournament.  </P> <P> But something was different. Maybe it was that it lasted 62 minutes, 20 minutes  more than her previous Graf's tournament match average. Or that Bunge was able  to extend Graf to a 22-point fifth game in the second set before being broken.  Or that Bunge won one more game than Graf's first three opponents combined.  </P> <P> Or maybe it was simply that Graf's dominance has made everyone change the  standard for a competitive match.  </P> <P> It is to the point where Bunge merely winning a point against Graf had the  sellout crowd of 4,400 cheering, and Bunge celebrating to herself.  </P> <P> "Every point you have to fight so hard, it tires you a little bit," Bunge said.  "You're so happy when you win one."  </P> <P> Graf has lost just five games in four matches in advancing to the final today  at 1 p.m. against second-seeded Zina Garrison, who defeated No. 6 Nathalie  Tauziat of France, 6-1, 7-5, Saturday night.  </P> <P> Even by Graf standards, that is impressive. Never had she lost so few games in  playing four matches to reach a tournament final.  </P> <P> The last time they held such a lopsided series in this city, a court declared  it illegal and awarded New Zealand the America's Cup.  </P> <P> Graf put a signature touch on her latest conquest by closing the match with  consecutive aces.  </P> <P> "She was serving like (Ivan) Lendl," Bunge said. "I am sure a lot of the men  couldn't return them."  </P> <P> It was not the only time she froze Bunge. At least a half-dozen times, she did  not take a step toward a Graf winner. Other times she came in for a volley only  to watch Graf's return go fly past her before she got much past the service  line.  </P> <P> "Some of them, the ball was so fast, you don't have a chance," Bunge said. "If  you hit the ball a bit too short, a little bit defensive, you get punished  right away. You are not going to get away with getting the ball in and hoping  she will miss."  </P> <P> Despite the score, Bunge did take some consolation from her performance. The  match was only her fourth in singles competition since November 1987. Knee and  foot surgeries forced her to take a 20-month layoff. She began her comeback  this week with Graf-like victories over No. 5 Lori McNeil (6-2, 6-0) and Jo  Durie (6-1, 6-1) before a tough, three-set quarterfinal victory Friday over  last year's San Diego runner-up, Ann Grossman (2-6, 7-5, 6-4).  </P> <P> Her comeback will continue this week at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles  tournament at the Manhattan Country Club.  </P> <P> "Before the match, my knee was really sore," Bunge said. "I was pretty worried  about it, but in the match I didn't really feel it at all.  </P> <P> "Under the circumstances, I was quite pleased. . . . I hadn't played a (big)  match like that in years, even before I stopped in 1987."  </P> <P> The layoff had Graf wondering how competitively Bunge would play.  </P> <P> "I really didn't know what to expect because I hadn't seen her play (in so  long)," Graf said. "But I know she has the touch, and I know she knows how to  do it."  </P> <P> Actually, both players are well acquainted with each other. Bunge, 26, recalls  seeing Graf for first time in 1981 when she was ranked in the top 10 and Graf  was a junior player.  </P> <P> "I remember a training camp in Germany when Claudia (Kohde-Kilsch) and I were  big stars," Bunge said. "(Steffi) was 12 years old, a skinny girl. She was so  good. God, she was already so good."  </P> <P> Three years later, Bunge lost to her at Wimbledon in their first meeting.  </P> <P> "She was 13 or 14 (actually just turned 15)," Bunge said. "I wasn't upset  because I knew she was exceptional."  </P> <P> Their previous most recent match had been a 6-1, 6-1 Graf victory in Los  Angeles in 1987. This was their fifth career meeting; Bunge has yet to win a  set.  </P> <P> Graf allowed Bunge only two points off her serve in the first set. At one point  over the first and second sets, Graf scored 16 consecutive points on serve.  </P> <P> Bunge toughened as the match continued. Her persistence showed, but was not  rewarded, in fifth game of the second set, when she played Graf 22 points  before being broken. Bunge won 10 points in the game, as many as she won in the  entire first set.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, I was little too careful, and I got punished with some  blistering returns," Bunge said. "I was trying to at least prove to her that I  could give her a good match, that (every match) is not totally boring for her."  </P> <P> Graf might expect an even better match from Garrison, who actually owns a  three-set victory over her, although it was four years ago in their first  meeting. The last time they played, in the final of an indoor tournament in  Washington in February, Graf won 6-1, 7-5. It was her fourth consecutive  victory over the world's sixth-ranked player.  </P> <P> The close second set followed a first set in which Graf won the first 20 points  to lead, 5-0.  </P> <P> The final will be Garrison's fifth in 12 tournaments this year. She is coming  off her second title of the year -- a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Pam Shriver in  Newport, R.I., two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Garrison said her strategy today will be simple, the risks high.  </P> <P> "I have got to get more first serves in, a lot more than I've been getting in,"  Garrison said. "And on her second serve, I'll have to attack, no matter what.  If I get passed 99 times, I've got to let her pass me.  </P> <P> "The thing about Steffi is you have to go out there and say, 'I'm going to be  aggressive.' You know she is going to be aggressive. You're not going to be  given many opportunities, and when you do you have to take advantage of it."  </P></p>

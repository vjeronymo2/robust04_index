			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Guinness Having worked hard to reduce its costs and stepped up marketing spending on its brands, all Guinness now needs is a drop of recovery in the drinks market. The 4 per cent slide in its shares following yesterday's results partly reflects the downbeat trading statement that accompanied them. True, there are some glimmerings in spirits, up 1 per cent by volume last year with Scotch whisky sales up 3 per cent. But demand is strongest in lower-priced brands and price rises lagged inflation. Even these modest volume increases are being bought at the expense of margins. In brewing, efforts to exploit the stout brand are overshadowed by the continued slide in Cruzcampo's profits. Recession and the lack of Olympic games custom provide convenient excuses for its poor performance, but Guinness now has ample cause to regret buying into Spanish brewing expensively and at the wrong time. Still, there may be little alternative, as in spirits, but to wait for better times. At least the cash inflow from the recent LVMH deal will reduce gearing to 38 per cent. Since Guinness is generating ample cash from operations, the LVMH deal hastens the day when it must find a way of spending some of this money. Presumably another Cruzcampo is not on the cards, though smaller targetted acquisitions may be. Or perhaps Guinness could again buy in its own shares, starting with the 4 per cent stake that LVMH must sell by June next year.</p>

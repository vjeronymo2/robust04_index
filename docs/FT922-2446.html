			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Growth through a window in the market - A look at why Anglian Group can be floated with a Pounds 200m valuation MR WILLIAM Hancock, chief executive of Anglian Group, must be heading one of the most successful of recent management buy-outs. Just 18 months after buying the Norwich-based double-glazing company for Pounds 84.5m from BET, the business services group, Mr Hancock and his seven-man buy-out team are floating Anglian with a market valuation of about Pounds 200m. To say the least, Mr Hancock's team has greatly benefited from the misfortunes at BET where new management is trimming back on the excesses of a late 1980's acquisition binge. Not only did the buy-out team obtain a company that was already cash generative and profitable, but just before BET's financial year-end in March, Anglian was also able to make an early repayment of a Pounds 30m loan note which BET provided to help finance the buy-out. By repaying early, Anglian is able to avoid paying BET a considerably greater deferred consideration on flotation. Anglian's first year results after the buy-out produced operating profits of Pounds 15.5m, broadly in line with projections made to BET. It was during the next year, and despite the recession, that the MBO team made profits sing and laid the basis for shareholders to seek an earlier than expected exit through the flotation. After increasing prices by 7.5 per cent in February 1991 and cutting costs, operating profits for the year to March 1992 jumped to Pounds 23m on turn-over almost unchanged at Pounds 145.6m. Net cash from operations jumped 19 per cent to Pounds 26.7m and operating margins were nearly 50 per cent higher at 15.8 per cent. According to Mr Hancock, current trading is 'at least as good as last year' despite no real sign of any economic upturn. 'In the short term we may have to continue the same discounting policy but with new products in September we will not be so reliant on discounting policy,' he says. 'We expect to make 15.8 per cent margins with the same discounting policy.' While the company has been forced to discount, it has remained remarkably unscathed by slow consumer spending. Before recession hit - and indeed before BET sold - the company cut 180 jobs in its manufacturing plants in Norwich and closed some of the branches through which it supports and co-ordinates its self-employed sales and installation teams. Anglian has also had little exposure to the new building market. Almost 75 per cent of sales are replacement windows and doors made from rigid PVC-U, a product Anglian successfully introduced to the UK market 12 years ago. From this base Anglian has more recently moved into conservatories and is breaking into the new build market and sales to commercial and local council buildings. Despite this vertical integration, Anglian has only managed to carve a 7 per cent to 8 per cent share of the replacement window market. The fact that this is enough to make it market leader ahead of Bowater Windows and Everest is testimony not only to the market's fragmentation but also to the degree to which the company can be grown through increases in market share in the absence of economic recovery, Mr Hancock says. There is also growth potential geographically by spreading branches through the Midlands, the north of England and Scotland and through expansion over the longer term in France. The flotation itself is relatively straight forward, involving a placement of half the shares on offer, by NM Rothschild, and a public offering of the other half. About half the company is to be sold. The company will raise approximately Pounds 56.3m net from a placement and public offering that will be priced on June 29. The providers of the venture capital, led by Legal &amp; General Ventures, will sell a portion of their stake, raising a further Pounds 40m. As a result the MBO team will be left with about 8 per cent of the enlarged capital, the workforce will have about 4 per cent and existing shareholders will keep about 40 per cent. The proceeds will be used to redeem Pounds 23.6m of preference shares and the Pounds 30m debt that replaced the loan note from BET and BET will receive a Pounds 1.5m deferred consider-ation. As a result, Anglian will add about Pounds 1.4m to cash balances which on a pro-forma basis stood at about Pounds 10m in March. At the very least the company's profits will benefit from not having to pay Pounds 5.7m of interest as it did last year. Pricing will be decided a week ahead of the closing date for public applications on July 7. It will be the subject of intense discussion with brokers and is a relatively difficult decision as there are few comparable quoted companies on which Anglian's rating can be based. The company operates in an industry known to bring either feast or famine and in which there have been some notable failures. On the other hand, it has to some degree suffered at the hands of salesmen from competing double glazing companies who have spent the last three years undermining Anglian by telling potential customers that the company is either up for sale or so heavily leveraged that it is unreli-able. Once shareholders have backed the company with Pounds 200m of equity, this is a slur they will no longer be able to deploy. The company's advisers would like Anglian to be rated alongside other building materials companies. If that were the case, Anglian could float at a price between 240p and 280p and would carry an earnings multiple in the mid teens and still be at a small discount to the sector.</p>

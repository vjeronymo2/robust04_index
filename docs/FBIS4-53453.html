			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Wednesday [18 May] urged parliamentary cooperation in  speeding up the process of enacting an electorate redistricting  bill so that an upcoming general election could be contested  under the single-seat constituency system.    "Although I can invoke my authority to call a general  election even under the current multiseat constituency system  still in place, it is desirable for the election to be contested  under the new system," Hata said.    Hata made the remark in a question-and-answer session in the  House of Representatives Budget Committee.    Although the Diet legislated in January a package of  electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system  for the 511-member lower chamber with a mix of single-seat  electorates and proportional representation, it requires the  passage of the demarcation bill to allow the next election to be  lawfully contested under the single-seat system.    At present, a government-appointed panel of experts are  speeding up the task of splitting the nation's multiseat  constituencies into 300 single-seat electorates.    Hata said, "I am aware that some citizens are demanding an  early holding of the election to seek a public verdict on  politicians in view of the fact that my new administration has  been reduced to a minority government."    However, Hata said the legislation of the redistricting bill  must precede the general election, saying, "it is crucial to  firmly establish the (single-seat) system."    "The public feels that politics is in a hopeless situation  and their feelings have caused low voter turnout ratios in  various elections," he said.    On North Korea's alleged nuclear development program, Hata  said Japan is trying to make contacts with Pyongyang through the  Japanese Embassy in China to convey the international  community's stance on the issue.    He said that if North Korea really opens itself to the  world,  the United States, South Korea, China and Japan can help it  "develop its people's livelihood." Japan is ready to talk with  North Korea "if talks are necessary," Hata said.    On the idea of "universal security" incorporated in policy  accords among the ruling coalition parties, Hata said the idea  is "very similar" to the collective security spelled out in the  U.N. Charter.    Last Thursday, Hata told a House of Representatives plenary  session that the Constitution prohibits Japan's involvement in  collective defense, in answer to concerns that his government  may move toward active military actions overseas.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa addressed the committee and  appeared to retract his earlier statements referring to  reconsidering the interpretation of the war-renouncing  Constitution by postwar governments that it bars participation  in collective defense.    Kakizawa said he expected "wide-range discussion on what  national security should be" and he would apologize and withdraw  the remarks if the statements caused misunderstanding.    On another remark of his calling for early steps toward  legislation for dealing with international crises, Kakizawa said  he was referring to a possible emergency situation related to  North Korea's suspected nuclear development project.    Kakizawa said he was not referring to "emergency  legislation"  that was once discussed to deal with a possible invasion of  Japan.</p>

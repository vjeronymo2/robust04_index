			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Meanwhile"] </F>   [Text] We have learned from reliable sources at the  Russian Federation Foreign Ministry that Russia is firmly  following the line of nuclear nonproliferation, including on the  Korean Peninsula. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry  believes that the sanctions problem is not yet practicable.  Sanctions are an extreme measure to be used when all the  political possibilities have been exhausted.    According to reports from Seoul, South Korea has placed its  650,000-strong Armed Forces on a heightened state of alert. All  leave has been canceled.    Meanwhile, ITAR-TASS reports from Pyongyang, the situation  in  the DPRK capital remains calm. No changes have as yet been  observed which would point to preparations for a possible  military conflict.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DISCOUNT BROKER'S $15,000 SETTLEMENT UPHELD BY COURT;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: A BROKER WINS A COURT ORDER THAT PAYS HER DAMAGES AND BARS ANOTHER  BROKER FROM TREATING HER UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF HER DISCOUNT RATES.  </P> <P> A Santa Clarita Valley real estate broker has won a court order against another  broker she had accused of blacklisting her firm for its discount rates,  refusing to pay her agents market rates on shared property sales.  </P> <P> In a ruling Monday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Workman upheld an  out-of-court settlement reached last month between discount broker Jeannette  Sharar and the broker she accused in the state antitrust lawsuit, Marcia  Gaskill, owner of two Realty World franchises.  </P> <P> The settlement orders Gaskill to pay Sharar $15,255 in damages and barred  Gaskill's firms from treating Sharar or her agents differently than others in  the business, according to court records.  </P> <P> Sharar's attorney, Marvin G. Claitman of Encino, called the ruling a victory  for consumers and discount brokers. Sharar's firm, Sharar Associates,  advertised 2% commissions instead of the standard 6%.  </P> <P> Claitman said the ruling "puts a stop to a practice that we felt was  retaliatory. The primary goal was not a matter of recovering monetary damages  but trying to put a stop to the discrimination."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Gaskill declined comment and Gaskill's attorney, David L.  Candeaux of Encino, could not be reached Tuesday.  </P> <P> The case, filed in January, 1989, claimed Gaskill's firms -- Valencia Homes  Inc. and Cheyenne Properties Inc. -- offered Sharar's agents what industry  calls "punitive splits," or a lower commission than generally extended in  shared sales. For example, Sharar claimed, her agents were offered 1%  commissions although most others would be offered a 3% fee.  </P> <P> Sharar, a Santa Clarita planning commissioner, argued that the lower  commissions not only discriminated against her firm for its discounts, but also  discouraged other brokers from following her example.  </P> <P> Although industry representatives contended that 6% commissions are no longer  prevalent in today's competitive market, consumer advocates agreed with Sharar,  saying most real estate brokers remained resistant to cutting their fees.  </P> <P> The case was settled out of court last month. But Sharar's appearance on a Feb.  18 radio talk show prompted Gaskill to claim that the terms of their agreement  had been improperly disclosed and she refused to comply with the settlement,  Claitman said.  </P> <P> In a hearing Monday, Workman said he had listened to a tape recording of the  radio program and found no violation of the Feb. 16 settlement agreement.  </P> <P> Claitman said he and Candeaux were still working out the final language of the  judgment, which has yet to be signed by the judge and become official.  </P></p>

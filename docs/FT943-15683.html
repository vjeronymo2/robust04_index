			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Two summits for price of one in Naples: Peter Norman, Economics Editor, previews the G7 meeting opening tonight The world economic summit that begins in Naples tonight will be the 20th of its kind and the first in which Russia has been accorded equal status with the leading industrialised democracies when discussing the globe's geopolitical problems. While the summiteers and the world's media will be getting two summits for the price of one, the early signs are that the leaders of the Group of Seven countries and President Boris Yeltsin will be hard pressed to pin the adjective 'historic' on their weekend talks in a former royal palace overlooking the Bay of Naples. To some extent, this is as it should be. The G7 economic summits have been subject to a law of diminishing returns for many years. Indeed, last year in Tokyo the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, accompanied as always by the European Commission president, decided to make a virtue out of necessity and make this year's summit shorter, less scripted and more informal. But old habits die hard. Put together eight ambitious politicians (or nine if you count Mr Yeltsin, who will join the talks halfway through) under a Mediterranean sun with a multinational force of journalists for nearly 48 hours and they will start playing to the gallery. This instinct was apparent earlier this week, when President Bill Clinton conjured up a clutch of initiatives to revive what clearly seemed a flagging agenda to White House planners. The improved world economic outlook has created an unusually favourable background. But faced with a batch of topics for discussion that are worthy rather than gripping, Mr Clinton's advisers surprised other summit nations by saying he would propose a global data super-highway, encompassing Russia, and a multinational review of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The US is also keen to inject new urgency into further liberalisation of world trade that would build on the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations. Whether the meetings will be flexible enough to cope with these late-breaking ideas remains to be seen. The reforms initiated at Tokyo should give the summiteers the chance to take up proposals at short notice. The Naples talks have been arranged to give leaders more time to talk informally with only one official per delegation present. But there is also evidence of the usual advance scripting and the airbrushing away of awkward issues. The economic communique, to be released tomorrow, is virtually complete and drafts reportedly contain no reference to the weakness of the dollar on currency markets. Indeed, it has become apparent that perhaps only Japan wants to give the matter a thorough airing. German officials have gone out of their way to play down the significance of the dollar's fall, suggesting that it is either a US problem or a bilateral US-Japanese affair. Although the finance ministers (who, like foreign ministers, attend the meeting) can be expected to discuss financial market developments and the rise in long-term bond rates, decisions are unlikely in the absence of central bank governors, who do not attend. Instead, the 'sherpas' (senior officials who prepare the summit) have primed their masters to put their weight behind the campaign to reduce unemployment adopted at the ministerial meeting in Paris last month of the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. More references can be expected to the need for better education and training, openness to new technology and help for small and medium-sized companies as ways to combat unemployment. However, it remains unclear whether France, in particular, will allow explicit recommendations for greater labour market flexibility, which the OECD says are essential to reduce the 35m unemployed in the industrial world. Proposals are well advanced for broad agreement to make safer Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors in Ukraine and other states of the former Soviet Union. The summiteers could come closer to agreement on that than on most other issues. The European Union summit in Corfu offered Ecu500m (Pounds 385m) in grants and loans from union funds to close Chernobyl and help provide Ukraine with alternative nuclear capacity. The EU idea, being strongly promoted by Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is that other nations should contribute to the effort so that altogether about Dollars 1.5bn is available. However, the Naples meeting will not be able to put to rest all fears about the former Soviet reactors. This is because Ukraine itself will be expected to contribute to the clean-up by covering local costs and agreeing to conditions that will make it eligible for subsidised loans from the industrialised nations. Some difficult negotiations lie ahead to achieve this. Russia, by contrast, is not queueing up for large financial assistance although it hopes to benefit from any agreement to allow the IMF to issue some of its own reserve asset, known as the special drawing right, to member countries. Instead, the summit is intended to give a deliberate signal that the industrialised democracies regard Russia as a full partner in international affairs. Whereas previously the G7 countries and the European Commission have discussed the global political agenda among themselves before reconstituting as 'G7 plus one' with Russia, this year Russia will be a participant to all geopolitical discussions. The crises in Bosnia, North Korea, Yemen and central Africa, and the more hopeful developments in South Africa, will be discussed on Sunday. Naples will be a time for wheeler-dealing and contact-making. It would be indelicate for the four EU countries present to be caught cooking up a deal on the successor to Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president. But discreet whisperings in the corridors cannot be ruled out. The other leaders will also be anxious to monitor the international debut of Japan's new prime minister, the 70-year-old Socialist Mr Tomiichi Murayama. There is no danger that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and summit host, will hide his light under a bushel. Naples is Mr Berlusconi's first great opportunity to strut his stuff on the world stage. The Italian media magnate-turned-politician can be expected to do just that  -underlining what the other heads of state and government already know: that summits are about domestic politics as much as about statesmanship.</p>

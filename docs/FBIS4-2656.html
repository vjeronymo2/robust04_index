			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Vice-President Rong  Yiren met here today with a delegation from the Japan  Association of Corporate Executives (JACE), led by Chairman  Hiroshi Watanabe.    JACE is one of Japan's four most influential economic  organizations, with heads of major enterprises among its members.    JACE puts great emphasis on economic cooperation and  exchanges with China and has sent several delegations to China,  Rong said during the meeting.    Rong believes that JACE's current visit will help strengthen  bilateral economic exchanges and friendly relations.    Watanabe said JACE is ready to conduct regular exchanges  with  China's state economic and trade commission to help cultivate  Chinese modern entrepreneurs.    Rong appreciated Watanabe's move, saying that facing an  economy which is growing "continuously, quickly and healthily,"  China is in urgent need of talents. Though China will train  qualified personnel by itself, it heartily welcomes foreign  friends to lend a hand for this purpose.    Rong expressed the hope that China and Japan will improve  their mutually beneficial cooperation in economics, which is an  impetus to the two countries' economic growth.    Praising China's achievements in fostering economic growth  and maintaining domestic stability, Watanabe expressed the  confidence that a large group of outstanding entrepreneurs will  crop up in China in the wake of the thriving economy.</p>

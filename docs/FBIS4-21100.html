[prefecture], April 4 KYODO --  Police said Monday [4 April] they have arrested a man from  Singapore on suspicion of smuggling psychotropic drugs with a  market value of 20 million yen into Japan.    Loh Seng Chow, 39, a machinist, arrived at Tokyo's Narita  airport from Bangkok on March 16 without his luggage, which had  been mistakenly left behind.    During a routine check of Loh's unaccompanied luggage, which  arrived on another flight 20 minutes later, customs officials  found almost 20,000 tablets packed into vinyl bags, hidden in  the hood of a jumper.    Loh was apprehended soon afterward at a nearby hotel for  allegedly violating the Narcotic Control Law, police said.    It is the biggest haul of psychotropic drugs ever  confiscated  at Narita and the second highest amount nationwide.    Loh told investigators he received the drugs from a female  he  met by chance in Bangkok who promised to pay 50,000 yen for the  successful delivery of the drugs to Japan.    Depending on the dosage, psychotropic or mind-expanding  drugs  produce a wide range of effects including hallucinations and  altered sensations. Abuse has become widespread in Japan,  especially among young people.    With this latest case, the overall amount of psychotropic  drugs confiscated this year comes to about 45,000 tablets, more  than the entire amount of drugs recovered for the whole of last  year.</p>

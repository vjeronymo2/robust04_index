			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Smith Corona quits PC venture SMITH Corona, the US manufacturer of typewriters and word processors, is pulling out of the fiercely competitive personal computer market little more than a year after it entered the sector through a joint venture with Acer, the large Taiwanese company. Smith Corona, which is 48 per cent owned by Hanson, the UK conglomerate, said the joint venture would be terminated at the end of next month. Smith Corona, which has been building PCs under the joint venture agreement, will continue to do so for a short period but manufacturing will eventually be transferred to Acer's plants. Acer said it would also continue developing products based on the joint venture's technology, with royalty payments to Smith Corona. Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, said the company had been breaking even on the venture but intense price competition in the PC market meant there was little profit opportunity. When the joint venture launched its first products in March last year Mr Thompson said he hoped that one third of Smith Corona's sales would come from personal computers in three to five years. But he said yesterday that 'a third of revenues doesn't mean anything if you don't get about a third of profits'. Competition in the PC market was extremely fierce even when Smith Corona entered the field and it has grown much more cut-throat over the past 12 months. The company's core market of typing and word processing equipment for the home and small business has also been depressed for the past two years, and Smith Corona reported net income virtually halved, at Dollars 17.3m (Pounds 9.6m), in the first nine months of the financial year. Mr Thompson said the financial effect of the joint venture termination on Smith Corona was expected to be immaterial. Analysts have often questioned whether Smith Corona's core market faces erosion in the face of cut-price PCs aimed at the home. However, Mr Thompson said yesterday that the company was getting more and more confirmation that the typewriter and word processor market was quite distinct from PCs.</p>

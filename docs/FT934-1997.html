			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / MPs to examine Post Office The Commons trade and industry committee is to examine the future of the Post Office in the light of warnings from its management that the corporation faces a growing crisis, Roland Rudd and David Owen write. The committee plans to call Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, to give evidence and may seek to question ministers responsible for the corporation. Committee members are understood to be concerned that the corporation's investment plans and profitability are threatened by uncertainty created by the government's review of the Post Office. The move will put pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry to produce its review early next month. Ministers are understood to have rejected plans for full-scale privatisation.</p>

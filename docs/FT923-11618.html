			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Imperial Oil shows solid improvement IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest integrated oil company and 70 per cent-owned by Exxon, says its performance is firmly on the mend after the 1991 roller coaster caused by the Gulf war. Second-quarter earnings were CDollars 58m (USDollars 48.3m), or 30 cents a share, up from CDollars 5m, or 3 cents, in the corresponding period of 1991. Revenues totalled CDollars 2.33bn against CDollars 2.35bn a year earlier. In the first half, earnings were CDollars 108m, or 51 cents, against CDollars 201m, or Dollars 1.04, a year earlier. Much of the 1991 period's profit was due to the effect of the Gulf war. First-half revenues were CDollars 4.4bn against CDollars 4.76bn. Imperial said cash provided from operations in the first half, after dividends, was CDollars 375m against CDollars 290m. Operating expense was down 15 per cent to CDollars 246m. 'We have set a direction that will restore earnings to acceptable levels,' said Mr Arden Haynes, chairman. In resource operations better heavy oil prices and higher synthetic oil production more than offset declines in conventional oil output. Petroleum products margins contracted, while chemicals were strong in the second quarter.</p>

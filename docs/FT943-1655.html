			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Kozyrev adds to doubts over Azerbaijan oil deal Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, yesterday added his voice to doubts surrounding the the Dollars 8bn Caspian oil contract signed earlier this week between the government of Azerbaijan and a consortium of foreign oil companies. Mr Kozyrev said that Russian interests had to be taken into account in any agreement to exploit the reserves in the Caspian sea. Agreements signed by the Soviet Union limiting exploitation were still in force - 'no one has annulled them,' he said. 'The former Soviet republics are the Soviet Union's legal heirs, while Russia is its main successor. Obligations have to do with all the former Soviet republics. Azerbaijan is well aware of this.' Mr Kozyrev's statements were greeted yesterday with muted anger by other Russian institutions concerned with the contract. These include the energy ministry, which sent a deputy minister to applaud the signing of the deal and Lukoil, the partly state-owned oil company which is a partner in the consortium with 10 per cent of the contract. An oil ministry spokesman said the ministry had 'no special comment' on Mr Kozyrev's statement, adding that various interests were involved including those of the ministries and oil companies - 'each of which could have a different position'. For Lukoil, Mr Alexander Vasilenko said that 'we signed a statement of intent with the state oil company of Azerbaijan last September. There was an inter-government agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan signed last October, which Mr Yuri Shafrannik (the Russian Energy Minister) signed, permitting an agreement between Lukoil and Azerbaijan. Lukoil works always within the bounds of the law, and that is how we intend to work now,' Mr Vasilenko said. The issue has an importance beyond that of the Azeri contract - signed by BP, Amoco, Statoil, Pennzoil, McDermott and other western oil companies. Russia could effectively block the flow of oil by refusing to allow a pipeline through its territory. It could also apply pressure to Azerbaijan against running a pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean. If so, it would send a message to other oil companies that deals with former Soviet republics cannot be made without Russian approval.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> WHEELCHAIR TENNIS WHIZ A REAL FIGHTER  </P> <P> A full day had passed since Donna Miller upset the No. 3 seeded women's player  at the U.S. Open Wheelchair Tennis Championships in Irvine, but fellow players  still congratulated her when they passed by.  </P> <P> "That a girl, Donna," said one. "Go get 'em," said another. And the smile on  Miller's face grew brighter with each compliment.  </P> <P> "I'm hungry for this one," she said.  </P> <P> Miller is one of 262 players from 14 countries competing at the Racquet Club of  Irvine through Sunday. She is the first player in five years to beat out  Monique Van Den Bosch of Holland in the first round of play.  </P> <P> The players, many with custom-made wheelchairs and tennis racquets, compete  nationally and internationally each year, starting in April and culminating  with the Irvine tournament. Over the last 10 years, the circuit has grown from  the original 75 players.  </P> <P> "This is just a small percentage of people who play wheelchair tennis," said  Brad Parks, 33, who founded the National Foundation for Wheelchair Tennis in  1980.  </P> <P> While recuperating in the hospital from a skiing accident in 1976, Parks  wondered what sport he could take up.  </P> <P> "I'd never heard of it (wheelchair tennis)," he said. But then he got on the  court in his set of wheels from the hospital and hit a few balls to his  parents. "I couldn't move very well and I knew there was only one way to go,  and that was up."  </P> <P> "It's very aerobic," said Rich Rosenbaum of Ft. Lee, N.J., who is completing  his fourth season on the circuit. "It's also one of the few wheelchair sports  that you can do with able-bodied people."  </P> <P> For Miller, it's the competitiveness that drew her in.  </P> <P> At 28, she is the executive director of a referral service for the handicapped  in Middletown, N.Y. Her staff encourages disabled people to live as  independently as possible, focusing on their abilities instead of their  disabilities.  </P> <P> She trains for several hours every day, playing tennis, swimming, lifting  weights and pushing a specially designed wheelchair up and down the streets of  her neighborhood. She has a coach whom she credits with teaching her to  outthink her opponents.  </P> <P> Before her multiple sclerosis was diagnosed five years ago, Miller was a  nationally ranked swimmer. After she became wheelchair-bound, she tried road  racing and basketball, but neither sport pushed her competitive spirit the way  tennis did. She is now ranked third nationally.  </P> <P> The tournament at the Racquet Club of Irvine, 5 Sandburg Way, is open to the  public. Admission is free. MARY ANNE PEREZ  </P></p>

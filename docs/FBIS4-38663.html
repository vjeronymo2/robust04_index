			<p>BFN     [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas today received  European Parliament President Egon Klepsch and an accompanying  delegation.    Brazauskas welcomed the guest who is representing an  international organization, which is little known in Lithuania,  but which is important to its future. Striving for integration  in the European community, Brazauskas said, I have taken  measures to coordinate the steps of Lithuania and of other  Eastern and Central European states and proposed to arrange a  meeting of the leaders of the Baltic states and the states of  the Visegrad group. I have taken some steps lately to realize  the ideas of this cooperation.    The president dwelled on the complex development of  relations  between Lithuania and Russia, especially with Kaliningrad  region. He expressed concern over obstacles in the processes of  independence of Ukraine and Belarus. It is imperative to seek a  solution in relations between Russia and Estonia, with a view to  foreign troops being withdrawn from this Baltic state, too, by  the end of the summer.    Describing Lithuania's domestic scene, Brazauskas said that  political passions have somewhat subsided in the one and a half  years which have elapsed since the elections to the Seimas. The  economic situation is difficult, however. Lithuania especially  lacks foreign investments. Western countries should pay more  attention to the Eastern and Central European states and help to  consolidate their stability.    Klepsch supported the idea of cooperation between the Baltic  and Visegrad states. The European community, he said, is  concerned about the stability of the Northern and Central  European states, especially of those with whom it is preparing  to conclude agreements of associated membership.    Welcoming the Lithuanian-Polish treaty, the guest drew  attention to the importance of normalizing relations with  Russia. The guest also gave a positive assessment to the fact  that there are no problems of national minorities in Lithuania,  that the process of their integration is taking place. This is  well known in the European parliament, he said.    The meeting lasted for one hour instead of the planned 40  minutes. "We had to explain our attitude to current Russian  policy, relations of that country with Ukraine and Belarus, ELTA  correspondent was told by President Algirdas Brazauskas.    Egon Klepsch met the chairman of the Seimas, Ceslovas  Jursenas, today. During the meeting, the guest expressed the  view that positive processes in Lithuania are taking the country  closer to the European structures. "The first meetings with  members of the Seimas factions created an impression that  various political forces in Lithuania have similar foreign  polity aims, and they differ only in detail. A state wishing to  join the European Union is facing corresponding demands. After  the signing of a free trade agreement with the European Union  Lithuania will come closer to this European structure.    Klepsch supports long-term and close cooperation between the  Lithuanian and European parliaments.    Ceslovas Jursenas noted that his meetings with Klepsch in  Paris and Brussels and the present visit by the president of the  European Parliament show that such contacts are very useful to  our state advancing along a complex path to the European Union.    Accompanied by the Seimas chairman, the guest inspected the  building of the Lithuanian parliament, a fragment of the  barricades, and crossed himself at the Smutkelis crucifix.    Today, Egon Klepsch met the chairman of the Lithuanian  Bishops Conference, Vilnius archbishop Metropolitan Audrius  Juozas Backis.</p>

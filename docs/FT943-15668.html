			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Israeli-PLO talks aim to accelerate self-rule Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are to begin talks next week in Cairo on an accelerated extension of self-rule from Gaza-Jericho across the rest of the West Bank. The agreement announced in Paris yesterday marks a critical step forward in the peace process and reflects the greater trust and confidence both sides have in each other following completion of the first phase: the implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. However, Israel appears to have forced the PLO to accept a two-stage negotiating process for the West Bank - accelerated talks on the transfer of power followed by talks on redeployment of Israeli forces - rather than the single-stage process demanded by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chair-man. Mr Arafat wants the process speeded up considerably to allow the PLO to take control of the West Bank well ahead of Palestinian national elections due on October 15. He appears determined to hold quick polls to confound critics who say he is undemocratic and afraid of elections which might see opponents win considerable power. Israel has cautioned on the need to move slowly. A joint Israeli-PLO statement said yesterday that the Cairo talks would break into two working groups. One group would discuss issues outstanding from the first phase - such as Israel's refusal to release 6,000 Palestinian prisoners, and arrangements for border crossings and safe corridors between the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The second group would discuss giving Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank more control over some aspects of the local administration, as well as elections and financial matters such as the transfer of taxes and customs. Israel agreed in Paris to speed up transfer of power in the West Bank and expand self-rule beyond the already agreed five areas of health, education, tourism, direct taxation and social welfare. Only after the conclusion of these talks would the two sides negotiate an interim accord for the West Bank including the redeployment of Israeli forces out of Palestinian population centres, which Israel is pledged to complete by the eve of elections. The third issue which is now open for discussion is the right of return of Palestinians who fled their homes in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>

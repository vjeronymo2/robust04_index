			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> VETERANS BELIEVE THEY CAN END GORDON'S DOMINATION IN STADIUM RACES  </P> <P> As the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Championship Series enters the second half of  its season Saturday night at the Rose Bowl, the question at hand is: Can the  truck-driving old-timers stop the kid from winning it all?  </P> <P> Robby Gordon, 20, in his first year of stadium truck racing, has finished first  in four of the five previous Grand National Sports Truck races, although he was  penalized for rough driving in one of his victories and dropped to third place.  In the one race he failed to win, Gordon was also penalized, for rough driving  in a heat, and forced to start last in the feature. He finished third.  </P> <P> The consensus among his peers is that Gordon is very good, has unusually strong  equipment in the Toyota truck prepared by Cal Wells and has also been very  lucky.  </P> <P> From Walker Evans, 50, the dean of off-road racers, through a group of proven  winners such as Roger Mears, Glenn Harris, Danny Thompson and David Ashley, the  feeling is that Gordon can be beaten -- and each one thinks individually that  he is the one to do it.  </P> <P> "Toyota was dominant in the first four races, but we got our act together in  Houston and beat them and I feel good about coming to the Rose Bowl," Evans  said. "I guess Saturday night will be the time to prove we can do it again, but  we'll have to drive fast and hard."  </P> <P> It was Evans' Jeep that Gordon hit in Seattle, the incident prompting the  Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group's committee on rough driving to take  Gordon's win from him. And it was Evans he hit again in Houston, putting him in  the rear of the field in the main event.  </P> <P> "I just seem to be the one in his way the most, but the other guys will tell  you, too, that some of his driving is not totally gentlemanly," Evans said.  "He's leaned on a lot of guys and that doesn't sit too well with his  competitors.  </P> <P> "On the other hand, he's talented and knows how to get to the front and win  races. You can't take that away from him."  </P> <P> Evans and the others figure that a new system of lining up the field for the  main event will help their cause. For the first four races, starting positions  were determined by a blind draw. Since the race in Houston, though, the grid  has been determined by a points system involving qualifying and two heats.  </P> <P> "Gordon had a lot of luck going for him with the draws," Evans said. "As lucky  as he was, he should be in Las Vegas. Now to get up front in the main event,  you've got to earn the spot. He might be up there, but he'll have to work for  it, and the new way will make for a much better show because qualifying and the  heats mean a lot more."  </P> <P> Mears, 41, likened the Toyota domination by Gordon and Ivan Stewart to that of  the Penske Indy car team, of which Roger's younger brother, Rick, is a member.  </P> <P> "They've got the combination right now, the way Penske had it last year at  Indy," Mears said. "Racing seems to be like that, one team getting dominant,  but it always ends, and we hope to be the ones to end it for Toyota."  </P> <P> Mears has a streak of six straight second-place finishes in his Nissan pickup  -- three in desert races and three in stadiums.  </P> <P> "After the disastrous year we had in 1988, second places felt pretty good, but  winning will feel a lot better," he said. "We feel we have the right stuff to  beat them, and the Rose Bowl might be the place to start. We got our last win  there."  </P> <P> Mears won 16 of 25 stadium races in 1984 and '85, but since then has won only  once -- in the Rose Bowl in '87.  </P> <P> Harris, 30, also said that the Rose Bowl will be good for his independently  campaigned Mazda. He won his first truck race there in 1986.  </P> <P> "The Rose Bowl course is a favorite of mine," Harris said. "When I won there, I  considered it a major breakthrough, a landmark win if you will. With the new  format, consistency will pay off and that means keeping the right attitude all  evening.  </P> <P> "It's obvious that Gordon's on a roll, but if I didn't think I could beat him,  there wouldn't be any sense in showing up."  </P> <P> Thompson, 38, is looking for his first win in his privately funded Chevrolet.  </P> <P> Ashley, 31, drives the lone Ford Ranger in the truck class and hopes a return  to Southern California will help his chances. Ashley, who won in a Jeep in the  Coliseum two years ago, was leading in the opening race at Anaheim before  rolling in a multi-truck collision.  </P> <P> Truck standings: 1. Gordon, Orange, Toyota, 282 points; 2. Stewart, Lakeside,  Toyota, 199; 3. Evans, Riverside, Jeep, 194; 4. Harris, Camarillo, Mazda, 179;  5. Thompson, Huntington Beach, Chevrolet, 156; 6.

Ashley, Placentia, Ford, 113.  </P> <P> Racing will start Saturday at 6:30 p.m.  </P> <P> MIDGETS -- Perennial champion Sleepy Tripp finally gained the lead in the  United States Auto Club's Western Regional championship series with a win last  week at Ascot Park and a third at Ventura behind A. J. Johnson and Robby Flock.  Tripp is only nine points ahead of Flock going into two full midget and TQ  doubleheaders this week -- tonight at Ascot Park and Saturday night at Saugus  Speedway. Mini stocks will also be on the Saugus program.  </P> <P> STOCK CARS -- Bill Sedgwick, the Van Nuys driver who won last week's Winston  West opener at Madera Speedway, was co-crew chief on the car Roman Calczynski  drove to the Southwest Tour championship last year and was once the jack man on  Hershel McGriff's pit crew. McGriff, 61, finished third behind Sedgwick and  defending series champion Roy Smith. The next Winston West race will be May 13  at Bakersfield's Mesa Marin Raceway.  </P> <P> Rookie Chris Laney of Redondo won his first Winston Racing Series main event  last week at Ascot Park and will be back Sunday looking for a repeat win. . . .  Gary Curtis will be going for his fourth straight mini-stock win Friday night  at Ventura Raceway. . . . NASCAR sportsman and street stocks will go Saturday  night at Cajon Speedway.  </P> <P> DRAG RACING -- Bernie Partridge, one of the pioneers of the National Hot Rod  Assn., will retire as NHRA's vice president of field operations at the end of  the season.

Lewis will join the NHRA July 1 to begin  phasing into the job.  </P> <P> Top Gas West and the California Injected Funny Car Assn. will run Saturday at  Los Angeles County Raceway in Palmdale. The track is located on Ave. T, one  block east of California 138 and Pearblossom Highway.  </P> <P> SPORTS CARS -- The Firestone American City Racing League will open its Sports  2000 season Sunday at Sears Point Raceway, along with the Sports Car Club of  America's Trans Am main event.

The skiing Mahre brothers, Steve and Phil, will drive for Reno.  </P> <P> A goal of $135,000 has been established for a memorial scholarship in the name  of Al Holbert at Lehigh University. Holbert, a veteran of sports car and Indy  car racing, was killed in an airplane accident last September at 41.  Contributions can be made to the Alvah R. Holbert Memorial Scholarship, c/o  Patricia Boig, Alumni Memorial Bldg. 27, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa.  18015.  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLES -- The Gardena Cup, an institution at Ascot Park for 14 years, will  be revived next week after an absence of two years with the running of the  American Motorcyclist Assn.'s Camel Pro national half-mile championship race on  May 13. . . .

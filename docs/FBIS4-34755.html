			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Exclusive report by Miguel Lozano: "The Hour of the Chosen </F> Ones"]    [Text] Havana -- Each evening in May and June, thousands of  Cubans will have to make a decision: whether to attend a  neighbors meeting to analyze community problems or to watch the  island's most popular soap opera, "Felicidad."    For municipal representatives (councilmen), the Brazilian  soap opera constitutes the first trial by fire during these warm  nights. The number of voters who will decide to skip the soap  opera will be larger in those places where there is more  confidence in their performances.    These meetings to "account for one's actions" represent an  initial aspect of the Cuban "sui generis" democratic system,  designed to facilitate people's participation in domestic  affairs without interfering with the constitutional foundation  of the single-party system.    According to prevalent belief, the existence of a single  party is justified by the need to have unity to preserve  sovereignty in view of the pressure exerted by the Unites  States, including an economic, commercial, and financial  blockade and hundreds of hours of anti-government radio messages  coming from that country on a daily basis.    Although this concept -- applied to the party founded to  organize last century's fight for independence -- has broad  support, a stated government concern is to facilitate people's  participation in elections where candidates are chosen by the  neighbors themselves rather than by groups.    The chosen ones are responsible for holding meetings with  their constituencies at least twice a year to account for their  actions. In addition, voters have the chance of dismissing the  councilman who fails to accomplish his mission or who no longer  meets the requirements to represent them.    Theoretically, this system has countless advantages if  compared with a representative democracy, whereby candidates are  chosen by their own parties rather than by the population, and  once they are chosen, their voters can no longer contact,  criticize, or evaluate them.    In practice, however, this system has some shortcomings that  have conspired against it. This is something that high-ranking  Cuban officials have recognized, although they believe overall  results are positive, especially at times of crises when the  population's full support is vital.    One such problem is the elimination of formalism, once  delegates (councilmen) fall under the influence of the  bureaucratic plague. During the processes to account for one's  actions prior to the summer (the other processes take place  during the last months of the year) and with the help of  democratic representatives, the aim is to give an identity to  the search for solutions to the problems inherent in each  community to meet the people's demands.    Ernesto Suarez, National Assembly of the People's Government  (parliament) secretary, told a group of local journalists that  we can see that this change of identity cannot be accomplished  instantly, not even before the conclusion of the meetings held  by the 13,685 councilmen.    In some cases, these democratic representatives fail to  attend the neighborhood meetings held to find solutions to  water, hygiene, transportation, and food distribution problems,  which the loss of Cuba's main trade partners, triggered by the  fall of the European socialist world, exacerbated.    In other cases, the tendency of these representatives is "to  report" on their works and to gather new concerns in order to  address them six months later. This system not only fails to  involve the population in the process to solve problems, but  also distorts the meaning these meetings have as a basic element  of the democratic system.    Suarez believes it is important to encourage people to exert  their authority. Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon believes  the trend indicates we are moving toward the creation of a true  democratic system, although the country finds itself amid large  raw materials shortages.    Alarcon, who admits there are flaws, maintains that this  mechanism to control the chosen ones, along with the power to  dismiss them, places the Cuban system above other systems due to  an irrefutable reason: the people's participation in the  decisionmaking process.    The Cuban parliament president points out one way to make  progress in the creation of a real democracy is to prevent the  processes to account for one's actions from becoming a ritual  every six months.    Most people, however, seem to be slightly concerned about  the  comparisons between the degrees of democracy in other countries  and are more interested in reporting those elements that  obstruct the good development of the community to their  neighborhood representative.    The search for solutions to deficiencies in the water supply  and food distribution systems exceed any political arguments,  which are stronger abroad than on the island. Cuban authorities  are determined to prove the potential of a single-party  democracy.    Neither media reports on the progress of the processes to  account for one's actions nor street rumors indicate there are  enough arguments against the island's political system, although  there are some criticisms of the shortcomings of the  administrative system in many places.    Although hardly reported abroad, these meetings between the  chosen ones and their constituencies theoretically represent a  revival of the original democracy, whereby ancient Greeks and  their representatives would meet without the meddling of  political parties.    Despite this reasonable thesis, the Cuban system is facing  obstacles larger that its nightly competition against  "Felicidad;" it is attempting to overcome its own mistakes and  weaknesses to show the world there can be a single-party  democracy, although the predominant trend dictates just the  opposite.</p>

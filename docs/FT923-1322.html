			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Happy days 'we will never devalue' - Lamont is a happy man. He can look at Germany's dreadful figures for the money supply with the joy of someone gazing from shore at a ship caught in a fierce tempest. He can commiserate with the plight of all the passengers. He can feel quiet pleasure over Mr Helmut Schlesinger's unwillingness to see sterling on board the ERM again. And, above all, he can cut interest rates below the German level. The chancellor says that yesterday's one percentage point cut in interest rates was 'justified on fundamental economic grounds'. But he was unlikely to say anything else. He also says he is determined to persist with the policy of defeating inflation. 'If at any time I thought inflation was going to pose a problem again,' he asserts, 'I would not hesitate to put rates up.' But unkind folk may remember that this is the chancellor who said but a week ago that he would do whatever was necessary to defend sterling within the ERM. What the chancellor says can be ignored. What matters far more is what he does. After an effective devaluation of 8.4 per cent over the last week, monetary policy has already been substantially loosened. Should the government want to match rates of inflation elsewhere in Europe - still a worthy goal - the case for further rapid loosening, though it can be made, is not overwhelming. It is because the government can adjust policy at will that it should be particularly careful about what it does now. It should ask itself what signals will be sent both to employers and to employees if it appears absolutely determined to combine devaluation with monetary expansion. The need to show such caution would be far less if the government were to establish a convincing set of institutional changes for the control of monetary policy. But, as it is, the chancellor seems enchanted by his new freedom to run the country by the seat of his pants. A damaged government presiding over a country with a plunging exchange rate, a fiscal deficit of more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product and underlying price inflation still around 4 per cent needs, like Caesar's wife, to be above suspicion. This government is not. Yesterday's interest rate cut - probably justifiable in and of itself - does nothing to remove the doubts.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Broker settles dispute with Sakura Bank YAMATANE Securities, an ailing second-tier Japanese broker, appears to have settled a protracted dispute with Sakura Bank, its main bank, over a restructuring programme and the appointment of new board members. Sakura is planning to send an executive to take control of Yamatane, which reported a net loss of Y25.4bn (Dollars 205m) last fiscal year and is likely to report another large loss this year due to the continuing weakness of stock prices and trading volume on the Tokyo market. But the fate of the broker's former chairman, Mr Tomiji Yamazaki, remains unclear. As part of the reform plan, he has promised to resign next June as a board member, though his family has controlled Yamatane since its founding in 1933 and is likely to continue to exercise influence over the management. The difficulties of returning Yamatane to profit were highlighted on Monday when the trading volume on the Tokyo market was a meagre 117m shares, the lowest level for 10 years, and particularly damaging for second-tier brokers which are more reliant on stock commissions than the big four brokers. Negotiating the reform plan was complicated by a disagreement between Mr Tomiji Yamazaki and his brother, Seizo, who runs Yamatane Corporation, a warehouse operator and food distributor with a 6.2 per cent stake in the broker. Tomiji had appealed to Seizo for assistance, but the latter was dismayed by the controversy that the broker has drawn to the Yamatane name over the past two years. Yamatane was investigated by the finance ministry for its role in a 'tobashi' scandal, in which brokers shuffled stocks around client accounts to avoid booking losses. But some of those clients discovered they were left holding the losing stocks, leading to legal actions against Yamatane. Overseeing the reform of Yamatane will add to Sakura's expertise in the securities industry, though the deregulation of Japan's financial system has slowed, and the bank may have to wait several years before it can establish a subsidiary to deal in stocks. 'Since we are the main bank of Yamatane, it is natural that we would give them assistance. We have been occasionally helping them and we are studying a request for us to send them a new president,' Sakura Bank said yesterday. Yamatane said three creditor banks, Asahi, Mitsubishi Trust and Nippon Credit Bank, will be satisfied by the increased authority given to Sakura.</p>

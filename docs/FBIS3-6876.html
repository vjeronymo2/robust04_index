			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Thai Stops on Terror's Highway"] </F>   [Text] We can all be thankful that the terrorist driving a  bomb truck through Bangkok last week was not a very good driver.  Had he not collided his deadly vehicle with a motorcycle he  would have killed many more people than the one innocent truck  driver. The explosives on his truck, set to go off at the flick  of a battery switch, would have levelled an entire building or  more, and killed and wounded people in a wide area. The bomb  was assembled mostly from easily obtained common items. It was  similar to the bombs that exploded last year at New York's World  Trade Centre and before that at the Israeli Embassy in Argentina.    In short the bomb was practically a signature for  international terrorists using Mideast grievances as their  flimsy excuse for killing. Our security officials have rightly  taken a cautious role and avoided assigning a motive for last  week's abortive bomb attack. This will not stop the man in the  street from speculation, nor should it prevent those same  officials keeping a close watch on suspects. The means and  methods of this unsuccessful attack clearly point to  professional terrorists with international backing.  Identification of the driver of the truck as of Mideast  appearance provides at least some clue in the search for the  criminals.    There must be a forthright, unyielding investigation of this  truck bomb. In the first place, one Thai citizen has already  been murdered. Although the attack itself was stopped thanks to  the bungling of the driver coupled with the unwitting tenacity  of a motorcycle taxi driver, the terrorist was clearly planning  massive killing and destruction. Whether the target of this  foreigner's attack was other foreigners, as seems likely, is not  the point. The blast would have killed and injured more  innocent Thai citizens as well as the foreign officials our  authorities are pledged to protect. The worldwide publicity  after a successful blast would have also done untold harm to the  country's image. Despite its good relations with all sides in  the Middle Eastern disputes, Thailand as a country would have  thus become an innocent victim of international terrorism as  much as have the unfortunate passengers on hijacked or bombed  airliners.    International terror has seldom visited Bangkok. But when it  has the results have been deadly. A Black September attack on  the Israeli Embassy in 1972 ended peacefully after several days  of tense negotiations. But since then, hijackings and attacks  have cost several dozen innocent lives. Authorities pledged  after the deadly 1988 Kuwait Air hijacking from Bangkok that  anti-terrorism procedures would be tightened. During the Gulf  War, when suspected terrorists were poised to make attacks in  Bangkok, they were intercepted and sent packing.    Of course, there is no way that every act of terror can be  detected and stopped. New York's blast and the recent attacks  on London's Heathrow airport show that even the most  security-conscious governments are helpless against the  determined terrorist. But it is clearly imperative that police  and other security officials continue to do their utmost to  prevent such heinous acts. Few doubt that last week's giant  bomb could not have been assembled without help from people  other than the lone, and possibly suicidal, truck driver.  Whether these helpers were foreign diplomats or private Thai or  foreign citizens should not influence the strength of efforts to  root out dangerous threats to our country. Diplomats involved  in terrorism can and should be expelled. Those who hold no such  special status, Thai or foreign, can be investigated and dealt  with under the law.    There is a general belief -- whether true or not -- that on  occasion our law-enforcement officers go easy on disputes  between foreigners. At the personal level this may at times be  the wisest course. But acts of great violence like that which  would have been triggered by the truck bomb deserve full  investigation and, if possible, direct action. Indeed, it is  exactly Thailand and its citizens who have been wronged even  during the spineless lead-up to last week's non-bombing.    There may be no fingerprints to identify positively the  driver of the bomb truck or the murderer of an innocent Thai.  But the fingerprints of international terror lie over this  entire case. The real culprits should be sought by aggressive  police work. Even if they escape there still remains the  responsibility to determine who brought terror into our capital.  If suspected, such persons should be rigorously investigated.  Any diplomats found guilty should be immediately expelled and  other suspects charged in court. Terrorism must not be  tolerated anywhere within Thailand. Our security officials must  take tough action and must also be seen to be taking such  action. Bangkok is not Beirut or the occupied territories.  Those who would use the uncivilised violence of terrorism in our  country must be identified and dealt with unflinching firmness.</p>

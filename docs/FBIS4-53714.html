			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Choe Won-ki: "Forecast of Third Round </F> of U.S.-North Korea Talks -- U.S. Will Likely Accept All North  Korean Demands If North Korean Nuclear Transparency Is Insured  100 Percent"]    [Text] The North Korean nuclear train, which was dashing  toward the edge of a cliff, is turning around in the direction  of a safety zone with 21 May as the climax.    Since U.S. President Clinton stated that day that "North  Korea's replacing of fuel rods is merely a technical violation,"  the possibility of a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks,  which has been suspended since July last year, being held sooner  or later, has increased. Thus, it is highly likely that  according to this policy of Washington's, the North Korean  nuclear problem henceforth will again go through a script for  the "dissolution of discord" that forecasts negotiations between  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  based on a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, and  improvement in North-South relations.    Besides, in the event that the North Korean nuclear problem  is resolved smoothly, relations between North Korea and the  United States will even develop into such a level as to  establish a liaison office in Washington and Pyongyang  respectively during the later half of this year. Experts who  have been watching the recent nuclear issue observed that the  North Korean nuclear problem will proceed on the following three  stages in accordance with a simultaneous or separate timetable.    The event to take place in the first stage is negotiation  between North Korea and IAEA.    The IAEA will soon begin negotiations with Pyongyang over  the  issue of replacement, storage, and measurement of fuel rods.    Second is the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level  talks.    In the event that additional inspection of the radiochemical  experimental power station is carried out as a separate work  from replacing fuel rods and sample-taking, the United States  will view that the conditions for a third round of talks have  been met. Taking into account the fact that additional  inspection is being carried out satisfactorily, the possibility  of North Korea-U.S. talks being held in early June is very great.    It is also likely that the third round of North Korea-U.S.  talks will be held in Geneva between Kang Sok-chu, North Korean  first vice foreign minister, and Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant  secretary of state. The United States and North Korea have  already worked out detailed political and economic issues to be  discussed and exchanged with each other. North Korea has  established a long-range goal of establishing diplomatic  relations with the United States by taking advantage of recent  developments of the situation. Under this long- range goal,  North Korea will put forward various short-range demands for the  improvement in mutual relations, including suspension of the  Team Spirit joint military exercise; recognition of the North  Korean political system; improvement in North Korea-U.S.  relations; a promise not to launch a preemptive attack on North  Korea; elimination of North Korea from the list of terrorist  states, and support for a light-water reactor.    There is a possibility that North Korea will demand that  these pledges be specified in a document, and will propose  holding a Kim Il-song-Clinton summit. On other other hand, the  United States will likely demand a guarantee for special  inspections by the IAEA; prohibition of nuclear reprocessing;  the resumption of North-South dialogue for the joint  denuclearization declaration; and a complete return of North  Korea to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT].    It appears that the United States has finalized its position  in conformity with the agreement with the ROK that there will be  no serious problems in accepting North Korean demands if North  Korea's nuclear transparency is insured 100 percent.    This signifies that if North Korea resolves its nuclear  problem, the United States will implement an epoch-making policy  on North Korea, including a long-range plan to recognize North  Korea diplomatically .    This position has been expressed on many occasions by  President Kim Yong-sam and U.S. President Clinton.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu also believes that in a  long-range view, improvement in North Korea-U.S. relations will  be helpful for bringing North Korea out to the international  community.    The third stage is North-South relations. Experts observe  that if the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks proceed  smoothly, positive impact will be exerted on North-South  relations which have been in deadlock for a long time.    In other words, in the event that the third round of North  Korea- U.S. talks proceed satisfactorily, the government, which  has been maintaining the "nuclear solution-first and economic  cooperation-next policy" for the past two years, will highly  likely take an appeasement gesture toward North Korea according  to the changes in the situation, including granting permission  to ROK businessmen to visit North Korea during the later half of  the year. How much weight and what degree of importance North  Korea will attach to dialogue with South Korea and to improving  its relations with South Korea in the course of carrying out  dialogue with the United States will decide on the speed of  improving North Korea-U.S. relations.    This is because both the ROK and the United States maintain  the position that the United States' improving its relations  with North Korea should be carried out in parallel with  improvement of North-South relations.    Professor Yi Pom-chun (Songsin Womens University) said: We  must clearly express our strong will to North Korea and the  United States that without implementation of ordinary and  special inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities and  mutual inspections between North and South of Korea in a bid to  check North Korea's nuclear weapons development, the  establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and  the United States should not be realized, nor should the United  States' economic cooperation with North Korea be pushed for.    Both the ROK and the United States are attempting to make an  appeasement approach to North Korea, stating "Let us solve the  problem through dialogue," despite North Korea's intentional  foul play, such as the unilateral act of replacing nuclear fuel  rods. However, there certainly is a possibility that a solution  to the North Korean nuclear issue may get fouled up into a more  difficult status according to the North Korean attitude  henceforth.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Management: Adapting to change - Jozef Cornu is well-placed to capitaliseon Alcatel-Alsthom's rapidly evolving markets / Euromanagers to watch 'I have never been just a technology nut,' says Jozef Cornu. But the director of technical affairs at Alcatel-Alsthom, the Paris-based telecommunications, engineering and transport group, has a glint in his eye when he explains the rapid pace of technical change in the telecommunications sector and the business opportunities it creates. From the development of cellular and cable technologies to the growing importance of software and broad band transmission, Cornu describes in detail the directions of the group's rapidly evolving markets. 'Almost anything is possible now,' he says, referring to the upheavals in the US and European telecoms industries. Such enthusiasm about technical matters helps to explain Cornu's ascent to the top echelons of one of Europe's fastest-growing industrial groups. Alcatel-Alsthom's net profits have more than trebled since 1988 to reach an expected FFr7bn (Dollars 1.19bn) in 1993. Annual sales have risen to more than FFr160bn. The rise is largely the result of heavy investment in new technology and its applications. As head of these operations, Cornu is at the cutting edge of group strategy. He is also at the sharp end of several substantial management challenges - how to develop and commercialise technology, and how to do so in a group as geographically diverse as Alcatel-Alsthom. On the first count he has the advantage of knowing his technology. Cornu completed a doctorate in electronics at Carleton University in Ottawa and has subsequently kept track of the new developments in relevant research. 'Not all technicians adapt to business,' he says. 'But I do not regard it as a disadvantage to know what you are talking about.' Scientific aptitude alone, however, counts for little. For Cornu, it has been complemented by commercial experience gained from a winding career through various technology-based companies. His first job was at Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, where he worked in the research department. In 1973, he joined a subsidiary of ITT in Belgium, his homeland, to start its micro-electronic design activities. Nine years later he was appointed general manager of a telecoms joint venture between ITT and the regional investment company in Flanders and in 1984 he became general manager of ITT's Belgian subsidiary. The big move, however, came in 1987. The merger between the telecommunications activities of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite and the telecommunications operations of ITT gave birth to Alcatel and brought Cornu into the new company. Put in charge of the key telecoms switching division, he successfully developed the rival digital systems of ITT and CGE, expanding their combined market share from about 17 per cent then to about 20 per cent today. He was appointed to the Alcatel board in 1988 and to the board of Alcatel-Alsthom, the mother company, in 1992. The trail, which has led Cornu through Belgium to Canada and Paris and through companies of different nationalities, appears fitting. Alcatel-Alsthom is one of the world's most international business groups, with a management base in Paris, a financial base in the Netherlands, a joint venture with GEC of the UK, and three-quarters of its sales from outside France. But its diversity also poses a problem - how to manage such a dispersed group and how to harness technology from the group's various research facilities. For Cornu, the solution is to adapt management to the strengths of diversity rather than to impose a rigid centralised influence. One example is in the appointment of local managers. Whereas Siemens' overseas operations are often headed by Germans, and Ericsson's by Swedes, Cornu argues in favour of local appointments. 'We have national people even at the subsidiary level. We have Brazilians running our operations in Brazil and Australians in Australia,' he says. 'The biggest benefit is that you can use the talents of many nationalities. The most mobile people in a company are not always the best.' Cornu is also an advocate of decentralisation within each management group. 'The greatest danger for big companies is to be too rigidly structured, too formal,' he says. 'We have to maintain the dynamism of a small company, which involves being open and relatively informal. In that respect we are not a typically French company.' For Cornu this dynamism requires a high degree of delegation. 'You have to give people responsibility. You cannot manage through formal reports.' This in turn places a strong emphasis on the appointment of subordinates. 'Attracting the best people will continue to be our biggest challenge,' he says, arguing that the group's large advertising expenditure is aimed at potential employees as well as clients. But channelling the various international operations and managing a decentralised group requires a strong system of communications. At the level of research, Cornu's domain, the solution is partly based on what he refers to as the general relations agreement. Under this agreement, technical information from Alcatel's various operations is pooled and is accessible to all companies in the group. To finance research, each company pays a percentage of sales to a common fund. The application of technology is determined by a research director in Paris. If communication within the group is an important part of Cornu's management creed, so too is contact with the client. 'Just three years ago this was a relatively predictable industry. Now everything is changing very quickly.' The best example is the US where the four levels of telecommunications operators - regional and long distance, cable and cellular - are battling to enter each other's territory. The result, says Cornu is that Alcatel's customers are no longer 'sleeping beauties'. They are, he says 'much more awake and have much more flexible strategies. I need to have my ear much closer to the ground, to know what customers are doing and to match our research to the changes in the industry'. So far, so good. The rise in the group's sales and profits and its resilience to recession reflect Alcatel's ability to adapt. Having undergone a personal transition from technology to the marketplace, Cornu is well placed to help steer the group through the same transformation.</p>

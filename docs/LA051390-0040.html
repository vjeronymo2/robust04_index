			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PLEDGES 'GOOD FAITH' BUDGET TALKS;  </P> <P> DEFICIT: THE PRESIDENT WON'T SAY WHERE HE STANDS ON A POSSIBLE TAX INCREASE BUT  PROMISED NOT TO SET ANY PRECONDITIONS IN HIS SUMMIT WITH CONGRESS.  </P> <P> President Bush brushed off a political firestorm over possible tax increases on  Friday by saying, "I can't be ruffled," and he refused to reveal what he will  put on the table at this week's budget summit with Congress.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to show you my hand. I haven't seen a lot of hands being laid  down," Bush said as he embarked on a weekend trip of college commencement  speeches.  </P> <P> Democrats have been reluctant to be the first to mention taxes, urging Bush  instead to take the lead in offering a formula to cut the growing budget  deficit.  </P> <P> The Administration has warned that there would be mandatory spending cuts  approaching $100 billion this fall unless Congress and the White House agree on  major reductions in the deficit.  </P> <P> Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force One, refused to provide any clues  about his strategy but promised to bargain in good faith with Democrats.  </P> <P> En route to a commencement address at Texas A&amp;I University -- his first of  three for the weekend -- the President moved quickly to put out a brushfire  fueled by distrust and concern over his true intentions in the process.  </P> <P> "There's no conditions, and that's the way it is," Bush said. "That's the way  it's going to be and that's the way it must be."  </P> <P> In Washington, Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said the budget talks shouldn't  just work toward a broad agreement. He suggested that members dealing with the  budget should be given official status as a joint committee that actually  shapes a final budget bill for House and Senate action.  </P> <P> But Lugar said he is not optimistic the planned talks can produce an agreement.  "The gaps are so large, and the politics of it are so difficult," Lugar told  reporters.  </P> <P> Bush's invitation to budget negotiations has raised suspicions among Democrats  of an election-year tax trap and sparked fears of election setbacks for  Republicans who have made anti-tax pledges a key part of their campaigns.  </P> <P> Bush has not said he would endorse tax increases, but he has muted his  no-new-taxes pledge for the budget talks, which begin Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Administration is telling Republicans privately that the "no preconditions"  stance offered by the White House does not necessarily mean Bush will accept  increased taxes.  </P> <P> The atmosphere for the talks was clouded when White House chief of staff John  Sununu suggested last week that the President would not accept a tax increase  regardless of what the Democrats propose.  </P> <P> Bush, asked if Sununu's remarks reflected his position, said, "I would ask you  to reflect my posture, to talk about what I say. . . . So I'd respectfully  suggest you take your guidance from me on this one, because that's the way it  is."  </P> <P> And Bush said Sununu was not in trouble for his remarks. "That's silly, so  stupid. None of these congressmen are in trouble, either," he said.  </P> <P> "I'm approaching it very openly, and I recognize the controversy swirling  around from one statement or another," he said. "But look, stay on track,  steady as she goes, and be open, deal frankly with people and deal in the way  I've said."  </P> <P> Bush said, "Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave so keep your snorkel above  the water level and do what you think is best.  </P> <P> "(It) goes back to what my mom taught me when I was about 6: 'Do your best, do  your best.' Well, I'm trying hard. Stay calm."  </P> <P> Bush said, "I think the President has a certain responsibility to stay cool,  make clear to people that he's dealing in good faith and do my best.  </P> <P> "That's exactly what I intend to do, and I can't be ruffled by these things,"  Bush said. "I've got to be understanding when people come forward and express  themselves forcefully on something like this."  </P> <P> Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, (D-Tex.), on board the President's plane, said he was  willing to give Bush "the benefit of the doubt."  </P> <P> "I think it's back on track," Bentsen, one of the Senate negotiators, said of  the budget talks, "as long as we can keep these fellows in line."  </P> <P> Otherwise, Bush began the two days of commencement speeches at Texas A&amp;I  with the promise that an American flag will be planted on Mars by the year  2019, although he had no specifics on how to achieve that costly goal.  </P> <P> Bush, who would be 95 years old if he lived to see that promise fulfilled,  later traveled to Columbia, S.C., for a fund-raiser for Republican Gov. Carroll  A. Campbell Jr.  </P></p>

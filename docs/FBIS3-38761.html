			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finland might move straight to so-called green  prices for agricultural products if it gets the regional  subsidies it wants from the European Union [EU]. This was  stated by Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen in Stockholm  after his meeting with the other Nordic ministers. Timo  Seppaenen reports.    [Seppaenen] The demands for regional subsidies presented to  the EU by Finland, Sweden, and Norway are very similar. Swedish  Minister of European Affairs Ulf Dinkelspiel said, however, that  the EU negotiators have a somewhat more positive attitude toward  subsidy requests from Norway and Finland than ones from Sweden.  Sweden has not connected its demands regarding these subsidies  to any other issue in the negotiations. In negotiations  concerning Sweden, every matter is discussed on its own merits,  Dinkelspiel affirms.    Finland's negotiating strategy is different, at least  concerning regional subsidies. Foreign Trade Minister Pertti  Salolainen said in Stockholm that Finland might use the price of  agricultural products as a carrot to tempt the EU to promise  regional subsidies as generous as Finland has hoped for.  According to Salolainen, Finland might promise the EU that it  will move more quickly than expected to green prices, which are  cheaper than the current prices. Salolainen even said that  Finland might consider moving straight to such prices if a  satisfactory solution is reached in the regional subsidy matter.  What Salolainen said reveals a fairly essential aspect of  Finland's negotiating tactics and his message shows what a how  crucial regional subsidies are for Finland.    Both Sweden and Norway place great importance on this  matter.  Sweden, for example, is hoping to get the so-called first class  regional subsidy, which the EU gives to its poorest southern  member countries, for Norrland [northern area of Sweden].  According to the Swedish minister of European affairs, Sweden  could never accept an unambiguous no from the EU to the demands  on regional subsidies for Norrland.</p>

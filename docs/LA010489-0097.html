			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIG CARCASS LEFT OUTSIDE HOME OF JEWISH ACTIVIST  </P> <P> Police were trying to learn Tuesday who left a skinned pig carcass outside the  home of Stanley Sheinbaum, the publisher and activist who, with four other  American Jews, recently met in Sweden with Palestine Liberation Organization  Chairman Yasser Arafat.  </P> <P> Sheinbaum and his wife, Betty, told West Los Angeles police detectives that the  dead animal was left in their driveway between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. on New  Year's Day while they were away.  </P> <P> With the pig was a blood-saturated note that read, simply, "Troy."  </P> <P> Sheinbaum, 68, an economist, Democratic Party fund-raiser and University of  California regent, said he did not know the significance of the message.  </P> <P> "It has no meaning for me," he said.  </P> <P> Other members of the Jewish community have charged that Arafat is trying to use  his recent recognition of Israel's right to exist and the resultant  conversations with the United States as a "Trojan horse" to infiltrate Israeli  defenses.  </P> <P> "One doesn't like this sort of thing," Sheinbaum said. "It has an ugly quality  to it."  </P> <P> He said the act was the work of "some people whose quality is reflected by  their own actions."  </P> <P> Sheinbaum conceded that "a lot of my fellow Jews are very upset that I met with  Yasser Arafat."  </P></p>

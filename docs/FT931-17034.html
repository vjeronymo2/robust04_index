			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The art of a friendly welcome THE FIRST restaurant I rang, where dinner would have cost Pounds 50 a head, did not seem concerned that it could not give me a table. There was no offer of an alternative time nor was my name and number taken in case of a cancellation. It showed little desire to welcome me. The second restaurant could not have been more different - even though it was part of the same group, Forte. The receptionist explained the new menu; told me about its jazz trio and made me feel most welcome. Dinner was very reasonably priced. Efficient but friendly receptionists are invaluable to any restaurant because first impressions are so crucial. Receptionists are also a restaurant's last line of defence. Any criticism of the food or service which the customer felt too intimidated to pass to the manager often comes out as the coats go on. A receptionist worth her salt should be able to overhear and make some attempt at salvaging the situation. Christmas and new year test a receptionist's talents to the full. Perhaps he or she will be grappling with 20 similar overcoats and black umbrellas from a group arriving for an office party. Maybe the receptionist will be propping up his or her eyelids until the early hours when the last guest leaves. Often a receptionist will be dealing with clients who are slightly the worse for drink. But there will be financial compensations. Receptionists are paid a bread and butter rate by the restaurant, approximately Pounds 25 for a shift that may last from 5.30pm until 1.30 am. The cream is the tips. Until the Inland Revenue and the recession intervened, tips could amount to Pounds 40 to Pounds 50 in cash on a busy night. Today, the receptionist will invariably be last in the gratuities queue as customers curb spending and tips are pooled with the rest of the staff and taxed. So what is the appeal of the job? For the answer I turned to Sian Cox, a woman who was the finest receptionist I employed in my previous career as a restaurateur. On paper, she was vastly over-qualified - an attractive fulltime schoolteacher and a mother of three. But she had the two basic qualities any good receptionist needs - old-fashioned good manners and a genuine interest in the public. Sian Cox modestly described herself as 'a people junkie.' Armed with Sian's qualities a good receptionist should be able to cope with the other demands of the job: to put themselves out, whatever the time; to be able to prioritise when dealing with the arrival and departure of guests; answering the incessant call of the telephone and handling irate taxi drivers who have been given only a client's first name. The final attraction of the job for Sian was that it gave her the opportunity for nights out in a completely different environment. Made-up and smartly dressed, she would leave her children with her husband and join a bustling, adult world which was a complete contrast to her day in the classroom. The receptionist's world may not be as intellectually stimulating as a teacher's but it can be more financially rewarding. The most attractive bonus for any receptionist must, however, be that of Kurt Wachtveitl's, general manager of the Oriental, in Bangkok. Every New Year's Eve he opens itsfamous Bamboo Bar and closes when the last guest has left at about 6am. Then, armed with a large Bloody Mary, he heads off for a peaceful journeyalong the klongs (canals) of Bangkok. Sadly,this is a perk not available to even the finest restaurant receptionist in London.</p>

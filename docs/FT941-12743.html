			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Allied Textile makes Pounds 29m N American move Continuing its policy of overseas expansion, Allied Textile Companies, the textile manufacturer and processor, yesterday announced two acquisitions in North America for a combined consideration of about Pounds 29.3m in shares. The group also revealed a Pounds 1m rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.7m for the year to September 30. Shares rose 17p to 568p. Mr Peter Honeysett, chairman, ascribed the group's ability to consistently lift its textile profits in a recession to 'anticipating and constantly rationalising.' Mr John Corrin, chief executive, added that ATC had bought, sold or shut 24 units in the past 30 months, in response to market or product demand. Mr Corrin said the rise in textiles profits to Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 8.64m) had been greater than in previous years because of the Pounds 36.5m capital expenditure since 1990. The companies acquired are Cleyn &amp; Tinker, a Canadian maker of worsted cloth, and Carleton Woolen Mills, a US maker of wool and wool blend fabrics. C&amp;T raised operating profits from CDollars 1.41m to CDollars 3.32m in 1992 and has assets of CDollars 22.4m (Pounds 11.4m). ATC is paying CDollars 33.2m in shares on a p/e of 9.2 for C&amp;T, though this includes CDollars 15m to cover debt. Carleton made Dollars 4.33m (Dollars 4.38m) on turnover of Dollars 45.2m (Dollars 44.8m) in 1992. ATC is paying about Dollars 15.2m (Pounds 10.1m) via the issue of 2.03m new shares on a p/e of 7.7, plus the issue of up to 411,000 shares to the vendor, which are valued at Pounds 2.27m. Carleton has Dollars 9m of debt. The two companies' combined debt, along with ATC's October acquisition of Coatings Applications (Textiles) for about Pounds 6m, has all but wiped out the group's cash pile, which at the interim stage stood at Pounds 27m. The consideration shares are to be placed at 500p on a 1-for-5.3265 basis. Group turnover for the year slipped to Pounds 127.4m (Pounds 129.1m); earnings grew to 33.2p (30.8p) per share; and the final dividend is lifted to 8.3p for a total of 12.9p (12.6p). COMMENT It is almost impossible to find a critic of the transatlantic acquisitions. Having stalked C&amp;T for three years (and put continental European expansion on hold pending the recession), ATC has clearly done its homework. It waited for the successful conclusion of Nafta and then Gatt - the 36 per cent tariff barrier is set to reduce by 1 point a year - it has paid a good price and is still not geared and there should be no problems getting the paper away. Furthermore, the group's canny reputation has been enhanced by its growing openness. Forecasts for the current year range from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 18m pre-tax for earnings of 35p to 38.7p. giving a p/e of about 15, a discount to the market.</p>

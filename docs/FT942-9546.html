			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Outdoors: Snow poses a threat - FT Round the World Ski Expeditio - Arnie Wilson on the hazards of skiing in the Himalayas The Himalayas, potentially the greatest ski area in the world, almost wrecked our plans to ski every day of 1994. Since arriving in India, we have been forced to scramble over rocks and avalanche debris in search of skiable terrain, to follow snowploughs along roads and ski on snow bridges across streams swollen into torrents by melting snow. Merely getting this far was stressful enough: our connecting flight from Delhi to Bhuntar, in the foothills, was almost four hours late. Then we discovered that the Rohtang Pass - where we were scheduled to ski - was hopelessly blocked for the last 25kms after heavy unseasonal snow. Driving into the mountains, still two hours from any snow, we heard an ominous bump-bump-bump from a back wheel. A flat tyre at almost 3pm - time was running out. My companion, Lucy Dicker, and I, both felt a sinking feeling: after skiing for 124 consecutive days would this be the day we failed? At least our driver was carrying a spare, albeit quite bald. For the remainder of the journey into the Kullu Valley - the Valley of the Gods - he kept glancing anxiously at the replacement to make sure it was still with us. At last we entered Manali - 'the Queen of the Hill Stations' - consisting almost entirely of hotels, the only function of which is to cater for hordes of trekkers and tourists: the trekkers to trek, and the tourists, especially those from the rest of India, to escape from the heat and dust of the big cities such as Bombay and Madras into the cool mountain air, perhaps to frolic in the melting patches of snow. Entire families had rented red wellington boots, fur coats and gloves from shacks along the route, and sometimes skis and boots as well, to make a turn or two or simply pose for photographs. Everyone from grandmother down took delight in simply scrambling up the banks of snow and slithering down again. But Lucy and I needed something a little more ambitious. We had to take to the roads. In spite of many hairpin bends and precipitous drops, Indian drivers treat the narrow mountain pass to the Rohtang skiing area like a main street in Delhi, sounding their horns at every opportunity. Still short of our intended destination, we were forced to stop - we needed an army permit to travel further. But in the absence of the slightly sullen Major Randhawa, all we could do was to find the longest section of linked snow patches, self-consciously snap on our skis, and set off. We managed just under half a mile - not much, but at least we had skied in India the day after skiing in France. High above the army checkpoint, two huge snowploughs were trundling along the pass towards Rohtang; a third was being repaired by mechanics. For the next few days we went in search of new terrain, driving as far as we could behind the snowploughs as they inched towards Rohtang. In our search we ran the gauntlet of snowslides and rockfalls and in one particularly hair-rasing section of the route - a series of a dozen zig-zagging hairpin bends - huge blocks of snow and rock would suddenly appear. The skiing was dangerous and inelegant: Lucy dislodged a rock and slithered 10 yards down a gulley before I managed to disentangle her. The rock then fell on me. The next day I fell through a snow bridge but my skis stopped me falling into the stream below. I was struggling to climb back to the road when an oily hand reached out to haul me over the parapet. It was one of the snowplough repair men. And on our last day in India, we skied in monsoon conditions. In spite of the extraordinary kindness shown by our hosts, who resuscitated us like ringside assistants between rounds in a boxing match, we shall never forget the perils of the Rohtang Pass. After the Valley of the Gods, night skiing in Tokyo's new Ski Dome was going to be an absolute doddle. Travel arrangements were made by the Indian Tourist Office in London and Span Tours 'n' Travel, 36 Janpath, Delhi.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Emu not a discredited objective Sir, In his very sound article 'More Maastricht to come' (September 27) Ian Davidson errs in referring to 'the old (and discredited) objective of European Monetary Union'. He should not fall into the trap of mouthing excuses thought up by politicians whose policies have failed and who, like a bad carpenter, either blame their tools or pretend that the objective was wrong. No, sir. European Monetary Union is still very much on the cards. And why not? There has been a British Monetary Union in the UK for years. No-one challenges or questions that. Its advantages are so obvious that it is taken for granted. Why should not the countries of the European Community enjoy similar advantages? Monetary union will facilitate the free movement of people throughout the European Community and it will be a major boost to community-wide trade. The difficulty is how to get from the present situation of each EC country (except Belgium and Luxembourg, which already have a monetary union) having its own currency and its own economic and monetary policies, to the target situation of the European Community having one currency. And this accompanied, as it must be, by one economic and monetary policy. The ERM is one means of getting from the status quo to the target situation. Britain's prime minister, John Major, has himself suggested another (the 'hard Ecu'). And there are others. What is needed now is an objective assessment of what went wrong with the ERM and either the modification of the ERM to ensure that similar monetary disturbances do not happen again or the replacement of ERM by some other system that avoids the identified pitfalls. Then full speed ahead to Emu. We should not fool ourselves by believing the excuses of politicians who have failed. John Szemerey, 76 Marnixlaan, 3090 Overijse, Belgium</p>

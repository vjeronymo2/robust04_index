			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ economist sees metal prices remaining flat in 1994 Average base metal prices are unlikely to be much different this year from 1993, Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, forecast yesterday. In spite of some signs of economic recovery around the world, '1994 will not be a particularly exciting year for metals demand', he suggested as RTZ announced its annual results. There would certainly not be enough of an increase in demand to reverse the flood of excess metal into stocks. Several wild cards would continue to influence the supply and demand balance, including net Chinese trade, the behaviour of CIS exports, and conflicting influences on Western production. Prices would be liable 'to fluctuate over a fairly wide range before any clear tends become established'. But they should not drop back to the low points reached last November. Since then, prices have risen about 20 per cent. The rise 'was triggered, and even sustained by investors acting largely on technical analysis of chart patterns', Mr Crowson said. A substantial volume of funds, mainly US, had been seeking alternative outlets to equities and bonds. Many investment funds had a 'heads I win, tails I don't lose' attitude to the metal markets. If prices rose, they held on in expectation of further gains, and if they fell back, they considered metals even better bargains, and bought.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: SCHWANN SONG FOR YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC CATALOGUE  </P> <P> The chunky Schwann catalogue, beloved of music librarians, record collectors  and trivia buffs everywhere, is no more. Or rather, it is now a triumvirate of  publications, two quarterly catalogues led by a monthly magazine.  </P> <P> The first isssue of the magazine, inMusic, is out now. According to Gary  Higgins, the production editor, the initial circulation was 10,000 copies,  60-70% to record stores and the rest to individual subscribers.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get as much detail into the new releases as possible," Higgins  says of the magazine. "Basically, we're trying to keep it to little notes and  reviews, centered around the new releases."  </P> <P> This is a far-flung endeavor, with the editorial and advertising offices in  Boston, the publisher in Chatsworth, the printing facility in Santa Monica and  the individual subscription office in Nashville. "We've got it under control,"  Higgins laughs. "We do alot of faxing and overnight mailing."  </P> <P> The bulk of the current 76-page issue is devoted to listings of new classical  releases, in the format familiar to Schwann users. Look closely, though, and  you'll discover a wealth of informative editorial asides in fine print, blunt  in opinion and breezy in style.  </P> <P> A sampling:  </P> <P> "Among this month's avalanche of historic live broadcast releases are 11  Koussevitsky (mostly Boston Symphony Orchestra) CDs from Italy. . . . The 4th  movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony sung in French with Koussevitsky  conducting the French National Radio Orchestra &amp; Chorus (AS Disc AS-555),  for example, is marred by constant tape print-through, many sound dropouts, 15  seconds of what sounds like someone tinkling on a celesta or glockenspiel  off-hall a little over 3 minutes in, a complete half-second break mid-movement,  two repeated bars 23 minutes in as a result of a bad tape splice, and bits of  extraneous conversation audible in two soft passages. . . . As a final fillip,  the tape speeds up 25 seconds from the end, just as the chorus has begun its  rousing finish, sending everybody up approximately 3/4 of a tone for the rest  of the ride. Those excitable French engineers, I guess."  </P> <P> "This is one ("Carmen" excerpts) of five releases on vanity label GDS --  Giuseppe Di Stefano Records -- from Italy. . . . The unauthorized recordings  are of standard pirate (oh, sorry, we're not supposed to say that anymore; make  that 'public domain') quality sound, and reflect poorly on a great artist that  he would lend his name to such an enterprise."  </P> <P> "The back of this CD (vol. 2 of Szymanowski's piano music by Andrzej Stefanski)  bears the legend DIGITAL RECORDING in large bold type. It is not. The  recordings are from 1978-1981 and the SPARS code is A-A-D. This information is  also displayed on the back of the package, so perhaps it is not an attempt to  mislead. We have seen the phrase 'Digital Recording' misused by several labels  . . . often enough that we are persuaded that it is on occasion employed by  certain record labels in a deliberate effort to falsely represent their  product. More common is the use of the single word "Digital" printed on the  front or back of the CD, usually, though not always, on analog recordings.  Since all CDs are digitally mastered, signified by the (always 'D') third  component of the three-letter SPARS code, the term conveys no information as to  either the original recording or subsequent editing processes, and is, at best,  meaningless, but confusing and misleading to the unwary. While most labels are  not guilty of either practice, those irresponsible few that are do real injury  to the reputations of all."  </P> <P> Not your usual catalogue listings.  </P> <P> With inMusic concentrating on new releases in all fields, the traditional  Schwann cataloguing will devolve to the quarterlies; Spectrum for pop musics,  and Opus for classical recordings.  </P> <P> "In the past it's been geared a lot toward the classical audience," Higgins  says. "We're trying to broaden that audience."  </P> <P> ON THE ROAD: The current North American tour of the Alvin Ailey American Dance  Theater began in Birmingham, Ala., on Tuesday, and continues through June,  touching down on, among other stops, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Boston, Los  Angeles (at the Wiltern Theatre, May 8-13, sponsored by the UCLA Center for the  Arts) and Washington, D.C. The tour is sponsored by the Philip Morris  Companies, Inc. . . . The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, under Christopher  Hogwood, its music director, embarks on its second European tour March 5. The  tour begins in Geneva March 8 and ends in Zurich March 23. In between, the  orchestra will play in East Germany, Liechtenstein, Italy, the Netherlands,  Spain and Portugal. . . . In Adare, County Limerick, Ireland, the New Jersey  Symphony, under its music director Hugh Wolff, will be a major participant in a  new music festival to be housed in Adare Manor. The first Adare Festival takes  place July 13-29.  </P> <P> PEOPLE: Pianist Rosalind Runcie, wife of The Most Rev. Robert Runcie,  Archbishop of Canterbury, will make an appearance with the Chamber Orchestra at  St. Matthew's in Pacific Palisades Feb. 23 to benefit the new Episcopal  Diocesan Center to be built in Echo Park. Runcie will play Shostakovich's Piano  Concerto No. 2 on a program to be conducted by Thomas Neenan; the remainder of  the agenda: Mozart's "Coronation" Mass and Vaughan Williams' "The Lark  Ascending". . . . Frederick Swann, Robert Preston, Peter Sweeney, Jacques  Taddei and Ian Tracey are the international organists set to perform on the  1990 summer recital series at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. Swann,  organist at the Cathedral, opens the series May 4 with a program given in  memory of Virgil Fox, who died 10 years ago, and who designed the Hazel Wright  organ there. Preston, organist at First Presbyterian Church of San Diego,  appears June 1 with a brass ensemble; Sweeney, organist at Christ Church  Cathedral in Dublin, Ireland, plays July 12; Taddei, who succeeded Jean  Langlais as titulaire of St. Clotilde in Paris, France, appears July 27.  Tracey, organist at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral in England, closes the series,  Aug. 10.  </P> <P> BOOKSHELF: "We Build a School of Music," written by the late USC professor  Pauline Alderman, is an informal history of the 110-year-old USC School of  Music. Filled with facts, pictures and Alderman's observations, the 353-page  book, originally intended for release during the school's centennial in 1980,  has just been published by the Alderman Book Committee.  </P> <P> After Alderman's death in 1983, a group of volunteers assembled to complete the  work.  </P> <P> "We didn't write it. We just put it together," said Dorothy Jean Hartshorn,  retired music education chair from USC. "Her style of writing and usage of  words is part of the charm."  </P> <P> The book (at $24.95) can be obtained from Carol Skinner, 1806 Hollyvista, Los  Angeles, Calif. 90027. Proceeds from the purchase will benefit the Alderman  Scholarship Fund.  </P> <P>  Daniel Cariaga and David Sweet contributed to this column.  </P> <P>  For the Record: In some editions of last Sunday's Calendar, Martin  Bernheimer's byline was left off the commentary in the music section entitled  "The Supertenor Calls the Shots in Los Angeles."  </P></p>

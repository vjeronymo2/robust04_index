			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm on rise in producer prices US TREASURY securities firmed across the board yesterday after a modest rise in April producer prices left the monetary authorities with room for another policy ease. In late trading the benchmark 30-year issue was up  11/32 at 101 19/32 , yielding 7.855 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  3/32 at 100 3/8 , yielding 5.154 per cent. The morning's inflation news was good, with the core producer prices index rising just 0.2 per cent last month, a slightly smaller increase than expected. Analysts said that while the data was unlikely to trigger a cut in interest rates, it did leave the window open for any easing if the Federal Reserve felt inclined to provide the sluggish economic recovery with some additional stimulus. Although the consensus in the market appears to favour an interest rate cut, analysts said monetary policy was unlikely to be changed until after next Tuesday's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee. UK government bond prices rose yesterday following the release of factory gate price data which suggested that inflationary pressures in the economy were weakening. The June gilt futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, opened at 98.18 and fell to 98.13 early in the session before the inflation data was released. However, in the afternoon the contract traded up to 98.26 before settling back to close at 98.20. Volume was light at 28,000 contracts. In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed at 98 23/32 , unchanged on the day, for a yield of 9.04 per cent. Analysts were encouraged by figures for factory gate prices in April, which showed a 0.4 per cent rise on the month, well below market expectations of a 0.8 per cent rise. Prices rose at a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent, from 4.5 per cent in March, the largest monthly drop in this measure of inflation since 1983. However, while the figures were encouraging, investors will be paying more attention to retail price inflation data due to be released on Friday. THE GERMAN government bond market remained subdued yesterday, with most market participants waiting for the outcome of the current round of wage negotiations before committing funds. Yesterday, IG. Metall, the engineering and metal workers' union, said that it would decide whether to ballot its 65,000 members over strike action on May 18. The June bund future on Liffe opened at 87.18, and drifted down to 87.10 by mid-morning, in line with other European markets. However, the future rose though the afternoon session encouraged by the positive tone of the US Treasuries market and closed at 87.22. Volume was again sluggish at 40,000 contracts. The benchmark 10-year 8 per cent Unity bond closed at 100.17 for a yield of 7.97 per cent, unchanged from Monday. The French government bond market consolidated the gains of the last week, with the yield spread over the German market stable at just over 60 basis points through the day. The 8 1/2 per cent French government OAT maturing 2002 closed on a yield of 8.57 per cent, also unchanged on the day. JAPANESE government bond prices were firmer overnight in Tokyo, led higher by the strong performance of US Treasuries. However, in the absence of new domestic factors trading remained thin. Trading in the benchmark bond amounted to just Y112bn. The benchmark government bond issue No 129 actually fell on the day, closing on a yield of 5.60 per cent, from 5.59 per cent at the opening. Analysts said that investors were starting to switch into longer-dated paper. The issue No 129 matures in June 2000.</p>

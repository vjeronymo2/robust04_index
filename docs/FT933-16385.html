			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Loans for the boys (1) BECAUSE OF problems in his business, I have been making my son personal interest-free loans for the past few months, all without written documentation. I believe this private agreement is of no concern to anyone else, including the taxman? Am I right? Broadly speaking, the answer is yes - unless, of course, your son's tax inspector asks where the money in question came from. For a number of reasons, though, it would be as well to ask your son for a written acknowledgement of the loans. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

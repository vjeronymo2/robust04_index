			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH CRITICIZED ON CHINA  </P> <P> "Attention all dictators: Feel free to openly commit mass murder upon innocent  citizens of your country with minimal cost to your relations with the U.S."  </P> <P> This is the message implicit in the Bush Administration's response to events in  China since the massacre. The message has been underscored even further by  Scowcroft's meeting with Deng Xiaoping, the Butcher of Beijing himself. This  meeting came about not because of any improvement of the situation within  China, but only because the Administration felt that contacts had been  suspended long enough.  </P> <P> Evidently, when it comes to mass murder, the President feels that six months is  plenty of time after which to let bygones be bygones. I do not know how others  in the U.S. react to this, but it makes me sick to my stomach.  </P> <P> DANA HONEYCUTT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

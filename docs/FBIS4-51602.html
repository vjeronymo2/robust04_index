			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit has  emphatically ruled out the possibility of another coup, saying  only neurotics expect the military to seize power again.    "I can assure my fellow countrymen that there won't be  another coup," Gen Wimon said yesterday.    "Those who always sniff up (rumors of) a coup must have a  bad, non-functional nose. These neurotic people deserve all the  derision and scorn of the public."    Wimon also urged the media to ignore "ignorant and  unsupported" predictions of another coup. He was responding to  an academic's comments that present political uncertainty could  result in the military again stepping in.    Chalongphop Suksangkan, the director of the Thailand  Development Research Institute, said on Wednesday he believed  there could be another coup unless Prime Minister Chuan Likphai  dissolves the House of Representatives to defuse the political  crisis. His widely-publicized comment was made at a seminar  organized by the Board of Trade.    Chalongphop said the bombings in the South and the perceived  poor performance of the government had hurt the economy and  could lead to political tensions resulting in a coup.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters at Government  House yesterday that the likelihood of another coup was a  non-issue and not worth discussing.    "I would like to ask those (who keep talking about the  possibility of a coup): Are you doing this because you cannot  hold your tongue, or because you want it to happen?"    A visibly annoyed Chuan said the public should help find  ways  to accelerate the country's democratization process rather than  paying attention to "unproductive speculation."    "The country's democratization has come a long way. But the  political development still is not fast enough for some groups  of people," Chuan said. "My advice is don't give up hope. We  are making steady progress."    Politicians and senior military officers said talking about  a  possible coup was counter-productive to the growth of democracy.  Such talk would only damage Thailand's credibility in the eyes  of the international community and scare away foreign investors.</p>

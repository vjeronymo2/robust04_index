			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Denmark expected to launch tightly-priced Dollars 1bn FRN THE INTERNATIONAL bond market expects the Kingdom of Denmark to launch an aggressively-priced Dollars 1bn issue of four-year floating-rate notes (FRNs) today. Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National Bank, confirmed that the notes would pay interest below the London interbank offered rate (Libor) but declined to say by how much. The market expects the coupon to pay up to  3/16 of a point below Libor. Mr Sorensen declined to say which bank had been awarded the mandate for the offering, Denmark's third transaction in the international bond issue in as many weeks. The proceeds from the notes will be used to replenish the country's foreign exchange reserves. They were depleted by heavy currency intervention in recent weeks to help restore stability to the European exchange rate mechanism. Yesterday, the Province of Ontario and the European Investment Bank (EIB) succeeded in raising cheaper funding than usual when they swapped the proceeds of two international bond issues which raised Pounds 255m and CDollars 500m respectively. In what is known as a 'back-to-back' or 'parallel' deal, Ontario and the EIB used their rarity value in the sterling and Canadian dollar sectors to achieve fairly aggressive terms on their seven-year offerings. The two borrowers then ultimately took on the other's liabilities, so that Ontario ended up with Canadian dollars and the EIB with sterling at much lower interest rates than they would have done had they raised the funds directly in the market. Both borrowers were believed to have achieved a saving of at least 10 basis points. Officials at the joint lead managers, BZW and Salomon Brothers, said that demand for both bond issues was good but that Ontario's bonds were selling faster because of the current lack of supply in the Eurosterling market. As a result, when Ontario's bonds were freed to trade, their yield spread over the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2000 tightened to around 32 basis points from 35 basis points at pricing. However, the yield spread over the underlying Canadian Treasury on the EIB's bonds widened to around 14 basis points from 12 basis points at pricing. Officials at Ontario's borrowing department said that after yesterday's transaction the province had completed just over half of its CDollars 10bn borrowing needs for fiscal 1993. The State Bank of New South Wales also tapped the Canadian dollar sector with a 10-year, CDollars 150m offering which was priced to yield 52 basis points over the underlying Canadian Treasuries. The deal was arranged by Merrill Lynch, which also lead-managed a Dollars 200m issue of FRNs for Finnish Export Credit. An official at Merrill Lynch said that the notes were likely to be taken up by holders of an earlier FRN issue by the same borrower, since those notes are expected to be called in December 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Regions Enter Federalist Debate </F> With Initiative"]    [Text] (ANSA) Florence, April 9 -- The central Italian  regions of Tuscany, Emilia Romagna, Umbria and the Marche, which  bucked the rightist trend in Italy's recent elections, have  begun their own initiative on the question of federalism, in  favor of the German model over the American one and stressing  how any change must be the result of consensus between majority  and opposition.    The regions are slated to meet here on Wednesday [13 April]  in an effort to play a more active role in the federalist  debate, which until now has been dominated by the Northern  League, and to stress the need to reconcile federalism with  national unity, the basis of which they claim would be the  creation of a House of Regions.    The president of the Region of Tuscany, Vannino Chiti,  explained here on Saturday how "The federalism we envision as  Italian regions and promoters of this initiative foresees a new  balance of powers and responsibilities between the central state  and the regions."    "The problem of the so-called macro-regions," he added,  "arises when the debate on federalism is shifted to questions of  sovereignty. But, in this case, the issue becomes confederalism  and not federalism. The responsibilities of the regions cannot  be expanded from the center nor can they put national unity into  question."    Given these considerations, Chiti went on to argue how, for  Italy, the best federalist model would be Germany, "also because  it would be better adapt to the European Union. Those of the  League are wrong to point to the example of the United States,  which is too different for tradition, culture and size." In  Chiti's view, the blueprint mapped out between Northern League  leader Umberto Bossi and Giancarlo Fini of the National Alliance  "would violate important rules of democratic behavior."    "In all democratic nations" he observed, "the rules  governing  democratic life are the result of a consensus between the  majority and the opposition. One cannot conceive of making  institutional reforms over the heads of almost half of  parliament and of the regions which are supposed to be part of  the reform of the state."    The regions' federalist initiative, on the other hand, "is  of  an institutional type" Chiti said, and added "We cannot tolerate  that one force, which presents itself to be more contradictory  than one could imagine, can impose on or discriminate against an  important economic reality for the nation."    The federalist debate now moves to next week's conference of  the presidents of all Italian regions from which a proposal is  expected to be agreed on which can then be brought to the  attention of the head of state.    (The argument that constitutional reform cannot be forced on  by a parliamentary majority was also underscored in Rome today  by Raffaele Costa, head of the Centrist Union which was part of  the winning Freedom Alliance. Constitutions, he said, cannot be  changed through the will of a simple majority, but must also be  the result of a consensus with the opposition).</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: EDITING A CLASSIC TEXT -- AN ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR  </P> <P> In his review of George Bernard Shaw's "Man and Superman" at South Coast  Repertory, Don Shirley takes exception to the way in which the play has been  edited. In doing so, he attributes SCR's playing version of the text to Amlin  Gray, a mistake which must be corrected at the outset. Although Martin Benson,  the director of SCR's production, did refer to a version prepared by Gray for  Berkeley Rep, along with versions from San Diego's Old Globe and Washington's  Arena Stage, none of these is being used as the performance text for SCR's  production.  </P> <P> Benson and I (as the dramaturge for the SCR production) prepared our own  version, which was then further refined through Benson's work with his actors.  </P> <P> That's the way it should be. To appropriate someone else's edition  </P> <P> of a play in toto is to shirk a primary responsibility. The SCR text is of  necessity a product of SCR's own artistic collaboration: Its editing choices  were made with our production approach in mind and were tested and validated  through six weeks of rehearsal and a week of preview performances.  </P> <P> While I find arguable Shirley's specific opinions (Sept. 10) about the cuts we  made for our production, I won't argue with them here. I do feel, however, that  it would be worthwhile to clarify how and why we went about the process of  trimming Shaw's mammoth work down to playable size.  </P> <P> SCR values the text as the center of the theatrical event and our primary  objective is always to realize the writer's vision. Nevertheless, very few  classic plays are performed in their entirety any more, at SCR or any other  theater in America; not, as Shirley suggests, because actors can't memorize all  those lines (they can), but because audiences won't sit still for them. Prior  to the modern age, theatergoers had no qualms about sitting for four hours or  more to take in a play.  </P> <P> More recently, the collective attention span has dwindled, perhaps because  movies and television have instilled in us a different sense of rhythm and  pace. In today's theater, three hours' duration seems to be the outer limit,  excepting those rare shows such as "Nicholas Nickleby" or "The Mahabharata,"  whose extraordinary length becomes a crucial aspect of the theatrical  experience.  </P> <P> So the contemporary producer of such classics as "Hamlet" (four hours plus),  "Peer Gynt" (six to seven hours) or Goethe's "Faust" (off the chart) faces a  thorny task. How to keep such plays in the repertory without putting people to  sleep or sending them to their cars at intermission?  </P> <P> For "Man and Superman," which has been known to clock in at five hours, the  common solution (endorsed even by Shaw himself) is to eliminate the hourlong  "Don Juan in Hell" dream scene or to perform it separately. Yet as Shirley  observes the remaining portion of the play, the romantic comedy, seems  "surprisingly trivial" and "conventional" by itself. Hence our decision to  retain the dream, which serves up the philosophical meat of the play and  provides an intellectual context for the otherwise frivolous romance.  </P> <P> We wanted our audience to hear Shaw's ruminations on the Life Force in the  dream scene, thereby to appreciate the comic love story of Jack and Ann as a  lighthearted example of the Life Force in action.  </P> <P> This meant that we had to look for other, less convenient ways to condense the  play. We aimed for no arbitrary time limit and were prepared to accept as long  an evening as would be necessary to do the play justice. As we investigated,  each proposed cut was debated, its merits weighed against its faults;  ultimately we removed only material which seemed redundant or unhelpfully  tangential or, in a few cases, hopelessly obscure.  </P> <P> No cut was made casually. Take, for example, the first-act conversation between  Jack and Ann about their shared childhood. Shirley cites this as an example of  our infelicitous editing, implying that we dismissed the scene as mere  "entertaining repartee." He argues that our version obscures an audience's  understanding of Jack and Ann's obsession with one another and the  inevitability of their final embrace.  </P> <P> I suggest that we have preserved enough of the scene to make clear Jack and  Ann's deep and longstanding connection. More importantly, the fact that these  two have known each other since childhood matters very little in the scheme of  the play: as Shaw's Don Juan tells us, "In the sex relation the pair may be  utter strangers to one another, but the Life Force throws them into one  another's arms at the exchange of a glance."  </P> <P> In other words, Ann and Jack's final embrace is inevitable because that's the  way the Life Force wants it. All else is beside the point. Such analysis,  supported by careful experimentation during rehearsal, led to our decision to  eliminate some of the exposition in this scene while preserving its spirit and  emotional subtext.  </P> <P> In capable hands, the process of editing a classic text is never a desperate  effort to force a Size 9 play into a Size 6 show. It becomes an artistic  endeavor whose objective is to hone and polish and streamline the play for  contemporary sensibilities -- and to do so without damaging the play or  reducing the audience's experience of it. In my opinion, the version of Shaw's  play which we have prepared is, for this day and age and with respect to the  goals of our production, considerably better than the one he prepared himself.  After all, he anticipated that it would never be staged at all.  </P></p>

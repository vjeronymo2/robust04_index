			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Computer-controlled trucks go for gold - How Modular Mining dug into the vehicle dispatch business IT CANNOT be often that a company invests Dollars 2.5m and immediately covers the cost. But that happened when American Barrick Resources, the Canadian gold mining group, bought a computer-based truck dispatch system for its big Goldstrike gold mine in Nevada. Mr Bob Smith, Barrick's president recalls: 'The package cost Dollars 2.5m and we immediately saved 10 to 15 per cent of our haulage truck requirements. That's three trucks at Dollars 1.4m each'. Then came productivity gains from the system, which enables a central dispatcher to know where every haulage truck and big mechanical shovel is at every second of the working day in the huge open pit. Mr Smith points out: 'There's often Dollars 80,000 of gold on one of our 190-tonne trucks. If that's accidentally dumped as waste, that's a big loss. The system double-checks, so there are fewer losses. In mining you've gotta roll with the punches. Nothing is ever the way you expect and the computer reacts faster than the human brain'. The truck dispatch system concept is a simple one: to link shovels, trucks and dump points at a big mine together using a central computer connected via a radio network to microcomputers on the equipment. This collects real-time data and makes assignment decisions as well as general reports for management. But it is far from easy to put the concept into effect. One company, Modular Mining of Tucson, Arizona, seems to have a monopoly. Mr James White, MM's executive vice-president says: 'Several other companies claim to offer similar technology, but as yet have failed to make a sale. Several mines thought the problem was simple and developed one-of-a-kind, in-house systems over the years. We have replaced such systems in Australia, Canada, Papua New Guinea and South Africa'. He says, for example, at RTZ's huge Palabora open pit copper mine in South Africa, where there are three main ore types, numerous dumps, 20 different waste categories, three crushers feeding five storage pads and multiple composite blasts, MM's dispatch system improved productivity by 7 per cent compared with the in-house one it replaced. The list of MM's new clients last year included De Beers in South Africa, Gecamines in Zaire and Southern Peru Copper, as well as Kennecott, the RTZ copper-gold subsidiary, in the US, and Echo Bay's McCoy/Cove gold mine in Nevada. Use of the system does not, of course, alway produce results as dramatic as those at American Barrick. At Kennecott's Bingham Canyon copper mine, the dispatch system was installed last summer because Kennecott believed it could win a modest productivity improvement, while ensuring that its expensive in-pit ore crusher and conveyor system would always be kept fully occupied. Mr Rod Davey, vice-president and general manager of operations at Bingham, says no substantial improvements could be expected from the truck and shovel fleet, given that the equipment is spread along five miles of roads in the pit, which is 5,000 feet deep. Ultimately, the MM system achieved what he expected - a 2 per cent improvement - and, also as predicted, it seems likely to pay for itself in three years. Mr Davey says his company looked at several potential suppliers for a truck dispatch system 'but Modular had a bit of a track record so we chose them'. So success is breeding success. But it took a great deal of tenacity by the founders before MM could build its present monopoly. Mr White recalls that at one stage in the early days the office drinking-water cooler was removed to save Dollars 7.50 a month. He was a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Arizona's College of Mines and joined up with Phelps Dodge, the biggest copper mining group in the US, to develop the truck dispatch system that was first used in PD's Tyrone mine in 1980 and later at its flagship Morenci mine. He was joined by Mr Michael Arnold, a colleague from the university, who is now MM's president, and Mr Mark Baker, a consulting engineer who represented PD in the early days. Mr Baker is senior vice-president. MM started in business just as the mining industry was plunged into the worst recession in living memory. Banks shied away from a company with 'mining' in its name but Mr White recalls: 'We persevered, tightened our belts, took sizeable salary cuts, watched every dime - that's when the water cooler was removed - and used home equity, personal revolving lines of credit and personal credit cards to provide needed cash flow'. MM completed a survey in 1982 which showed that there were then only 370 mines of a size to justify the use of its technology. With such a small prospective client base, it decided to contact companies directly. Eventually this paid off with the first contract outside the PD organisation  -with Quintette Coal for its Tumbler Ridge mine in British Columbia in January, 1983. During these direct contacts Mr White emphasises that the system - which MM calls, would you believe, Dispatch - can help to manage almost the entire mining operation once installed. It picks the best haul routes in open pit mines. It monitors pit disturbances and adjusts the haulage flow pattern to exploit present mine conditions. It tracks equipment delays and equipment breakdowns, adjusting its instructions to compensate. Management can ask the system 'what if?' questions to see how changes such as big shovel moves, new dump placements, digging rate variations and shovel priority schemes, would affect production. Dispatch also allows management to determine truck and shovel efficiencies by fleet or by individual items of equipment and to analyse each segment of the haulage cycle to evaluate the performance of tyres, engine parts an so on. The system monitors vital signs on vehicles, such as oil pressure, wheel motor currents, so that maintenance personnel can monitor a vehicle while it is working and spot potential problems before they cause expensive down time, says Mr White. However, Kennecott's Mr Davey points out that there is a danger of the user being swamped by all this. 'It can become a question of doing less and less with more and more data,' he says. 'The system is not a panacea. Management must continue to manage.' There is also a potentially controversial aspect to the system. It might well be seen as a 'spy in the cab' or part of a regime where 'Big Brother' is watching the drivers. Mr White says one of its benefits is that: 'Dispatch watches operator actions. Drivers can no longer grab an extra ten minute smoke break at a far dump. The system alerts the dispatcher within seconds whenever the operator is late.' However, Mr Davey at Kennecott suggests that a majority of his drivers have welcomed the system. 'It gives them something to fool with and they feel more a part of the team. It sometimes gets boring in those cabs. Also we would never use the system to compare the performance of one driver with another.' At American Barrick, Mr Smith also says the system need not necessarily sap employee morale. 'Okay, it stops drivers taking some sneaky time out but it also tells them when they must take a break - sometimes when the supervisor might want them to keep working,' he points out. American Barrick also arranged for employees to benefit from the productivity gains arising from the use of Dispatch. A bonus system was implemented based on the tonnage of ore mined, ounces of gold produced, the mine's safety record and production cost. This has been giving drivers an extra Dollars 240 each a month to add to their basic pay of Dollars 16 an hour.</p>

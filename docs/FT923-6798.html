			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome support to end PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome advanced sharply as traders sensed that the 'green shoe' operation to support the price of the group's global share issue was about to be ended. Late last night, Robert Fleming, the merchant bank heading the global share issue, said the support operation, which allowed it to buy back up to 40.5m shares in order to stabilise the 800p issue price, would terminate at the close of yesterday's trading session in New York, assuming no sudden collapse in the US market overnight. The winding-up of the issue will mean that Wellcome Trust, the governing charity, will have reduced its stake to 40 per cent and sold around 290m shares to raise Pounds 2.32bn minus expenses. The money is expected to be reinvested in equities. Wellcome shares closed a net 10 higher at 802p after high turnover of 9.4m. Fleming could have operated the 'green shoe' until next Wednesday but said it had not bought any Wellcome shares since August 12, since when the share price had held up well in a completely free market. Mr Ian Hannam, who has been co-ordinating the issue, said that ending the support process would give a chance to analysts, gagged by Stock Exchange rules, to publish research on the company. There have been fears that Wellcome's forecast of full-year profits of Pounds 500m to Pounds 510m might be affected by a weaker dollar, but the company has been reassuring analysts. Securities house Hoare Govett and agency broker James Capel, both linked to the flotation, were believed yesterday to be preparing positive research. Hillsdown drops Food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings fell victim to a rash of negative rumours in the wake of a series of recent downgrades in the run-up to its interim results, due early next month. The timing and manner of the fall in the share price suggested to some dealers a bear raid on the stock. Nomura became the latest to downgrade the group yesterday, chopping Pounds 17m from its full-year estimate to Pounds 193m. The move is the latest in a revision of the whole food manufacturing sector by analysts across the market. Hillsdown shares came under pressure early yesterday, following activity in the option market. This appeared to be the signal for the rumour mill to grind into action, with questions hinted about Hillsdown's profitability and talk that the company may issue a deeply negative trading statement. Both suggestions were dismissed by analysts, but the damage to the shares was already done. They closed 13 down at 94p after busy turnover of 6.4m. Insurance broker Willis Corroon fell 8 in pre-market trading and finished a net 16 off at 170p on heavy turnover of 7.3m shares after the company posted lower than expected half-year profits of Pounds 54m. A range of analysts' profits forecasts predicted between Pounds 60m and Pounds 66m, against Pounds 69.4m last time. The company said profits for 1992 would not match those for 1991 because of world insurance and financial market factors, together with the cost of the firm's long-term investments. CE Heath declined 9 to 251p in sympathy. An upgrade for Boots lifted the shares 9 to 452p. After meeting the company, Nomura added Pounds 10m to this year's forecast, to Pounds 420m, and raised 1993's figure Pounds 15m to Pounds 470m. John Menzies escaped a hangover from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into newspaper suppliers, recovering 11 to 331p. SG Warburg was said to be positive. But nervousness ahead of next week's figures kept WH Smith under pressure to end 8 lower at 383p. Brewer and hotelier Vaux was knocked by a sell note and downgrade from Smith New Court, shedding 6 to 168p. There were also reported downgrades in Bass, off a penny at 520p, by BZW and Hoare Govett. Exceptionally large turnover in Racal Electronics followed a big sale by a leading UK institution. Dealers said 11m shares were crossed at 63p, with an eventual 26m dealt, making it the most heavily traded stock of the day. The shares edged forward a halfpenny to 64p. British Gas was a penny firmer at 236 1/2 p after announcing that a partnership with Tractebel, of Belgium, had been selected to develop, own and operate a Pounds 175m central plant to serve a Thai petrochemical complex. In spite of a 21 per cent rise in first-half profits, environmental services group Rentokil ended a penny easier at 147p. The company, which has expanded through more than 100 small to medium-sized acquisitions into hygiene, building and office services, has increased profits at around 20 per cent a year for the last 10 years. Analysts expect that growth rate to continue through this year, with full-year profits of around Pounds 114m. Two large lines of stock, one of which turned into a badly executed sale, was said to have unhinged Ladbroke. The shares receded 8 to 141p with turnover a hefty 5.3m. In transports, NFC was in demand and moved ahead 7 to 242p, but profit-taking was seen in BAA, 5 down at 666p. British Aerospace advanced 9 to 213p in early trading on talk that the company was about to announce the long-awaited order from Saudi Arabia for the Tornado military aircraft. The stock was also said to have been helped by a reported buy recommendation from broker Strauss Turnbull. But sellers appeared at the higher levels, leaving the shares 4 up at 208p. T &amp; N eased 3 to 137p after James Capel crossed a block of shares at 137 1/2 p. Inchcape shrugged off recent weakness and rallied 9 to 386p after broker SG Warburg recommended the stock, saying: 'Recent falls have been overdone and now is the time to buy for the long term.' A squeeze in English China Clays helped the shares buck the trend in a dull building and construction sector. The stock added 7 at 499p in thin trading. Hartstone was wanted and bounced 4 to 129p. Financial worries continued to overhang Trafalgar House, which finished 3 1/2 lower at 48 1/2 p. Profit-taking in Lonrho brought a reaction of 3 to 78p after Wednesday's gain.

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Gaviria in UK investment drive ONE of the main purposes of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's visit to the UK, which began yesterday, is to persuade investors that his country is a land of economic opportunity with an unfortunate image, writes Sarita Kendall in Bogota. He will be shuttling from a Guildhall dinner in the City, from the CBI and the Bank of England, to meetings with Mr John Major, the prime minister, other cabinet ministers and the press. The Gaviria government's economic liberalisation programme, begun three years ago, is at a crucial stage. After a relatively easy ride, cracks have begun to appear. These are being papered over but economic experts are questioning whether Colombia was ready for such radical reform. Industry and agriculture have felt the effects of a big increase in imports over the last 18 months. Overall, the economy grew by 3.5 per cent in 1992, but agriculture declined by 0.9 per cent and industry grew by only 0.9 per cent. Industrialists are protesting at the inflow of cheap textiles, footwear, cigarettes and paper products, and at the inability of the customs service to prevent contraband. Not everyone is unhappy though - chemical and pharmaceutical companies and vehicle manufacturers are all benefiting from cheaper imports used in their processes. Agriculture is in bad shape, however. Production of grains and vegetable oils has fallen in response to low-priced imports, while export crops - such as bananas, coffee and flowers - hit by international marketing problems, are in further trouble because of the gradual revaluation of the peso. So far the reforms have not drawn foreign investors to Colombia as expected. Last year direct foreign investment limped up to Dollars 308m (Pounds 205.3m), excluding the oil sector which will be attracting much foreign capital over the next few years as the Cusiana oil and gas reserves are developed.</p>

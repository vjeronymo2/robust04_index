The six-lane expressway will require an investment of 3.6  billion yuan, to be jointly provided by the highway  administration of the municipal government and the Tianhe  Company from Hong Kong, the officials said.    The expressway, starting from the Madian cloverleaf on the  northeast and ending at the Badaling Great Wall, one of  Beijing's chief tourist attractions, will also greatly improve  Beijing's link with Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, which now  account for one- fifth of the traffic flow to the capital, the  officials added.</p>

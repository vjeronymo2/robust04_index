			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (15): 'Birds can mean good business' - Environmental Tourism MOST TOURISTS take one look at the Gouves estuary with its shallow, brackish lagoons and tufts of spiky grass and head further down the beach. But birdwatchers are fascinated: this 30-acre wetland near Heraklion on the northern coast of Crete is a stop-over for dozens of exotic species migrating to and from the rest of Europe. With a little luck, Gouves should become the first organised centre for environmental tourism in Greece. Next to it is a 680-bed hotel belonging to Grechotel, the country's largest hotel management group, which is backing the project. The problem until recently was opposition from local residents, who wanted to fill in the river delta and take advantage of soaring prices for property close to the sea. In fact, one part of the delta is now covered by a soccer pitch. But the remaining lagoons are still frequented by such rarities as the giant flamingo, the glossy ibis, the pallid harrier and the booted eagle. More than 170 species have been logged on spring visits by British birdwatching groups. Mr Nikos Daskalantonakis, Grechotel's chairman, who owns a sizeable part of the delta, is ready to see his property included in a nature reserve planned for Gouves. 'Green tourism could be very successful on Crete,' he says. 'Why shouldn't Gouves set the trend?' Many Greek wetlands have disappeared in the past 20 years as long stretches of sandy coastline were swallowed up by hotels and bungalow complexes. Though specialised bird and flower tours to Crete have been operating for years, environmental awareness was slow to develop in the rush to exploit traditional sea and sun tourism. But members of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature have been taking an interest in Gouves for several years. Now the Greek tourism ministry is also involved. A scheme to develop Gouves along the lines of the highly successful Minsmere nature reserve in Suffolk is being considered for European Community funding, as one of four green tourism projects in Crete. If accepted, the Community would contribute 50 per cent of the costs initially estimated at about Dr48m (Dollars 250,000). In the meantime, the bird enthusiasts have been trying to persuade people in Gouves that their lagoons will be worth more in the long run if they are not filled in and sold off as building plots. Mrs Anne Cryer, who runs a travel business for the Wildlife Trust in Britain, argued the case with the villagers with the help of videotapes from Minsmere dubbed into Greek. 'I think there's now a growing realisation that Gouves actually has a natural resource that will help it catch up with other tourist areas. Birds can mean very good business,' she says.</p>

Peregrine Capital was 'a pioneer and market leader' in sponsoring Chinese enterprises seeking to be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, he said. In 1992, it participated in more than 40 fund-raising exercises, involving total funds of more than HKDollars 19bn. Mr Tose said the bank had built a big presence in China.

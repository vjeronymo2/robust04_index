			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo preoccupied by economy and politics - Emiko Terazono on prospects for Japanese equities Uncertainty over the ability of the Japanese prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, to resolve mounting political and economic issues has kept investors away from the Tokyo stock market in spite of low long-term yields and falling money market rates. Political developments have preoccupied investors as the government's decision to open the rice market and the passage of the political reform bill have become crucial issues, alongside government-mooted additional fiscal measures to prop up the sagging economy. Mr Hosokawa is currently trying to juggle these issues. However, last week's plunge in the Nikkei index to a year's low of 16,078.71, wiping out the market's local currency gains for the year, has unnerved government officials. It has forced them to turn more of their attention to the economy, and prompted cabinet members to pledge support for share prices through economic stimulus. Analysts point out that an income tax cut, designed to lift sluggish consumption, is already discounted into share prices. Ms Tomoko Fujii, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says that the chances of a market plunge are high if the government fails to announce an income tax cut of around Y5,000bn-Y6,000bn soon. However, the income tax cuts are expected to form part of an overall tax reform package. Mr Hosokawa will need to twist the arms of bureaucrats at the ministry of finance, which is staunchly insisting that a tax cut be coupled with a consumption tax hike to maintain fiscal soundness. The prime minister does not have time on his side. He still needs to push political reform through parliament during the current session. If he fails to implement reform, the cabinet is likely to resign, followed by a lower house election, causing a delay in the implementation of economic measures. Meanwhile, some investors point out that even if additional stimuli are announced, their implementation will take time. 'The underlying fundamentals won't change in a short term,' says a fund manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest life insurer. However, he says that the company is ready to bargain hunt shares around the 16,000 level. Pessimism over the economy is increasing. Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities recently announced that the economy would contract by 0.4 per cent in the next business year. The NRI forecast presumes that the government will introduce another economic stimulus package and an income tax cut, and that the official discount rate will be reduced from the present record low of 1.75 per cent to 1 per cent. Concerns over the country's labour market are also heightening as unemployment is rising and the number of job offers are falling. Unemployment in October rose to 2.7 per cent, a six-year high, while the ratio of job offers to job seekers fell to a six-year low of 0.67, or 67 jobs for 100 seekers. And while the July-September quarter gross domestic product grew 0.5 per cent from the preceding three months, economists attribute the growth to last minute output by companies and aggressive discounts by retailers ahead of the half year book closing. Most market participants hope that trading will fluctuate around the 17,000 level for the rest of this year. However, the new year may see increased liquidation of stock holdings by companies ahead of the March book closing. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities says that companies have already sold some Y1,900bn worth of shares this year, and are potential sellers of another Y1,000bn. Banks, which still need to write off mounting bad loans are also expected to continue to realise profits on their long term holdings. Many brokers hope that a declining trend in the yen will support export oriented high-technology stocks, whose weakness this year has reflected sharp falls in profits, due to sluggish consumer confidence and foreign exchange losses. 'The trading cycle points to electronic stocks,' says Mr Ueki at Nikko. Some institutional investors, especially life insurers, which have low exposure to equities, are looking for higher yielding investments. Many shifted into the bond market at the start of the year, and total investments in bonds rose by 42 per cent in the year to June, accounting for almost half of their net cash flow. Most investors hope that the government will deliver a boost to share prices eventually, and that public insurance and postal funds will come in to buy shares as they did during the first half of this year. While purchases by public funds have evaporated since the flotation of East Japan Railway in October, weakness in equities ahead of the March year end book closing of their books might bring government influence to bear. Meanwhile, some analysts take comfort in a traditional approach. Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, points out that stock markets tend to be strong during the first four months of the year. 'Investors come in at the start of the year with a determination to make money,' he explains.</p>

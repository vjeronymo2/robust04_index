			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AGREEABLE DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Laguna Beach city officials and the Irvine Co. last week showed a remarkable  willingness to search for a solution to the long-running controversy over the  Laguna Laurel residential project planned for Laguna Canyon. While far from  completed, the negotiations are a welcome softening of positions that were  becoming so hardened that mutual agreement seemed impossible.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. has long had the Orange County Board of Supervisors' approval  for the 2,000-acre residential development. But board approval did not bring  with it community support. There were the usual concerns about traffic and  indeed about any development -- even a low-density one -- in Laguna Canyon's  treasured open space. Recently, an estimated 7,000 protesters -- many of them  from outside Laguna Beach -- marched through the canyon to demonstrate their  opposition to the project. It was a clear message that may have prodded the  Irvine Co. to rethink the plan.  </P> <P> The current proposal calls for moving the project to Irvine if a number of  conditions are met. Whether it's a good idea is yet to be seen. Much depends on  the reaction in Irvine. Still, it is encouraging that all parties keep looking  for a plan that will work for everyone.  </P></p>

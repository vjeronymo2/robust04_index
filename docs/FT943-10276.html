			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Top general angers Kremlin A top Russian general who supports military dictatorship and backs a muscular role for the Russian army in the former Soviet republics is set to lose his job, military officials said yesterday. The predicted removal of Gen Alexander Lebed, commander of Russian forces in the break-away Transdnestr region of Moldova, suggests the Kremlin is seeking to remove hardliners from the military. Col Mikhail Bergman, a close ally of Gen Lebed, said yesterday that the 14th army which the general commands is to be disbanded, a move which would automatically deprive Gen Lebed of his job. However, other Russian military officers denied that Gen Lebed was being forced out and said that although some reorganisation of the 14th army was planned it would not to be disbanded entirely. Relations between Gen Lebed, who has said he will not stay in the military if he is removed from his post, and the Kremlin reached a nadir last month after the general told Izvestia, the Russian daily newspaper, that Russia invited attack through its military weakness and described all Russian politicians, including President Boris Yeltsin, as 'minuses'.</p>

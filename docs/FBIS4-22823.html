			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. G. Mamedova and S. P. Rodtsevich, General and </F> Inorganic Chemistry Institute, Minsk; UDC666.59]    [Abstract] Large-scale use of electric heating films  capable of providing surface heat emission at low  heater-to-object temperature gradients, makes it is necessary to  develop low-cost metal-ceramic and ceramic resistor coatings on  ceramics and to study the effects of some technological factors  on their properties. The use of any particular ceramic as an  electric heater coating is hindered by the mutual diffusion  between both the components of the film and its substrate which  leads to chemical reactions in the interfacial zones resulting  in a rise in the resistance of the coating to cause mechanical  stresses which inhibit conducting processes. In this respect,  the highly clayey ceramic (22KhS) is of considerable interest  since it is chemically inert and does not react with the coating  material. The problem of making low cost film heaters may be  resolved through study of metal-ceramic (Me-clay-glass) and  ceramic (transition metal oxide-glass former) systems. Selection  of the proper material used in a system depends on the following  considerations. In the first system the metal is used as a base  for an electrically conducting component; the clay is needed to  support the slip in a suspended state. Also, after losing its  water of hydration, clay becomes more chemically active and  reacts with metals to form the conducting phase, while glass  serves to bind the metal particles to the ceramic base. In the  second system, during the calcining process, the transition  metal oxides form cations of varying valencies of the same  element to provide the needed conditions for electrical  conductivity. The oxide-glass former plays the same role as  glass does in the first system. Slips, prepared using  3d-elements (nickel, titanium, iron, copper, and chromium) and  alloys of these elements with aluminum, boron, phosphorus, and  silicon, were applied to ceramic objects by dipping or coating  and tested for resistance to heat, cold temperatures, and  moisture. Films containing Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Mo, V, La, and Nb  oxides had the best electrical conductivities, and negative  temperature coefficients of resistance. On heating, resistance  drops rapidly and the objects become overheated and burn out  unless a thermo-regulator is used. The coatings are resistant to  vibration, cold, and moisture.

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Salutory lesson in Washington ways: Baird's withdrawal for a yuppie offence gets the new era off to a bad start PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has now joined the sort of club of which he would rather not be a member. Like five of his six predecessors, he has seen a nominee go down in flames and his own administration get off to the sort of start it would have preferred to avoid. In accepting Ms Zoe Baird's withdrawal as prospective attorney-general, Mr Clinton essentially decided to cut his losses and save his credits for a battle more central to his presidency, like health care and jobs creation. But sacrificing a nominee in the first two days of office does not quite convey the sense of strength and purpose that he hoped he would bring to the office. Weighing on Mr Clinton's mind must have been the precedents which provide conflicting advice. President George Bush stuck with the nomination of Mr John Tower to be defence secretary, lost it, and never really regained the upper hand with Congress. President Jimmy Carter faced two such battles. He stuck with Mr Bert Lance, his budget director, and won confirmation, only to have Mr Lance resign under a cloud of scandal six months later. He let Mr Theodore Sorensen, his CIA nominee, withdraw. The combination of both affairs may have marked the beginning of the slow unravelling of confidence in his presidency. President Ronald Reagan saw a lesser state department nominee, Mr Ernest Lefever, a particularly controversial right winger, denied office, but that proved to be a mere blip on his first term. In 1987 he could not get Senate approval of Mr Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, a fate that also befell the Court nominees of Presidents Johnson and Nixon later in their terms. Ms Baird was undone, politically, by a curious combination of circumstances. Mr Clinton himself seems to have chosen Mrs Baird at the very last minute - she was previously in line to be White House legal counsel. In the crunch, he never stood four square behind her, which exposed the weakness of her own political constituency. As a corporate lawyer, she seemed to appeal more to Republicans in the Senate than to Democrats. This week she picked up two powerful opponents, both Democrats, in the persons of two principled (and black) law professors - Ms Barbara Jordan of Texas University and Ms Patricia King of Georgetown. Both said unequivocally, that someone who has admitted breaking the law, as Ms Baird had, was automatically disqualified from being the nation's chief law enforcement officer. Her crime was quickly deemed a 'yuppie' offence, and much was made of the fact that someone who was earning Dollars 500,000 a year did not have to stoop to employing illegal immigrants. That the offence is rampant in Washington and the nation's more affluent suburbs mattered less than the floods of hostile mail received by the Senators from their less affluent constituents and by the opposition reflected in instant polls and talk show conversations, many of which recalled Mr Clinton's campaign promise to respect those who 'paid their taxes . . . and played by the rules.' Even if Mr Clinton can limit the damage, he is still left with a tricky problem of finding another attorney general. The women's lobby, which had begun to distance itself from Ms Baird in the last 48 hours, still expects a woman to run the justice department, which was the President's proud proclamation just last month. At the very least President Bill Clinton has received an early and salutary education in the ways of Washington.</p>

In a by-lined article calling for further increasing the  might of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the paper says:    This movement must fully play the role of a leading force in  building a new world where all the countries and nations would  exercise independent rights in the international arena on an  equal footing.    What is important in this is to activate the work for the  reform and democratization of the United Nations so that the  non-aligned nations can take part in the solution of  international issues with equal responsibility and rights. Only  when the United Nations is democratized is it possible to do  away with arbitrariness and privilege in the United Nations and  ensure equality, allow its member nations to lift up their  voices of justice and solve international issues in a fair way.    The non-aligned nations must work out a common strategy for  the reform of the United Nations, take a joint action and make  concerted efforts to put an end to pressure, sanctions and  interference in other's internal affairs based on the abuse of  the authority of the United Nations. If the NAM is to be kept  pure, any attempt to open its door without consideration must  never be allowed, the paper says, and goes on:    Whether a country can be a member nation of the NAM or join  it with any other qualification depends on whether it pursues a  policy according with the basic idea and principle of the NAM or  aspires after and sympathizes with it.    The non-aligned nations must take a joint action for a total  elimination of the nuclear weapons in the world and the removal  of the inequality of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

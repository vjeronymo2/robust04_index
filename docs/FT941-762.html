			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Advisers told to delay applications to PIA Independent financial advisers have been urged by their trade associations not to send their applications to join the Personal Investment Authority - the new watchdog to protect private investors - until its future is settled. Mr Garry Heath, chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers, wrote last Friday to his organisation's members recommending that they should fill in application forms, but not post them for at least a month. In its prospectus, published in February, the PIA set a deadline for applications of April 5, but it is already clear this time-limit will not be met by many potential members. Mr Heath's memorandum highlighted the uncertainty over the PIA's future after last week's refusal by Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, to join the PIA, and the serious reservations expressed by other large organisations, such as Halifax building society. 'In the light of this uncertainty we see no reason why IFAs should rush to join the PIA,' he said. 'If you had recommended to your clients that they placed their futures in such a shaky enterprise, you would quite rightly have been disciplined.' A similar message to that issued by the federation is going to members of the British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association. The two organisations have already announced their intention to merge. Businesses that are subject to existing regulators at the moment will not have to pay an application fee if they miss the deadline, provided that they apply before the PIA becomes operational in July. But the PIA said yesterday that it regretted the NFIFA's advice and urged companies to apply by the early April date. It was confident of being able to process applications received by the deadline in time for the start of the new regulatory regime. However, applicants that missed that date might have to continue with their existing regulator for some time after the PIA had become effective. So far, the PIA has received more than 800 applications. It estimates potential membership at about 6,000 companies Letters, Page 20</p>

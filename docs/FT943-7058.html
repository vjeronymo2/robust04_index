			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Boards of utilities likened to pirates Directors of the privatised water and electricity supply companies were yesterday likened to pirates by Sir Anthony Beaumont-Dark, the former MP and chairman of TR High Income Trust. 'They control monopolies and give themselves huge increases in pay,' he said. 'They are like modern pirates pillaging their companies.' At his instigation TR High Income has adopted a policy of opposing three-year rolling contracts and 'excessive rewards which appear to be unjustified by performance'. Sir Anthony added that his trust was small, but he hoped that others would follow suit. 'It is the institutions which have the muscle to make sure this sort of thing is stopped.' TR High Income's assets totalled Pounds 27.8m at June 30 with its 10 largest investments including South West Water, British Gas, Northern Electricity and Southern Water. 'They can all look forward to having their actions closely watched,' said Sir Anthony. He added: 'What appals me most is not the rolling contracts, but directors who get huge increases despite the company making losses. And at the same time there are a lot of people who work damned hard and don't get paid anything like as much.' Sir Anthony made his comments as TR High Income Trust announced results for the half year to the end of June showing net revenue down from Pounds 825,000 to Pounds 789,000. Earnings per share were lower at 3.11p (3.27p) reflecting reduced holdings of fixed interest securities. A second interim dividend of 1.5p (1.4p) is declared. Net asset value per share at the end of June was 119.5p, against 144.5p at the December 31 year end and 120.9p a year earlier. The fully diluted figures were 116.4p, 137.2p and 117.5p.</p>

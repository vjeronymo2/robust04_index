			<p>940721 FT  21 JUL 94 / Hungary media chiefs named Hungarian President Arpad Goncz has appointed new heads of state television and radio after years of political controversy over broadcasting, his office said yesterday. He accepted nominations made by new Socialist Prime Minister Gyula Horn and appointed Adam Horvath president of state television and Janos Sziranyi president of state radio, after consultations with opposition parties broke down. The opposition parties and a group of journalists had appealed to Mr Goncz to delay the appointments. Trade unions and broadcasters' professional groups urged him to go ahead. Many journalist groups in Hungary and abroad have accused the former centre-right government, which was replaced by a socialist-liberal coalition last Friday, of using electronic media to promote itself and attack its adversaries. The new government has proposed that parliament pass a long-stalled media law that would enshrine guarantees of editorial independence for broadcasters and pave the way for partially privatising electronic media, over which the state has a virtual monopoly.</p>

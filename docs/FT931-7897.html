			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Shortfall at Air Canada worsens HEAVY fare discounting to maintain market share and restructuring charges brought Air Canada's 1992 net losses to CDollars 454m (USDollars 361m), or CDollars 6.13 a share, against losses of CDollars 218m or Dollars 2.94 a share, the year before. Revenues were barely changed at CDollars 3.5bn. Domestic markets continued to be depressed because of the recession and Atlantic routes were highly competitive. The only favourable sign was an upturn in operating results for the fourth quarter, said Mr Hollis Harris, president. Operating costs were reduced 10 per cent in 1992 and 2,200 jobs were eliminated. The 1992 final loss was worse than analysts had forecast. On an operating basis before all special charges, Air Canada's operating loss was CDollars 145m, against CDollars 164m. Air Canada has warned it will lose about CDollars 200m in 1993, with further rationalisation of equipment and manpower, and hopes to return to profitability in 1994. Mr Harris said having two Canadian airlines operating internationally was counter productive. He called again for a merger with rival Canadian Airlines, now trying to complete a stock and operating alliance with American Airlines. PWA, Canadian's parent company, forecast it would report a heavy 1992 loss later this month.</p>

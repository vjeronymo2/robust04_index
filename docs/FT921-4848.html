			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Life Sciences up 29% at Pounds 19m LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments company, bucked the continuing recession in the US, its largest market, by reporting a 29 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.5m for the year to December 31. Sales increased from Pounds 74.5m to Pounds 91.8m. Trading margins continued to strengthen, rising from 16 to 17.8 per cent. Mr Christopher Bland, chairman, said the results demonstrated 'the recession-resistant characteristic both of our divisions and the markets they serve.' Shandon, the tissues analysis business, showed a substantial increase in profits. Mr Bland said the company's earnings had also benefited from an effective treasury operation. Net debt of Pounds 8.3m, following the Dollars 46m (Pounds 26.1m) purchase of Neslab, a New Hampshire temperature control company, decreased to Pounds 2.4m at the year end, representing 7 per cent of shareholders' funds. Although the company's tax charge increased to 27 per cent from 25 per cent, it still remained lower than the average because of the struct-uring of the company's acquisitions. A final dividend of 2.2p, makes a 3.35p (2.9p) total. Earnings per share rose to 8.8p (7.6p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Alberto Briceno] </F>   [Text] Ambassador [to the United States] Gonzalo Facio  yesterday submitted his resignation to President Calderon given  the imminent conclusion of this administration and to allow "his  successor to choose a person that is politically and personally  close to him as my replacement."    Although the letter states the resignation is effective 8  May, Ambassador Facio told LA REPUBLICA he will leave his  Washington post "late in April or early in May." Facio is  currently in the country. He participated in the elections here  and will return to the U.S. capital on Sunday.    Facio explained he met with President-elect Jose Maria  Figueres on Thursday to review Costa Rica's relations with Bill  Clinton's administration, and to review challenges the next  government will have to face in this regard. The meeting was  requested by Figueres, to whom Ambassador Facio explained that  discussions on the laws concerning the Uruguay Round are still  pending and are "extremely important." Furthermore, the next  government must follow up the proposal to extend the free trade  agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada to  include the Caribbean zone. The dispute with the U.S. Embassy  over expropriations of U.S. citizens' properties will be another  inheritance for Figueres, Facio emphasized.</p>

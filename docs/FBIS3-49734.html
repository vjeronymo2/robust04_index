			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and Foreign  Minister Jozef Moravcik met journalists in Bratislava today. The  prime minister first briefly assessed the Prague talks. We have  chosen the following essential part of his remarks:    [Begin Meciar recording] We assume that, in connection with  the Partnership for Peace, neither the United States nor NATO  countries are trying to create any new division line in Europe.  This is an opportunity and a chance for all.    NATO membership is a matter of extraordinary responsibility,  a matter of further development. The Partnership for Peace does  not guarantee direct [NATO] membership, but gives a chance to  take part in preparations for it.    We see and understand that the Partnership for Peace is a  big  step forward. The Slovak Republic is an active member of the  North Atlantic Committee for Cooperation, and, within this  institution, it became a member of several of its bodies.    The Partnership for Peace means a qualitatively new  contribution to security in Central and East Europe and is  qualitatively different from the present incorporation into the  North Atlantic Committee for Cooperation. The Partnership for  Peace contains both political and military aspects. It envisages  joint military excercises, training, intervention, modeling  future relationships, and membership in NATO.    The Partnership for Peace is not an automatic guarantee of  security. However, it envisages the possibility of consultation  with other countries in the event of a military threat.    The declaration from Brussels is also important to us. It is  namely a declaration that NATO expects and welcomes as its  future members countries neighboring it in the East. This is a  new element, and, on the basis of this stance, the talk is no  longer about a yes or a no for membership; the talk is only  about when and how. This is a marked qualitative shift forward.    A framework declaration concerning the sequence of steps  needed to join the Partnership for Peace was adopted at the  Brussels summit. We assume that those who subscribe to the  Partnership for Peace will have to take on themselves the  following pledges: First, they will pledge to observe the  principles of democracy, human rights, and minorities' rights.    In Europe there are two alternative concepts concerning the  rights of minorities, one being the concept pushed through by  the Council of Europe and the other being the one pushed through  by the Hungarian Republic, the latter being directed toward  collective rights. President Clinton and his entourage confirmed  that the rights involved are individual human rights, as the  [word indistinct] of collective rights as such is unacceptable.  In this respect, this is exceptionally important international  political support for the stance taken by the Government of the  Slovak Republic.    Second, these countries must pledge that they will  unconditionally accept the principle of the inviolability of  borders.    The remaining topic of discussion for us is the southern  border. We are holding talks with the Hungarian Government  specifically about the adoption of this principle. Our position  on this matter is thus reconfirmed and is advantageous to us.    The next thing envisaged is civilian control over the Army  and the transparency of the military budget. NATO countries and  the countries that will become members of the Partnership for  Peace should sign an agreement to this effect. [passage omitted]  [end recording]</p>

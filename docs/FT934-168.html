			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Occidental wins price violation ruling Occidental Petroleum has won a Dollars 1bn ruling from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) over charges of price control violations dating back to the late 1970s. In a decision issued this week the FERC, an independent commission within the US Department of Energy, reversed an earlier judicial decision that would have required Oxy USA, Occidental's subsidiary, to pay Dollars 261.4m plus interest for alleged violations of government pricing rules between 1979 and 1981. A separate proceeding brought by the Department of Energy last year alleging that the same crude oil transactions violated other regulations is still pending. That case would also involve close to Dollars 1bn in principal and interest. Occidental agreed in 1989 to pay the government Dollars 205m to settle its claims, which already totalled more than Dollars 700m in penalties and accumulated interest, but the Department of Energy later decided to move to litigation. The case involves deals which the Energy Department calls reciprocal crude oil transactions and Occidental terms tier trades, in which Cities Service Oil and Gas, now Oxy USA, provided crude oil subject to government price controls to a reseller, in exchange for crude that was exempt from the controls. Occidental's is believed to be the largest case left from the era of oil price controls, imposed in response to the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and in place until 1981. A temporary emergency court of appeals set up to decide price control suits was not dissolved until earlier this year.</p>

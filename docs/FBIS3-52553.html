			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Muhammad Jibril, Cairo </F> representative of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya,  in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What are your justifications  for accusing the Libyan regime of kidnapping [Mansur] al-Kikhya  [Libyan opposition leader and former foreign minister]? Do you  have any proof or material evidence to support your claim?    [Jibril] First of all I admit that we do not have any  material evidence that would expose to the world the  responsibility of the regime's agents for the abduction, but let  me ask: As al-Kikhya is one of the most prominent people  opposed to the current regime in Libya, who would have an  interest in his disappearance? As al-Qadhdhafi has publicly  said that he intends to liquidate the opposition, how is he  going to achieve that without pursuit?    There is another important point which must be mentioned. It  is the Libyan regime's black record of pursuing and liquidating  opponents. Its agents have committed 23 attacks on Libyan  opposition members living in European capitals, resulting in the  martyrdom of most of them.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Have you received any direct threats  from the Libyan authorities?    [Jibril] I have personally received dozens of threats from  the regime's agents. They have told my family that their arm  will reach me soon. Not to mention the official threats to all  the Libyan opposition at home and abroad.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you feel that there was any Egyptian  failure in connection with the disappearance of al-Kikhya?    [Jibril] I strongly deny even the slightest direct or  indirect Egyptian role in the puzzle of al-Kikhya's  disappearance, but I do believe that, in the event an agreement  is signed with Egypt for the extradition of criminals, the  Libyan regime would not hesitate to claim (falsely) that Egypt  extradited al-Kikhya.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] How are you currently handling  developments related to the al-Kikhya incident?    [Jibril] We are in continual daily contact with the relevant  Egyptian authorities, and they are doing their best to solve the  disappearance riddle.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Would the Libyan regime return al-Kikhya  if, as you believe, he was kidnapped?    [Jibril] I rule that out completely, of course.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Libya has officially denied any  connection with the al-Kikhya incident.    [Jibril] We expected that, after 10 days of official  silence. We are used to such lies and games.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you have any information about a  request by the Libyan regime asking Arab and European states to  hand over opposition members?    [Jibril] Yes, al-Qadhdhafi has asked that of Egypt and other  states. He even made the improvement of relations with any  state conditional on their handing over the opposition members.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you believe that the measures for  guarding Libyan opposition members in Egypt are good?    [Jibril] Before the normalization of Egyptian-Libyan  relations there was a strict guard for those opposed to  al-Qadhdhafi but that was relaxed after al-Qadhdhafi promised  the Egyptian authorities not to harm the opposition members  living in Egypt.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] But could one say that Egypt has frozen  the activities of the Libyan opposition in Egypt or that it has  imposed restrictions on the movement of opposition members?    [Jibril] The restrictions on the Libyan opposition's  activities were confined to the closure of their information  offices and discontinuation of their coordination meetings,  after the normalization of relations. But Egypt has not asked  or forced any opposition member to leave the country. We hope  that the Libyan political opposition will move from Europe and  the United States to Egypt and the Arab states adjacent to Libya.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What about the Libyan opposition at  home?    [Jibril] Those opposed to the regime at home face the  severest kinds of torture and pursuit. Suffice it to say that  there are about 3,000 political detainees in Libyan prisons.</p>

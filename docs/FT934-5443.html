			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Merger complete - Legal Briefs The 'merger' between Dibb Lupton Broomhead, based in Leeds and London, and Needham &amp; James, of Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon, finally comes into operation tomorrow. The merger has given Dibb Lupton the presence in the west Midlands that it needed to further its ambitions to become the first truly national law firm in England - a title the constituent firms of the Eversheds group might dispute. The name of Needham &amp; James will disappear in Birmingham.</p>

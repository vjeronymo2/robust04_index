The Companies will deduct any premium tax levied by any governmental entity as a result of the Contracts or the Accounts. Purchase payments received under the Contracts will be allocated, after the deduction of applicable premium taxes, to any one or more of the subaccounts of the appropriate Account or to a fixed annuity account of either of the Companies at the discretion of the owner of the Contract. The application states that the applicable premium taxes are determined by the then current state of residence of the Contract owner. Premium taxes currently range from 0.04% to 5% of purchase payments or of the amount annuitized. Applicants state that, where permitted by state law, the premium taxes will be deducted upon annuitization. In all other jurisdictions, the taxes will be deducted upon the death of the annuitant, surrender or withdrawal as directed by the law of the Contract owner's state of residence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Battle will be critical and unpredictable - London: The race in the capital will be closely watched as several seats may buck the national trend THE BATTLE for votes across London's 84 parliamentary constituencies, which have the greatest concentration of voters and marginal seats in Britain, will be critical, colourful and unpredictable. London's capacity to shock and surprise has added a piquancy to local and national elections for years, and April 9 is likely to maintain the tradition. The outcome of a fight stretching from Enfield to Croydon, from Uxbridge to Upminster, will be crucial in determining the identity of the next government. Labour has not won a London seat from the Tories in a general election since Millie Miller snatched Ilford North nearly 18 years ago. The party needs to win between 15 and 20 if its hopes of forming the next government are to be met. It is a tall order. However, the three elections since 1974, which have shrunk Labour's representation in the region from 51 to just 23, have left plenty of marginal seats in Tory hands, and a 7-8 per cent capital-wide swing should bring Labour the gains it needs. This, together with the likelihood that several seats will move against national trends, explains why the race in London will be watched so closely. Will the Conservatives, who have 58 London seats, hold yuppified but heavily-mortgaged Battersea, and even snatch Labour Tooting? Will they lose Croydon North-West, to which many traditional inner-city Labour voters have migrated? Can the Liberal Democrats keep their only London seat in Southwark and Bermondsey, and perhaps double their tally through the addition of Richmond and Barnes? Will the voters of Greenwich and Woolwich deliver the coup de grace to the twitching corpse of the Social Democrats? Is Mr Ken Livingstone, the former Greater London Council leader, safe in Brent East? Can Ms Glenda Jackson win rave reviews for Labour in Tory Hampstead and Highgate? Labour claims that polls and canvass returns put the party on the threshold of the swing it needs, but in some respects the deck seems to be stacked against it. There is real concern that the party's task will be made harder by the fall in numbers on London's electoral registers. A disproportionate number of poll tax fugitives are thought to be likely Labour supporters. The party may again pay the price  - as it did in 1987  - for the 'loony left' image of some local authorities. Labour officials are confident the dragon has been slain, through a clampdown on extremism and a big effort to rebuild the party's reputation in the capital, but the auguries of the 1990 council elections are not altogether positive. In spite of the widespread unpopularity of the poll tax, Labour only managed a swing of some 5 per cent across the capital, against 11 per cent nationally. Heavy defeats in Wandsworth and Westminster, and losses in Hillingdon, Brent and Ealing, eclipsed more pleasing victories elsewhere. Council by-election results since have further underlined the scale of the mountain Labour has to climb. But the Labour campaign has at least 'hit the ground running', in the words of Mr Bryan Gould, London campaign supremo. Showing commendable diligence in the contest's early days, the party claims to have already interviewed up to 40 per cent of voters in many constituencies. It also has a recession to exploit. Unemployment and house repossessions have hit the relatively affluent south-east especially hard over the past year or so. Unemployment will top the local agenda today when a visit employment secretary, coincides with the release of monthly jobless figures. The party's London campaign team will endeavour to keep it there  - along with health, transport, the economy generally and the party's plans the capital. With polls suggesting that seven in 10 Londoners want an elected authority for their city, this is widely seen as a potential trump card. The Tories today begin their attempts to disarm this and other Labour weapons in the capital with the launch of a London manifesto. The document includes plans for a minister for London transport and a cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate ministerial efforts for improving life in London. Besides outlining its alternative, the party will attack Labour's proposed authority as an embryonic GLC. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, has described Labour's plans as 'expensive and divisive'. The Tories also plan to hit back at Labour horror stories about the National Health Service, transport and education, with detailed spending and performance statistics purporting to show an improvement in the overall picture. Officials say the party will continue to supply 'young men in white coats' to local television programmes to spread the Tory message on health, in the belief that voters' personal experience of local facilities is at the root of most concerns on the subject. The extent of Labour inroads may be further limited by the number of high-profile Tory candidates defending marginal seats. For example, the prospects in Lewisham West of Mr John Maples, junior Treasury minister, may be improved by frequent media appearances as a party spokesman. The Liberal Democrats will focus a large slice of their comparatively meagre resources on keeping what they hold: namely Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey. They are also optimistic of gaining ground in a limited number of constituencies where they have strong council representation. This includes Tory-held Richmond and Barnes and Labour Bow and Poplar. The party also has its eye on Conservative seats in Twickenham, held by Mr Toby Jessel and, more ambitiously, Sutton and Cheam, where Lady Olga Maitland is standing as the Tory candidate. Transport and pollution will figure prominently in the Liberal Democrat campaign. The party will also hammer away at the message that Labour is not alone in offering a strategic London authority, and that the Liberal Democrat version will be partly funded by locally-raised taxes. Mr Hughes said members of the authority would be elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation, using the same constituency boundaries as in a general election.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                THE CAPITAL'S KEY MARGINALS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Seats Labour would find easiest to win Votes cast 1987 (%)                                             Con                          Con   Lab   Alln   lead 1 Dullwich               42.2  42.0  14.5   0.4 2 Battersea              44.2  42.4  11.9   1.8 3 Hornsey &amp; Wood Green   43.0  40.0  15.1   3.0 4 Walthamstow            39.0  34.7  25.1   4.3 5 Hampstead &amp; Highgate   42.5  37.6  19.3   4.9 6 Streatham              44.9  39.2  15.8   5.7 7 Westminster North      47.3  39.5  12.1   7.8 8 Lewisham West          46.2  37.9  15.9   8.3 9 Feltham &amp; Heston       46.5  37.4  16.1   9.1 10 Croydon North-West    47.0  37.0  16.0  10.0 11 Lewisham East         45.1  34.2  20.7  10.9 12 Ilford South          48.4  37.5  14.1  10.9 13 Mitcham &amp; Morden      48.2  35.2  16.6  13.0 14 Hayes &amp; Harlington    49.2  35.5  15.3  13.7 15 Kensington            47.5  33.2  17.2  14.3 16 Putney                50.5  36.1  12.4  14.4 17 Brentford &amp; Isleworth 47.7  33.2  17.5  14.5 18 Fulham                51.8  36.7  10.4  15.1 19 Edmonton              51.2  36.0  12.8  15.2 20 Eltham                47.5  32.0  20.5  15.5 21 Erith &amp; Crayford      45.2  29.5  25.3  15.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Liberal Democrats targets (where Lib/Dem have their best chance) 22 Richmond &amp; Barnes     47.7   7.1  43.8   3.9 23 Twickenham            51.9   8.4  38.3  13.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

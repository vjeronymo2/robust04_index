			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Water row threatens to surface at Turkish-Syrian meeting WATER, which has so often jeopardised Turkey's relations with its Arab neighbours, again threatens to overshadow the talks in Damascus today between Turkish premier Suleyman Demirel and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. It will be the first trip to Damascus for a Turkish leader since 1987, when Mr Turgut Ozal initialled a joint security pact and guaranteed Syria a flow of 500 cu metres a second where the Euphrates crosses the shared border. Some success on the security front, especially where Turks see Syria's new willingness to curb rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), has helped pave the way for today's meeting. In April, Ankara revived the security protocol. The two sides also agreed to restart trilateral water talks suspended because of the war with Iraq. But relations continue to be marked by mutual suspicion. The Syrians will want to use today's talks to press the water issue, vital for 60 per cent of the country's power generation. Turkey has announced plans to start irrigating along the Harran plain from May, diverting more water from the vast Ataturk reservoir. The Syrians argue that under the existing protocol there is an implicit undertaking for the Turks to negotiate a permanent water settlement once the reservoir is filled. Ankara continues to resist the linkage between Syria's backing for the PKK and Syria's security concerns over Turkish control of the Euphrates River.</p>

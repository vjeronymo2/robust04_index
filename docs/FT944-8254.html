			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Bull sale puts France on the horns of a dilemma: Foreign groups interested in a big stake in computer maker The privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer, is the French government's most difficult task so far in its programme to sell 21 public-sector groups. The planned privatisation, which kicked off on Friday with the opening of a tender for stakes in the company, is the first test of the government's ability to sell one of the casualties of the public sector. It may also force the government into tough decisions concerning the extent to which it will allow foreign electronics and telecommunications groups to invest in the national computer company and penetrate the French market, possibly to the detriment of powerful domestic players, such as Alcatel and France Telecom. As one Paris banker said: 'They need to sell Bull, but this may involve increased access in strategic markets for foreign companies such as NEC of Japan or AT&amp;T of the US.' The complexity of the government's task stems from Bull's financial plight. Whereas previous privatisation candidates have all been profitable, the computer maker has been in the red since 1989, racking up total losses of more than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) as it has struggled with increasingly competitive markets, bureaucratic management and an inflated cost base. Although losses have been curbed as a result of a cost-cutting plan by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman last autumn, Bull remains vulnerable in many business areas. A report this year by an independent consultancy claimed only the company's large systems and computer maintenance businesses were secure. The legacy of losses has required a succession of subsidies. Since the start of last year, the computer maker has received FFr11.1bn in state aid, roughly three times analysts' estimates of its value. European Commission approval of such huge transfers, matched only by capital injections for Air France and Credit Lyonnais, was granted only on condition of rapid privatisation. Because public investors are unlikely to be attracted by such a risky proposition, the government has been constrained to seek privatisation through selling stakes to industry partners. 'We are seeking to find a majority shareholder, or significant minority shareholders to allow the company to reinforce its industrial strategies,' said Friday's statement from the French economy and industry ministries. The good news is that even before the official launch of an invitation for bids, potential investors had expressed interest. NEC, which holds 4.4 per cent of Bull and supplies its partner with mainframe computers, said this month that it wanted to raise its stake. It is thought to be seeking a holding of about 10 per cent to use Bull to expand its services and supply network in Europe. AT&amp;T, the US telecoms company and Quadral, parent of CSEE, the French electronics concern, are weighing a joint bid for up to 40 per cent of Bull's shares. IBM, which holds a 2.1 per cent stake in its French counterpart has yet to make clear its intentions, while Motorola, which recently concluded a technology partnership with Bull, may also be a candidate for a stake. 'The company holds a few trumps,' said one electronics analyst. 'It has a strong European base and some quality technicians.' The flurry of interest has drawn a positive response from the French government. 'It is a good sign that investors are showing themselves,' said Mr Jose Rossi, French industry minister. But the potential proposals are likely to leave Mr Rossi and his government colleagues with some daunting decisions. The proposal from AT&amp;T and CSEE, for example, could prove controversial. If the offer is confirmed - so far only a preliminary letter has been sent to the government - it could solve at a stroke the privatisation conundrum. In conjunction with a bigger stake for NEC, the state would be able to obtain its objective of reducing its 76 per cent stake to a minority holding. But there are hurdles. AT&amp;T's interest in the privatisation does not lie in the computing side of Bull's operations. Instead, the US company is seeking to enter France's telephone services market which is monopolised by France Telecom, the state operator. AT&amp;T is thought to be offering to buy a large stake in Bull in return for the award of a telecoms services licence, although the French market, in line with EU policy, is not set to be liberalised until 1998. Such a proposal throws up thorny questions for the government. France Telecom, which holds 17 per cent of Bull, is likely to resist the arrival of one of its main international rivals. Alcatel, the French telecoms equipment giant and another rival of AT&amp;T, would also be expected to oppose such a solution. In addition, Mr Descarpentries is thought to favour a series of smaller investments by industrial partners and a substantial shareholding by employees, rather than the presence of a powerful shareholder such as AT&amp;T. Trade unions, wary of foreign shareholders and fearing Bull will be broken up after the sale, are planning demonstrations against the privatisation this week. The French government declines to comment on specific proposals, but has indicated it will not oppose the presence of foreign companies on the shareholder register. 'The only thing which interests me is to give the company the chance to succeed,' said Mr Rossi. Friday's statement also made clear that the French government is seeking to maintain Bull as a whole. 'It would be difficult politically to allow the national computer company to be broken up,' said one analyst. The sensitivity of the issue could be blunted by the retention of a blocking stake by the state, in conjunction with France Telecom. Less problematic solutions may also emerge from proposals by potential investors or by the creation of a network of significant, but not dominant, shareholders, as sought by Bull's chairman. But time is short. Prospective candidates have until December 9 to submit their offers, after which a selected shortlist will have six weeks to perform a detailed study of Bull before making binding proposals. Ultimately, the state-shareholder is faced with the fact that beggars cannot be choosers. As befits Bull's troubled history, however, the choices may prove painful.</p>

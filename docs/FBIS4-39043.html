			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nerdun Hacioglu: "Russia Moves Silently and </F> Effectively on the Karabakh Dispute"]    [Text] Russia is silently moving to put into effect its  peace plan on the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute, a plan that has  created a very difficult situation for the Aliyev government in  Azerbaijan. Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's  special envoy, has said that the initiative Russia has launched  to resolve the Karabakh dispute has not ended and that the talks  on the matter are being maintained without publicity.    In an exclusive statement to HURRIYET, Kazimirov disclosed  the most recent diplomatic initiatives on Daghlyk Karabakh.  Stressing that the peace plan for Karabakh, which the sides  failed to sign at the last moment after putting forward several  reservations two weeks ago, is still on the agenda, Kazimirov  asserted: "Compared with the crisis in Bosnia, the dispute on  Karabakh is an older problem and has deeper roots. We are  maintaining our initiatives. However, we do not expect to find  a quick solution."  <H5>  Contacts With Aliyev </H5>   Kazimirov stressed that he confers with President Geydar  Aliyev and President Levon Ter-Petrosyan by telephone every day.  He noted: "Russia's peace proposals will be accepted sooner or  later. No other way exists to resolve the dispute. The  Armenian and the Azerbaijani officials urge Russia to support  them. However, complying with their requests is impossible.  Considering the occupation of a part of Azerbaijan's territory,  Turkey may view the matter in a different way. However, as far  as we are concerned, no side can win or lose in the war on  Karabakh. Both sides have to make significant concessions for  the solution of the problem. The peace plan will be successful  when they become mature enough to agree to make concessions."  <H5>  Turkey Must Not Worry </H5>   Referring to the Russia's intention to deploy its  peacekeeping forces in the region, Kazimirov said that Turkey  must not be worried by Moscow's approach. He asserted: "We  have been proposing the deployment of peacekeeping forces for  the past year. Russia is the only country that has agreed to  deploy troops in that region without delay. No other CSCE  country has agreed to do so. It is true that Turkey has offered  to send troops. However, Armenia has objected to that proposal.  We should not be blamed for that. The deployment of the  Turkish military units would have facilitated our work.  Considering all that, I want to suggest that Turkey must not be  worried by the idea that Russia will occupy Karabakh by  deploying its troops in that region.    Recalling that Turkey refrained from adopting a negative  approach on Russia's latest proposals for peace, Kazimirov said:  "I am aware of the message President Suleyman Demirel has  conveyed to President Boris Yeltsin on the Karabakh dispute.  The message was received two months ago. I have recently held  talks with the Turkish ambassador in Moscow. We were not  informed of Ankara's official objection on the Karabakh dispute."  <H5>  Why Involve Military Forces? </H5>   Kazimirov explained why a prominent role has been given to  the generals in the peace talks, particularly to Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev. He said: "The first stage of the peace  plan includes several military issues. The separation of the  warring sides, deployment of observers, and adoption of measures  against the side that violates the cease-fire are military  matters. That is why Grachev should be on the scene.  Naturally, the diplomats will take over when the first stage of  the plan is realized."  <H5>  The Aliyev-Ter-Petrosyan Summit </H5>   Kazimirov said that an effort is being made for a meeting  between President Aliyev and President Ter-Petrosyan to sign the  agreement which has been drawn up by the defense ministers of  the three sides. He asserted: "Predicting the exact date of  that summit is impossible. However, we believe that the silence  on the matter will be broken and the Armenian and Azerbaijani  leaders will hold a summit soon."</p>

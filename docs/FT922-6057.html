			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Old Masters hold their class: Saleroom OLD MASTER pictures have survived the downturn in the art market better than most sectors and both Sotheby's and Christie's held encouraging auctions in New York at the weekend. Sotheby's was particularly cheered by a sale that totalled Dollars 15.4m (Pounds 8.45m) with 13 per cent unsold. The top price was Dollars 1.48m (Pounds 814,000) for a previously unknown painting by Canaletto of Venice's Grand Canal looking south-west. To attract bids in what is still a convalescent market, Sotheby's had put a temptingly low estimate on the work of about Dollars 500,000. The auction contained a group of paintings from the collection of Jaime Ortiz-Patino including another Venetian view, of the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, by the other great 18th-century recorder of the city, Guardi, which sold within forecast for Dollars 1.26m. 'A Village Wedding Dance', by Pieter Brueghel the Younger sold for Dollars 577,500 and another 'lost' painting, 'Boethius and Philosophy', by the 17th-century Italian artist Mattia Preti, which carried a Dollars 60,000 estimate, sold for Dollars 506,000. Sotheby's noticed stronger buying from private American collectors. All told, Sotheby's raised Dollars 29.4m for Mr Ortiz-Patino from its auctions of furniture, silver and paintings from his collection. That comfortably exceeded its pre-sale estimate of Dollars 22m. Christie's main achievement in its Old Masters auction was selling all 31 paintings offloaded as surplus stock by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California. They totalled Dollars 3.33m. Top price in the sale was 'The Bathers' by Francois Le Moyne, which had been estimated at Dollars 60,000 but which sold to a London dealer for Dollars 451,000.</p>

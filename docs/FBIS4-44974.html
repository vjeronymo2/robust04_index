			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yamuna Dutt Vaishnav Ashok: India and Tibet's </F> Long Journey Together]    [Text] Our Constitution expects each citizen to be  acquainted with the name of Tibet, the gold reserves of its  Kailash Mansarover area, and its language, science, tradition  and history in connection with its being an ancient center of  world culture. A parliamentarian should certainly have known,  much more than an ordinary citizen, that the sage Purushottam  Das Tandon gave a statement in the Lok Sabha nearly 28 years  ago. This statement was given in the context of Nehru's request  to obtain approval of an announcement to grant to Zhou Enlai the  highways built by the government of British India, the  transportation and communication system from Leh to Lhasa, and  the right of India to freely trade in Tibet. The reply given by  the Indian government in Parliament during the three-day  international Parliamentary conference on Tibet now held in  Delhi, was the complete opposite of the statement of Mr. Tandon.  (See Lok Sabha narrative - May, 1956.)    The description in the Indian Constitution of the  fundamental  duties of the country's citizens is given in paragraph 51-k of  chapter 4 as follows:    "It is the fundamental duty of every citizen of India to  develop in the populace the scientific viewpoint, humanism and a  feeling of purifying investigation." At the root of this duty  we find that branch of the mountain routes described by Panini  which go from Leh to Lhasa, on which India's Shak traders  traveled through mountain passes to enter the present Kumaon  These passes are approximately 18,000 feet above sea level. It  was extremely terrifying to cross these passes by sliding down  the ice of contiguous mountain peaks. Shak traders passing  through the "snaky roads", their sheep and cows loaded with  goods from Central Asia, tied spears and sticks cross-wise  across their bodies to avoid being buried in the invisible  cracks of ice-boulders. Therefore these routes were also called  "spear paths".    History tells us that in 640 AD, in this country called  Kirat Mandal, ruled the Khus (Shak) King Chan Gampo (Sog Chang  Gampo). He married the daughter of India's Khus King Anshu Verma  and for her established Shivalaya near Kailash Mansarovar. He  also married China's princess and established Pota la Vihar in  the east in Rasa (now Lhasa). A descendant of this king in 747  AD invited Acharya Padmasambhav from Nalanda University. At his  command, he built Buddhist monastries in his country in the  Magadh architectural style. During the next 400 years Buddhist  monastries and abbeys were built in all of Central Asia.    When Marco Polo from Venice reached the court of Mongolia's  ruler, the ruler Kubbla Khan could not decide which religion he  should follow. He requested the Polo brothers to bring with them  preachers of the Christian religion in their second visit to  Mongolia. He also asked them to bring some holy oil from the  temple in Jerusalem. The two Christian missionaries with whom  Polo had started out, did not have the courage to travel beyond  Syria, and returned home. Thus Kubbla Khan took initiation into  the Buddhist religion, and endeavored to make the Kailash  Mansarovar area a center of Buddhist religion, similar to the  center that then Rome was of the Christian religion. It was  made compulsory for the religious king of the Buddhist country  (Ta Bodh) to remain a bachelor and a teetotaller. The word Ta  Bodh of the Italavi language was called Tibate by Jesuit priests  and became Tibbat (Tibet) in English.    The age-old commerce of the northern routes, spread over all  three continents of the ancient world, was at its peak during  the Mughal era. The Mughals had great allegiance and devotion  towards Central Asia, especially Samarkand. At the time of  Akbar, Samarkand was the learning center of the Arab world. Many  philosophers and teachers in his court were from Samarkand.  Babar was born in Turkemanistan and was enthroned in Samarkand  at the age of twelve. Babar's ancestor Taimurlung had made the  capitals and markets located on the ancient Central Asian trade  routes the target of his barbarism. In 1393 A.D. he had looted  the grand city of the Caliphs, modern Iraq's capital Baghdad,  and had captured Moscow in the north. Only three years later he  had destroyed Delhi. Then in 1401 A.D., he had destroyed western  Asia's largest trade center Damascus, and had defeated Egypt's  armies. Having killed thousands there, he had reached Ankara in  1403 AD. At that time the ancient northern trade route had  become Taimurlung's military route.    At the time of Kumaon's king Udyot Chand (1678-1699 AD), the  border of the Kumaon kingdom reached the western shore of the  Karnali river. In the north it bordered Taklakot and in the  south reached the Karnali river flowing between Bahraich and  Kheeri districts. Indians were allowed to freely visit Kailash  Mansarovar. Border traders roamed Central Asia's markets for six  months without interference, and arranged for their own safety  on trade routes.    The British government, patient for 45 years, felt the  imminent loss of Tibet. Finally the British government sent a  group of representatives from the Indian border towards Tibet,  but they were stopped 24 kilometers inside Tibet. Then Lord  Curzon, under the leadership of Sir Francis Young Husbandsman,  sent armed forces to attack Lhasa. In March 1904 the British  army murdered 700 unarmed Tibetans. In August of the same year,  Sir Young reached Lhasa. He did not find any representatives  from Russia there. A fine of 7.5 million rupees was imposed on  Tibet by the British government. A treaty was signed with the  condition that its Chumbi valley area would be under British  control for 74 years for the collection of this fine, so that  100,000 rupees could be collected every year.    The British home department reached an agreement with Russia  and also sent a proposal to China in 1907 that if China would  pay the fine imposed on Lhasa, the British would give up their  right to Chumbi valley. Thus China got an invaluable  opportunity to gain control over all of Tibet for 7.2 million  rupees. According to the agreement of 1906, the British  government obtained full freedom to trade with Tibet. There are  more than a dozen mountain passes from Almora and Garhwal  districts running towards Tibet. Free trade commenced through  all of these. Indian British soldiers were deployed for the  protection of these routes. Military outposts were built from  place to place. Mail collectors and mule operators who carried  mail to India, began to travel to and from Almora. This  arrangement would continue for nearly six months every year.  After that soldiers were appointed at every outpost in Tibet to  protect the government treasury. British trade agents would stay  in Gabyang for a few days, then come to Calcutta, and after 1911  to Delhi. In the protection of trade routes, terrible accidents  would sometimes occur due to sudden floods. In 1947, in the  flood of Myantsay, hundreds of Indian soldiers were killed along  with Captain Nagar and Major Nagpal. After the flood subsided  Subedar Budh Singh dug up from the river sand 100,000 rupees  that had been swept away when the government treasury building  was destroyed. Almost 150 bodies were found in the dry river bed  when the flood waters receded. After the cash and other valuable  military goods were handed over to the Indian government,  Subedar Budh Singh and the entire mountain populace were proud  of the responsibility for its supervision. When Nehru handed  over the entire administrative estate to Zhou Enlai, the  northern mountain dwellers were deeply hurt.</p>

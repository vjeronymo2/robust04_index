			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc squeeze fears continue despite price fall ZINC'S PRICE fell again yesterday on the London Metal Exchange but analysts suggested an options-related technical squeeze was still looming in the final quarter of this year. Market interest was also focussed on nickel, which recovered only slightly yesterday after touching its lowest price for two and a half years. Analysts said producers must be seriously considering cuts in output. Zinc's price had been easing because some speculators, disappointed that it had not broken through Dollars 1,400 a tonne, had been liquidating their positions, said Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the metal and commodities broker. 'There has been a bit of a sell-off but the price will head higher again,' he said. Mr John Wolff, chairman of the LME, said the zinc market was still being closely monitored by the board because tightness persisted for metal for delivery in the months of October to December. Zinc for immediate delivery fell by Dollars 36 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,376 yesterday. Since Monday morning zinc has lost more than 4 per cent of its value. Three-month nickel recovered slightly yesterday, by Dollars 7.50 to Dollars 6,995 a tonne. Traders suggested that nickel producers were buying yesterday to put a brake on the steep fall seen earlier this week. However, 'at this level it is cheaper to buy LME metal than to produce', said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group. 'How much longer before a producer cut occurs?' he asked.</p>

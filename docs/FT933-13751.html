			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Pop's Mr Power aims to make the business pay ONE OF the most controver-sial music figures at this weekend's festival will be Mr Vince Power, its promoter, whose name does not appear on a single billboard. While many pundits bewail the death of youth pop, Mr Power, 46, is intent on showing that he can make the business pay, in spite of the recession. His rise on the music scene has been slow but steady. After opening his first venue, the Mean Fiddler, in Harlesden, north London, 12 years ago he has quietly expanded to control seven of London's most fashionable venues and 11 UK festivals. Mr Power says his Mean Fiddler organisation is one of the biggest in the business and worth more than Pounds 8m. One London rival says: 'It's getting like a monopoly. The bands playing at his festivals now get deals to play only at his venues, which means the others can't compete.' Mr Power's decision to launch Phoenix this summer was one of his more risky steps. As he admits, the festival was triggered more by politics than financial planning - when Mean Fiddler lost control of the Reading Festival last year, he launched Phoenix as a spoiler. Since then Mean Fiddler has regained control of Reading, so it has the problem of promoting two rival venues in the same month. 'We were shafted over Reading so I wanted a festival of my own,' says Mr Power. 'But now we're doing both, there is definitely room for it.' The signs are that most of the 25,000 tickets for the Phoenix Festival will be sold at Pounds 55 a head, with another 15,000 day tickets on top. Repeating the trick at the 35,000-ticket Reading Festival three weeks later could be considerably harder.</p>

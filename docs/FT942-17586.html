			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Judge extends Trizec protection Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, has gained another 24 days of court protection while it tries to convince creditors not to push it into bankruptcy. An Alberta judge has given the Calgary-based company until April 25 to work out an agreement with the creditors, notably a group holding CDollars 1.2bn (USDollars 870m) of senior debentures. The two sides agreed that if they cannot bridge their differences by then, the number of days required for notice under bankruptcy laws will be reduced from 10 business days to one. The debenture holders, many of whom are European investors, have rejected plans presented by Trizec last August to restructure part of its CDollars 4.8bn debt. Repayment of the debentures fell due last autumn. But Trizec announced an agreement earlier this week for a CDollars 600m equity injection by Horsham, the Toronto investment company controlled by entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk. Horsham would end up with a stake of at least 43 per cent. Trizec expects that the Horsham deal will enable it to offer the senior debenture holders a higher proportion of cash, in place of the securities included in its original proposal. Details of its revised offer have not yet been released. The debenture holders have so far dismissed the Horsham deal.</p>

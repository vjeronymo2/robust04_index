			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Write-down helps push Magnum into red A NZDollars 56m (USDollars 31.1m) write-down by Magnum Corporation, the New Zealand liquor and food group, on the value of its investment in fellow drinks group Wilson Neill, helped push it to attributable losses of NZDollars 66.24m for the first half to December. This compares with attributable profits of NZDollars 31.25m for the year-ago period. Before losses from extraordinary items, Magnum made a NZDollars 10.68m after-tax profit, a drop of 65 per cent. This was in spite of a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to NZDollars 875.65m. No interim dividend was declared. Magnum, which has substantial liquor interests in both New Zealand and Australia, is controlled by a joint venture between Brierley Investments, with 27 per cent, and Asia Pacific Breweries, which in turn is owned by both Singaporean and Dutch interests. Magnum wrote down the value of the Wilson Neill shares because of a substantial fall in their value. Wilson Neill also owns hotels in Australia and the Tasmanian brewery Cascade. However, the writedown valued the Wilson Neill shares at 25 cents, compared with around 8.5 cents on the share market yesterday. Extraordinary costs were NZDollars 76.93m, against gains of NZDollars 872,000 in the same period of 1990. Magnum is forecasting NZDollars 20m full-year profits before extraordinary items. Later yesterday, Brierley Investments and Asia Pacific Breweries said they were buying a 50 per cent stake in Australian hotel group Austotel from Magnum. Magnum bought the shares last year for NZDollars 110m. Magnum also announced that Austotel had sold 70 hotels in Australia in a debt reduction programme.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Normandy Poseidon rises 12% NORMANDY Poseidon, Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Australian resources group, yesterday announced a 12.5 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 14.4m (USDollars 10.8m) for the six months to the end of December. However, the group said the result was not comparable with the earlier period because of the merger of Normandy Resources and Poseidon in May as part of an attempt by Mr de Crespigny to improve the group's image. In addition, the results of three subsidiaries - Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, Mt Leyshon Gold Mines and Command Petroleum Holdings - have been consolidated for the first time. Mr de Crespigny said the group's operating profit of ADollars 59m on sales revenue of ADollars 293m was 'a very pleasing result in the light of weak commodity prices'. Poseidon Gold (Posgold), the group's 76 per cent-owned gold mining arm, reported a consolidated profit of ADollars 53.6m, an increase of 22 per cent over the earlier period. However, Posgold incurred a tax charge of ADollars 20.5m, following the removal by the federal government of a tax exemption for gold mining. Posgold announced during the period that it plans to merge with Mt Leyshon Gold Mines and ACM Gold, formerly part of Australian Consolidated Minerals, which is controlled jointly by Normandy Poseidon and Western Mining Corporation. Mr de Crespigny said the merger would result in the creation of a gold company with 'strong fundamentals and improved marketability of shares' which should make it attractive to investors. Shareholders will vote on the proposed merger later this month. In a separate announcement, ACM Gold said net profits fell to ADollars 3.6m for the six months to December, compared with ADollars 12.8m in the previous first half. Revenue was down from ADollars 119m to ADollars 102m. The company said the result was struck after abnormal charges of ADollars 14.9m relating to the write back of future tax benefits which are no longer certain of recovery, and provisions against the carrying value of some assets and investments.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOTH SIDES AGREE -- THEY DISLIKE GROWTH PLAN  </P> <P> Homeowners and studio executives alike said Wednesday they are dissatisfied  with the Burbank City Council's recommendations for growth controls in the  city's Media District, the most controversial of which is a 15-story height  limit on construction.  </P> <P> The council's recommendations will be used to revise a proposed Media District  Specific Plan that, when completed, will guide development of the  1.2-square-mile area in the southwest corner of Burbank.  </P> <P> Some homeowners complained Wednesday that the proposed restrictions do not go  far enough in protecting their neighborhoods, which they say are already  overrun with traffic, noise and pollution caused by overdevelopment. But film  studio executives maintain that their operations are important to the city's  economic future and that they should be given more flexibility to expand.  </P> <P> "A 15-story building is still a high-rise," said Michael Scandiffio, a member  of the Burbank Rancho Homeowners. "The City Council is trying to force  something down our throats that we don't want."  </P> <P> Carolyn Berlin, a member of the Verdugo-Magnolia Homeowners Assn., also was  disappointed with the council's proposed height restriction.  </P> <P> "I feel they have no regard for people who live here," Berlin said. "It's like  we should all move out so they can develop the entire city."  </P> <P> Jack O'Neill, vice president of real estate for NBC, said the height  restriction is the studio's main concern. NBC, in partnership with Cushman  Investment and Development Corp., has proposed constructing a 21-story tower  and a 17-story tower on a triangular parcel bounded by Olive Avenue, California  Street and the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> "We're willing to come down to 20 stories," O'Neill said. "I know that there  are going to have to be compromises made, but I would hope that they will not  be so severe as to not allow the project to go forward."  </P> <P> He said the five-story limit sought by the homeowners was unreasonable. "There  has to be a midpoint somewhere," he said.  </P> <P> Council members said they would favor allowing media-related businesses  flexibility on the 15-story height limit.  </P> <P> A majority of the council also agreed that the major studios in the district  should not have to apply for a conditional-use permit -- a lengthy process that  requires a public hearing -- for buildings up to 125 feet tall. Such buildings  would be between 10 and 12 stories.  </P> <P> The council recommended other restrictions, including requiring buildings of  between 25 and 50 feet to be at least 25 feet away from residential  neighborhoods. Buildings of between 50 and 150 feet high would be required to  be at least 35 feet away from such a neighborhood, under the recommendations.  </P> <P> Developers, however, could apply for conditional-use permits for projects that  exceeded the recommended limits if they thought the projects warranted further  consideration.  </P> <P> Despite the opposition, Councilman Thomas E. Flavin defended the council's  recommendations. "I thought the council made an honest effort to balance the  differing viewpoints on both sides," Flavin said. "Of course, not everyone is  going to be 100% satisfied."  </P> <P> Flavin said further modifications might be necessary before a final  growth-control plan for the Media District is drafted. After the plan is  revised, an environmental impact report will be prepared and more public  hearings scheduled.  </P></p>

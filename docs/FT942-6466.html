			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Big borrowers ride out turbulence - International For big borrowers in the eurobond market, hell is something other people go through. Investors and banks might be running scared, but the large companies and countries which raise funds in the market claim to have weathered the recent bond market storm and fulfilled their requirements, at least for now. Merrill Lynch shows in its most recent statistics for eurobond issuance that in February, March and April this year, Dollars 75.5bn of debt was launched, a figure sharply below last year's Dollars 104.7bn but well up on previous years. And floating-rate note (FRN) issuance, the attractive choice in a climate of rising interest rates, is higher than at any time in the past six years. The world's biggest borrowers all claim to be up to date in their funding programmes this year. Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, says: 'We have already raised Dollars 4.5bn of a proposed Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn.' Officials at the Swedish national debt office say two-thirds of the country's Dollars 10bn annual borrowing programme has been fulfilled. Abbey National, the UK bank, says it doesn't have annual quotas, but is 'very comfortable' with its funding this year. Mr Jean-Claude Bresson, deputy manager of capital markets at the European Investment Bank, shrugs off any suggestion of a funding problem. Issuers may be sitting pretty, but for the syndicate managers who launch the deals, it is a different story. Privately, and in relation to offerings from rivals, they say deals are being priced too aggressively as banks fight for business. They add that large amounts of new eurobonds are returning to the underwriters. One way to track the performance of a eurobond issue is through the yield spread at which it is priced over the relevant government bond. A rising spread suggests more supply than demand. Among the first to take advantage of the seemingly more stable environment provided by the Fed rate rise almost a fortnight ago was the Republic of Finland, which offered FFr6bn of debt priced to yield 32 basis points above 10-year French government bonds. The issue has widened to yield 35 basis points over on Friday. A similar deal for the Kingdom of Spain saw the yield spread widen to 30 basis points from 24 basis points at the launch a week ago. Mr Thomas Keller, assistant director to the treasury at Germany's L-Bank, which has completed about half of its funding, says syndicate managers have found themselves at the mercy of a volatile market. 'Many bookrunners have so many bonds that they don't have the flexibility to calm the markets. Every time the market goes up they sell into strength to unwind their portfolio and it goes down again,' he says. The amount of debt on underwriters' books, fuelled by over-enthusiastic buying during last year's bull market, is difficult to quantify. However, the costs of carrying these bonds have increased because of the collapse in bond prices this year. In addition, the buyers' strike among investors has made it virtually impossible to get rid of the bonds. Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, estimates that in early April some Dollars 8n of FRNs were unsold. It says the figure might have fallen to between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn, but that the overhang is still depressing prices. Mr Tim Skeet, at Kidder's capital markets desk, says those with big positions to unwind will suffer whatever happens in the markets. 'Whether the market falls further or simply moves sideways, syndicates will have to start worrying about their costs and put greater emphasis on inventory turnover.' Mr Jonathan Nicholls of Abbey National's treasury department agrees. 'There is a lot of inventory out there. I would not be considering issuing a large transaction at this time,' he says. The exceptionally high volatility in bond markets has left investors bruised and confused. With no clear idea of the direction the markets are taking, they prefer to be in a more heavily-traded arena such as government bonds, which can be offloaded more quickly than the less liquid eurobonds. So who is buying? Eurobond salesmen pinpoint Swiss retail investors and wealthy individuals who have been attracted by the relatively high yield on short-dated dollar-denominated debt. However, insurance companies and pension groups, which are traditionally drawn to longer-dated maturities, are keeping a low profile. What buyers there are in the market are also being more selective, choosing to invest only in bonds issued by highly-rated or well-known names. And as Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed income and currency at Rothschild Asset Management points out: 'The highest quality issuers tend to be able to issue in any circumstance.' However, if the sticky conditions continue, the investors who are there will fall by the wayside and borrowers might find that their funding programmes and confidence fall off with them.</p>

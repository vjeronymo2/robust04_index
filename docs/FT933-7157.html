			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Saudis widen political horizons DIPLOMATS yesterday wel-comed the naming of the 60 people who will sit on Saudi Arabia's new consultative council as the most important political change in the kingdom since it became a state more than 60 years ago. King Fahd's weekend announcement, which fulfilled a promise made more than 15 years ago to open out his kingdom's secretive, family-run government, was welcomed as 'remarkable' in the context of the Gulf's most powerful and conservative state. 'It's an important step,' said Mr David Gore-Booth, Britain's ambassador in Riyadh. The setting up of the Shoura council, as it will be known, will bring Saudi Arabia in line with other Gulf states, including Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain. These states have taken steps of varying degrees towards broader political participation since the Gulf war, partly because of the intense western scrutiny of their political systems which came with the war. The new Saudi council will be free to advise and criticise the government but has no legislative powers. Its creation falls well short of anything like a shift towards western-style democracy. Its members are appointed to their four-year terms by the king, who retains the final say in all policy decisions. However, its constitution will allow the first institutionalised political participation for Saudis outside the royal family. 'It represents a realisation that you can no longer run a country which has had modernity thrust upon it with ancient methods,' said one Gulf analyst. 'It's an implicit dilution of absolute power.' In a further move to open up the kingdom's closely held government, King Fahd also announced that all ministerial terms would be limited to four years, subject to possible extensions. Saudi ministers have hitherto enjoyed almost indefinite tenure. The list of council members is a broad and carefully balanced selection of academics, military men, journalists, doctors, businessmen, deputy ministers, lawyers, religious scholars and poets. Few are well known outside the kingdom and many obscure inside it, reflecting the kingdom's lack of a public political culture. More than half the new members hold doctorates, many from US or other western universities. Many observers feel that if not quite pro-western, the council as a whole is well acquainted with the west. 'We can say that it's not entirely weighted in the direction of the conservatives,' said one diplomat. No date has been set for the first meeting of the new council, which will convene at least once every two weeks. It will do so in a building in Riyadh's diplomatic quarter which was completed, along with electronic voting equipment, in the late 1970s and has awaited a role ever since.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Move to relaunch Asian trade zone SOUTH-EAST Asian governments have announced plans to relaunch the Asean Free Trade Area (Afta) after a year of haggling during which they have made little headway in reducing tariffs. Ministers from the six members of Asean - the Association of South East Asian Nations, comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - are meeting in Singapore this week to discuss regional and international trade matters. Asean announced in Singapore that member states would start implementing tariff cuts for intra-Asean trade from January 1 1994, to show the private sector that the six countries were serious about moving towards Afta. Officials said that a timetable would be issued in November. The original plan agreed in 1992 was to begin reducing tariffs at the start of this year to create a free trade area in 15 years, but the agreement did not tie the signatories to a precise timetable. Most governments, under pressure from uncompetitive national industries protected by high tariffs, delayed the cuts and announced long lists of products they were excluding from the scheme. Asean said there had now been 'improvements to the commitments of member countries', although Asean's own figures show little change for the better. Malaysia, for example, appears to have sharply reduced the number of product categories it is submitting to the Afta tariff cuts, partly because it has dropped processed agricultural products for the time being and partly because of bureaucratic changes to the way products are consolidated into different tariff categories. Previously, Malaysia has warned other Asean countries not to take advantage of what it calls 'Malaysia's generosity'.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Mild reprieve for French franc THE French franc yesterday recovered some of the ground lost against the D-Mark last Friday, but the currency weakened in the European afternoon amid rumours that the Bundesbank will not support the franc with the vigour deployed in the autumn, writes James Blitz. In early European trading the D-Mark displayed weakness against other currencies. Dealers were impressed by the results of the summit of European leaders in Edinburgh, in particular the agreement on a Community budget and Denmark's decision to hold a second referendum on European Monetary Union in the summer. The French franc consequently appreciated to a high of FFr3.3970 against the D-Mark in the morning, having closed in Europe on Friday night at FFr3.4180. Sterling also benefited from the news from Edinburgh, peaking in the morning at DM2.4652 after finishing on Friday at DM2.4575. In the afternoon, however, the franc's strength was sapped by rumours that the Bundesbank had told the French authorities that there would be a limit in future on the amounts they would spend supporting the French currency. That rumour was not confirmed, but the currency closed at FFr3.4110 against the D-Mark. The net effect of yesterday's moves was to remove some of the stress that had plagued the system last week. The Danish krone closed at DKr3.8525 to the D-Mark, having been as low as DKr2.8950 the previous week. This came in spite of a cut in Denmark's Certificate of Deposit interest rates from 15 per cent to 14 per cent yesterday. Analysts believe that the French franc may only be enjoying a reprieve because of the unwillingness of traders to take open positions in the run-up to the new year. Mr David Cocker, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, says the franc is suffering from large-scale hedging by investment funds who are not selling assets but protecting their equities by restructuring their currency portfolios. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, is moving towards thinking that a French franc devaluation may happen. But he still thinks the French and German authorities will avoid it, 'fighting a devaluation tooth and nail'. Mr Hannah believes three factors will melt the Bundesbank's icy unwillingness to ease policy. First, prospects of a German recession are worsening, with the Ifo institute yesterday predicting a fall in German GDP of 0.5 per cent next year. Secondly, German unions seem to be settling for wage rises that translate to nil per cent in real terms. And, he feels, falling business activity will trigger a decline in M3 money supply next year, with M3 dropping to the lower end of the Bundesbank's new target range.</p>

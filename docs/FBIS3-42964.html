			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viesturs Pauls Karnups: "The Citizenship Law of </F> the Republic of Latvia and the Fate of the Latvian People."]    [Text] It is no secret nor revelation that the Latvian  people are being faced with a demographic catastrophe. The goal  of our generation is to prevent a worsening of the present  situation and make some attempts so that at least our children's  children shall not inherit a situation worse that what we have  today. This is a difficult goal, and it will be essential to use  all of our strength in order to make this happen.    One of the basic principles, which could have a significant  impact on the situation, is the adoption of a citizenship law  favorable to the Latvian people. It is not a secret to anyone  that the citizenship law involves many important questions. It  includes a wide spectrum of problems, not only on the  demographic situation of Latvians, but also on the status of the  colonists brought into Latvia during the occupation. And there  is also the gradual repatriation of these colonists and the  promotion of emigration, as well as many other current problems.  The subject of this article will be the relationship between the  citizenship law and the question of the survival of the Latvia  people.    Before delving into the matter of the citizenship law, I  would like to familiarize you with some figures describing the  current situation:    According to the residents' registry data, which have been  entered into the computer data bank, we see the following  picture:    1. Registered residents of Latvia: 2,410,763.    Among this number:    -- Latvian citizens: 1,355,259 -- 78.8%    -- citizens of other nationalities: 365,043 -- 21.2%;    -- total -- 1,720,302 -- 100%.    2. Registered Latvians who are not citizens of the Latvian  state: 21,555;    -- together with citizens -- Latvians --1,376,814 --  79%;    -- all citizens combined -- 1,741,857.    3. It can be estimated that the category of non-citizens to  be naturalized outside the quota (excepting Latvians) would  increase the number of citizens through the naturalization  process by --180,000;    -- all citizens combined -- 1,921,857.    4. If the number of Latvians in the total citizenship body  does not change (1,376,814 resp.), then the proportion of  Latvians in the total citizenship body will decline to  71.6%.    5. If we include those born in the Latvian SSR, who are not  Latvian state citizens and who do not belong to the number  outside the quota -- 213,250, then the total citizenship body of  the Latvian state is 2,135,107, and the proportion of Latvians  in the total citizenship body declines to 64.5/%.    6. If we include the number of those who entered the Latvian  SSR until 1983, who are not citizens of Latvia, and who are not  part of the number outside the quota -- approximately 200,000,  then the total number of Latvian state citizens becomes  2,335,107, and the proportion of Latvians in the total  citizenship body would decline to 59%.    It is evident that such a picture, from the viewpoint of the  survival of the Latvian people, is very sad. Over the normal  course, the natural population growth rate of the Latvian  people, i.e. the rate of generation change over, will remain  under 2.1. Thus, every citizen who is not a Latvian reduces the  proportion of Latvians in the total citizenship body, and along  with this, increases the threat that Latvia, in the best case,  will become a dual-community state. This perspective is most  dangerous to the survival of the Latvian people. This risk was  confirmed by a certain study in 1992[.sup]1[/] concerning the  adaption of foreigners (Russians) to Latvia. The results  confirmed that foreigners in a Latvian community did not adapt  themselves, they did not become accustomed, nor did they wish to  become accustomed, but wanted to live in Latvia within their own  community.    After 50 years of occupation, the Latvian people have  assimilated, to a certain extent, in the direction of the  Russian people. During the occupation of Latvia, a comfortable  community was created for the Russia people, but not for the  Latvians. This means that the possibilities to integrate such a  large mass of colonists into the Latvian community are minimal,  because, first of all, such a Latvian community must be created,  i.e. it is necessary to turn the Latvians away from the  influence of the Russian people and towards their own people.  Only when the Latvian community has been established, more or  less, can we talk about the integration of non-Latvians.    The deciding role here is played by the citizenship law. In  a  normal society, the acquisition of citizenship is a very  individualized and long-term process, and it cannot be  accomplished in mass style. There is a critical moment when an  individual has decided to commit his and his family's future to  the state where he has been a long-term resident, and in which  he has become so integrated that he feels more comfortable and  more apart of its social and cultural community than that of the  country from which he originated. The acquisition of citizenship  is the culmination point of the integration process.    In Latvia, there is a desire to start this process in a  manner completely opposite from what is generally accepted  elsewhere. The acquisition of citizenship is considered as the  beginning of integration, and there are attempts to convince us  that only after citizenship has been granted, can we hope to  integrate the large mass of colonists. It is quite obvious  that we will not be able to integrate into the Latvian  community, which at present only exists formally, and is not a  reality, 500,000 colonists. It is more plausible that quite the  opposite will happen, that the russification of the Latvian  people will continued in earnest. When this happens, we will be  unable to claim our human rights because we have voluntarily  agreed to these developments.    The Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM) has  consistently supported the viewpoint that the proportion of  Latvians in the total citizenship body should not be allowed to  fall below 75%, if we want to provide for the existence  of the  Latvian people and the development of the Latvian state. In  practice, this would mean that general naturalization should  only occur after many years. From our standpoint, the  citizenship law question is a political question, not  a question of integration or loyalty to the Latvian sate. It  is essential that political and economic power remains in the  hands of the Latvian people, because the Latvia people do not  have another country of their own. It is not a matter of how  well or poorly the Latvians can realize this power, since Latvia  is the only country that the Latvians have, whose future should  be shaped by the Latvian people, not by people who have been  systematically relocated as a result of some other country's  politics.    Therefore, the citizenship law of the Republic of Latvia is  not merely a mechanism for dealing with the relationships  between non-citizens and the state, but also the cornerstone for  determining the fate of the Latvian people. Today, we are faced  with a choice. It is a question of whether we will attempt to  guarantee the survival of the Latvia people, or  whether we will decide that our children shall live, as I  mentioned earlier -- in the best case -- in a dual-community  state, or -- in the worst case -- in a russified province of  Russia. We have no other choices because the caravan is  beginning to move on.    What can we do right now to move the caravan in a direction  that would be in our favor? Despite the unfavorable statistics,  there are a few things that we can do.    1. Using all the means available to the state, we could  promote repatriation of the Latvia people back to Latvia, and  the voluntary immigration of non-citizens to foreign countries.  I am purposefully using the term "foreign countries", because  just as many non-citizens would gladly immigrate in the western  direction as repatriate to the east. That would also mean that  we must involve western countries for immigration (for example,  the USA, Canada, Australia, etc.), so that they could establish  specific immigration programs in which they would agree to  accept a given number of colonists from Latvia within their  general immigration quotas. We will have to deal with the  repatriation of Latvians back to Latvia ourselves.    2. Within the citizenship law, it must be clearly and simply  stated that the naturalization quotas will only be minimal, and  that the beginning of generalized naturalization should not be  expected, neither in the near future nor even sometime in the  foreseeable future. In principle, non-citizens would be given  two choices, respectively, either to emigrate or to continue  living in Latvia as a foreigner.    3. All efforts should be concentrated on fortifying the  establishment of a Latvian community in Latvia, and, as I  mentioned earlier, to return Latvians in the direction of their  people. I am speaking here about derussification,  which, until now, has not be included among the famous three  "D's". Latvian identity, etc., will not be found by shouting or  contemplating one's navel. The Latvian community, first of all,  is based on the Latvian language. When every student who  graduates from school in Latvia will be totally fluent in the  Latvian language, regardless of his nationality, then we have a  Latvian community we can start talking about. Everything else  will follow as a natural result.    In ending, I would once again like to stress the  cornerstones.    First, the demographic situation of the Latvian people does  not allow for generalized naturalization any time soon.    Second, it is essential to create a Latvian community in  Latvia, in order to insure the survival of the Latvian people,  regardless of the regulations in the citizenship law.    Third, with all of our power, we must promote the  repatriation of Latvians and the voluntary emigration of  non-citizens.    Thank you for your attention,    Viesturs Pauls Karnups  Footnotes    1.

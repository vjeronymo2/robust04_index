			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] The DPRK's decision to withdraw from the IAEA has  created new tensions with regard to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula. Our station commentator (Krichevskiy) writes:    Pyongyang has taken a new, very dangerous measure to beef up  its confrontation with the international community. By so  doing, Pyongyang tries to free itself from the IAEA's  intervention with regard to the nuclear issue. However, this  measure does not mean that the DPRK can ignore the IAEA's right  to continue the inspections. This is because the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] stipulates such a right. The DPRK  is still a signatory of this treaty.    Pyongyang's decision immediately has caused a greater worry  worldwide. A problem facing governments of many countries and  the United Nations is what they should do. The United States  more strongly demands that sanctions be imposed immediately.    Russia has begun to refer to sanctions more often. Russia  does not like to see a country -- that violates the NPT and  possesses nuclear weapons -- appear in its neighborhood. Russia  does not like to see the situation along its border aggravated,  either.    However, sanctions will inevitably bring such results.  Therefore, Moscow has tenaciously pursued the possibility of  imposing sanctions step by step and a proposal for convening an  international conference attended by representatives of Russia,  China, the United States, the DPRK, the ROK, the IAEA, and the  United Nations.    There have been some results. After talking to U.S.  President Clinton over telephone on 14 June, President Yeltsin  said that they agreed to convene an international conference on  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. They assigned the  Russian Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Secretary of State to the  task of linking the issue of holding of the international  conference to the issue of imposing sanctions on the DPRK step  by step.    China still plays an important role in coping with the  crisis. China expresses a grave worry over the DPRK's decision  and the future development of the situation on the Korean  peninsula. Observers say that as it did before, Beijing opposes  sanctions on the DPRK, demands the resumption of direct talks  between Korea [choson] and the United States, and keeps silent  on Russia's proposal for convening an international conference  with China in attendance. In short, a complicated situation is  prevailing.    However, there is still hope. This will be especially true  if Pyongyang signals aspirations for resolving the complex knot,  instead of bringing the issue to a deadlock.</p>

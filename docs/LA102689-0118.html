			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN DATA RULING MAY BE CHALLENGED;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: THE JUSTICE DEPT. MAY TEST A DECISION ALLOWING SUBPOENA OF THE  FORMER PRESIDENT'S NOTES FOR THE TRIAL OF JOHN M. POINDEXTER.  </P> <P> The Justice Department raised the possibility Wednesday that it might challenge  a federal judge's ruling that former President Ronald Reagan's notes and  diaries on Iran-Contra events can be subpoenaed for the trial of his former  national security adviser, John M. Poindexter.  </P> <P> Department lawyers are reviewing the 67-page ruling of U.S. District Judge  Harold Greene, said David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman. He added  that Greene's ruling Tuesday "does raise a serious question regarding the  institution of the presidency."  </P> <P> Runkel declined to pinpoint the "serious question" that was raised, but  presumably he meant that the ruling threatens the privacy of a former  President's notes and diaries.  </P> <P> Any move to head off the subpoena could raise questions left open by the  Supreme Court's 8-0 ruling in 1974 requiring former President Richard M. Nixon  to surrender tapes of his conversations for the criminal trial of several of  his aides.  </P> <P> The decision recognized a "constitutionally based" executive privilege covering  presidential materials, but said in the Watergate coverup case that it "must  yield to the demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal  trial."  </P> <P> Runkel made clear that the department would make no move without consulting  with Reagan's personal attorney, Theodore B. Olson, who headed the Justice  Department's office of legal counsel during Reagan's first term.  </P> <P> Greene's ruling first will be reviewed by the department's criminal division  and then by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's office, Runkel said.  </P> <P> Olson declined comment Wednesday but it is clear that he or the department  would not move to quash a subpoena until it is issued by Greene for specific  materials.  </P> <P> Although Greene ruled Tuesday that Poindexter can subpoena Reagan documents,  Poindexter's lawyer still must submit subpoenas to Greene for "specific,  relevant documents" in the custody of Reagan or the U.S. archivist. The  material must be requested by Nov. 23 -- 60 days before the Jan. 22 trial date  set for Poindexter.  </P> <P> Greene made his decision on the basis of a sealed claim submitted to him by  Poindexter setting out the reasons for which he needs Reagan's diaries and  notes. Greene made public Tuesday only that part of Poindexter's claims that  were necessary to explain the logic of his ruling.  </P> <P> He cited Poindexter's claim that he frequently met alone with Reagan and  routinely discussed national security matters with him, including various  aspects of what became the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> Reagan and others took notes on these conversations and these notes or Reagan's  diary entries "would support his defense to the charges in the various counts  of the indictment," Poindexter said in his submission to the judge.  </P> <P> Reagan's personal notes were examined under tight limits by the presidential  commission headed by former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) that evaluated the White  House national security mechanism as it operated in Iran-Contra, and by the  congressional committees that investigated the matter. But these panels did not  have Poindexter providing a roadmap of what he sees as Reagan's involvement and  knowledge of the matter.  </P> <P> Philip A. Lacovara, the former Watergate special prosecution force lawyer who  argued the Nixon tapes case before the Supreme Court, said Wednesday: "I can't  imagine why the privacy of an ex-President's notes would be higher than that of  an incumbent President."  </P></p>

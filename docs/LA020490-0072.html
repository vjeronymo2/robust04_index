			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOB'S MUSCLE CITED AS FORCE BEHIND F. D. ROBERTS PENNY STOCK SWINDLE;  </P> <P> SECURITIES: A NEW JERSEY CASE BRINGS TO LIGHT HOW THE MAFIA MANAGED THE  FRAUDULENT SECURITIES OPERATION AND ITS INTIMIDATING SALES TACTICS.  </P> <P> When Scotty Lyons answered a tiny help-wanted advertisement for a stockbroker  that he saw in his local Florida newspaper, he wouldn't have guessed that he'd  end up working for the Mob.  </P> <P> But it wasn't too long after getting that high-paying job at F. D. Roberts  Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., that Lyons -- whose name has been changed  here -- realized that the stocks he was peddling to gullible investors  nationwide were worthless and that, more ominously, he had unknowingly become a  participant in one of organized crime's hottest new schemes -- securities  fraud.  </P> <P> Even the most naive employee apparently knew of F. D. Roberts' underworld  affiliation -- a connection that certain officials of the now-closed brokerage  have admitted in court.  </P> <P> Some of the low-level employees didn't care that they were working for the Mob,  Lyons says. Others were such novices in the securities business that perhaps  they didn't realize that what they were doing was very illegal.  </P> <P> But all of the workers knew one thing. "Everybody knew not to screw with them,"  says Lyons now, months after having quit the "brokerage" business. "The  intimidation factor was tremendous."  </P> <P> Lyons agreed to discuss how he was recruited into a seemingly legitimate  brokerage that federal prosecutors allege was nothing more than a business  subsidiary of the New York-based Gambino organized crime family, which is  reputedly headed by John Gotti. In return, some of the details about Lyons'  past have been disguised, so that he doesn't have to have a reunion with his  old employers.  </P> <P> To start with, nobody really knows how deeply organized crime has infiltrated  the business of selling penny stocks to the public, but several of the major  crime families are believed to dabble in the business. There have been hearings  before Congress about the matter, and investigators say the link between the  Mob and the selling of worthless securities has been growing in recent years.  </P> <P> Why? "It's such a fertile field," says Joseph G. Braunreuther, assistant U.S.  attorney in Newark, N.J., where penny stock fraud prosecutions have become a  specialty. "There is a lot of money to be made in the financial markets," he  adds.  </P> <P> Members of organized crime, of course, are not the only ones selling worthless  stocks in bogus companies. There are thousands of enterprising thieves around  the nation who -- with the aid of a printing press, a telephone and a deft  sales pitch -- are selling securities that give new meaning to the phrase "junk  market."  </P> <P> Not all penny stocks are worthless. Some legitimate companies do start out  small, with their stocks worth a fraction of what an established company's  shares would be worth.  </P> <P> But the case of F. D. Roberts -- which is being prosecuted successfully in New  Jersey, the company's state of incorporation -- provides a unique peek into the  role of the Mob in penny stock frauds. (The company formerly had branches in  Los Angeles and Desert Hot Springs.)  </P> <P> Prosecutors say organized crime brings a special talent to the stock fraud  business -- intimidation. The muscle isn't used against the investors. Believe  it or not, people voluntarily surrender millions of dollars a year to the  smooth-talking operators of penny stock frauds, as Lyons explains.  </P> <P> Instead, the Mob's muscle comes in handy if any of the co-conspirators in a  stock fraud decide that they no longer feel comfortable stealing from  investors. "Not much (muscle) is needed," says Braunreuther, explaining that an  implied threat is usually enough to make any white-collar criminal buckle.  </P> <P> Most penny stock frauds are similar to the age-old pyramid schemes. Here's how  the Mob, for instance, would put one of these scams together:  </P> <P> First, the mobsters would launder illegally obtained money by bankrolling the  start of a new company that, let's say, will purportedly own shopping centers.  The company wouldn't be given a whole lot of capital -- just enough so that it  can buy a property or two and be able to promise convincingly in legal  documents that it plans to buy more buildings.  </P> <P> Then, a large amount of stock that far exceeds the company's actual worth is  sold by a small number of closely related "brokerages" that specialize in penny  stocks. The sales are made over the telephone, with names of potential clients  coming from mailing lists and referrals.  </P> <P> The company never really plans to purchase more buildings. That's just a ruse.  </P> <P> What the company -- which is usually run by close associates or relatives of  the mobsters -- and its brokers really intend to do is manipulate the price of  the shares upward so that investors will continually be enticed into buying  stock.  </P> <P> This way, not only do the schemers sell their personal stock holdings in the  company at inflated prices as the stock rises, but the brokers and their firms  also make fortunes from excessive trading commissions generated from the stock  purchases.  </P> <P> The key to all this is that nobody can be allowed to break with the conspiracy.  If one of the brokerages stops trading the manipulated stock at the falsely  inflated price, then the whole deceit unravels. That's where the Mob comes in:  It keeps everyone in line.  </P> <P> But, as Lyons explained, it wasn't all that difficult for the folks running F.  D. Roberts to keep its troops loyal. There were, after all, plenty of economic  incentives.  </P> <P> Lyons said he personally made more than $100,000 in sales commissions in his  first two months on the job, and it wasn't unusual for office managers to pull  in $100,000 a month.  </P> <P> That's big money for anyone, but it is especially enticing when you consider  that F. D. Roberts had a habit of recruiting lesser-paid workers -- like  bartenders barely out of their teens -- into its version of the brokerage  business. "One guy was sleeping in a laundry room" before he was hired by F. D.  Roberts, Lyons said.  </P> <P> As if that weren't enough to ensure loyalty, there also was the French chef  hired by Roberts to provide sustenance for its troops during business hours;  the evening beer blasts that went on even as brokers were making calls to  clients on the West Coast, and "phenomenal" parties at the Boca Raton Resort  &amp; Club.  </P> <P> But F. D. Roberts also expected a lot of its brokers.  </P> <P> Lyons said the 60 or so brokers at the Boca Raton office were required to be at  work before 9 a.m. each day or be fined $100. At 9:30 a.m. they'd be given a  pep talk that would have made a Big 10 college football coach proud.  </P> <P> At that meeting, the managers would tell the brokers which stocks would be  manipulated higher in price that day. They'd be encouraged to sell, sell, sell.  A manager might fling a piece of gold jewelry to the previous day's most  successful salesman.  </P> <P> One manager even ushered his brokers to the office window so they could be  inspired by the sight of the manager's new Rolls-Royce Corniche being delivered  on cue in the parking lot. That car sells for more than $140,000, and the  brokers were well aware that the manager also had a Mercedes and a Porsche at  home.  </P> <P> Lyons said the message was: "You do your work, and see what you can get."  </P> <P> The brokers would spend their entire day calling clients from coast to coast.  Some used scripts prepared for them by F. D. Roberts; other brokers would wing  it. All were specially trained in high-pressure sales techniques.  </P> <P> If a prospective client said, "I can't make that sort of investment without  consulting my spouse," the broker would typically deride him or her by saying,  "Who's the boss in your family anyway?"  </P> <P> If the client's objection was that the money was being set aside for a child's  education, the broker might say, "Do you really think you'll be able to afford  a good college education investing the way you are now?"  </P> <P> And if an investor insisted that he needed more time to think it over, the  broker would offer to fill out the forms to buy stock now, "and you can always  cancel the order later." Later, if the client did try to cancel, he would be  told that it was too late.  </P> <P> His protests would be cut short when the broker told him that the price of the  stock he bought had already risen. (The stock, of course, actually did go up  because the brokerage was manipulating it higher.)  </P> <P> The brokers weren't above a little play acting, either. On more than one  occasion, a broker's confederates would create background noises of ticker tape  machines by tapping on their staplers. "Oh, oh," the broker would tell his mark  over the phone, "another 100 shares of XYZ stock just traded. You'd better  hurry or you'll miss out."  </P> <P> Brokers in the Boca Raton office were expected to stay on the phone for hours.  "If you weren't on the phone, they'd pull your chair away and make you stand up  to get motivated," Lyons says.  </P> <P> The sales staff was really pumped up, Lyons said, whenever the brokerage was  starting a new scam. "They'd have an emergency meeting at 2 p.m. and say, 'This  stock is coming out; have everyone buy it.' They guaranteed that the price  would go up," Lyons says.  </P> <P> But only certain clients -- mostly close associates of the brokerage's owners  -- would ever be permitted to sell their stocks once the price did go up.  Often, a broker was told that he had to deliver two new clients to buy a stock  at a higher price for every one client who wanted out.  </P> <P> Sometimes, Roberts just wouldn't let a client sell. One client, according to  Lyons, was told that sell orders for a particular stock were being taken in the  alphabetical order of the clients' last names. Since this particular client's  name began with "W," he'd just have to wait his turn.  </P> <P> If a client persisted, the broker would simply "fire" the client, said Lyons.  The broker would mail the client the worthless stock certificate. Of course,  the client would never be able to sell the stock anywhere else.  </P> <P> So far, New Jersey prosecutors have gotten 17 guilty pleas in the F. D. Roberts  case. And New Jersey securities regulators have filed a civil complaint against  more than a dozen officials of the firm, alleging that it made $65 million in  illegal trading profits. Additional criminal charges are likely to be filed as  well, according to law enforcement sources.  </P></p>

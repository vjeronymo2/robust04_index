			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH DEFICIT RISES SLIGHTLY  </P> <P> Britain's balance of payments deficit rose slightly in June to almost $2.5  billion after a gap of $2.4 billion in May, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The increase was in line with forecasts, and financial markets generally took  the view that the government was still moving in the right direction to narrow  the gap.  </P> <P> The Central Statistical Office data showed the merchandise trade balance for  June was almost $2.8 billion in the red compared with a shortfall of just over  $2.8 billion in May.  </P> <P> The trade deficit was offset by a $363-million surplus on so-called invisible  items such as shipping, insurance and tourism.  </P> <P> With a stronger pound making imports cheaper and exports more expensive, the  fact that the increase was within expectations brought relief to financial  markets, and the pound rose a third of a cent against the dollar to $1.8180 at  midday.  </P></p>

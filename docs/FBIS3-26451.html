Signed by Premier Li Peng, the two series of regulations --  on "The Management of Foreign People's Religious Activities in  China" and on the "Management of the Places of Religious  Activities" -- took effect on January 31.    The first group noted that China respects foreign people's  freedom of religious belief in the country and it protects  foreign religious people's friendly exchanges and cultural and  academic exchanges in religion with Chinese counterparts.

They can preach at religious places in China at the  invitation of the religious organizations at and above  provincial level and they can hold religious activities  participated by foreigners at places which are recognized by the  religious administrative departments of the government at and  above county level.    Foreign people in China can invite Chinese religious people  to hold religious ceremonies for them, including baptism,  wedding, funeral ceremony and Taoist and Buddhist rites.    The regulations noted that foreign people who enter China  can  bring with them religious printed matters, religious recordings  and video tapes and other religious matters for their own uses.  Materials which are more than for their own uses should be  handled by Chinese customs offices according to relevant  regulations.

The regulations said that setting up of religious places  should be subject to registration. Religious places should be  managed by their own managing organizations. The legitimate  rights and interests and normal religious activities of the  places are protected by law and no organizations and individuals  should infringe upon and interfere in the legitimate rights and  the normal activities.    Laws and regulations should be observed when religious  activities are held in religious places. No people are allowed  to make use of religious places to conduct activities which  undermine the national unity, unity of nationalities and social  stability, impair citizens' health and hinder the state  education system. Religious places should not be controlled by  overseas organizations and individuals.    The managing organizations of religious places can receive  donations from the public. Donations from overseas religious  services and individuals to religious places in China should be  disposed of according to relevant regulations of the country.    In religious places, the managing organizations can sell  religious art ware, books and magazines according to the  stipulations of the country.    The managing organizations of religious places should have  licences for their land, mountains and houses, which are issued  by the country.

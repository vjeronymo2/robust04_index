			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: REAGANS' RATING SOARS, BUT FOR UNPOPULARITY  </P> <P> "IN EXACTLY one year since leaving the White House, the Reagans have done the  impossible. They have become the most unpopular First Couple in history,"  writes Sally Ogle Davis in Los Angeles magazine.  </P> <P> Davis makes the point in her article titled "The Teflon Wears Thin" that Ronald  Reagan left Washington with a healthy 68% approval rating. She says this rating  no longer exists and cites the controversial $2-million trip by the Reagans to  Japan . . . the former President's praise of the Japanese who might make "clean  movies" to improve on Hollywood . . . Nancy's withdrawal of support from the  drug rehabilitating Phoenix House . . . the coming IRS tax probe into the  former First Lady's use of designer clothes . . . proliferating books against  the Reagans . . . and Nancy's own memoir.  </P> <P> THE TRUE "capper" in this Los Angeles magazine piece, however, is the  revelation that the Reagans' estranged daughter, Patti Davis, "is reportedly  spending time closeted with tell-all biographer Kitty Kelley for the latter's  book on Nancy Reagan!"  </P> <P> Kitty's Christmas card, by the by, features Nancy Reagan consulting a woman  looking into a crystal ball and speaks of a big unauthorized biography that  will tell all the former First Lady's deepest, darkest secrets. Inside the card  there is a cartoon of Nancy wearing a button that reads: "Just Say Dough!"  </P> <P> FAYE DUNAWAY is a star on the rebound. Her recent "Cold Sassy Tree" for the  Turner TV network showed Faye at her most subtle, and with terrific results.  Now the actress is getting hot advance word-of-mouth for her portrayal of a  former TV evangelist in the soon due "The Handmaiden's Tale," based on Margaret  Atwood's futuristic thriller.  </P> <P> Faye's career derailed after "Mommie Dearest" in 1980, although I've never  understood why.  </P> <P> THE NEGRO Ensemble Company is the nation's oldest, consistently producing  theater organization. It opens its 23rd season on Jan. 13 with one of two plays  from Charles Fuller's cycle of dramas. On the 11th, we get "Jonquil" and then  in February comes "Burner's Frolic." Last season, Fuller did "Sally and  Prince," dramatizing the turbulent, violence-ridden years after the Civil War  and the emancipation of the slaves.  </P> <P> These plays are independent of each other, separated by 10 years in time and  with entirely different casts. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "A  Soldier's Story" is now working on the screenplay for "Malcolm X," to star  Denzel Washington.  </P></p>

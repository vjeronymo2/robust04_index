			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Technology: Making a costs diagnosis Patients in the UK are getting used to seeing a computer on their doctor's desk. Eighty per cent of general practices in Britain have a computer to help manage patient records. While some sorts of data have always been demanded by authorities - on the occurrence of certain diseases, for example - additional requirements have resulted from the cost-conscious reforms of the 1980s. The NHS had formerly required few costs measurements, and doctors were inexperienced in 'budgeting' patient care and drug costs. Almost overnight, a new market for software suppliers appeared, selling systems to doctors who were novices at both computers and business administration. Doctors suddenly had to monitor costs, especially prescription expenses, an exercise that would have been impossible based purely on paper-based notes. Many doctors installed their first systems in the late 1980s, aware of an increasing need to measure drug-related costs, and other resources used by patients. The two most widely sold systems, Vamp Health (2,000 sites) and AAH Meditel (1,289 sites), were both developed by British companies that were acquired by pharmaceuticals companies. The recent emphasis on preventative medicine has put extra tasks on the doctors' agenda. Their pay levels are now linked to fulfilling preventative duties, including immunisation, cervical smears and check-ups on the elderly. Doctors must be able to satisfy their local Family Health Service Authority that they have achieved set percentages of their patient quota to qualify for performance-related pay. Practices can now apply for fundholder status, which allows doctors a budget for patient care, and gives them control of how it is allocated. To qualify for fundholder status, doctors must be able to deliver the appropriate statistics, which means computerisation must take place at least a year beforehand. GP fundholders get all software expenses and 75 per cent of hardware costs reimbursed by the FHSA. Non fundholders get up to half of entire system costs, including maintenance.</p>

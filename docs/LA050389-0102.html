			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG LENDER PULLING OUT OF STATE STUDENT-LOAN PROGRAM  </P> <P> California's largest and most controversial maker of government-guaranteed  student loans announced that it is pulling out of the program, throwing into  further disarray California's already chaotic student-loan market.  </P> <P> The lender, First Independent Trust Co. of Sacramento, which has made $1.5  billion in student loans nationwide since 1980, cited recent financial turmoil  in the state's $6-billion student-loan market as the reason for its decision.  That turmoil, it said, includes the drying up of money in the "secondary  market" where lenders sell the student loans.  </P> <P> What First Independent Trust did not mention in its announcement late Monday  was that it has been given formal notice that it is about to be banned by state  officials from making government-guaranteed student loans in California. The  officials are alleging widespread and continuing violations by the trust  company of student-loan program rules. It would be the first time a lender has  been banned from making student loans, officials said.  </P> <P> State officials said they have found that First Independent Trust failed to pay  at least $4.5 million in fees owed to the federal government during the first  six months of last year and another $1.25 million in refunds owed to investors  holding student loans.  </P> <P> "We are not talking about nit-picky things. We are talking about paying your  bills when you are supposed to pay them and making your refunds when you are  supposed to refund them. And we are talking about millions of dollars," said  Samuel Kipp III, executive director of the California Student Aid Commission, a  state agency that administers federal student-loan programs.  </P> <P> But Jon D. Smock, a lawyer for First Independent Trust, said the company's  decision to withdraw from making student loans is not related to the state  action.  </P> <P> He said the trust company disputes the state findings about its operations and  plans to appeal the state's move to ban it from making student loans in the  future. Smock said that as a result of First Independent's decision, about  4,000 students will have to look elsewhere for their loans.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday, the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a private nonprofit  group in Minnesota that guarantees student loans nationwide, said it will stop  guaranteeing student loans made by First Independent Trust. The foundation  guaranteed about 60% of First Independent's student loans, nearly all of them  made to students out of state.  </P> <P> First Independent Trust's action is the latest mess for the  government-guaranteed student-loan market. The problems started when an Encino  company, United Education &amp; Software, failed to properly "service" more  than $1 billion in student loans.  </P> <P> Last year, federal officials reviewed United Education's servicing operation  and found the biggest foul-up ever in the history of the program. It included  failing to send out thousands of letters to delinquent borrowers, sending  letters to wrong addresses and stuffing hundreds of drawers full of documents  waiting to be filed.  </P> <P> Because of those problems, U.S. Department of Education officials have decided  that the government will not pick up the bill when students default on their  loans. That has left on the hook some of the world's biggest banks, most of  them based in Japan, which backed with letters of credit the bonds that were  issued to buy the student loans from various lenders.  </P> <P> Last month, nine of those banks sued Bank of America, trustee for the bonds,  alleging that they have lost more than $350 million in the fiasco and may lose  up to $650 million.  </P> <P> First Independent Trust has been California's largest student-loan lender in  the past three years and among the top five nationwide. As it has grown, the  company has become increasingly controversial.  </P> <P> The company's aggressiveness in making student loans, primarily to vocational  school students who have the highest default rate of any student group, has  made some state and federal student-loan officials increasingly uncomfortable.  </P> <P> One source of controversy has been First Independent Trust's supplying of  computer equipment linking vocational schools with its offices.  </P> <P> The company contends that that was done for convenience, but federal officials  have said they consider it a way of inducing schools to send students for loans  to the trust company and told First Independent to start charging for the  equipment.  </P> <P> State officials said Tuesday that the company has not properly documented that  it is charging for the equipment. However, Smock said this problem has been  resolved.  </P></p>

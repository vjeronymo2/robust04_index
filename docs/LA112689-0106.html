			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A POOR RISK IN NORTH PARK  </P> <P> When the San Diego City Council went against the advice of the city manager and  decided to spend $905,000 in federal community development funds to purchase  the dilapidated North Park Theater, it was betting on a dream of outgoing  Councilwoman Gloria McColl that the theater would revive the somewhat tattered  North Park business district.  </P> <P> But, if her dream does not come true, the council may have purchased a white  elephant.  </P> <P> The theater has major structural problems, which the city manager estimates  will cost $1.4 million to repair. And to turn it from a movie theater into a  marketable playhouse will cost another $2.3 million. What's more, little  private interest has been shown in operating the theater, and the city manager  estimates that the city will be saddled with a continuing annual subsidy of  more than $180,000.  </P> <P> The city has learned how difficult it can be to raise money for theater  renovation with the Balboa Theater downtown, which the city acquired for $2.5  million and which is estimated to need up to $11 million in repairs. A  foundation has been struggling for years to raise that money. So it is  surprising that the city would be willing to take on another theater  renovation.  </P> <P> Perhaps in recognition of the difficulty in raising private money, the plan for  the North Park Theater renovation is to use tax money generated by a proposed  redevelopment district. But $4.6 million -- for purchase and renovation -- is a  lot of public money, especially when the theater community has not rallied  around this project.  </P> <P> The theater may be a landmark in North Park that McColl and community leaders  want to save from demolition. And we often support such preservation efforts.  </P> <P> But this project seems like a greater risk than the old theater merits. The  council should reconsider its decision and look for surer ways to help North  Park.  </P></p>

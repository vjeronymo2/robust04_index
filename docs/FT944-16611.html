			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Multinational companies find success in eurodollar sector Three leading multinational companies - Bayer, SmithKline Beecham and Toyota  -yesterday successfully completed eurodollar issues, while deals by two frequent European borrowers, including the first 20-year peseta-denominated issue, also caught the eye of traders. Toyota Motor Finance (Netherlands), a financing subsidiary of the Japanese motor concern, and Bayer USA, part of the German drugs and chemical group, successfully placed dollar-denominated paper. The three-year Toyota paper, led by CS First Boston, was sold at a fixed re-offer price of 99.75, yielding 20 basis points over the corresponding US Treasury bond, and raising a total of Dollars 200m. The re-offer price on the five-year Bayer paper was 99.479, yielding 42 basis points over Treasuries. Deutsche Bank led the issue which raised Dollars 300m. *something in here (HP) * SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, raised Dollars 200m with three-year paper carrying a coupon of 7 3/8 per cent. The issue was priced at 99.85, but fell to close at 99.70 after the bonds were freed to trade, with the yield spread widening from 37 1/2 basis points to 42 over the US Treasury bond. Lead manager SG Warburg said that the decision by Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, to downgrade the company last month - and the fact that it now has a 'split rating' - had discouraged some investors. SmithKline raised the money as part of its financing programme for a series of recent acquisitions, including the Dollars 1.9bn purchase of Sterling Winthrop. Proceeds were immediately swapped into floating-rate funds and used to refinance bank debt, according to Warburg. Eurofima, the Swiss-based group which funds the purchase of railway rolling stock, raised Pta20bn, passing on the proceeds to Renfe, the Spanish railway operator. The deal followed a Pta20bn floating-rate note by the European Investment Bank last week but was the first matador bond to be issued for some months and the first ever to carry a 20-year maturity. Both its term and 11 per cent coupon appealed to Spanish life assurance companies and pension funds, lead manager Banco Bilbao Vizcaya explained. The European Investment Bank was also back in the markets yesterday, raising L400bn, fungible with a L1,400bn deal launched in June. JP Morgan, together with three Italian banks, led the deal, which was priced at 97.995 with a 10.15 per cent coupon. Morgan said demand was particularly strong in Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as in Italy.</p>

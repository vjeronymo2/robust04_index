			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities Despite yesterday's 32 point rise, the London equity market still looks range-bound. Having dipped sharply at the start of the week in response to the latest Federal Reserve tightening, it recovered at the end as the US bond market rallied. Equities thus still seem tied to the bond markets. With the results reporting season largely over, there is less corporate news to go on. There does not even seem to be a great deal of mileage any more in hoping for a base rate cut. The money markets are discounting a rise in rates later in the year. Without solid evidence that the recovery is faltering, a cut seems unlikely. Even if it happened the market would probably assume that no more reductions were in the offing, which is hardly a recipe for higher share prices. The Fed's action on Monday shows it is not in the business of knee-jerk reactions to individual indicators. But the debate progresses about the extent of the rate rises that will be needed to reach what it calls a neutral stance for policy. Bonds, and therefore equities too, could have some nervous moments next week given the steady flow of US economic indicators, culminating in Thursday's first-quarter GDP report. The encouraging aspect is that with each rise in US rates, the shock to the markets becomes less. Equities might be able to move back into higher territory if bond markets stage a sustained recovery once the US tightening is perceived to be over. The question investors will still have to ask is whether share prices that move in response to bond markets really do reflect fundamental earnings and dividend prospects.</p>

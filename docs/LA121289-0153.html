			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JETS QUARTERBACK O'BRIEN DOUBTFUL FOR RAMS GAME  </P> <P> New York Jets quarterback Ken O'Brien has aggravated his injured throwing  shoulder and is questionable for Sunday's game against the Rams at Anaheim.  </P> <P> O'Brien was supposed to sit out Sunday's 13-0 loss to Pittsburgh, but he  aggravated his shoulder injury when he was forced to play after Pat Ryan was  knocked out of the game with a concussion.  </P> <P> O'Brien's arm was so sore it kept him up most of Sunday night. He won't throw  until Friday, if at all, Coach Joe Walton said Monday.  </P> <P> Ryan, who complained Monday of headaches and a stiff neck following a late hit  from Pittsburgh's Greg Lloyd, is also questionable.  </P> <P> That means Tony Eason, who signed with the Jets on Nov. 7 after being picked up  on waivers from New England, could start.  </P> <P> O'Brien, who has been working on a reduced throwing schedule all season because  of rotator cuff tendinitis, jammed his shoulder against San Diego.  </P></p>

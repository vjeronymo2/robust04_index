			<p>BFN     [Text] The first carload of crude oil produced by the  (Changcheng) Oil Field in Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner was  officially shipped to outside the region recently. This marked  a significant breakthrough in the oil prospecting in the Horqin  Grassland.    Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner, an important resource deposit  in the periphery of Liaohe Oil Field, is located in the  (Zhangqiang) caved-in area in Zhangwu County of Liaoning  Province. Crude oil was first discovered in (Zhandu) sumu of  this banner in 1992. Among the five oil wells already drilled,  four were found to have oil flow or (?oil layers). The first  well put into trial production, the Bai No. 4 Well, produced 24  cubic meters of crude oil a day. Not long ago, the Liaohe Oil  Prospecting Bureau officially named the oil field discovered in  Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner as the (Changcheng) Oil Field.  Further prospecting work is being carried out in 20 sumu,  towns, and townships of the banner.</p>

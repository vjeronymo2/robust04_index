			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD BRIEFS: BARLEY GETS A BOOST AS A CHOLESTEROL FIGHTER  </P> <P> The grain family's cholesterol-fighting ability got another boost last week  with the release of a new study at a chemists' convention.  </P> <P> This time it was barley's turn to demonstrate a tendency to lower elevated  blood cholesterol levels in humans, according to a report presented at the  American Chemical Society's national meeting in Boston.  </P> <P> The author, Rosemary K. Newman of Montana State University, found that "Barley  is right up there with oats as one of the best foods for lowering cholesterol."  </P> <P> The findings emerged from two separate feeding studies conducted by Newman, a  professor in the school's Plant and Soil Science Department. Although the  groups' sample sizes were small, the results are promising.  </P> <P> In the largest study, 22 men and women with elevated cholesterol levels were  chosen. The group was then split into two sections. One set of participants was  served a six-week diet that included three products -- cereal, muffins or flat  bread -- made from oat flour. The other set of subjects were served the same  baked goods, except that the items were prepared with barley flour.  </P> <P> "There was a lowering of cholesterol of up to 14% in both groups with no  appreciable difference between (the two)," Newman reports.  </P> <P> (Oat bran's ability to effectively battle cholesterol was minimized in a recent  study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. However, the journal  report has subsequently been questioned by leading researchers in the  cholesterol field. In a separate development, rice bran has also demonstrated  cholesterol-lowering capabilities.)  </P> <P> The other Newman study demonstrated that baked barley products, when  incorporated into a four-week diet, were more effective in lowering levels of  low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, or that form of the substance considered  harmful, than were baked wheat products.  </P> <P> The author theorizes that an ingredient in barley -- beta-glucans -- works in  conjunction with other soluble fibers to partially prevent the absorption of  dietary fats and cholesterol in the intestine.  </P> <P> Another important component of barley -- tocotrienol -- also works to suppress  cholesterol production in the liver, Newman reported.  </P> <P> "Therefore, we believe that barley has an advantage over all other grains in  controlling cholesterol," she said.  </P> <P> Health Claims Stall -- Whether barley growers and processors will capitalize on  the grain's cholesterol-fighting potential is not as clear as it was just a few  months ago.  </P> <P> Prior to February, food manufacturers rushed to make health claims on product  labels or packaging when any such encouraging research was published. But the  activity has subsided now that the U. S. Food and Drug Administration is close  to adopting new regulations on any health-related statements on product labels  or in advertising, according to an advocacy group's newsletter.  </P> <P> Nutrition Week, a publication of the Washington-based Community Nutrition  Institute, reports that the FDA will intensify enforcement of "inappropriate  health claims" made on food products.  </P> <P> The newsletter reports that breakfast cereals are likely to receive a great  deal of the agency's regulatory attention because of the proliferation of  health claims made in this category.  </P> <P> Kellogg's is believed to have been the first to incorporate health information  on a product package when it stated that a high-fiber diet might reduce the  risk of cancer. The statement appeared on Kellogg's All-Bran cereal, which is  advertised as a high-fiber food.  </P> <P> In announcing the agency's labeling proposal, Health and Human Services  Secretary Louis W. Sullivan virtually acknowledged that things had gotten out  of hand.  </P> <P> "In hindsight, the 1987 proposal has proved to be too permissive," said  Sullivan, whose department includes FDA. "We need an interim policy to serve as  a mid-course correction and provide guidance to industry on what health  messages will and will not be allowed. Only with such a consistent set of  standards can Americans be sure of the meaning of health information on  labels."  </P> <P> The public comment period on the federal proposal recently closed. Final  regulations will be written after the statements are reviewed.  </P> <P> Unlike the present, almost free-wheeling attitude toward label claims, the  FDA's initial proposal greatly narrows the areas where health claims can be  made for foods. Only a limited range of messages on relationships between diet  and health will be allowed. And these areas must be substantiated in recent  research by the U.S. Surgeon General or the National Academy of Sciences.  </P> <P> There are six dietary relationships that the FDA is considering in its  rule-making process. They are: calcium and osteoporosis; sodium and  hypertension; lipids and cardiovascular disease; lipids and cancer; dietary  fiber and cancer, and fiber and cardiovascular disease.  </P> <P> Helping the Endangered -- Even as health claims on food products may be fading,  similar pro-environment messages seem to be taking their place.  </P> <P> One of the more unusual examples of this environmentally sensitive packaging  comes from Hughes Markets. The chain recently announced that it would begin  carrying the pictures of endangered species on its store-brand milk cartons.  </P> <P> The first animal to appear on Hughes half-gallon milk cartons is the California  condor.  </P> <P> The supermarket chain, with 47 outlets, claims to be the first in Southern  California to embark on such a program, which is being coordinated with the  Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. The effort aims to "educate the community on the  threat facing many endangered species such as lions, tigers and elephants."  </P> <P> In the coming year, Hughes will produce as many as three million milk cartons  carrying the pictures of endangered species. The packaging also will include  information on the animals and a telephone number from which to receive more  information on animal conservation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE CHARGES MAYOR OF INGLEWOOD WITH ILLEGAL USE OF FUNDS  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office charged Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent on  Monday with illegally using about $5,000 in campaign funds for personal  expenses during the last two years.  </P> <P> The charge was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and was the first such  action against an elected official under a 1981 law that bars personal use of  campaign funds, according to Eugene Hill, head of the attorney general's  government law division.  </P> <P> The complaint, which caps a four-month state investigation prompted by articles  in The Times, asks that Vincent pay fines totaling about $10,000, twice the  amount allegedly misspent.  </P> <P> Vincent spent the campaign money on travel, clothing, auto repair and a  veterinarian's bill, among other things, the complaint alleges.  </P> <P> Vincent, who could not be reached for comment, has acknowledged improper use of  campaign funds in the past but said it was unintentional and resulted from  sloppy bookkeeping. Hill said that explanation was "not satisfactory."  </P> <P> In other cases in which officeholders have violated the law, the attorney  general's office has been satisfied when the campaign funds were repaid. In  this case, stiffer penalties are being sought because investigators believe  that Vincent systematically and knowingly violated the law, Hill said.  </P> <P> "There did appear to be a pattern of activity that went over several  transactions," Hill said. "It was conduct that was repeated."  </P> <P> Vincent's campaign accountant, David Gould, acknowledged last month that the  expenditures violated the prohibition against using campaign donations for  personal expenses.  </P> <P> Vincent filed a campaign statement last month indicating that he had reimbursed  his campaign fund for some of the expenditures and planned to repay the others.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 30 Days to Respond  </P> <P> Vincent will have 30 days to respond to the charges in the civil complaint,  officials said. He can either admit the charges and pay the fines or deny the  allegations and seek a trial.  </P> <P> The mayor's attorney, Carl Douglas, said Vincent has not yet decided how he  will respond because he hopes to negotiate a settlement with the attorney  general's office before the 30 days has passed.  </P> <P> Such a settlement would probably involve at least partial payment of the fines,  Douglas said. "It has always been the mayor's hope to resolve this matter and  repay any unfair renumeration," he said.  </P> <P> The complaint alleges that Vincent unlawfully spent about $2,900 in campaign  money on city-related trips to Morro Bay, Calif.; Philadelphia; Salt Lake City  and Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Received Reimbursement  </P> <P> Records show that the mayor paid for those trips with campaign funds and  submitted the receipts to the city. By obtaining reimbursement from the city  for trips paid for with campaign funds, Vincent was in effect converting  campaign money to his personal use, investigators said.  </P> <P> Other alleged personal use of campaign money includes $1,078 for repair of his  pickup truck, $374 on clothes, $128 on a veterinarian's bill and $509 in  miscellaneous expenses.  </P> <P> The state Election Code defines personal use of campaign funds as creating "a  substantial personal benefit" and lacking "more than a negligible political,  legislative or governmental purpose."  </P></p>

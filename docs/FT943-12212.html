			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT may form link with Sydney The Chicago Board of Trade and the Sydney Futures Exchange are studying the technical feasibility of joining their after-hours trading systems. The move could be the first step towards a new global futures alliance. The announcement comes a week after the CBoT and the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange agreed to a similar study to find an alternative to Globex, the electronic trading system developed by Reuters. By linking with the Australian exchange, the CBoT would gain a clear foothold for its after hours system - known as Project A - in the Asian time zone. Any link would be at least a 12 months in development, the exchanges said. The after-hours trading strength of the Sydney Futures Exchange lies in its government bond futures and options contract. Globex, which currently consists of an alliance between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Matif of France and the DTB of Germany, specialises chiefly in short-term interest rate and foreign currency contracts. The CME has a mutual offset link with Singapore International Monetary Exchange, but Globex itself lacks an exchange partner in the Asian region. The Sydney-Chicago exploratory study is widely seen as another indication that the concept of linking existing proprietary trading systems is more appealing than the co-management of a single system, which is the way Globex is structured. Under the broad outlines of the CBoT-Liffe plan, the CBoT would retain its existing trading technology as well as control of trading and clearing functions for its own contracts. The growing number of strategic alliances between futures exchanges has raised the stakes for futures exchanges around the world. However, both Liffe and the CBoT have a number of failed trading agreements behind them.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican refinery strike lifts zinc price ZINC PRICES broke through the psychologically-important Dollars 1,200 a tonne level on the London Metal Exchange yesterday after Grupo Minera Mexico said its zinc refinery had declared force majeure on deliveries because of a strike which started on Monday. The refinery, in central Mexico, was scheduled to produce 96,000 tonnes of zinc this year. This is the second zinc refinery in two weeks to be declared force majeure. Minero Peru's Cajamarquilla smelter (93,000 tonnes a year) is suffering from power supply problems because of a drought. Traders suggested, however, it was delivering as much as 95 per cent of ordered metal. Market sentiment was also affected by news that a strike had started at Asarco's New Market zinc mine in Tennessee which produced about 29,000 tonnes of the metal in concentrates last year. This represented roughly one quarter of Asarco's total zinc output. The lead market remained steady after Metaleurop said its Spanish subsidiary, Penarroya, would file a petition for a suspension of payments. This would almost certainly result in closure of Penarroya's 90,000-tonnes-a-year Santa Lucia primary lead smelter.</p>

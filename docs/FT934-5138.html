			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Local government a big loser - Public spending The moves to reduce the fiscal deficit shift a larger proportion of Britain's public spending towards social security, health and education and away from local government, transport, defence and public housing. The biggest loser in the announcement of spending plans for the next three years is spending by central government departments on local government, which has been cut by Pounds 860m in 1994-95 compared with the plans set out in the March Budget. In 1994-95 spending by the chancellor's departments - including the Treasury and the Central Statistical Office - has been shaved by Pounds 130m to Pounds 3.43bn. This is part of the general drive to cut spending throughout the civil service by low growth in wage costs and greater efficiency. Relative winners have been central government spending on education and health which have been boosted by Pounds 390m and Pounds 480m respectively in 1994-95 compared with plans set out in March. The new totals for these departments are Pounds 10.49bn and Pounds 31.73bn. Defence spending has been reduced by Pounds 260m in 1994-95,while transport has been cut by Pounds 210m with the roads programme a particular casualty. Spending by the Department of the Environment on housing has been cut by Pounds 250m. In 1994-95, social security departmental spending has been increased by Pounds 1.55bn compared with the total agreed in March, mainly due to higher pensions and payments to poorer people hit by the imposition of VAT on fuel. The new totals for central government spending on defence, transport and housing in 1994-95 work out at Pounds 23.49bn, Pounds 5.85bn and Pounds 7.43bn. Social security spending - easily the biggest share of the total - comes out at Pounds 68.8bn The new figures are part of the public spending control total which in 1994-95 has been set at Pounds 251.3bn. Allowing for a classification change linked to altered national accounting treatment of the fossil fuel levy, the 1994-95 figure is Pounds 3.6bn less than that set out in the March Budget. Another way the Treasury has cut back spending is to have reduced the unallocated reserve which is part of the 1994-95 control total from the Pounds 7bn figure in the March Budget to Pounds 3.5bn. Rather than spread the Pounds 3.5bn removed from reserve among spending programmes - which has been the Treasury practice in comparable Budgets in recent years - the department has taken the money out of public spending altogether.</p>

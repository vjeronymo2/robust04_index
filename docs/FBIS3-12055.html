			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Given this past weekend's severe outages, the  Electric Union advises that efforts to repair breakdowns at  several power plants had already solved some problems by Sunday  evening. Breakdowns in the generating units of the Talla Piedra  and Regla power plants in Havana City, the East Havana power  plant in Santa Cruz del Norte, as well as the Maximo [words  indistinct] fuel supply to the Diez de Octubre Power Plant in  Camaguey caused the elevated deficits that affected the early  morning hours of Saturday and Sunday. The Electric Union told us  they will return to the regular schedule in each province once  the generating level has been recovered.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BIRMINGHAM STOPS SYLMAR IN MARATHON  </P> <P> Shadows crept across Ramirez Field at Birmingham High on Friday as afternoon  turned to early evening, and early evening turned to dusk.  </P> <P> And still the teams played. Birmingham and Sylmar waged a war of wills in a  first-round City Section 4-A Division playoff game that spanned nine innings  and more than 4 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Finally, Birmingham third baseman Ruben Flores, with no out and the bases  loaded in the bottom of the ninth, unexpectedly dropped a squeeze bunt on an  0-2 pitch from sophomore Jimmy Lemos (2-1). As the ball rolled to the right of  the mound, Bob Bookatz scored from third base to record the game's 27th and  final run and give the Braves a 14-13 win.  </P> <P> "I'm elated," Birmingham Coach Wayne Sink said, dripping wet from an impromptu  ice-water shower, courtesy of his players. "What can I say?"  </P> <P> He was elated because his team came back from a 12-5, fifth-inning deficit with  three runs in the fifth and five in the sixth. Elated because junior Noah  Kirshbaum (3-0), in only his third pitching appearance of the year, held  Sylmar's big bats to six hits and two runs in 6 2/3 innings of relief.  </P> <P> And elated because Birmingham's season -- at 19-6-1 the best in Sink's 13-year  tenure -- will continue Wednesday in the quarterfinals at El Camino Real, which  defeated North Hollywood on Friday, 6-1.  </P> <P> "I'm numb," Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella said. "I'm drained."  </P> <P> Drained because his players had come back from a 4-0 deficit with a nine-run  second, only to lose. Drained because Sylmar (16-10), trailing, 13-12, in the  seventh inning, tied the score on a bases-loaded walk to James Encinas that  forced extra innings, only to lose.  </P> <P> "But that's the playoffs," Donatella said. "Kids rise to the occasion."  </P> <P> Kirshbaum bailed himself out in the seventh, shutting down Sylmar after he  walked in the tying run with the bases full.  </P> <P> "I was freaked," Kirshbaum admitted. "I was scared, obviously."  </P> <P> Earlier in the inning, he induced Dereck Ornelas (three hits, three runs) into  a force out with none out and runners at first and second.  </P> <P> After London Woodfin singled to load the bases, Kirshbaum walked Encinas to tie  the score but then retired Ben Soliz and Pat Garcia on weak grounders to end  the threat.  </P> <P> Flores led Birmingham with a game-high four runs batted in, and Bookatz, who  scored the winning run after he tripled to lead off the ninth, had three hits  and scored three runs. Danny Larson had two hits and three runs, and Mike  Malkin added two hits.  </P> <P> Woodfin had three hits and three RBIs to lead Sylmar.  </P></p>

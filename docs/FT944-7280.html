			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping angina off the beat A potential advance in the understanding and treatment of artery narrowing has been announced by researchers funded by the British Heart Foundation. Angina, the chest pains caused by an inadequate supply of blood to the heart, is usually successfully treated by angioplasty, a procedure which widens narrowed arteries. But a third of patients suffer complications in the form of renewed narrowing of the arteries or, more rarely, from the formation of blood clots. Research carried out by King's College School of Medicine in London, which is due to be published in tomorrow's Lancet, found that a blood-clotting mechanism is activated during angioplasty. Arterial narrowing appears to stem from the excessive activity of growth factors contained in white blood cells called platelets. The researchers found that the platelet activity was inhibited in a small group of patients who received an infusion of a nitrate medicine called S-nitroso-glutathione GSNO before the angioplasty. It is thought to cause nitric oxide to be released by the platelets, which acts as a brake on their activity. Further work will now be undertaken.

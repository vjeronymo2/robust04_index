			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton and China IN WASHINGTON this month, the annual dance between president and Congress is under way. What conditions will Mr Clinton attach to China's most-favoured nation trading status? Will they be enough for Congress? This domestic, repetitive argument hardly seems a sound basis for formulating the policy of the largest economic power towards a country that may aspire to that position, some think by the end of the decade. China has changed. It is still governed by a repressive, totalitarian regime which showed in 1989 that it was determined to retain power at all costs. But its growth is quickly making it an economic and a regional power. Western and Asian countries, which are pouring investment into it, already have a big economic stake. Only yesterday, Singapore agreed to develop a Dollars 20bn town in China modelled upon itself. Western companies know that if they do not invest and trade with China, they risk locking themselves out of the world's most profitable and dynamic region and so endangering growth and jobs in the west. Policy towards China needs to take these economic factors into account. The need is for greater subtlety rather than an annual, self-satisfying decision on how much to bash China over human rights. Since a Russian-style end to Communist party rule seems unlikely, greater freedom is likely to come slowly, whatever the west does. That the transition takes place in reasonable stability is in everybody's interest, given the dangers implicit in political turmoil in a country of 1.2bn people. Economic reforms, under way for 14 years, offer the best hope of a more pluralistic society. Nannyish conditions The freedom to make economic choices should lead in time to greater freedom of expression and a general desire for greater political choice. The thousands of contacts between foreign and Chinese business people are the most important means of opening China to a wider range of ideas. For the US to seek to stifle such relationships by attaching nannyish conditions to MFN would be clumsy and counter-productive. It would hit precisely those who are likely to change China for the better, and would probably be ineffective in putting pressure on its leaders. Mr Clinton has an opportunity to forge a new policy. He has so far been cautious, pointing out the large US contribution to the revitalisation of the Chinese economy, and asserting the right of the US to expect progress on human rights and democracy. His officials say he will impose as yet unspecified conditions on China's MFN status in June. They say that with China no longer the balancing factor between two superpowers, the US can afford to be less reticent on issues such as human rights. Bouts of hectoring In setting out his line, Mr Clinton should ensure that he is indeed seen to have a China policy. A clearly enunciated, firm approach, sensitive to congressional and business concerns, should render unnecessary the annual MFN squabble. This should include a clear statement of the US interest in a growing, stable China. Mr Clinton, mindful of the China's Dollars 18bn trade surplus with the US last year, should make clear that trade must be on a level playing field. The US presidency has unique leverage with Beijing, and should engage in firm but private dialogue on human rights, arms sales and China's participation in world affairs as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. This is the way to ensure that the US builds on its central role in east Asian affairs, with a strong part in maintaining regional security. Since the immediate discussion seems bound to end with the attachment of new conditions to MFN, it is to be hoped that they will be phrased in general terms. This does not preclude the separate application of pressure on specific human rights issues such as prison labour, political detainees and the rights of Tibetans. Experience shows that pressure on particular issues produces small but significant dividends. But the most important point is that in pursuing this crucial strategic relationship, the US needs to strike a strategic tempo, rather than indulging in annual bouts of hectoring.</p>

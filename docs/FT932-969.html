			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: TSB emphasises return to core - Interest income hit by customers' move to higher interest accounts THE TSB GROUP'S half year results yesterday showed the efforts it is making to concentrate on what it regards as its core business of selling banking services and savings and insurance products to personal customers. This involves trying to manage down or sell other businesses such as its Hill Samuel merchant banking arm, and re-shaping its 'bancassurance' business which combines its retail banking and insurance sales operations. The re-shaping of this business involves significant short-term costs including staff redundancies, and a controversial push to transfer customers' savings into higher interest-bearing accounts in order to keep them. Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, emphasised that TSB was now 'sticking to the knitting' after three years of sustaining large bad debts on peripheral businesses. It was trying to drive down costs, while selling more retail products. Trading profits for retail banking and insurance operations rose to Pounds 206m (Pounds 192m) before restructuring costs of Pounds 37m involving a 900 cut in staff. Operating costs fell by Pounds 4m to Pounds 367m as staff costs fell by Pounds 13m. Overall headcount fell from 37,317 to 33,568 over the 12 months to April and the company expects to continue reducing staff at a lower rate. Interest income was depressed by the continuing policy of advising customers to move from old savings accounts which do not pay rates of interest competitive with Halifax Building Society, which it regards as its main competitor. Net interest income fell 5 per cent from Pounds 422m to Pounds 399m as low interest deposits fell. They have been reduced from Pounds 5.4bn in 1990 to Pounds 2bn in April, while high interest accounts have grown from Pounds 1.8bn to Pounds 6.2bn in the same period. Mr Ellwood said that the strategy, which will continue to depress net interest income over the next 18 to 24 months, would be repaid by the bank being able to retain customers and being able to sell them other products such as insurance. Non-interest income from banking rose only slightly to Pounds 158m (Pounds 152m), while insurance income rose to Pounds 183m (Pounds 153m) helped by general insurance sales. In common with other banks, TSB also achieved a large rise in mortgage sales through its branch network. Mortgages balances rose by 21 per cent to Pounds 5.2bn (Pounds 4.3bn), the majority of the rise coming from fixed rate mortgages. Mr Ellwood indicated yesterday that TSB would try to reinforce such 'cross-selling' of products to its banking customers in future if it re-introduced charges on current accounts in credit, as most banks are now considering. He said that TSB had no immediate plans to introduce such charges. However, only 15 per cent of its 4.5m customers now incurred charges, and such cross-subsidisation among accounts was inherently unsustainable beyond two or three years. He added that TSB would try to reflect relationships in any charging structure. This is likely to mean that charges may be waived for customers who hold other savings products or mortgages with the bank as well as a current account. Retail group profits advanced by 8 per cent before provisions for bad and doubtful debts and insurance claims to Pounds 322m (Pounds 298m), but there was a Pounds 12m rise in provisions to Pounds 72m (Pounds 60m) as the recovery remained modest. Provisions for branch mortgages remained low at 0.1 per cent of balances, Pounds 3m against the Pounds 5.2bn book. But provisions against other forms of personal lending rose to Pounds 44m (Pounds 35m), or 2 per cent of balances, against 1.5 per cent.</p>

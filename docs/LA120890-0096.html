			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GEAR GIVES BBDO MUCH OF ITS TV AD WORK;  </P> <P> MARKETING: THE SNEAKER MAKER, WHICH HAD BEEN HANDLING CREATIVE CHORES ITSELF,  WANTS A CHANGE OF IMAGE.  </P> <P> L.A. Gear, eager to establish an advertised image that pleases both sneaker  buyers and Wall Street investors, handed much of its television ad business to  the Los Angeles office of the agency BBDO Worldwide.  </P> <P> Executives of L.A. Gear and the agency declined to reveal the specifics of the  agreement. But industry executives estimate that BBDO could initially pick up  about $15 million in annual billings, with the potential for much more.  </P> <P> "Between their team and ours, we can rewrite the rules," said Michael Albright,  creative director at L.A. Gear. He said L.A. Gear selected BBDO because  "they're an international presence and showed us very strong creative work."  </P> <P> Executives from BBDO declined to comment, referring all calls to L.A. Gear.  </P> <P> Until now, the nation's No. 3 sneaker maker -- which has been struggling with  soft sales and disappointing earnings -- has created its own ads. That includes  the slogan "Unstoppable," which executives say will be scrapped. L.A. Gear will  at least temporarily continue to create print advertisements.  </P> <P> Another firm, New York-based Vitt Media, will continue to place L.A. Gear's  broadcast and print ads. Overall, L.A. Gear spends more than $60 million  annually to create and place advertising.  </P> <P> For BBDO, which also creates ads for Apple Computer, the win represents an  opportunity to create high-profile spots for another client. L.A. Gear's need  for a strong advertised image has never been greater. Said one L.A. Gear  official who asked not to be named, "We have to out-Nike Nike."  </P> <P> Industry analysts say the agency selection is a good one. "TV advertising and  promotion is becoming increasingly important in the footwear industry," said  Gary M. Jacobson, analyst at the New York investment firm Kidder, Peabody &amp;  Co. "This can only help them."  </P> <P> L.A. Gear stock jumped $1.50 Friday to $15.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.  The agency selection, however, had not been publicly announced.  </P> <P> Some BBDO spots could be airing in less than a month. The agency's most  pressing mission will be to create an ad for LA Gear's new high-tech line of  basketball performance shoes, "Catapult," to air during the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> The agency review set off a flurry of inquiries in late October by dozens of  West Coast agencies. BBDO was one of four finalists.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most surprising agency to make the cut was the year-old San  Francisco creative boutique, Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre. "We were  the long-shot new kids on the block," said Chairman Jeff Atlas.  </P></p>

This means that he disagrees with Austrian Chancellor  Franz Vranitzky, who in a DIE PRESSE interview rejected  Austria's participation in such partnership. Commenting on the  statements of the head of government and chairman of the Social  Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], Busek said: "This is not  the government's opinion!"    The OeVP chairman said: "We welcome this initiative.  Undoubtedly, there is no alternative to it." Busek said that  all the other [heads of] neutral European states "except for  Vranitzky" have welcomed the initiative.  <H3>  Austrian Trade Union Federation Recommendation on the  European Union </H3>   Austrian Trade Union Federation [OeGB] President  Verzetnitsch  announced a separate OeGB recommendation for a referendum on  European Union (EU) membership. This recommendation will be  discussed at a conference at the end of the membership  negotiations.    Representatives of the two government parties on 17 January  demonstrated cautious optimism that the membership negotiations  would be completed by March. SPOe floor leader Fuhrmann  considers a date in March "not totally unrealistic." OeVP  Secretary General Molterer believes the odds in favor are "more  than 50 percent."</p>

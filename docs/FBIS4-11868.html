			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian Ambassador in Amman al-Tayyib  'Abd-al-Rahim has voiced appreciation for the Jordanian  Government's position under Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali in support of the PLO as well as the Government's  policy aimed to protect the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories and establish a just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    In a statement to the Jordanian news agency commenting on  the  remarks made by Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for  cabinet affairs and information minister, on the recent  agreement reached in Cairo, 'Abd-al-Rahim said the Jordanian  Government's call for Palestinian national unity and its support  for the PLO, which is on the threshold of a new phase, emanate  from a genuine pan-Arab position and show sound political  foresight.    He added that the PLO is very eager to coordinate with  Jordan  now and in the future in view of the common interests and the  one future for both fraternal peoples. He said: Jordan, under  His Majesty King Husayn and his wise government, is maintaining  a pan-Arab position. We believe this position should be  championed because it supports the Palestinian people's struggle  to establish an independent entity on their national soil, he  added.</p>

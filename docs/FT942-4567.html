			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / P&amp;O to withdraw Chinese workers P&amp;O European Ferries bowed to pressure from French seafaring unions yesterday and agreed to withdraw 58 Chinese cleaners from its two most recently chartered ferries. The French unions disrupted dockings at Cherbourg last week and spread the action yesterday to Calais, although P&amp;O had already said it would dispense with the Chinese workers. The government yesterday asked the French government to intervene in the dispute after French workers blocked the departure of a P&amp;O ferry from Calais, disrupting sailings for several hours. The dispute arose when the French seafarers complained that employment of the Chinese could drive down pay for other nationalities. However, P&amp;O suggested yesterday that the action had been a smokescreen for wider fears about French ferry jobs. The two ships in which the Chinese were employed were previously run by the German Olau line.</p>

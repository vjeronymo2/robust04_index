			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Discount for US patients on SB ulcer drug SmithKline Beecham is to offer Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.60) rebates to some US patients buying Tagamet, its once best-selling ulcer drug which loses patent protection in the US today. The move is the latest in a series of measures SB has taken in the past 10 days to defend Tagamet from the onslaught of generic competition. The rebate is available to patients without health insurance, notably those on the US government run Medicare which provides health cover for the elderly. The full price of a one-month course of Tagamet is Dollars 83. That compares with Dollars 93 for a month's supply of Zantac, made by the UK's Glaxo, and Dollars 86 for US company Merck's Pepcid, said SB. SB's discounted price is likely to be heavily undercut from tomorrow. Three companies have signalled their intention to sell the generic drug, cimetidine, as soon as the patent expires. They are Novopharm, the Canadian company, Mylan of the US, and Endo Laboratories, a partnership between Du Pont, the US chemicals giant, and Merck. SB has said that up to 10 generics companies may eventually join the fray. Novopharm has said it expects the generic price to be 30 to 50 per cent below that of the branded drug. Recent cases of other big selling drugs running out of patent protection suggest that an 80 per cent discount within 12 months is likely. As well as patient discounts, SB intends to maintain tight control of remaining intellectual property rights over Tagamet. Novopharm and Mylan were last week the subject of law suits alleging infringement of patent and trademark laws. The cases revolved around the similar appearance of the generic versions and branded Tagamet. Novopharm quickly settled out of court to make its cimetidine tablets in a darker green than Tagamet tablets. SB also decided last week to launch its own generic version of Tagamet in competition with the three other suppliers. It will sell them to hospital chains and managed healthcare organisations that look after the healthcare obligations of large employers. It also engaged Lederle, part of American Cyanamid, to sell the generic to pharmacies. SB plans eventually to sell Tagamet without a prescription over-the-counter. The OTC version has already been launched in the UK and the company said that it remained 'in active discussions' with Washington's Food and Drug Administration. 'There will be more of these measures as SB engages in this damage limitation exercise,' said Mr Nigel Barnes, analyst at Hoare Govett. 'SmithKline knows that it is facing a tide of generics.'</p>

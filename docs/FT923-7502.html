			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): A longer life-line - Japanese small companies are coping with hard times but whether they can continue to do so remains questionable When the Japanese economy sneezes, it is its small businesses that catch cold. During previous economic downturns, small companies served as shock absorbers to ease their big business customers over economic bumps. In their role as subcontractors, small industrial concerns were often forced by their big clients to cut profit margins for the components they supplied. But small companies are now more successful in resisting profit squeezes and weathering hard times. Although the number of bankruptcies has doubled among small and medium-sized businesses since the height of the economic boom two years ago, it is no worse than in 1987, when the economy suffered from the yen's sharp appreciation. In addition, the percentage of bankruptcies among industrial companies has fallen, while that for finance companies and small retail outlets has grown. One main reason for their survival, according to Tsuyoshi Nakai, director for research of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, is that many small manufacturing companies built up large capital reserves during the economic boom of the late 1980s. They also avoided investments in overvalued land and securities, and used their earnings instead to acquire capital assets such as machinery. 'The good liquidity situation means that most small and medium businesses can survive for another year or two before encountering severe difficulties,' said Nakai. One good sign is that the profitability of small concerns, measured by the ratio of earnings to sales, is not much different from the country's big companies. Companies that have gone bankrupt have tended to be ones which over-invested in production technology in the belief that the economy would keep expanding rapidly. The small business sector has benefited from a gradual restructuring. About half of the small companies work as subcontractors to bigger concerns, but they are reducing their dependence on a single company. 'The keiretsu relationship is gradually disappearing as small companies develop niche products that they can sell to several customers,' said Nakai. 'We are shifting from a pyramid structure, with one company dominating thousands of suppliers, to a network system that is more egalitarian.' This has enabled small companies to assert themselves and refuse to accept price cuts. Those with advanced products have a better bargaining position than ones that turn out basic components. The Arakawa district in Tokyo, for example, is home to more than 8,000 closely-packed family-owned workshops, with most employing fewer than 20 people. Almost all are subcontractors producing components for the car industry as well as parts for bicycles, furniture and electrical appliances. The downturn in the motor industry has particularly hurt the district, with a 60 per cent drop in orders from a peak period in the early 1980s. 'Although demand is shrinking, companies are reluctant to reduce prices because of the need to pay back loans and maintain wages,' said Mashiro Kitagawa, deputy director of the Arakawa branch of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce. 'Instead, they are reducing their workforce, with some companies now only relying on family members.' The fall in land prices has had a beneficial effect on companies operating in central Tokyo. 'The high rents that drove some companies out of the district are coming down. This is easing the financial pressure on businesses here,' Kitagawa adds. But concerns remain about the long-term future of small businesses. It is difficult for small concerns to get bank loans, and their ability to attract labour will become more difficult as the economy improves. 'Many of the family owners are even finding it tough to persuade their children to carry on the business,' explains Atsushi Yamauchi, the project manager for the Arakawa Chamber of Commerce. These problems are not limited to Arakawa; they threaten the future of Japanese small businesses. The need for Japanese banks to improve their capital adequacy ratios could curb loans to small businesses. Even small concerns that have used their own land as collateral may find it difficult to secure new loans if land prices fall drastically. 'The tightening of credit to small businesses will damage their efforts to develop new technologies, attract skilled workers such as engineers, and introduce automation to replace workers,' said Nakai. Moreover, automation may not be a practicable solution for companies too small to use it effectively. Instead, they will need to attract workers in a country suffering a serious labour shortage. Finding new workers is likely to prove a formidable task. Wages are lower and working hours longer at small companies. They are also associated with 3-D ('dirty, difficult and dangerous') jobs that most young Japanese now shun. The government is encouraging small companies to improve their image by reducing working hours, but most concerns are reluctant to do so because this will increase costs. Instead, they are pressing the government to increase the number of cheaper foreign labourers allowed into Japan. Small companies are already among the main employers of illegal workers - mainly from the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. All this is discouraging the creation of new small companies. The proportion of new businesses has fallen to 4 per cent of the total number of companies, compared with 6 per cent 10 years ago. The ratio is lower for manufacturing concerns - at 3 per cent. Nakai believes that, if steps are taken, there could be a resurgence of small businesses. Local governments should promote small businesses which would serve as the focal point for regional development, with each area specialising in a few industries. Small businesses could also co-operate in such activities as distribution and marketing, in order to reduce costs and increase their efficiency. Finally, they could seek foreign investment.</p>

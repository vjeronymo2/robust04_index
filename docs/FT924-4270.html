			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Matrix precedents withheld from MPs SIR NICHOLAS Lyell, the attorney-general, last night declined to disclose the legal precedents he considered in preparing his advice for ministers to sign public-interest immunity certificates in relation to the Matrix Churchill case. Replying to Mr Mike O'Brien, Labour MP for Warwickshire North, in a parliamentary written answer, Sir Nicholas said he had already told the House of his 'legal advice on public-interest immunity'. The question of precedents prompted angry clashes between Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Downing Street about three weeks ago, with the government citing judicial rulings from 1846. Sir Nicholas informed the Commons last month that when publication of official documents was against the public interest ministers had to ask the courts for their publication to be prevented. Meanwhile, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has disclosed further details of the briefing material supplied to him in preparation for his meeting with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, in late September 1989 when he was foreign secretary. Responding to a question from Mr Tam Dalyell, the veteran Labour MP, he said his brief 'referred to British media interest in Iraqi procurement activities in the United Kingdom, naming Learfan and Matrix Churchill as examples'. The meeting coincided with a burst of media interest in Iraqi procurement activities after the exposure of the unauthorised disbursement of Iraqi export credits by an Italian bank. In further replies to written questions yesterday, Mr Major declined to consent to all government documents made available to the Scott inquiry being passed on to comparable investigations launched by the US Congress, and revealed that ministers had signed a total of 15 public-interest immunity certificates since June. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, turned down a request from Mr Dalyell to make available to MPs a letter 'dated 20 June 1990 from his predecessor's principal private secretary to the private secretary to the chairman of the Commissioners for HM Customs and Excise'. The letter was 'one of the documents disclosed to the defence for use in connection with the Matrix-Churchill trial,' Mr Heseltine said.</p>

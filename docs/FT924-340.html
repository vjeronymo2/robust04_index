			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Shoppers flock to busiest winter sales for years: Traffic brings city centres to standstill - Large household items selling strongly CUSTOMERS streamed into the shops yesterday to hunt for bargains in one of the most hectic starts to the winter sales season for years. The AA said several city centres ground to a halt because of the weight of traffic. There was a six-mile tailback on the M25 London orbital ring road as drivers queued to go to the Lakeside shopping centre in Essex. More than 150,000 shoppers turned up at the Meadowhall shopping centre near Sheffield. A similar number thronged the MetroCentre in Gateshead. There was a six-mile queue in both directions on the M1 near Sheffield, and a five-mile tailback on the northbound A1 at Gateshead. In London, Oxford Street was at a standstill because of illegally parked cars. Mr Tim Daniels, chairman of the Oxford Street Association, said yesterday was 'the best start to the winter sales for many years'. Traffic came to a stop as car parks overflowed in Southampton, Oxford, Cardiff, Swansea, Leeds, Birmingham and Glasgow. Heavier household goods, such as washing machines, carpets and furnishings appeared to be selling especially well. In Liberty's flagship Regent Street store, four carpets reduced to Pounds 2,400 were sold in the first 40 minutes. A large number of shoppers from the Continent took advantage of the pound's relative weakness. Mr Daniels, who is managing director of Selfridges, said staff at the Oxford Street department store had to switch off some escalators to control the crowds: 'I have been here 12 years and I have never seen it like this before.' Selfridges reported particularly good sales of carpets and furnishings. 'In view of the housing market slump we were rather surprised that all of a sudden there has been such a surge,' Mr Daniels said. Mr Tony Salem, managing director of Liberty's, said: 'It looks as though this year's sale really will be a record.' Overall, Liberty's estimated sales were running about 10 per cent ahead of the previous year, he said. House of Fraser, with 62 stores in England, Scotland and Wales, said business had been 'exceedingly good', with sales of up to 40 per cent more than last year. The crucial question for retailers and the government will be whether the strong sales signify the start of a real economic upturn or simply reflect increasing consumer sophistication. The strength of consumer demand will be an important factor in the shape of the March Budget which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will discuss with senior Treasury officials on January 8 and 9. The Treasury has recently drawn comfort from retail sales figures. They have been one of the better performing economic indicators, rising 0.7 per cent in volume after seasonal adjustment in the three months from September-November compared with June-August. Just before Christmas, news of a 29 per cent jump in new car sales in the first 20 days of December was a further pointer to a recovery in demand. There are hopes that consumer confidence will strengthen further because of falling mortgage rates. The cut in bank base rates to 7 per cent from 10 per cent since September will have its full impact in the first four months of next year when those building societies and banks which adjust mortgage rates annually change their lending rates.

Simple Toxics Emissions Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 211(k)(3), EPA must at a minimum require the more stringent of either a specified formula fuel or a 15 percent reduction in toxics emissions from that of baseline gasoline. All five of the toxic air pollutants that section 211(k)(10) of the Act specifies for control through reformulated gasoline (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, polycyclic organic matter (POM), formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde) also fall under the category of VOCs. Exhaust emissions include unburned benzene and benzene formed from other aromatics during the combustion process. Benzene, an aromatic compound, is a natural component of gasoline and, as such, is present in evaporative, running loss and refueling emissions (nonexhaust emissions). However, nonexhaust VOC and benzene emissions data are only available in sufficient quantities under high ozone test conditions. Therefore, nonexhaust benzene emissions are not considered outside of the high ozone season. The four other toxic air pollutants subject to control by reformulated gasoline are not present in gasoline and hence are solely products of combustion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The equations that represent the simple model for air toxics emissions are shown in section 80.42 of the regulations. The derivation and referenced work is given in the regulatory impact analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Only minor changes were made to the proposed simple toxics model. One change excluded ethane from the exhaust VOC baseline emissions as discussed below in Section III.D.3. The weight fractions of the various toxics as a function of VOC have also been adjusted accordingly, resulting in no net change in predicted toxics performance for a particular fuel. At the request of commenters, EPA has also included the oxygenates tertiary amyl methal ether (TAME) and ethyl tertiary amyl ether (ETAE) as well as provisions for other oxygenates and mixed oxygenates. Due to their similar chemical makeup, methyl ethers (such as TAME) and ethyl ethers (such as ETAE) are to be modeled using the same equations as for MTBE and as for ETBE, respectively. Higher alcohols will be modeled using the same equations as for ethanol. Higher ethers will be modeled as ETBE for all air toxics, since ETBE was the highest ether for which toxics data were available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Baseline Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where the performance standard is more stringent than the formula, the Act requires EPA to promulgate standards for the performance of reformulated gasoline that are relative to emission levels from baseline vehicles using baseline fuel. In order to determine whether fuels meet the performance requirements of reformulated gasoline under the simple model, EPA must therefore establish the baseline to which the emission performance of reformulated fuels are to be compared. The following discussion describes how EPA derived the emission baselines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Control Periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the emission baselines can be determined, the time frame over which fuel performance will be evaluated must be identified. Section 211(k) of the Act requires control of VOC emissions during the ``high ozone season.'' For the purposes of this rulemaking, the high ozone season is defined to be June 1 through September 15. This period covers the vast majority of days during which the national ambient air quality standard for ozone is exceeded nationwide and is consistent with the period covered by EPA's gasoline volatility control requirements. All gasoline at service stations must thus comply with the reformulated gasoline requirements during this period. Also in keeping with the gasoline volatility control rulemaking the ``VOC control Period'' for compliance with the reformulated gasoline provisions upstream from the service station (necessary to ensure complying fuel is available at the service stations during the high ozone season) is May 1 through September 15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

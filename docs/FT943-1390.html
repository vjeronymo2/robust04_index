			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Joseph Holt pulls ahead 5% to Pounds 4m Joseph Holt, the Manchester-based brewer famed for some of the least expensive real ale brewed in the UK, lifted pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 3.82m to Pounds 3.99m in the six months to June 30. The shares declined 75p to Pounds 36.75. Mr Richard Kershaw, joint managing director, said the 'very conservative' company was 'not over excited' about the outcome - struck on flat turnover at Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 13.6m) - but said the Manchester market had been difficult in the last year. He suggested the area had entered the recession later and would emerge later, adding that high unemployment levels would continue to hamper trading growth. He said that there had been some improvement in the hotter months of July and August. The company sells a pint of bitter for 96p and mild for 90p. Mr Kershaw said there had been a 1p increase in retail prices though none in wholesale. He explained that Holt managed to sell beer so inexpensively because it had large managed houses - 96 of the total 108-strong estate - within a 20-mile radius of Manchester and that it did no advertising. It planned to open one or two new pubs a year and had recently built its first new pub in the centre of the city for 20 years. Earnings per share grew to 87.8p (84.58p) and the interim dividend is raised to 12p (11p).</p>

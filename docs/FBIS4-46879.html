			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khosrov Arutyunyan and Yuriy Grigoryan: "Is </F> Collapse Being Programmed?"]    [Text] Two opposite structures of the economy may  quite definitely be distinguished: the state structure, with its  centralized production and distribution system, and the  decentralized structure, where relationships are formed "at the  bottom" by the originally market, spontaneous path. There is no  doubt that the self-organized society is more progressive than  the artificially structured one. But the industrial potential  that took shape in past decades rejects market spontaneity, and  the transition process has been conditioned by contradictory  trends. Nonetheless, we have yet to see the harmonious  combination of these extreme forms in a single government  program. The dominant idea is the market, and merely when it  reduces to crisis a sector that has succumbed to reform are  backward steps taken in order to stabilize if only the low level  of the economy, as was the case with industry in 1993, but  subsequently the same type of alterations with, it has to be  assumed, a new spiraling of collapse are programmed. That is, as  long as a choice between different directions is possible, the  leadership of the republic will opt for a path at the end of  which we will find ourselves in an extraordinarily difficult  situation with just one, nondiscretional, way out. And the  forced measures are, as a rule, the former rejected methods of  management, in their worst version, what is more. Swings between  two polar-opposite approaches were clearly manifested, for  example, in the program of socioeconomic development for the  present year that has been drawn up by the government. Let us  take the measures to stabilize prices and increase the  well-being of society. As was to have been expected, control and  prohibitory methods are prevalent here: government price  control, a ban on the sale of foreign currency, a fuel price  fork, restrictions of currency exchange, and so forth. But  prohibitory campaigns even in the times of the command economy  amounted in the initial demonstration period more often than not  to selective repressive measures and, on the whole, merely  engendered new problems. The method most beloved of our  government is, it would seem, being taken from the arsenal of  the state's regulatory influence on the market: commodity and  dram intervention. With a well-computed quantity and precisely  chosen time and place it does, possibly, have the desired  effect. But if the measures are adopted inopportunely? Several  attempts by the government to knock down prices in the market  were condemned to fail from the very outset since, first, the  action was mounted when the high prices had already taken hold;  second, and this is particularly important, the quantity of the  commodity that was poured out was so small as to have been  unable to have had any powerful impact. The market did not even  notice the flea-bite, but some people made out pretty well. More  sober-minded people proposed simply selling the available stocks  to the needy, and they were right. One-time interventions of a  commodity, as of currency also, make sense as a calming  influence given incidental outpourings and perturbations of the  state of the market, but not as a means of rectification of a  constantly intensifying crisis. It is necessary once again here  to immediately combat the cause, not the effect. It is the  economic policy of recent years that we have to thank first and  foremost for the inconceivable deterioration in the well-being  of the population of the republic, the shortage of basic  necessities, the jacked-up prices, and the decline in the value  of the dram. We could have avoided all this or have experienced  it in a more tolerable form had the ill-considered price  liberalization not been implemented, had there not been the  accelerated winding down of state trade, had the sweeping  privatization of agriculture not been undertaken, and had the  state not begun hastily to rid itself of the leadership of  industry.    But let us examine these matters individually.  <H5>  Price Policy </H5>   Price liberalization will continue. Certain measures of  control and regulation will affect merely a very limited list of  commodities, but commodities and services at fixed prices will  be made available to the whole population.    In our view, these are fundamentally mistaken measures. The  point being that the formation of prices is genetically  conditioned by the form of economic system. If it is basically  composed of an aggregate of self-sufficient independent works,  the natural form of the exchange of commodities is the market  with a completely unrestricted price system. If, on the other  hand, a state-organized production system operates, the price of  a product is both coordinated and regulated by the state.    With a mixed economy, pricing should reflect the predominant  system of production. Both command intervention in the price  relationships of private manufacturers and liberalization with  the prevalence of the public sector are equally wrong (unless we  are talking about special cases, of course).    The state can merely maintain low prices for consumer goods  in order to bring them into line with the established minimum  wage. But this privilege cannot be extended to all, since income  and remuneration in the private sector are of a market nature.    Now, when the dance of prices is in full swing, and they are  subject to the influence of the vast market of Russia and,  partially, of the world market also, the state is required for  the purpose of the stabilization of production and the social  condition of part of the populace (whose income depends on the  state and is for this reason less labile) to regulate in the  public sector exchange, price relationships. It is necessary  particularly to harmonize with the minimum wage the prices of a  vitally necessary set of commodities and services, with their  identical periodic indexation. In a number of instances it is  more convenient to have prices tied to the market index, but to  compensate them by subsidy. In order to successfully influence  the market and regulate its prices, it is essential to bring the  relative value of the consumer merchandise presented for sale by  the state into line with the generated state product's share of  the gross national product. Barter exchange, clearing, and state  trade are perfectly capable of securing this proportion.  <H5>  Trade, the Market </H5>   It is hard to provide any rational explanation for the fact  that a working person in receipt of wages established on the  basis of his labor in the public sector, where the bulk of the  wealth of the republic is created, is supplied with goods in the  marketplace, for here the tradesmen have put the price of his  labor on the level of that of a laying hen. We can hardly be  satisfied here with the explanation that it is easiest to  privatize subjects of trade, and this is why the state has rid  itself of the last component in the "commodity-money" system.  The last instance of the movement of money has come to be in the  hands of businessmen, and so it is they who hold sway over  everything. The government is on the one hand devising special  measures to stabilize prices and the dram and to restore the  well-being of society and, on the other, never having understood  cause and effect, evidently, is blessing that same policy of the  privatization of trade.    It is hard not to see the harm of such an act.  First, we have acquired a distorted economy. It is  based predominantly on a state system of production, and at the  level of exchange, something akin to a market with some  arbitrarily established commodity prices. A market economy has  not eventuated, all the same, nor could it have. For this it is  essential to have a certain number, meaningful in the overall  system of production, of noninterconnected independent  enterprises. Trade is not creating them.    Second, the production-consumption chain, into  which a mass of businessmen, more often than not simply  profiteers and swindlers, has been squeezed, has been  artificially extended. The super-profits that they obtain have  served to increase prices. The remuneration of the direct  producer has become meager compared with the income of those  who, following a series of exchanges, sell to them the product  of their labor. The coffers of the state, which has voluntarily  given away its auriferous vein, are empty. The population is  starving.    Third, There has been a shift of stimulus of the  activity of the entrepreneurs. Everyone has made a dash for  trade, where it is possible to get rich without any particular  effort. It has swallowed up, all else aside, human business  capital also.    Fourth, against the background of the virtually  constant decline in production, a small group of people is  becoming incredibly wealthy. The negligible good things that are  still being created ultimately become the spoils of nimble smart  operators who are very far removed from production, but who are  dexterously availing themselves of the current situation.  Personal income is concentrated in their hands. The structure of  consumption is being distorted. The product of light industry,  which could cover a considerable proportion of the national  currency that has been issued, is going begging on account of  the exorbitantly inflated prices of the products necessary for  people's existence. In order to maintain the circulation of cash  and drams, the government has been forced to switch its  attention to the requirements of the latter-day nouveaux riches.  They are interested least of all in investment in industry. You  can indulge them with jewelry and foreign currency, which the  government does from time to time, lest the dram be strangled at  birth.    The stabilization of the dram in January, which was an  object  of the unconcealed pride of the government, was secured by  several measures: a delay in payments to the public, the sale of  foodstuffs via state trade, a ban on the sale of currency, and  currency intervention. The first measure in fact signified a  reduction in personal income, which is simply impermissible.  Prohibitory and control measures are ineffective, and currency  is urgently needed for more important things. There remains, as  a method for the future, state trade, but it is this that the  program for 1994 assigns merely an auxiliary role for a sporadic  impact on jacked-up prices.    It is time to conclude the flawed market game. An  alternative  policy in the sphere of trade should consist of the state taking  control of just as much of it as is necessary for the form of  exchange to be brought into line with the form of production. It  is possible to this end to organize the sale of a prudently  limited quantity of basic necessities exclusively to employees  of the public sector and to persons in receipt of a payment from  public funds in a fixed per capita amount, with regard to their  dependent underage children. To appoint for the corresponding  organizations wholly subordinate stores and distribution  outlets. Commodities purchased on a clearing or barter basis and  via state trade without parasitical middlemen would be priced  considerably below the market. This path would permit the social  protection of the populace against mistakes of the reforms that  are being undertaken, the enhancement and balance of consumer  demand, consolidation of the position of the dram, and the  preservation of foreign currency.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   When the land was being exultantly distributed to the  peasants, it was believed, evidently, that the sense of  ownership would signify a growth of the productivity of rural  labor to the level of the private farms of the West, almost, but  no thought was given to the fact that the farmer is merely a  link in an integral system of the production, shipment,  processing, and sale of agricultural produce. All components of  the system--be they the creation and servicing of equipment, the  supply of chemical agents, or transport, marketing, or  consultation services--operate in strictly interconnected  fashion. The farmer has only to be squeezed out of this system,  and, despite the astonishing degree of provision with equipment,  production begins to decline sharply. What is to be expected of  our peasant, whom we gave a piece of land and whom with delight  and an expectation of gratitude we ejected from the former  agro-industrial complex? He is no longer in a position to feed  not so much several dozen people, as the farmer of developed  countries is, but even the requisite dozen people, given the  current ratio of the population of town and country. The  disruption of the infrastructure and rural production has been  the cause not only of a diminution in the volume of the  agricultural product, but also of a considerable increase in its  cost on account of the excrescence of intermediate service  components. The farmstead cannot get the better of the middlemen  fleecing it and is sliding toward subsistence farming. Last  year, when the situation had become critical, the government was  forced to take a step toward the former methods, making  available to the countryside services at acceptable fixed  prices. But in the program for 1994 it is proposing a directly  opposite solution: the priority privatization of facilities of  the agricultural infrastructure. It has to be assumed that this  was more a political than an economic decision.    With the alternative approach, the brunt of the servicing of  rural labor is to be assumed by the state, the mistakes of the  ill-considered privatization of the land being rectified hereby.  Inasmuch as the peasant is now a proprietor, it is necessary to  work out a form of settlement with him, making clearing on the  strength of the actual or future agricultural product the basis.  It is necessary to give thought to a series of measures for  modernization of the countryside, create in vacant areas  specialized farms, model animal husbandry and poultry-breeding  units included, step up advisory services, and provide for  material backing for progressive techniques on favorable terms.  And the principal method of settlement between the rural worker  and the state should be the product of rural labor in absolute  or (in certain cases) relative values, what is more.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   The slight stabilization of industry in 1993 was achieved  thanks to centralized methods of management. Nonetheless,  government policy, to judge by the program that has been  presented, will be sustained in the previous reform style. It  has been shown quite convincingly, it would seem, that the  relatively developed industrial economic system of Armenia may  function only with high organization linking all its components.  Until self-formed internal relations have taken shape, they  should be predetermined from outside, by central management.  Otherwise, a collapse of the system affecting all its components  will begin. But despite the obvious destructive phenomena, the  policy of transformations remains invariable: On the one hand,  the program provides for huge outlays on defense industry, the  non-revenue-producing infrastructure, grants and subsidies to  the countryside, loans to entrepreneurs, and on social needs,  and, on the other, privatization and denationalization such as  will ultimately signify a dissipation of resources and a further  decline in production and, consequently, in receipts for the  treasury will be undertaken. Such reform will also harm, for  that matter, progress toward the goal for the sake of which it  is being undertaken: the creation of a developed capitalist  economy. First, the economic environment in which any  enterprise, private included, can exist and operate will be  destroyed. Second, funds that could be channeled into the  allocation of credit to enterprise will be irretrievably lost.  Third, the range of persons comprehending under the actual  conditions problems of production and marketing will be limited.  Instead of artificial "incubators" of business, the state has an  opportunity to have a school of management at the enterprises  themselves, attracting to them those who wish to show in  business of what they are capable.    The reform actions of the government amount mainly to  privatization. It is notable that no document giving the  go-ahead for privatization adduces economic justification of the  benefit of this step or criteria of an evaluation of its  consequences and the economic conditions and circumstances  permitting or prohibiting the transfer of title of a specific  facility. Merely a trend toward an order of priority of  privatization is noticeable. Components of at times a global  sector or sphere are being pulled into it, with a consistent  switch from the lower stories of the economic system to the  upper stories. Trade, agriculture, infrastructure, and small  light industry enterprises, subsequently the rest also. In  addition, it may be observed that preference in the order of  priority is being given "weak," unprofitable enterprises, which  is why the stimulus of a temporizing deterioration in their  activity has begun to operate. Either the principle of easiness  or of rapid turnover.    A nonpoliticized attitude toward privatization should be  based exclusively on the economic utility of each individual  act. A set of criteria whose fulfillment could guarantee  salutary consequences of a change in the form of ownership  should be formulated. Specifically, inasmuch as the economy  represents a multilevel interconnected system, from which it is  impossible to remove in full any level without appreciable  damage to the remaining and to the detached parts, it would make  more sense to reduce the centralized pyramid system, severing it  the length of the vertical line and thereby preserving the  possibility of its stable operation.    The principle of the redemption of the fixed capital only  for  the surplus product of an enterprise or for profit obtained  thanks to the use of the production capacity granted its  unrestricted enjoyment could be another criterion. Only the work  force, management, or individual that by their labor, expanding  and modernizing production, are able to show the prospects of  the transfer to them of a given facility would deserve to become  owners of state property. Several supplementary requirements  would create an incentive to the labor, not the inaction, of the  existing enterprises.    In line with privatization, the public sector would be  painlessly constricted, the sphere of market management being  expanded. The transitional period could be considered complete  when private capital investments cater in full for the further  development of the economy--the level of self-sustaining growth.    The adduced analysis of the government program has proceeded  from the fundamental principles of the formation of an economic  system and has attempted to reveal the strategy of the proposed  methods. More than a year ago an author of these lines--then  prime minister--raised before parliament the global issue of the  direction of the reform policy. Unfortunately, the Supreme  Council has not, evidently, deemed this problem of sufficient  importance for its special study. This has enabled the  government to continue unnoticed its former policy, hoping that  the wood of shock therapy will not be visible behind the trees  of specific decisions and, in this case, program measures.</p>

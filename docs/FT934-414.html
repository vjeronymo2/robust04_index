			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: When tax demands follow a legal bill  -Employees can get a costly shock With legal costs soaring, an employee whose company offered to meet his lawyer's bill would be unlikely to look a gift horse in the mouth. But the horse might turn out to be of the Trojan variety, concealing a platoon of Inland Revenue inspectors armed with tax demands. It is a well-established rule that payment of a worker's legal costs by his employer is a taxable benefit. The key court case involved a director who was charged with a serious motoring offence; had he been convicted, he probably would have gone to prison. Since his company did not wish to lose his services, it arranged for its solicitors to defend him. He was acquitted and the company picked up the legal bill. The Revenue then claimed that this should be taxed as part of the director's income. He argued that, since the company's sole aim was to protect its own interests, the Revenue had no right to tax him. But the law lords ruled that the company's motives were irrelevant; the director had received a benefit and was, therefore, liable to tax. The amount on which the employee is taxed is the cost to the employer of providing the benefit. Hence, it includes not just the lawyer's bill but also value added tax (unless the company can recover it). The factors which determine if that can be done were canvassed in a case which arose out of the Herald of Free Enterprise ferry disaster at Zeebruge in 1987. The ship's operator, P&amp;O, and seven of its employees were charged with manslaughter. P&amp;O was advised that it faced a real risk of being found guilty of corporate manslaughter, and that its fate probably hinged on whether the seven employees were convicted. So, it instructed lawyers to defend the seven and paid the costs of Pounds 3.5m. Customs &amp; Excise tried to block P&amp;O's claim to recover the VAT of around Pounds 600,000. It argued that the VAT had not been incurred by the company in the course of its business. Even though the acquittal of the seven staff members might have benefited the company, this did not mean that financing their defence was a corporate objective. The VAT tribunal disagreed. It noted that, had the seven been convicted, the company could well have followed suit. Since a conviction for corporate manslaughter would have done untold damage to P&amp;O's reputation, any steps taken to prevent such damage were potentially of crucial importance to its business Although C&amp;E lost this battle, it will no doubt continue to deny VAT relief  -and thus increase the employee's tax bill - in cases where the link between the employee's legal position and the company's business is less clear-cut. Despite this gloomy picture, of legal bills invariably being followed by tax bills, the Revenue recently announced a concession which will provide some relief from this double whammy. Under this, the taxman will turn a blind eye to the reimbursement by an employer of legal costs incurred by an ex-employee who sues for compensation for the loss of his job. If the two sides have had their day in court, the employee will always get away scot-free. On the other hand, where the parties have done their own deal without resorting to litigation, the Revenue will relent only if the payment is made: Direct to the former employee's solicitor. To cover only costs incurred in connection with the sacking. Under a specific clause in the settlement agreement. The Revenue's burst of seasonal generosity will be good news for vengeful ex-employees, but there is no indication of a change of mind in relation to legal costs in general. Nevertheless, each case will no doubt be considered on its own merits; and if you are, for example, a chancellor of the exchequer whose legal costs for evicting a sex therapist have been taken care of, you might well stand a sporting chance of staying outside the tax net.

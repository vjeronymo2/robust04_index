			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALTER WINCHELL MEMORABILIA SOLD;  </P> <P> AUCTIONS: MANY SEEM MORE INTERESTED IN THE STARS HE COVERED THAN IN THE FAMED  GOSSIP COLUMNIST.  </P> <P> It is said that famed gossip columnist Walter Winchell could make a star or  snuff out a career with the stroke of his pen.  </P> <P> But at an auction of the journalist's memorabilia in Hollywood Wednesday, it  became apparent that in the end, the allure of the stars has outlived the  star-maker.  </P> <P> The auction room wasn't quite full at the auction house of Butterfield &amp;  Butterfield when bidding began simultaneously in San Francisco and Los Angeles.  On the auction block were more than 40,000 letters, radio scripts and  photographs collected by Winchell during the nearly five decades he ruled  Hollywood with a newspaper column and microphone -- a man who was as hated in  some circles as he was feared in others.  </P> <P> But it was the items related to Winchell's celebrity subjects -- rather than  the journalist's personal effects -- that garnered the most attention. It  seemed that many who attended the auction were more interested in the golden  age Winchell represented than in the man himself.  </P> <P> Winchell died in 1972, but the materials were recently consigned for auction by  his granddaughter.  </P> <P> Doris Harris paid the highest price of the day when she bid $10,000 for a  letter in which "Gone With the Wind" author Margaret Mitchell corrected an item  written about her in Winchell's column. Another bidder paid $6,000 for a  single-spaced letter sent from Hotel Ambos Mundos in Havana, in which Ernest  Hemingway writes that his publisher believes his current novel has "F. to A.  ("A Farewell to Arms") beat."  </P> <P> The prices and interest level had been expected -- even though some collectors  said they'd seen larger turnouts for other celebrity auctions.  </P> <P> "There's been a lot of interest from book collectors, autograph collectors,  anybody interested in a bygone era," said Butterfield &amp; Butterfield  spokeswoman Laura Smissaert, who said the nearly two-hour auction yielded  $140,000. "Winchell was one of the most influential people in the '30s, '40s  and '50s."  </P> <P> Gary Milan said he had come to the auction not because he was a fan of Winchell  but because he wanted to add to his collection of celebrity memorabilia. Among  his acquisitions: a $700 file that included a letter from former President  Richard Nixon about a dentist.  </P> <P> "I think the letter is going to go on the wall of my office," said Milan -- a  dentist.  </P> <P> But there were some who were drawn by Winchell.  </P> <P> George J. Houle, a dealer who bought 30 items at the auction, including letters  written to Winchell by composer Irving Berlin, remembered his days as a child  when Winchell's radio-worn greeting "Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. America" sent  electricity through the air.  </P> <P> "He was very important in his day, but today he's somewhat forgotten," Houle  said. "No one really collects Winchell. They collect the people around him."  </P> <P> Winchell's loss of stature is not surprising, said author Neal Gabler, who is  currently writing a book about the culture and evolution of gossip in America,  in which Winchell was a key player.  </P> <P> "Winchell would understand perfectly," said Gabler, who bought bound copies of  Winchell's columns from the New York Daily Mirror and radio broadcast scripts  that were offered at the auction. "Winchell could make or break celebrities.  But he was also (an example) of how fleeting fame is."  </P></p>

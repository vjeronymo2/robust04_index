			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / MFI publishes pathfinder prospectus MFI, the furniture retailer which in 1987 was the subject of the largest management buy-out then seen, yesterday published the pathfinder prospectus for its planned reflotation. It also reported results for the year to end-April. These showed trading profits up 51.6 per cent to Pounds 73.7m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.8m compared with losses of Pounds 24.2m. Sales rose by 3.8 per cent to Pounds 644.4m. Had the float taken place before the year began, pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 67.1m and earnings per share 7.5p. The prospectus promised a progressive dividend policy. It said 'the first half of 1992 has seen conflicting signs of a recovery in consumer confidence'. The post-Christmas sales were strong. In March and April sales rose more slowly, but since then they have been broadly in line with the previous year. The float, expected to value the group at about Pounds 750m compared with the Pounds 718m buy-out, will raise Pounds 564m for the company, before expenses. The group will still have Pounds 100m of debt after the float, close to the pro-forma Pounds 107.2m of shareholders' funds. Some of the buy-out backers will sell their shares. Asda, the food retailer from which the buy-out was made, is expected to sell the 25 per cent stake it has held since then. MFI has 11.4 per cent of the Pounds 5.15bn UK furniture market, making it the leader in a fragmented industry. Its factories produce 60 per cent of what it sells. Under an incentive arrangement, Mr Derek Hunt, chairman and chief executive, will receive Pounds 1.3m, six other directors will receive Pounds 1m each, and one, Mr Trevor Tellett who joined the board in 1989, will get Pounds 215,000. The directors have signed three-year service contracts, dated July 1. Mr Hunt's salary will be Pounds 275,000 a year. The issue will be priced on July 2, with applications closing on July 10, and dealings starting on July 17. The basis of allocations will be announced on July 16. A quarter of the issue will be sold through a public offer, with 10 per cent sold through financial intermediaries and the rest placed with institutions, some in continental Europe. County NatWest is sponsoring the issue and the brokers are Rowe &amp; Pitman and Smith New Court.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MFI YEAR-END RESULTS (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1989    1990    1991    1992    1992*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Turnover            601.7   594.9   620.7   644.4      - Trading profit       91.4    50.9    48.6    73.7   73.3 Pre-tax profit       43.4    (1.9)  (22.7)   10.1   67.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Pro forma.

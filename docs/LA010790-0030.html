			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHADOW OF A DOUBT  </P> <P> I am shocked to read that professionals who deal with children believe that  "children don't lie."  </P> <P> Where on earth are their real-life experiences with children? And don't they  know of Lawrence Kohlberg's famous study at Harvard that shows that children  don't develop a moral code until they are 7 or 8?  </P> <P> Hasn't anyone considered the possibility that the children were playing doctor  and that the little girl, rather than saying, "We were playing doctor and I  enjoyed it," projected onto the little boy's father the injury?  </P> <P> I admire the Johnsons for insisting that their story be told.  </P> <P> HELEN COLTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

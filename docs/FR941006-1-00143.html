			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In proposing this action, it is not FDA's intention to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumvent the aim of the PPPA to allow access by elderly and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handicapped persons who may be unable to use such household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances when packaged in CRP's. The agency requests comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the effect that this proposed packaging requirement will have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the accessibility of iron-containing drugs and dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements to elderly and handicapped persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Iron-containing drug products that are removed from and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispensed in other than unit-dose packaging are adulterated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misbranded. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In order to be exempt from the requirement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 502(f)(1) of the act that a drug bear adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directions for use, a prescription drug product for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human use must bear, among other things, a statement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed to the pharmacist, specifying the type of container to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used in dispensing the drug product to maintain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product's identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.100(b)(7)). However, directions for repackaging are ``not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for prescription drug products packaged in unit-dose, unit-of-use, or other packaging format in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's original package is designed and intended to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispensed to patients without repackaging.'' (Id.) If FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately determines that unit-dose packaging is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of iron-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing drug products, the agency would consider such products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are dispensed to consumers in other than unit-dose packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be adulterated and misbranded. Products marketed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer in unit-dose packaging would remain exempt from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for repackaging instructions because FDA expects that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pharmacists will not compromise such packaging systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has, in certain cases in the past, prohibited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pharmacists from repackaging products because the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's packaging was necessary to ensure the product's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identity, strength, quality, and purity. In 1972, FDA concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that improper packaging of nitroglycerin preparations was causing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial loss of potency of the drug. Commonly used plastic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers and strip packaging failed to prevent appreciable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporation of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin tablets. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that it was necessary to require that these products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be packaged and dispensed in glass containers to ensure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potency of the product ((37 FR 15859, August 5, 1972); 21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.300 (1973)). In addition, manufacturers were required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a statement directed to pharmacists that the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be dispensed only in the original, unopened container (21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 250.300(b)(1973)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The top UN official for  refugees called Monday [18 April] for "political will" to  effectively tackle the humanitarian crises resulting from  increasing flows of refugees worldwide.    "There is no substitute for the political will to find a  solution," UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako  Ogata told participants at a symposium at the UN University in  Tokyo.    The number of people fleeing from poverty, natural  disasters,  civil war and oppression has jumped 10-fold over the last 20  years to some 20 million worldwide, she said. Another 25  million are displaced within their own countries.    According to UN estimates, conflicts and disasters will have  driven some 100 million people from their homes by the turn of  the century.    "A humanitarian strategy of preparedness, prevention and  solution demands a greater commitment to preventive diplomacy  and mediation efforts within countries to diffuse political  violence and ethnic tensions," Ogata said.    She noted, though, that prevention is the "most important,  but also most difficult" measure, as the United Nations has only  limited powers to interfere in the domestic affairs of member  states.    "International monitoring of national human rights is  extremely difficult and we are still at a very, very limited  scale today," Ogata said.    Large-scale UN operations like in Mozambique and Cambodia,  where tens of thousands of peacekeepers and humanitarian staff  were involved in settling the legacy of civil wars, will remain  the exception, Ogata said.    "More attention should be given to smaller, but carefully  balanced operations combining humanitarian, political and  military components such as in Tajikistan," she said.    Given that most refugees do not want to stay in their host  countries, while host countries for their part cannot absorb  large numbers of refugees, Ogata said that the concept of  "temporary protection" as practiced with refugees from former  Yugoslavia should be promoted.    Such temporary refuge is "still at the developing stage of  refugee law" and takes the form of different arrangements in  various countries, but could help overcome many governments'  reluctance to accept refugees.    Those returning to their countries must be given security  guarantees and be offered opportunities to make a living, if  repatriation is to prove successful, she said.    Ogata said she expects that extensive media coverage of  humanitarian crises will further increase public pressure on  governments to provide humanitarian aid, adding that the UNHCR  is short of funds "all the time."    She warned, however, of the risk "that humanitarian action  could become a camouflage for political inaction."</p>

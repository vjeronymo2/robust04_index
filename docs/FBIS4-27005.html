			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- China is to take steps  to tighten supervision and control over financial organizations  in a bid to maintain financial order, according to a recent  national conference.    The conference, held in Beijing from June 21-24, called on  the People's Bank of China, the central bank, to tighten  supervision and control over the operation of all financial  institutions in order to ensure safe and effective operation of  the financial system.    According to the meeting, although the People's Bank of  China  has done a great deal to rectify the financial order and  strengthen supervision and control over financial institutions,  there are still some problems. These included that some local  governments and departments approved the establishment of  financial institutions without authorization; some financial  institutions have violated rules and regulations and overstepped  their scope of businesses approved; there are also problems with  regard to the registration of financial institutions as legal  persons and in the management of increasing shares and capital.    The conference said that the establishment of any financial  institution must have the approval of the People's Banks of  China. It urged the People's Bank of China to take stock of the  financial institutions established without proper authorization  and solve the problem by deepening reforms.    It also called for efforts to formulate standards and  examination and approval procedures for establishing financial  institutions.    The conference stressed that the power of macro-regulation  in  the financial area must be in the hands of the central  authorities and there should be wavering in this regard.    The conference drew particular attention to the supervision  and control over trust and investment corporations, securities  companies and other non-banking financial institutions to see  that they operate according to law.    The conference urged the urban and rural credit cooperatives  to persist in the orientation of serving private and collective  sectors of the economy in urban and rural areas. They may also  establish cooperative banks by pooling funds.    On the establishment of development cooperative banks, the  conference said that there must be law first and such banks  should be established in urban areas first and rural areas  later. The cooperative banks should operate independently,  responsible for their own profit and losses, exercising  self-restraint and seeking development by themselves. Local  governments are not allowed to interfere in their operations.    Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also governor of the  People's  Bank of China (PBC), was present at the conference and made an  important speech.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters felt that termination should not be applied if deficiencies were corrected within the delineated timeframes. One commenter said that the timeframe for termination should be no shorter than 6 months in cases that do not constitute immediate jeopardy. One commenter suggested that the regulation require an ``acceptable plan of correction'' from the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current practice and the final regulations assure that termination will not be applied if noncompliance has been corrected within the designated timeframes. Redesignated &sect;488.456(b)(1) states that the facility's provider agreement may be terminated if the facility_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of participation; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fails to submit a plan of correction with the time specified by HCFA or the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 488.456(b)(2) states that HCFA and the State will terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, if that remedy is imposed by HCFA or the State; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment as set forth in &sect;488.412(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Act does not mandate an automatic 6 month period for the correction of all deficiencies; 6 months is the outside limit permitted for correction of deficiencies that constitute noncompliance and then only when specific statutory criteria are met. The States and HCFA must have the flexibility to choose appropriate remedies, including termination, and timeframes appropriate to the noncompliance identified. We agree with the suggestion to revise redesignated &sect;488.456(b)(1)(ii) to read ``an acceptable plan of correction.'' This change is in line with our current practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters were concerned that the proposed regulations were unreasonable and that HCFA and the States should have an objective, measurable mechanism to govern the enforcement procedures. Another commenter felt the new regulations would inflate termination actions tenfold and increase the State agency workload.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not agree with these comments. These regulations are designed to encourage the selection of a particular remedy based on the nature of the noncompliance and the likelihood of immediate and sustained compliance. It was the intent of the Act that the availability of additional remedies will mean that HCFA and the States will use termination as a remedy less frequently. The use of these regulations for the selection of remedies will help ensure that the selection of remedies is consistent and appropriate. We expect that these new regulations will not cause greater expenditures for the State agencies. However, as we said in the proposed rule, a reallocation of resources, particularly geared to more intensive monitoring of marginal facilities may well occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended amending the regulations to permit the survey agency to initiate termination actions based upon poor compliance history.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act provides the States and HCFA with the authority to terminate facilities with poor compliance histories. Specifically, sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act provide for State and Federal discretion as to whether or not termination is preferable to the imposition of alternative remedies in the case of noncompliance that constitutes non-immediate jeopardy. We expect that a facility's previous history will be a significant factor in the determination of whether termination or an alternative remedy is preferred. However, poor history in and of itself can not warrant termination if the noncompliance has not persisted. That is, if the provider has indicated poor performance in the past but is in compliance in the present, there would be no basis for termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.426&blank;Transfer of Residents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering comments we received on proposed &sect;488.226 and &sect;488.240, we have decided to combine both sections in a new &sect;488.426. We believe this change will be less confusing as transfers for all nursing homes can be referenced in one place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked the following questions: If a facility is terminated, who will be responsible for placing the residents elsewhere? If no bed is available, who will pay for the residents' care in the facility until a bed is found? The commenter stated that the State should have the responsibilities regarding transfer and discharge (in other words, tour of the new facility, counseling, orientation to the new facility, etc.), to avoid transfer trauma.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

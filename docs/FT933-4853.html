			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Allen &amp; Overy 'most profitable in UK'  -A survey of last year's profits at the top 100 firms The UK's top 100 law firms billed Pounds 2.7bn in fees in the 1992-93 financial year and achieved average profits per partner of Pounds 176,000, according to an annual survey of law firm earnings by Legal Business magazine, published tomorrow. Allen &amp; Overy, the City solicitors, emerged as the most profitable UK firm, with profits per partner of Pounds 377,000 on a turnover of Pounds 117m. It jumped ahead of Slaughter and May and Linklaters &amp; Paines, which finished first and second in 1991-92 with profits per partner of Pounds 377,000 and Pounds 349,000 respectively. In 1992-93 Slaughter ach-ieved profits per partner of Pounds 333,000 on a slightly reduced turnover (down from Pounds 113m to Pounds 112m), and Linklaters had profits per partner of Pounds 322,000 on an increased turnover of Pounds 154m (up from Pounds 144m). Overall, the 100 law firms covered by the survey earned combined profits of Pounds 690m. Although these are impressive figures for a period of recession, the magazine says there are clear signs from the generally lower levels of gross fees that the business of law is no longer a growth industry, but one where firms are fighting for shares of a decreasing pie. Ms Karen Dillon, editor of Legal Business, says that 1992-93 was a tough year for law firms, and this year she expects to see mergers, asset-stripping, and partners moving in record numbers. One notable feature of the last year is that 'the typical law firm partner is starting to earn the same kind of money as (rather than more than) his/her clients. That's good news for clients,' she says. Another feature of 1992-93 was the rise of regional law firms. Dibb Lupton Broomhead, the Leeds-based solicitors, is ranked 17th in the UK by turnover, with gross fees of Pounds 36.7m and profits per partner of Pounds 200,000. Five regional law firms, Dibb Lupton, Eversheds Phillips &amp; Buck (Cardiff), Pinsent &amp; Co (Birmingham), Simpson Curtis (Leeds) and Hammond Suddards (Leeds) had profits per partner in excess of Pounds 150,000, and 19 had profits per partner of more than Pounds 100,000. A league table of gross fees also confirms the widening gap between the top six firms and the rest. Clifford Chance is ranked top with a turnover of Pounds 210m followed by Linklaters with Pounds 154m, Freshfields Pounds 124m, Allen &amp; Overy Pounds 117m, Lovell White Durrant Pounds 115m and Slaughter Pounds 112m. But there is then a large gap to seventh-placed Herbert Smith, which has a turnover of Pounds 77.8m. The magazine comments that last year's financial results indicate that medium-sized firms suffered the most. It is among these firms that the mass defections of lawyers, asset-stripping and mergers will take place, it says. If they do not, they will be facing what Alan Hodgart of Hodgart Temporal, the management consultancy, calls the 'gentle decline' into oblivion, it concludes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top 10 UK law firms ranked by profits per partner 1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm                      Profits per partner     Gross fees, Pounds M  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Allen &amp; Overy                Pounds 377,000               117 2 Slaughter and May            Pounds 333,000               112 3 Linklaters &amp; Paines          Pounds 322,000               154 4 Freshfields                  Pounds 302,000               124 5 Ashurst Morris Crisp         Pounds 284,000                47 6 Macfarlanes                  Pounds 268,000                26 7 Lovell White Durrant         Pounds 260,000               115 8 Clifford Chance              Pounds 256,000               210 9 Herbert Smith                Pounds 249,000                78 10 Davies Arnold Cooper        Pounds 237,000                26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The table gives a figure for the average net profit generated per equity partner within a firm.

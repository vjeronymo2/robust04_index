			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Examples 2, 5 and 11 (now 10) are cited as situations where the Canadian shipper should be listed as the ultimate consignee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It would not be possible for the foreign shipper to be listed as the consignee or ultimate consignee on entry documents at the time of immediate delivery, entry or release. The notice of clarification indicated the party in the United States to whom merchandise is sold or consigned. It is this party who is required to be identified in the entry documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Example 9 is cited as a case where a Canadian company is listed on the entry documents as the buyer. The merchandise is shipped to a trucking company in the United States, presumably for shipment to the buyer in Canada. It is suggested that the Canadian buyer be listed as the ultimate consignee on U.S. entry documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The U.S. trucking company is properly listed as the ultimate consignee in this situation. Customs Regulations call for using the premises to which the merchandise is to be delivered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States as the effective ultimate consignee on the entry, when there is no known U.S. buyer at the time of immediate delivery, entry or release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It was requested that a new example be issued for entries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed on merchandise that arrives by pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The examples do not cover this because the mode of transportation is not a factor in identifying the ultimate consignee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter gave examples where the consignee or premises could change after the entry has been processed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the party to whom the merchandise is sold or consigned, or the premises to which it is to be delivered, at the time of entry or release, which must be listed in the Customs entry or release documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted to know who the consignee would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if an importer was shipping merchandise from Canada ``directly''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Mexico, through the United States, and chose to make a consumption entry. The commenter pointed out that the merchandise might be free of duty and both the client and the carrier might not want the shipment to move in-bond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A situation where a shipment moves from the point of entry to exportation from the United States is outside the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;142.3(a)(6). Consequently, Customs will establish a procedure to accommodate importers who wish to file a consumption entry for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merchandise that will transit the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, Customs has determined to adopt the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples without substantive change, with the exception of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example (Example 10 in the notice of clarification) which is removed because the special steel invoice the subject thereof is no longer being used. The succeeding examples are renumbered accordingly. In addition, the following two typographical errors are corrected: in Example 5, the reference to ``Example 4'' is changed to ``Example 3''; and in Example 9, the second sentence beginning with ``Acme shops'' is changed to ``Acme ships''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ABC Company, a distributor of telephone equipment located in Seattle, Washington, places an order with Canadian Bell Limited of Vancouver, Canada, and arranges for the importing carrier to deliver the goods directly to several customers of ABC Company in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ABC Company is the ultimate consignee for Customs purposes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since that is the party which purchased the merchandise from the Canadian shipper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  XYZ Limited is a Canadian company which produces and delivers baked goods to twenty retail food stores in the U.S. on a daily basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the baked goods are ordered/purchased separately from the Canadian supplier by the individual stores in the U.S., each of these stores is the ultimate consignee for Customs purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Montreal Furniture Company, a Canadian manufacturer of office furniture, leases storage space at the Champlain Warehouse Service in Champlain, New York. As orders are received from customers in the U.S., delivery is made from the Champlain storage facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

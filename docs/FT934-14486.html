			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A splenetic portrait of events Sir, As I am one of the group which Patricia Morison attacks ('Gallery headhunting', October 9) for 'gossip', 'venting their spleen' and 'petty opposition' to the decision of the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery to reject the favoured candidate, may I suggest that her article is as splenetic as any could be. What is outstanding about Dr Rogers is precisely his conventional curatorship with an art history that embraces social history, and to boot he is an able verbal communicator. Of course, we all know that Ms Morison's 'new' art history comprises analyses of finger expressions and the height of the wig above the eyebrow. She is on thin ice indeed if she upholds the writings of Saumarez Smith as evidence of this new approach. When you already have in-house a potential institutional leader whose relationship to donors to the very institute she or he aspires to is of the very best, it is surely foolish of the trustees to alienate and anger those very donors. John Harris, 16 Limerston Street, London SW10</p>

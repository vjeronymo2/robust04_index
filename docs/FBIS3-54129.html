			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay </F> Gur by Itay Engel and Ya'el Dan--live]    [Text] [Engel] We first want to ask you about the report  in DEFENSE NEWS, which says that Israel will demand Syrian  demilitarization beyond the Golan Heights, right up to Damascus.  Are you prepared to confirm or deny the report?    [Gur] All those reports are rubbish. No deliberations have  yet been held on that, therefore anybody who quotes us is just  making things up.    [Dan] Do you also call rubbish a report we aired this  morning that Israel is demanding military superiority and not  parity with Syria?    [Gur] Everything reported on Israel's detailed position on  the security arrangements in an agreement with the Syrians is  complete and utter nonsense.    [Engel] Can you then tell us what instructions the Israeli  delegation is receiving on the security aspects?    [Gur] I cannot tell you what instructions they are  receiving, but I will tell you that we have not reached the  stage of discussing the details of security arrangements,  therefore I do not understand how people believe those rumors.  The main problem is that the Syrian president has refused to  specify how he views the peace, therefore we are not prepared to  enter into any negotiations or go into any details on our  position until we know what peace we are talking about. That,  of course, includes everything that comes under the heading of  security arrangements, and I reiterate: everything reported in  our name on security arrangements is a figment of the  imagination.    [Dan] But what can Israel theoretically demand on security  arrangements for the Syrians to return to the Golan?    [Gur] Since I am deputy defense minister, I will not answer  theoretical questions, commentators can do that. I can answer  questions on policy, which is not dealing with any details of  arrangements before we know what type of peace we are discussing.    [Engel] Can you then tell us that there is a political  assumption in Jerusalem that without progress along the  Israeli-Syrian track there will be no movement with either the  Lebanese or the Jordanians?    [Gur] I think that if we take what the king has to say at  face value, then to my regret, even if the Jordanians are ready  to deal with the small print of the problems facing us -- and it  has been said more than once that they can be overcome -- the  king will apparently not want to sign a peace agreement before  there is a comprehensive accord, which includes Syria. That, of  course, makes progress in relations between the two states more  difficult, and does not help our negotiations with the Syrians  because what is needed there is a move by the Syrian president,  and as much as I try, I find it hard to understand why he cannot  say what peace he is talking about with us.    [Dan] A question about the compromise worked out between  Peres and 'Arafat in Oslo so that only technological means would  be used at the crossing points. Can we really make do with only  mechanical, technological means without human intervention as  security measures at border crossings?    [Gur] We have to differentiate between two things at the  border crossings. One is the bridge crossing. In other words,  Israel's overall security is our exclusive responsibility  because it was agreed in the first Oslo paper that we are  responsible for external security and overall security,  therefore everything to do with defending the border against any  danger is exclusively Israeli responsibility. The other aspect  is to what extent we participate in the searches on people who  have passed customs and have entry papers, to assure they have  nothing dangerous on them. Technological measures could be used  at that stage. I did not attend the latest talks between the  foreign minister and 'Arafat. I can only say that no solution  was found at the end of last week. If we are drawing closer to  a solution, I welcome it.</p>

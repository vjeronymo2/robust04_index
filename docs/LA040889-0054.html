			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME SOLUTIONS OFFERED TO PROBLEMS OF 'UNDER-ATTENDERS'  </P> <P> I was somewhat disturbed by the recent letter from Elaine Weiner of Villa Park  ("Some Reasons For Shunning Music Events," Feb 25). I feel compelled to respond  on behalf of the many people who contribute time and money to assure her access  to a broad range of classical music in Orange County.  </P> <P> While she may bemoan the loss of the New World Festival for 1989, there is  still plenty of good music available for her here, most of it by musicians as  good as, and some better than, those in the New World Symphony. As important,  this music is a available 52 weeks a year, not for just a short period in the  summer.  </P> <P> Responding to some of her specific comments: While traffic is not fun, most of  us have accepted it as a necessary part of life here. Getting to the Center by  8 p.m. is not that difficult. Also, a book is available which has seating  diagrams of all Southern California venues which makes buying tickets by phone  easy.  </P> <P> Second, I believe most presenters have made a conscious effort to maintain a  number of affordable seats. The Pacific Symphony, on whose board I serve, has  seats available for every concert for under $10, not bad considering the  economics of putting 100 musicians on stage. Indeed, the average classical  concert loses at least $10,000, so even the least expensive seats are  subsidized by people who think it is important to have live classical music  here.  </P> <P> Third, all of us who present music try to develop programs which are  entertaining because we want our audience to enjoy the music and come back  again. We also have an educational mission which we can accomplish, in part, by  playing less-familiar music. What may be distasteful to one person is expanding  the musical horizons of the person in the next seat.  </P> <P> Finally, most presenters, the Pacific Symphony included, have opportunities for  groups, such as schoolchildren, to attend concerts at greatly reduced rates,  some free, when there are unsold seats. This would not only give Ms. Weiner an  opportunity to hear a first-class orchestra but would provide a new experience  for children in her classes and build tomorrow's audience.  </P> <P> Orange County currently offers a tremendous variety of music for all tastes and  at reasonable cost. If there is a problem, it is that there are too many Ms.  Weiners who are under-attenders. Staying home does not make the situation  better. The musicians need and deserve their support. I hope that Ms. Weiner  and others of your readers will re-evaluate what we do have instead of what we  don't, and start attending something regularly. They'll be glad they did.  </P> <P> RANDY JOHNSON  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P> <P>  Please keep letters brief and include full name, address and phone number.

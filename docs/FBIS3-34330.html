			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the  residents of the besieged city of Sarajevo, spent last night in  a state of fear and apprehension of more heavy artillery attacks  by the Serbs. This apprehension was heightened by the failure  of talks involving the UN representatives to establish a  cease-fire between the Serbs and Muslims.    The UN representatives' attempts failed because of Serb  opposition to the removal of their heavy weapons and artillery  from the area around the Bosnian capital. Despite the scale of  the catastrophe of Saturday's [5 February] massacre, its  unprecedented nature, and the innumerable sacrifices it claimed,  stunning and horrifying people enormously, the UN  representatives remain skeptical. They announced that it is  difficult to examine the incident.    Along with this stance, European countries are seen to be  quite ambivalent, reluctant to condemn the Serbs for this savage  and antihuman act and brutal threats. They continue to give  conflicting assessments of possible strikes on Serb  positions--even though the Serbs have violated the UN Security  Council resolutions. That, ultimately, indicates a lack of  consensus on the need to take serious steps.    The United States has said it cannot assume sole  responsibility for any action against the Serbs. This, while  the European and American communities--with their own doubts and  impotence--fail to consent to other countries, including those  of the Islamic world, intervening to prevent massacres in  Bosnia-Herzegovina from continuing.    Many political experts say that even if the Western  countries  acted against the Serbs, this action would not be considered  within the framework of a fundamental solution to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. It would merely be a way of  mitigating the pressure of public opinion. This, because the  Europeans continue to step up their pressure on the Muslims to  accept a compromise and the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina  anytime a possible plan for any measures against the Serbs is  mentioned.    The West's unjustified conduct, the contradiction in its  words and deeds, and the vacillation in the stances of the EC  and the United States indicate the unlimited decadence of  ethical values prevailing over the West's policies. With such  low ethical and moral values, Europe and the United States are  nothing more than terminally ill patients with little time left  until their demise.</p>

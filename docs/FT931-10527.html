			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: Anne-Sophie Mutter There are few soloists who command such respect in the profession that their audiences are made up of other musicians. On Friday at the Barbican Hall the picture at the cloakroom told its own story - staff having to deal with not only a capacity audience, but also dozens of violin cases being deposited by their owners for safe-keeping. The violinists in the audience, student and professional, had come to hear Anne-Sophie Mutter. As her last solo appearance in London memorably showed, she is an enthralling recitalist. It is fairly safe to say that there is no other violinist active today who can approach the range of colours which she can draw from the instrument and that feature of her playing alone is enough to hold an audience spellbound. In the fragmented, quickly changing sound-world of Lutoslawski's Partita the effect was dazzling. This is a work with which Mutter has become closely associated, as Lutoslawski has made for her a newly-composed orchestral version of the score, but she brought to this performance of the original Partita with piano so kaleidoscopic a spread of tone colours that no orchestra was needed. From the first note each phrase spoke with its own character. The slightest wisp of melody sang; the briefest motif asserted itself. The late C Major Fantasy of Schubert opened with playing at the other extreme, a blissful calm, devoid of tension, long phrases floating on a soft breeze of tenderness. The slow movement is a set of variations on the song 'Sei mir gegrusst' and it is difficult to imagine any vocalist singing the music more beautifully. In some of her recent recordings Mutter's way with classical composers has been in danger of sounding over-ripe, but that was not the case here, either with the Schubert or Beethoven's 'Kreutzer' sonata. It may be that close microphone placing does her playing an injustice. In the hall, her vigorous attack in the Beethoven, the scale, the wealth of colours, all sounded in proportion and matched, too, by her imaginative accompanist, Lambert Orkis, who is better-known in this country for his work on period instruments. There were two encores: the first - the arrangement by Heifetz of Debussy's 'Beau soir' - was sheer enchantment, shimmering nocturnal beauty.

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIETNAM ASKED TO CURB EXODUS OF 'BOAT PEOPLE'  </P> <P> Delegates from 30 nations have drafted a plan asking Vietnam to curtail the  exodus of "boat people" from its shores, officials at an international  conference said.  </P> <P> However, the group, which held a three-day meeting here this week, ruled out  forcibly repatriating asylum-seekers who cannot show they are fleeing political  persecution, officials said.  </P> <P> "The rules are very clear . . . whenever refugees are repatriated, it has to be  on a voluntary basis," said Jean Pierre Hocke, the U.N. high commissioner for  refugees.  </P> <P> The delegates laid out the measures in a draft plan for consideration at the  International Conference on Indochinese Refugees, to be held June 13-14 in  Geneva.  </P> <P> Chairman Majid Mohammed said that the plan would help "provide durable  solutions to the Indochinese refugee problem."  </P> <P> The draft plan suggests that Vietnam launch a campaign stressing the risks and  hardships of fleeing by boat and work to end illegal departures by "boat  people." It also calls on Vietnam to make legal departures easier.  </P> <P> Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and other countries in the  region have agreed to provide temporary asylum for refugees. Western nations  were urged to take in refugees left in camps.  </P> <P> The officials said the Vietnamese delegation had agreed at the conference to  take back anyone who wants to return voluntarily.  </P> <P> Western delegations said they might take in additional refugees and step up  financial aid to help implement the plan.  </P></p>

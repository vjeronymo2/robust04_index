			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Romanian optimism on IMF loan Mr Mircea Cosea, Romania's deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, said yesterday a breakthrough had been made in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a new standby arrangement, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Mr Cosea, who returned to Romania yesterday after 10 days of talks in Washington, said he expected a letter of intent would be signed after an IMF visit to Bucharest at the end of this month. Romania has received no credits from the IMF this year after failing to meet its final performance criteria under a 1992 arrangement and due to disagreements with the fund over terms for a new accord. The sticking point in negotiations has been the Romanian government's unwillingness to liberalise the foreign exchange regime. The black market rate for the leu is around 40 per cent lower than at official currency auctions. Local bankers estimate that the daily official auction accounts for only around 10 per cent of hard currency transactions.</p>

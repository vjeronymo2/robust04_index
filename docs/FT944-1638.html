			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Uncertainty remains over Nordic bonds - Capital &amp; Credit For investors in the Nordic government bond markets, this has been a year of uncertainties. They have had to deal with a general election in Sweden, EU referenda in Norway, Sweden and Finland, and recovery from recession in all four countries that has left investors extremely nervous about whether there will be a new surge in inflation. What is more, these uncertainties have arisen against a background of a spectacular deterioration in bond markets worldwide that has had a particularly severe impact on the Nordic region. However, the most dominant concern - for investors in the Swedish and Finnish markets, at least - has been the state of the countries' public finances. Uncertainty has revolved around the ability and willingness of the Swedish authorities, in particular, to bring under control a budget deficit expected to reach 13 per cent of gross national product in the current year and a national debt that is now approaching 90 per cent of GNP. This uncertainty remains. Although yields in Sweden - and in the other Nordic countries - have fallen since the autumn as a relative calm has settled on international bond markets generally, Scandinavian investors - and in Sweden's bond market in particular - remain extremely wary. The election in September in Sweden ushered in a new government, under Social Democrat Mr Ingvar Carlsson, which immediately signalled its intent to be strict on public spending. That, and Sweden's decision to join the EU, which many think will impose an anti-inflation discipline on the government, provided a boost for the Swedish market. Nevertheless, investors will be watching next month's budget closely for an indication of how strict the government really intends to be on public spending - there was a wobble in the bond market last week at talk that taxes may be raised instead of spending cut. 'It was no big deal (the rumour was that the government would raise a tax on bank profits instead of cutting public consumption) but the market is very sensitive to any sign that the government is not keen on cutting spending at the moment,' said Mr Niels Christensen, Nordic analyst at Technical Data in London. Another uncertainty facing Sweden is the possibility that the country's credit rating may be downgraded. In October, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, warned that the country's Aa2 rating had been put on review for possible downgrade because of its rising public sector debt. If this happens, it could raise significantly Sweden's borrowing costs and lead to a jump in yields. Another, more longer-term risk is inflation. With expected GNP growth of 3.4 per cent in 1995, there are already some signs of significant cost pressures, with producer prices growing at around 6 per cent. Inflation is also the main risk to the Danish bond market. The 'economic fundamentals' look extremely favourable for Denmark - inflation is currently low at around 2.0 per cent, it has a current account surplus and its finances are in a healthy state. Denmark is ahead of most other European countries in the economic cycle and growth is expected to peak this year, before declining gradually in 1995. However, although inflation is currently low, some analysts doubt the authorities' willingness to tighten policy to head off future inflation. 'Unlike the UK, which is at a similar stage in the economic cycle, Denmark has interest rates on hold and has only begun to gradually reverse the stimulative fiscal policy it embarked upon in 1993-94,' said Mr Darren Cullen, Scandinavia economist at Salomon Brothers in London. 'Many are bullish about Denmark, but until it signals a stronger anti-inflationary stance I'm not convinced,' he said. The prospects for Norway's government bond market are perhaps brighter, although it is the smallest and least liquid of the Scandinavian markets and the one which has least interest for international investors. Certainly, its fundamentals - a current account surplus and subdued inflation - are supportive, and since the decision at the referendum not to join the EU, there has been a dramatic rally in the Norwegian bond market - the 10-year yield has now fallen by more than one percentage point since the peak in September and the yield spread against Germany has narrowed significantly. 'This reaction to the 'no' vote is perhaps due to the fact that Norway was likely to be a net contributor to the EU budget so its fiscal position has been helped by the decision,' said Mr Christensen. He expects the yield spread against Germany to narrow further next year. The Finnish bond market has, to a large extent, taken its lead from Sweden and it shares many of Sweden's problems - a large budget deficit and fears that inflation could take off with the economy growing strongly.</p>

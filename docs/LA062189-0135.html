			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INFLATION NOT ACCELERATING, ECONOMY STILL GROWING, FEDERAL RESERVE SAYS  </P> <P> In an assessment of current economic conditions, the Federal Reserve said today  that overall inflationary pressures do not appear to be accelerating and the  economy is still growing.  </P> <P> The economic review in the so-called Tan Book issued about every six weeks is  one of the tools used by Fed governors in adjusting monetary policy. The  Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions regulating the money  supply, is scheduled to meet next July 5-6.  </P> <P> The Fed report said, "With some exceptions, wage and price pressures are not  accelerating." It noted that in some areas, businesses have been unable to pass  on increased costs to consumers.  </P> <P> Retail sales were "generally positive," but auto sales fell, manufacturing  growth leveled off and real estate markets were sluggish, the Fed said. Some  areas reported "undesirably" high inventories, particularly in autos, the  report said.  </P> <P> The Fed said that firming oil prices helped energy-producing regions and that  recent rains eased drought problems in a number of areas. Environmentally  related legal disputes restricted lumber supplies, it said.  </P></p>

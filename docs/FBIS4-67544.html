			<p>BFN     [Text] Korea Resources Recovery and Reutilization  Corporation (KORECO) was founded Sept. 11, 1980 to promote the  reutilization of wastes and the preservation of natural  environment, thus opening the first chapter in Korea's waste  recycling program.    Since its inception, KORECO has continuously endeavored to  overcome a common concern of mankind, resource problems, and to  preserve a cleaner natural environment, and has spared no  efforts in developing and disseminating waste reutilization  technology.    In particular, the 1991 revision to the law on waste  management allowed KORECO to take a central role in the  country's efforts toward waste reutilization.    Fortunately, public concern over environmental preservation  and waste reutilization has been on the rise for the past few  years, and the KORECO has taken on a greater responsibility than  ever before.  <H5>  Role and Function </H5>   United in harmony and cooperation and in the spirit of  excellence, KORECO has been commissioned to contribute to the  development of national economy through waste reutilization and  technological development.    Since its founding Sept. 11, 1980, KORECO has systematically  collected and treated the main pollutants of the agricultural  environment such as used vinyl and used agricultural chemical  bottles, thus gradually becoming a leader in preserving the  agricultural environment.    As the size of the national economy expands and the level of  the industrial structure advances, however, there has been a  dramatic increase in the volume of wastes. Moreover, an  increase in the proportion of special wastes which have either a  higher chance of second-phase pollution or other particular  characteristics has not only called for the safe treatment and  reduction of waste volume, but has reminded us of the importance  of waste reutilization.    All of these have not only put an emphasis on the role of  KORECO in collecting reusable goods, but have precipitated  KORECO's assumption of a central role in a variety of waste  reutilization programs such as operation of the waste management  fund, creation of the Center for Waste Flow Information,  research and development (R&amp;D) on all aspects of waste  reutilization, and operation of reutilization plants.  <H5>  Treatment of Used Vinyl </H5>   The development of synthetic resins has dramatically changed  human life. The extensive use of synthetic resins, however, has  naturally increased the volume of used synthetic resins, whose  treatment becomes an urgent task.    In particular, the development of farming technology has  contributed to an increase in the use of vinyl in the  countryside, such as in preparation of rice seedbeds or for cash  crop cultivation. The resultant pollution of the agricultural  environment is also one of the corporation's major concerns.    Used vinyl, when burned, generates toxic gas; when buried in  the farmland, affects the growth of plants by interdicting the  flow of water. If used vinyl is not properly treated, it  creates an array of problems of reclamation, resources and  environmental pollution.    In order to render the agricultural environment more  affluent  and cleaner, KORECO has maintained a coherent used vinyl  management system from collection to reutilization, and has  regularly visited villages in the countryside.  <H5>  Used High-Density Vinyl Reutilization Plant </H5>   For the first time in Korea and as a culmination of  reutilization efforts, used vinyl reutilization plants have been  set up in Chongju and Andong, with a combined annual capacity of  over 10,000 tons. The vinyl is processed into an intermediate  resource, pellets, which are supplied to private companies.    In the past, KORECO paid for the collection of used  high-density vinyl in rural areas. Those collected vinyl,  however, could not be reutilized and was stored in the KORECO's  branch offices nationwide, due largely to its lack of economic  value and the low level of technology of private reutilization  companies.    Recognizing that the reutilization of used vinyl would be a  vital task in maximizing the use of available resources and  preserving the environment, KORECO conducted R&amp;D on the  reutilization technology of advanced countries and set up  Korea's first reutilization plant in Chongju, North Chungchong  Province.  <H5>  Collection and Treatment of Used Bottles </H5>   Agricultural chemicals are often called "economic poison" in  that depending upon whether they are used safely or not, they  can do good or harm. In order for agricultural chemicals, an  indispensable element in farming, to be most useful, attention  must be paid to their usage. Equally important, however, is  what to do about them after their use.    Shards of used bottles would not only do harm to the people  or cattle, but are one of the main culprits contaminating the  agricultural environment and destroying the ecosystem.    In parallel with its efforts to collect used vinyl, KORECO  collected and recycled between 1987 and 1992 a total of about  253 million bottles with a cash value of 3.2 billion won, and  has contributed to the preservation of a cleaner agricultural  environment.  <H5>  Separate Garbage Collection and Treatment of Reusable </H5> Resources    A variety of trends associated with rapid economic growth,  including a more consumptive pattern, increasing use of  disposables, and shorter lifespan of durable goods, have all  contributed to an ever-rising amount of household wastes.    It should be remembered, however, that the earth has limits  in its self-purification capacity, and so do the resources. It  is these considerations under which the nationwide separate  garbage disposal and collection system has been implemented so  that the public can dispose and separate the reusable resources,  other waste, and coal ash according to their respective  end-forms. Separately disposed garbage can be more effectively  collected and reused and can contribute to the saving of  resources and the creation of a far better and more comfortable  environment.</p>

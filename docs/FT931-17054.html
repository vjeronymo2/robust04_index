			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Early start for BES season THE 1993 Business Expansion Scheme season seems to have started in 1992. BESSA Plus (Second Series), launched last week, is a scheme sponsored by Close Brothers and backed by TSB Bank, which will buy repossessed properties from Hill Samuel Mortgage Services and let them for five years. Its crucial extra ingredient, on top of the guarantee from a high street bank, is the 'non-recourse loan'. This allows top-rate taxpayers effectively to realise their investment after only six months - note that it is not worthwhile for basic rate payers. For every Pounds 1 invested (60p after tax for top-rate payers), Hill Samuel will lend 72p to investors after six months. Investors can choose to continue for five years, but Hill Samuel is obliged to make the loans available. The loans are 'non-recourse', which means they are secured only against the BES shares themselves - Hill Samuel has no right to pursue investors for any other part of their assets. Similar schemes linked to the Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Ireland sold out within a week of becoming available, and it looks as though it will be difficult for those not already on Close Brothers' mailing list to invest in the current offer - total capacity is Pounds 8.5m, and Pounds 3.5m had been taken by New Year's Eve, when the offer had only been open for two days. A similar scheme sponsored by Capital Ventures in conjunction with Cambridge University also seems likely to be fully subscribed soon. Would these schemes be worth holding on to for the full five years? Falling base rates have cut sharply into the returns on offer, and TSB is offering only Pounds 1.08 after five years for every Pounds 1 before tax spent now. In 1991, offers of Pounds 1.35 for every Pounds 1.00 were common, although they did not have the security of bank backing. Anthony Yadgaroff, of Allenbridge Group, says current offers should be taken up only by those who want to take advantage of six-month loans. This will allow them to reinvest in the BES before the scheme is abolished at the end of the year. The budget, due in March, must put some question marks over the future of this type of scheme, as the low risks and high returns available to top-rate taxpayers seem out of line with the government's original intentions. However, the crop of schemes is taking repossessed housing out of the property market, removing a downward pressure on prices, so sponsors are hopeful that the schemes will survive. Banks and building societies - which are yet to get heavily involved with the BES - benefit by removing large amounts of bad debt from their balance sheets, so supply is likely to continue. Several sponsors are working on issues to fund university accommodation, which lack bank guarantees and loans, but may offer a higher return over five years.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Printers say they have won 3.8% rise THE majority of Britain's print workers have secured union demands of basic pay rises of 3.78 per cent and an extra day's holiday, Mr Tony Dubbins, general secretary of the GPMU print union, said yesterday. He said 85 per cent of his members had won increases of Pounds 6.50 a week through company-level bargaining after the breakdown of the national agreement earlier in the year. He accused the employers' body, the British Printing Industries Federation, of misleading its affiliated company members over the level of wage deals secured in the industry. Mr Dubbins challenged the federation to make public all pay data from affiliated companies. 'We are willing to make all of our information publicly available if the federation will do the same,' he said. Mr Andrew Brown, personnel director at the federation, said it would not reveal its data. The federation insists that nearly two thirds of the 1,060 member companies which have reported details of their settlements - half of the federation's members - have made deals at less than the union demand.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY JACKPOT HITS $55 MILLION IN ILLINOIS  </P> <P> The Illinois lottery jackpot jumped an additional $5 million on Thursday to $55  million, approaching California's record U.S. lottery prize of $61.98 million  with two days left before Saturday's drawing, officials said.  </P> <P> The Illinois jackpot has risen $27 million since Saturday, when, for the third  straight week, no one picked the six winning numbers from a field of 54. The  payoff for last week's drawing would have been $28 million.  </P> <P> "Lotto sales have broken records for four straight days, enabling us to boost  the jackpot . . . and we hope to see more of the same, as Friday and Saturday  are traditionally our strongest days," lottery director Sharon Sharp said.  </P> <P> Sharp said lottery agents were handling more than 717,000 transactions an hour  Thursday.  </P></p>

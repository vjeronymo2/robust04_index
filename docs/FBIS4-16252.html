			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of Supreme Soviet deputies (Viktar  Alampiyew, Aleh Trusaw, Lyavon Dzeyka, and three more deputies)  has submitted to the Supreme Soviet Presidium an appeal with  three demands: To entrust Prosecutor General Vasil Shaladonaw  with the task of immediately investigating and, if necessary, of  initiating criminal action against the participants in the  preparation and signing of the monetary merger agreement between  Belarus and Russia; to put the issue of the dismissal of the  prime minister, other government members and officials for their  anticonstitutional activities on the agenda of an extraordinary  Supreme Soviet session; and to conduct a political assessment of  these events. The authors of the appeal maintain that the Moscow  agreement violates Articles 8, 145, and others of the Belarusian  Constitution.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Editorial report] Editor Gwen Lister writes in the  "Political Perspective" column on page 6 of Windhoek THE  NAMIBIAN in English on 22 April that "reconciliation has had  varied degrees of success in Namibian society since the  implementation of this policy by SWAPO [South-West African  People's Organization] shortly after coming to power. It has  had a surprising degree of success, for instance, in the new  Namibia Defence Force (NDF), but the same cannot be said of the  Namibian Police which is almost totally polarised at this  stage." "Members of the public cannot help but notice the rift  in the ranks of the Namibian Police, a rift that appears to be  growing on an almost daily basis. In this case, however, the  division is almost exclusively between black and white." Lister  believes "there appears to be a tendency on the part of certain  white police officers to bide their time for a golden  handshake," which "does not demonstrate commitment on the part  of those who have already gone for this option." The Namibian  police force, "which has a mammoth task ahead of it,  particularly in the combatting of increased crime, cannot be  effective if it remains so divided. Unity among the ranks,  whether black or white, must be brought about if the force is to  earn the respect of the people."</p>

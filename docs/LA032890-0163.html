			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW YORK OVERNIGHT;  </P> <P> IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR ITALIANS DON'T LIKE BILLY'S JOKE  </P> <P> BILLY CRYSTAL'S OSCAR joke angers Italians: Comedian Billy Crystal wasn't very  funny when he "took a cheap shot" at Italians during Monday night's 62nd Annual  Academy Awards telecast, two major Italian-American organizations charged  today.  </P> <P> In separate wires, the Coalition of Italo-American Organizations here and the  National Italian American Foundation in Washington, D.C., charged that Billy  insulted them when he joked that the proposed purchase of MGM by an Italian  businessman would mean the famous lion would no longer roar but take the Fifth  instead.  </P> <P> "It was a cheap shot joke against Italian Americans," the Washington-based  group wired Crystal. "There is a fine line between ethnic humor and negative  stereotyping. We feel (you) crossed that line."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Coalition Chairman William Fugazy said he'd been "inundated" with  calls from his organization's membership.  </P> <P> NUMBER ONE: Barbara Walters doesn't know it yet but she's the first woman to be  named recipient of the Lowell Thomas Award from Marist College in Poughkeepsie.  She's on vacation in the Middle East until April 11. Previous winners include  Walter Cronkite, Eric Severeid, David Brinkley and Howard K. Smith. The award  will be presented at a luncheon on April 19 at the Helmsley Palace.  </P> <P> NIXON ON TAPE: Richard M. Nixon now says that he doesn't think he should have  accepted a pardon from Gerald R. Ford because it was seen by many as an  admission of guilt, the former President asserts in the three-hour recorded  version of his new memoir "In the Arena."  </P> <P> Nixon states: "In retrospect, I would say that Watergate was one part  wrongdoing, one part blundering and one part political vendetta. By far, the  hardest blow was the pardon. My primary reason for resigning was to avoid  having a President of the United States in the dock for alleged illegal  activities."  </P> <P> 'GYPSY' TO GET new leading lady? There may be some "Gypsy" in Linda Lavin's  soul. The Tony Award winner is at the front of the line to replace Tyne Daly in  the starring role of the hit musical revival at the St. James. Daly is signed  up until the end of July.  </P></p>

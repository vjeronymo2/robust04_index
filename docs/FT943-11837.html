			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Survival at the margins: Gerard Baker and Emiko Terazono ask if Japanese banks can shake off their bad debt problems This morning, in one of the stark concrete blocks that scar Tokyo's financial district, the denizens of Japan's banking community gather for their annual convention. They will be addressed by a glittering array of speakers, including Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, central bank governor Mr Yasushi Mieno, and most members of the financial aristocracy. The message they will hear is that the long night of Japan's banking crisis is over. Fortified by the drink and the canapes, some of them may believe it. Since they published their annual results in May, the country's 21 main banks have been anxious to claim that the worst of the bad debt nightmare that has haunted them for the past four years is over. The reality is different. It is doubtful whether the bad debt problem itself has reached the end of the beginning. But more troublesome for the banks is that their ability to deal with the problem is increasingly constrained because profits - out of which banks make provisions for bad debts - are stagnating. The banks' reversal of fortune has been rapid. Enriched by the country's vast current account and savings surpluses of the 1980s, they were respected and feared in boardrooms across the world. Now, though still the largest - occupying 11 of the top 20 slots in the world league, measured by assets - the past four years have revealed that size is no substitute for strategy. The opacity of Japanese accounting practices means it is not easy to gauge the true scale of the banks' problems. But even the most creative of accountants could not disguise for long the consequences of the collapse of the 'bubble economy', the period of spiralling asset prices in the late 1980s. Banks, heavily exposed to an overgrown property sector, watched helplessly as the collapse came. In the past three years the value of non-performing loans has nearly doubled. This year the banks have seen the first signs of hope. Total disclosed non-performing loans fell by 1.3 per cent from last September to Y13,600bn (Pounds 90bn) at the end of March - the first fall over a six-month period since the crisis began. There has also been a greater sense of realism by the banks. Initially, their response to the rising level of bad debt was to wait for a return to economic growth to ease their difficulties. In part, this was because they were labouring under a regulatory regime run by the Ministry of Finance which, with an eye on tax revenues, frowned upon bad debt provisions, since they are offset against tax. But last year, as the ministry loosened the reins, banks began to make sensible provisions. This year, write-offs and provisions at the 21 leading banks totalled Y3,855bn. Provisions as a proportion of disclosed problem loans rose from 28.9 per cent in March 1993 to 33.5 per cent a year later. Sumitomo Bank is one bank that has become much more bullish about its prospects. 'Our aim is to complete the strategy of dealing with problem loans in the current financial year. Current levels of provisioning mean we are on course to achieve that,' says Mr Kensuke Uchida, a senior manager. But this view is almost certainly too optimistic, because the level of problem loans disclosed by the banks under-represents the real total. The banks' figures do not include restructured loans, on which interest rates have been cut to keep borrowers solvent. They also exclude loans made to the banks' housing affiliates, whose own prodigality in property-related lending makes the banks look prudent. Industry estimates suggest that some of these companies have problem loans equal to more than 60 per cent of their loan book. These factors lead observers to estimate that banks' real problem loans are closer to Y30,000bn than the Y13,600bn officially disclosed. Some banks are much better placed than others: problem loans at Mitsubishi Bank are estimated at 3.6 per cent of total loans, while the figure for Hokkaido Takushoku Bank is 7.4 per cent. But for the sector as a whole, estimated bad loans represent nearly 6 per cent of the loan book, a figure that suggests that, even without further shocks such as another sharp fall in the property market, the backlog may take five years to clear. The problem of poor lending would be less severe if the profitability of Japanese banks were not among the lowest in the world. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, estimates that banks' profits before provisions for bad debts are less than 0.4 per cent of total assets, compared with 2.4 per cent for US banks and 1.7 per cent for banks in the UK. Worse still, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, the banks' low margins are not the product of big overheads or overmanning. Operating expenses as a percentage of risk assets are much lower for Japanese banks than for their American counterparts. The fundamental difficulty is weak revenue. Japanese loan spreads, the difference between lending and borrowing rates, are razor-thin. Core earnings (before taxes, credit expenses and securities gains), as a proportion of average assets, range from zero to 0.8 per cent for Japanese banks, against 2.5 per cent for US banks. As Moody's says: 'If Japanese banks had the same level of core earnings as US banks, the asset quality problem would be quite manageable, there would be no crisis, and Japanese banks as a whole would be much more creditworthy.' What is more alarming is that the slim margins are getting thinner. Interest rates are now at or near the bottom of the business cycle, depriving banks of the benefit of a time lag between cuts in lending rates and cuts in deposit rates that has kept their margins from narrowing even further. In any case, the fragile economy is cutting demand for bank lending and banks are being forced to pare loan rates. Financial deregulation is beginning to hit banks' profits, too. As limits on interest rates are gradually removed, banks are having to compete harder for funds in the retail market. And deregulation of the bond market is helping companies that are borrowing to dispense with banks altogether in their search for finance. Yet banks seem unable to break out of the stranglehold of low profitability. Despite the squeeze on margins, lending remains the core activity for banks, which have little knowhow in developing new fee-earning business. Seventy per cent of Japanese banks' profits derive from lending - far higher than in US or European banks. For now, banks will attempt to offset their falling profitability with gains on sales of their large equity portfolios. But this is not a long-term solution. Shareholding by banks counts as a part of their capital base and selling equities diminishes their capital ratios which, under rules laid down by the Bank for International Settlements, have to be kept above agreed levels. Japanese banks are already close to the minimum. More importantly, such emergency measures will not confront the heart of the problem. With 21 main banks and more than 5,000 regional and other banks, Japan has chronic financial overcapacity. As deregulation gathers pace, the competition for depositors and loans will heat up, and banks and regulators will face a choice between two unpalatable solutions. Some banks could be allowed to fail, but this is unlikely given the authorities' adherence to the stability of the banking system, and the fragile state of confidence in it. Or there will have to be mergers, a development said to be favoured by the regulators but fraught with difficulties, as the relatively profitable banks will find the charms of the weaker banks distinctly resistible. But as long as regulators oppose failures and banks say no to mergers, the much-needed rationalisation of the financial system will be shelved indefinitely. The status quo can only mean further decline for all Japan's banks. As a senior executive at one of the larger institutions puts it: 'The problem with Japanese banks is that not many of them realise that they weren't really competitive from the start. Now they have to face it: banking here is a dwindling business.'</p>

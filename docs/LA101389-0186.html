			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 6,500 MINERS STRIKE IN S. AFRICA  </P> <P> At least 6,500 miners at all five diamond mines of De Beers Consolidated Mines  Ltd. struck today for higher wages in the first national strike in the  company's history, company and union officials said.  </P> <P> By this afternoon, almost 100% of workers on two shifts had joined the  stoppage, but total support for the strike will not be clear until a full work  cycle has been completed, De Beers spokesman Sejamothopo Motau said.  </P> <P> The total black labor force in the five mines and one geology department was  about 9,000, Motau said. The white mining work force was unaffected by the  strike, he said.  </P> <P> Some of the mines are highly mechanized and it was not clear to what extent  production was affected, Motau said.  </P> <P> De Beers has offered a wage increase of 17%, which would raise the minimum  monthly wage from 553 rand ($205) to 647 rand ($240) and keep pace with  inflation. The NUM is demanding a 37.6% increase to 761 rand ($282) a month.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 6 -- The president does not change his  mind, the presidential spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said  Wednesday assessing chances of Dariusz Rosati, the candidate of  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], to assume the posts of  deputy prime minister and finance minister.    Drzycimski said that President Lech Walesa is open to talks  with representatives of the ruling coalition or the prime  minister about the filling of the vacant post in the government  but stressed that Rosati's candidature was completely out of the  question since it had already been officially rejected by the  president.    According to Drzycimski, the Thursday meeting between the  president and the Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy will be devoted to  discussing the results of a parliamentary delegation's visit  paid recently to Moscow.    The spokesman said also that the president had not taken a  decision yet whether to sign the law on election to commune  councils.</p>

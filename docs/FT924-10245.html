			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / (CORRECTED) International Capital Markets: Nikon posts 82% slide in profits Correction (published 5th November 1992) appended to this article NIKON, the leading Japanese camera and precision equipment manufacturer, has reported operating losses of Y248bn (Dollars 2bn) for the first six months to September, largely due to a steep fall in sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. This compares with operating profits of Y5.39bn a year earlier. Pre-tax profits fell by 81.9 per cent to Y1bn, while net profits slid by 73.8 per cent to Y645m. Only the redemption of Y1.1bn of dollar denominated bonds allowed the company to record pre-tax profits. Nikon's turnover fell by 14.7 per cent to Y104,273bn. However, sales of semiconductor equipment, which last year accounted for a third of the company's sales, fell by almost 50 per cent to Y19bn in the six months from Y37bn. Sales of cameras fell to Y48bn from Y51bn. Only sales of spectacle lenses, frames, sunglasses and binoculars increased, to Y16bn from Y13bn. Nikon hopes to contain its operating deficit for the year to March to about Y2.5bn, with cost savings in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment division. Nikon declared an unchanged interim dividend of Y4.50. CORRECTION Nikon announced operating losses of Y2.48bn (dollars 20.3m) on sales of Y104.27bn for the six months to September 30. These figures were incorrectly reported in the FT on November 2.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / German coalition seeks show of unity after protest vote CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday chaired a crisis meeting of leaders of Germany's three coalition parties in an effort to paper over cracks in his ruling alliance. The parties suffered a decisive vote of no confidence in local elections in Hamburg on Sunday. Both Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and the opposition Social Democratic party, admitted that a big protest vote in Hamburg, in favour of the Greens, two extreme rightwing parties and an anti-party alliance, was a severe warning for the traditional political establishment. The result was worse for Mr Kohl's CDU, with a slump in support from 35 per cent in 1991 to 25 per cent on Sunday, in spite of a swing against the ruling SPD government which saw it lose its overall majority in the city. SPD support fell from 48 per cent to 40.4 per cent. Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, warned that the splintering of support for the main parties would undermine future coalition government, making it increasingly difficult to form 'majorities capable of action'. The main parties must tackle the fundamental causes of protest, he said, including rising crime, unemployment, and the lack of cheap housing. The meeting yesterday did produce agreement on a new social insurance plan to pay for nursing care for the elderly. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the liberal Free Democratic party, which lost all its seats in the Hamburg city parliament, promised that he would not allow the coalition to collapse over the issue. Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, said the continuing rise of the extreme rightwing parties - although they failed to win any seats, they gained a combined 7.6 per cent of the vote in Hamburg - was 'alarming'. The Greens were the big winners in the city election, almost doubling their vote from 7.1 to 13.5 per cent, followed by the Statt Partei - literally the 'Instead of a Party' - which won eight seats in the city parliament with 5.6 per cent of the vote, although it has no political platform. The extreme rightwing parties, the Republicans and German People's Union (DVU) split the far right vote, leaving neither with enough support to win seats - to the universal relief of the main parties. The Republicans gained 4.8 per cent, just 1,430 votes short of the 5 per cent level required. All the protest parties won a disproportionate amount of support from younger voters, and again Mr Kohl's CDU performed particularly badly. In every age group up to 45, the Greens polled better than the CDU, according to the opinion research group Infas. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

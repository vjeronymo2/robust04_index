			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/6/1994 -- "Some aspects of  the declaration of Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and Tiraspol  leader Igor Smirnov signed on 28 April contradict the basic  principles of the opinion poll "La Sfat Cu Poporul" ("Consulting  With the People") especially the article which affirms that  Moldova is a unitary state," states an analytic report of the  Moldovan Euro-Atlantic Center. The authors of the report  consider that the term "juridical status of state for Dniester,"  can be interpreted as "the creation of a confederation union on  the basis of an agreement between two autonomous entities with  equal rights for sovereignty." References of the type  "departing from the existing political reality," which are often  used in the declaration, could serve as a definite juridical  basis for the legalization of the illegitimate structures of  Dniester, including the armed forces, says the report. The  experts of the Euro-Atlantic Center consider that the 28 April  declaration allows the leaders of the self-proclaimed Dniester  republic to negotiate about the interests of Tiraspol without  having to give up any positions. At the same time the authors  of the report doubt the legitimacy of the signing of the  declaration on the behalf of Dniester by the Russian citizen  Igor Smirnov. According to the cited source, the definite  refusal of Chisinau to allow the representatives of Romania and  the Ukraine to participate in the solving of the Dniester  conflict may lead to an aggravation in the relations between  Moldova and these states. The experts of the Euro-Atlantic  Center gauged the results of the 28 April negotiations as a  voluntary passage of Moldova into the Russian area of interests,  which could generate essential problems in its relations with  the West, including economic ones.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BILINGUAL TEACHERS CRUCIAL TO LA HABRA CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 students in La Habra City School District are classified as  "limited English proficient," according to a recent language survey. Spanish is  the primary language for 94% of them.  </P> <P> Although the district operates 36 bilingual or ESL (English as a Second  Language) classrooms, only 10 of the teachers are certified as bilingual  teachers. The district plans to help teachers by offering training leading to  full certification, Assistant Supt. Ruth Fehr said.  </P> <P> To qualify for the certificates, teachers must pass tests in culture,  methodology and Spanish language. Fehr said several teachers have completed all  but the language portion, which she described as very demanding.  </P> <P> "We probably have as many fully certificated teachers, proportionately, as most  districts in the county," Fehr said. Recruitment of bilingual teachers is  difficult, she said, adding that the district is now searching for a bilingual  kindergarten teacher.  </P></p>

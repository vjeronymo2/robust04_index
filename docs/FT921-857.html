			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Yugoslavia urges prompt UN action Bomb blasts and shooting rocked Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday as Yugoslavia urged the United Nations to speed up deployment of its peace-keeping force, Reuter reports from Belgrade. At least 30 people have been killed this week in an upsurge of violence in Bosnia and Croatia that has caused concern that the arrival of the UN peace-keeping troops could be delayed. In Helsinki, Yugoslavia urged special envoy Cyrus Vance and secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali to arrange for the main part of the UN's 14,000-strong peace-keeping force to arrive before the planned starting date of April 5.</p>

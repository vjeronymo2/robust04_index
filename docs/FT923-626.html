			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Italy approves sale of Efim subsidiary THE Italian government yesterday approved the sale of the first company in the Efim group, placed into voluntary liquidation in July, selecting SIV, the state industrial holding's glass-making subsidiary. At the same time the government agreed to place all Efim's aluminium production operations, the group's biggest loss-makers, into one company. SIV has 25 plants in Italy and abroad employing 5,200 employees and accounts for 22 per cent of the European car industry's glass market. Its 1991 sales totalled L732bn (Pounds 343.82m) turning in a small L3.7bn net profit. However, the recession in the European car industry is understood to have forced SIV into losses at the time Efim was placed into liquidation. The decision to proceed with the sale appeared an attempt to signal the government's desire to accelerate the winding up of Efim whose losses for the current year could reach L2,000bn. But SIV is also the least politically sensitive of Efim assets and the privately owned Varasi group has a 5 per cent stake with an agreement dating back to 1989 giving it option to buy an eventual 51 per cent. The government's decision to merge all Efim's aluminium interests gave no hint as to what operations, if any, might be closed. Nor has there been clarification on the fate of either Augusta, the loss-making helicopter company, or the companies in the Breda group, specialists in mass transit systems and considered Efim's jewel. On Thursday Mr Alberto Predieri, the liquidator, told parliament two month's scrutiny of the holding's books revealed total debts of L17,500bn.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> No one wants to get caught at an epicenter.  </P> <P> But what about at the Epicentre, L.A.'s first earthquake-themed restaurant?  </P> <P> "Our feeling was that so many people from out of state talk about L.A. falling  into the ocean that we'd have a positive attitude about it," said A. L.  Wehmeyer, assistant general manager of the downtown Kawada Hotel. "Besides,  Californians have a good sense of humor."  </P> <P> The Kawada's Epicentre, located at the corner of Hill and 2nd streets, will  open to epicures in October, three years after the Whittier quake struck.  </P> <P> Wehmeyer said that the restaurant's decor will include walls designed to appear  as if they're cracked, a map that shows California taking a dive into the  Pacific and a work of art that depicts City Hall "as it is now and after it has  crumbled in an earthquake."  </P> <P> No doubt the dessert menu will include pineapple upside-down cake.  </P> <P> Speaking of the shifting Earth, have you ever noticed the world map sculpture  on the Pacific Bell building on Grand Avenue?  </P> <P> California's still in place, but South America has moved up alongside it.  Meanwhile, Africa has drifted up toward Canada. And Australia's where Brazil  used to be.  </P> <P> Keep Pac Bell's map in mind the next time you have trouble making a connection  on an international phone call.  </P> <P> This is about that sports team that shifted its base to L.A. and left many  embittered fans behind. We mean the Dodgers, of course.  </P> <P> The club's heavy hitters -- its lawyers -- have filed a lawsuit against two men  who are using the name "Brooklyn Dodgers" on two restaurants in Brooklyn. The  team claims it has sole rights to "Brooklyn Dodgers."  </P> <P> Now, Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden has asked New York to seek a  court order declaring the name part of the public domain, meaning anyone could  use it.  </P> <P> First employed in 1890, the term originally described the baseball fans who had  to dodge trolley cars to get to the park.  </P> <P> "The name 'Brooklyn Dodgers' cannot be owned by a Los Angeles corporation which  turned its back on us more than 30 years ago," Golden declared.  </P> <P> As a public service to the two cities involved, Only in L.A. has decided to  combine two of its recent crusades: How Can Irwindale Fill Up Its Pits? and  What Can Long Beach Do With the Spruce Goose?  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P>  miscelLAny:  </P> <P> A bronze plaque at the peristyle end of the Coliseum commemorates the gold  medal winners of the 1932 L.A. Olympics, including Eddie Tolan (100-meter  dash), Babe Didrikson (javelin throw) and Lee Blair (water colors and  drawings). Blair's little-remembered division -- fine arts -- was later dropped  from the Olympics.  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Island is a law unto itself Alderney is a Crown possession governed by the States of Alderney, an elected parliament of 12 members and a president. Once a law has been passed by the States, the president will petition the Privy Council to approve it. Laws can only take effect once they have been approved by the Queen. Alderney is also part of the bailiwick of Guernsey, which is itself a Crown possession. The governor of Guernsey is also the governor of Alderney, but Alderney's parliament petitions directly to the Privy Council. Alderney and Guernsey do, however, have an arrangement that goes beyond their links within the bailiwick, whereby they levy the same taxes and Alderney passes its tax revenue to Guernsey in return for the provision of core services. Because of this agreement, two members of the States of Alderney represent the island in the Guernsey States of Deliberation, or parliament. Alderney's external affairs and treaties come under the jurisdiction of the British parliament and are handled by the UK's foreign office. Alderney is bound by EU external trade arrangements and agricultural policies. It is not affected by EU taxation, employment or any other policy area. The island has its own judiciary, appointed by the Crown, but appeals go to the Royal Court of Guernsey.</p>

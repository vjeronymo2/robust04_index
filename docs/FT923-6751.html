			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: European paper shares reflect the damage - A sector which is suffering from the recession and overcapacity European paper and pulp companies are suffering badly from the global economic recession and overcapacity in the industry. The damage is likely to worsen and it could take two years for profitability to improve. The structural problem is that paper manufacturing is capital-intensive with high fixed costs. When demand strengthens, prices move up quickly because of the difficulties of bringing on new capacity. But when demand is weak, capacity reduction is almost impossible and prices fall equally quickly. Paper and pulp shares have been highly volatile as investors, uncertain about the economic cycle, attempt to call the end of recession. Sentiment has fluctuated. For example, shares in MoDo, the Swedish group, increased from a level of SKr185 at the beginning of the year to SKr273 by June. Since then they have fallen back to SKr190. Mr Denis Christie, European paper and packaging analyst at James Capel, warns: 'There is a lot of hope-value in some paper shares and it is not necessarily justified.' Some sectors are suffering more than others. The pulp industry is in difficulties with most plants operating at below 90 per cent capacity. Although a strike in British Colombia cut about 20 per cent of northern bleached softwood kraft capacity recently, the long-term outlook is poor, according to Mr Christie. Pulp capacity growth is likely to exceed demand growth by almost two times and pulp prices this year will remain below those of last year, warns Mr Christie. Furthermore, in the long term, low-cost South American manufacturers are bringing on new capacity which will prevent Nordic producers repeating the profits peak of 1989. Nordic groups are also likely to suffer in the newsprint sector. Demand for newsprint has fallen, as newspapers have cut pagination following the fall in advertising revenue. At the same time, two newsprint plants in Germany and one in Switzerland with a combined capacity of 650,000 tonnes are due to come on stream by 1994. These will be sited near cities and will use recycled paper, offering a significant cost advantage over those using virgin fibre, such as the Scandinavians. Those sectors less affected by recession and overcapacity include coated papers and packaging. Mr Christie believes that when demand picks up prices are also likely to improve quite quickly. 'In these conditions it is difficult to pick any stocks,' adds Mr Christie. 'There is a lot of pain still to endure.' He argues, however, that those willing to wait for capital gains could find it profitable to invest near the bottom of the cycle. Some Continental stocks are tightly held, and when sentiment improves it can be difficult to buy them. He recommends avoiding those integrated with significant pulp capacity. KNP, the Dutch group, is short on pulp and therefore able to benefit from low prices. In addition, the group is strong in lightweight coated paper, which is likely to be one of the first areas to recover. It also has a joint venture with Buhrmann-Tetterode in corrugated board, which is in short supply. Mr Christie describes it as the highest quality paper company in Europe. He points out that it will have little problem covering its dividend and has a 6 per cent yield, making it a reasonable investment while waiting for the paper sector to improve. In the short term, profits of all paper groups are likely to be under pressure. The question for investors will be the speed and timing of recovery.</p>

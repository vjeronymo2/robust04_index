			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Paper groups report lower earnings, sales TWO leading Japanese paper companies which merged this month reported declines in sales and profits as demand for paper was hit by the prolonged economic downturn, writes Emiko Terazono. Kanzaki Paper and Oji Paper, which formed New Oji Paper on October 1, said their earnings were hit by a fall in paper prices due to over-supply. Oji's non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the six months to September fell 7.5 per cent to Y5bn (Dollars 46m) on a 4.9 per cent fall in sales to Y216bn. After-tax profits dropped 17.4 per cent to Y3.2bn. Sales of paper and pulp products fell 4.5 per cent to Y201bn, while processed paper products and lumber fell 5.2 per cent to Y215bn. Kanzaki posted a 24 per cent fall in half-year pre-tax profits to Y788m, while sales fell 9.6 per cent to Y64.2bn. After-tax profits rose 27.7 per cent to Y641m. Sales of its mainstay paper and pulp products fell 9.3 per cent to Y63.7bn. For the full year to March, New Oji expects pre-tax profits of Y11bn on sales of Y496bn and an after-tax profit of Y6.7bn.</p>

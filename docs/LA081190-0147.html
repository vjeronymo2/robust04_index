			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHUUR STEP AWAY FROM THE SHADOWS;  </P> <P> VOCALIST: THE JAZZ SINGER, WHO HASN'T RELEASED AN ALBUM SINCE 1988, WILL BE  MORE THAN 100 POUNDS LIGHTER AND EMOTIONALLY CLEARER AT THE COACH HOUSE.  </P> <P> What a difference a year or two can make. Diane Schuur hasn't released an album  since 1988, but she has used the free time to create a brand new image. When  the Washington state-based jazz singer appears at the Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano tonight, she will look svelte and slim -- more than 100 pounds  lighter than she was two years ago.  </P> <P> "I'm a mere shadow of former self," she joked earlier this week.  </P> <P> But the changes reach well beyond her new silhouette. She has also spent the  last two years trying to bring order to her professional and personal lives.  </P> <P> The long hiatus from recording resulted from a nasty dispute with GRP Records  over the duration of her contract and the quality of promotion for her albums.  It dragged on until GRP's recent acquisition by MCA Records.  </P> <P> A new album is scheduled for release early next year. "It takes a new slant for  me," Schuur says. "I wanted to spread my wings beyond the jazz genre. Not that  there's anything wrong with jazz, but I wanted to add some R&amp;B and some  ballads. I love like 'What a Difference a Day Makes' and 'Unforgettable.' We  were lucky enough to get Andre Fischer -- Natalie Cole's husband -- to produce  it, and he was excellent, one of the best producers I've had, just full of  enthusiasm and energy. Just great to work with."  </P> <P> Schuur has also begun to exorcise some demons that confronted her during her  rapid rise from Seattle nightclubs to command performances at the White House.  The star-making machinery, and Schuur's reaction to it, had unhealthy  consequences for the blind singer.  </P> <P> "I'm in a 12-step program now," she says, "and it's one of the best things  that's ever happened to me. I know I'm a compulsive person, and I have to be  careful that I don't go from one extreme to another. I shouldn't overeat, but  then I shouldn't under-eat, either, because that's as much a form of compulsive  acting-out as overeating is."  </P> <P> Equally important, she says, the program has helped her deal with a tendency to  beat up on herself: "It's always been much easier for me to say, 'Oh, well, you  were a bad girl; you screwed up again.' I'm trying to get myself out of that  way of thinking, and it's had a real positive effect in many parts of my life."  </P> <P> Schuur's audiences have begun to see and hear some of the tangible  consequences. She is more open, more communicative and, clearly, more self  confident. And her singing has become enriched. An often-criticized tendency  toward shrillness in her upper register has been replaced by a warmer, more  centered sound.  </P> <P> "There was a reason for my singing that way," she says. "I was carrying around  so much weight -- physical weight, emotional weight -- that it was hard to  project. So I pushed too hard and did the best I could with what I had. Now I'm  lighter, in a lot of ways. I've still got the power, but now it feels as though  it's harnessed.  </P> <P> "I like to think that what I'm doing is finally allowing the vulnerability of  the little child inside me to come out. And that feels really good."  </P></p>

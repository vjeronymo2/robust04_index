			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: An apology for a film festival / Finding two survivors and a stretcher case at Cannes SUDDENLY THE other night Cannes had something worth shouting about. 'Magnifique]' cried a thousand festivalgoers as they watched. 'Sensational]' 'Sacre bleu]' 'The best thing we have seen so far' (Translate into the languages of your choice). The cause of passion was a firework display. As bouquets of light burst over the bay, we all wondered why it had taken twenty-odd tons of gunpowder to prise open emotional responses left untouched by the films. This spectacle was a film in part. But what a film: laser-projected images of fire and war and clinching couples - Gable and Leigh, Garbo and Boyer, even Krushchev and Castro - thrown onto a giant floating screen as the real fireworks exploded all around. They say that human beings are united by adversity. But Cannes, pre-fireworks, had been the grimmest get-together in Cote d'Azur memory. Normally goodhearted festivalgoers avoided each other's eyes lest colleagues had even worse tales of aesthetic debacle to tell than they. 'Did you see the Icelandic film about despair in the fishing industry?' (Asdid Thorodssen'd Island). 'No, but I bet it wasn't as bad as that talkative Canadian movie about the gay murderer who drones on about why he killed his lover with a kitchen knife' (Jean Baudin's Being At Home With Claude). 'Well, at least it wasn't an ice pick. Do you know, I just saw the 23rd film in which . . ' Enough. From a festival resembling an unpleasant accident, let me pick out two unscathed survivors and one partial stretcher-case that smiled for the cameras. From Sweden Bille August's Best Intentions has a script by - oh how we need him now - Ingmar Bergman. The film surges majestically through the century's early years as Bergman recreates the romance and marriage of his own parents. He is a cold-eyed Lutheran pastor, she a walking nervous breakdown. Between them, in snowscapes and lakelands that dazzle the eye, they create the conditions of elegiac dementia into which young Ingmar could be born. This is a prequel to Fanny And Alexander. It is also a flexi-movie in the same vein. A 4-hour TV serial co-exists with the three-hour film seen at Cannes; and indeed our only reservation is that we feel we could buy this story by the yard. (Why not five hours - seven - ten?) But Bergman has lost none of his skill at paring emotion to the bone and beyond to the marrow. Quarrel scenes have a lacerating force; reconciliations a melting poignancy. As for director Bille August, he was the last non-American to win a Cannes Golden Palm with Pelle The Conqueror and he may be the first non-American to end Hollywood's three-year run in 1992. The other alive-and-kicking festival item, shown non-competitively in the Directors Fortnight, was Stacey Cochrane's My New Gun: a blissful black comedy about a young New Jersey suburbanite (Diane Lane) whose life is transformed when she is given a gun by her security-conscious yuppie husband (Stephen Collins). Direct and indirect results: two woundings, one near-fatal case of food poisonning, the discovery of a lost Country and Western singer in hiding (Tess Harper), an adulterous romance and a friends' wedding that almost models itself on one of those famous bloodbath nuptials beloved of Dynasty. The film is sly, wise and very very funny. So at best, with its spot-the-star cast and trigger-happy satirical zest, is Bob Roberts. Tim Robbins, deified by Cannes as the star of Robert Altman's anti-Hollywood spoof The Player (current Golden Palm favourite), wrote, directed and gave himself the lead role in this Awful Warning romp about a pop singer turned neo-fascist senatorial candidate. Gore Vidal turns up as a waspish political veteran and Giancarlo Esposito as a radical black journalist; plus Susan Sarandon, James Spader, Alan Rickman and more stars than you can find walking the Croisette. If you were watching for political subtlety, you would leave after five minutes. Robbins's targets are made of straw and he peppers them with a blunderbuss. But the film boasts a snazzy storytelling style - all Steadicam bustle and spitfire close-ups - and makes deft use of newsreel mock-ups in the style of Citizen Kane. Elsewhere, films are going down with all hands at Cannes 1992. Even the ones that begin with a blaze of ambition - like Vincent Ward's globe-hopping Eskimo-makes-good tale Map Of The Human Heart or Fernando Solanas's sardonic history of post-Columbian America The Voyage - are soon sinking towards oblivion. And as films clock up 2-, 3-, 4-hour running times, panic is caused in the scheduling department. Some critics have turned up for 8 pm screenings only to be told that the film began at 7. Not surprisingly, they adjourn to the nearest bar to fill up with four-star Fernet Branca. Is there a moral in the artistic decrepitude of this festival? Yes. I suspect we are seeing the convergence of two catastrophic tendencies to create a Chaos Theory of late-century cinema. To the East as I speak, Europe is breaking up as a once-rich consortium of individual cultures. It is becoming a wasteland for co-production carpetbaggers. (Look and quail at Cannes samples like The Last Butterfly, a Nazi melodrama with Tom Courtenay adrift in ill-dubbed Czechoslovakia). And to the West, America is hurling at us its short-attention Video Age no-brainers. Woe upon a festival that has to open with Basic Instinct and close with the new Tom Cruise vehicle. No wonder Britain, secure in a middle ground, has contributed two of the three current favourites for Golden Palm. If you have shirts, prepare to shred them now. Put one third on Robert Altman's The Player; one third on Howards End; and one third on Terence Davies's touching self-portrait in celluloid The Long Day Closes. Screened last night, this proved a hit with everyone except the French. But then who sets store by the French these days? They were responsible for mounting this apology for a film festival.</p>

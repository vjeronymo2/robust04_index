			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Engineer Victor Joy Way, vice president of the  CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress], yesterday voiced his  concern about a document that the Army Public Relations Office  (OIEP) has sent to the barracks, in which several media--LA  REPUBLICA among them--are said to be the presumed authors of "a  smear campaign against the Peruvian Army."    Joy Way said he is concerned about everything having to do  with freedom of expression--despite the fact that it is does not  deal with his specific area--particularly because during the  government of engineer Alberto Fujimori, "absolute press freedom  has been guaranteed, with no restrictions whatsoever."    For his part, Oswaldo Sandoval, chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, said that the government guarantees  unrestricted freedom of expression. [passage omitted]</p>

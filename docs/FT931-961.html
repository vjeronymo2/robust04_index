			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland reverse The prospect of a rising tax charge in this year and in 1994 and an uncovered dividend served to reverse an early rise in Redland shares. They were strong at first, climbing to 499p after revealing a 19 per cent increase in in preliminary profits and a maintained dividend. But following the meeting with the company, the shares came under heavy pressure as some analysts cast doubts over the dividend and took a bearish stance on the outlook in Germany, one of Redland's real successes this year. The shares dipped to the day's low point of 459p before picking up to close a net 21 off at 467p. Turnover was above 5.3m shares. Other building specialists pointed out, however, that much of the selling in Redland reflected profit-taking after the stock's 15 per cent outperformance over the past quarter. 'If one accepts the dividend will be maintained, the stock offers a highly attractive 6.7 per cent yield,' said one. Headline Book Publishing jumped 12 to 258p after better than expected profits - up 58 per cent - and the 20 per cent increase in final dividend. Analysts were nudging future profits estimates higher yesterday's figures. Both leisure and drinks stocks were affected by the UBS Phillips and Drew programme trade. Among these, Bass retreated 12 to 549p, Whitbread 9 to 461p and Grand Metropolitan 5 to 451p, although the latter did rally on US support. There was good two-way business in hotel stocks. Queens Moat Houses was steady at 45p in turnover of 9.8m and Forte slipped a penny to 197p on 6.1m traded. While results from Booker were in line with expectations, analysts did not like the details, in particular the gearing figure and the cautious note struck on food distribution at the company meeting. The shares fell sharply and continued to come off for most of the day, finishing 29 down at 410p. Food specialists said the fall had made the stock attractive on a yield basis and that a correction may be due. One analyst said that while the pain had been felt in the results for 1992, worries about longer-term earnings growth remained. A profits warning from Dalepak Food sent the shares tumbling, closing 63 down at 201p, after touching 194p. Argyll Group found some support from NatWest Securities and Lehman Brothers and the shares rose 4 to 348p. Asda retreated 1 3/4 p to 69 1/2 p with some suggestions in the market that recent sales talk growth may have been exaggerated. Talk of a price war in the DIY market rumbled on, hitting related stocks in its wake. Boots fell 9 to 499p and WH Smith dropped 14 to 410p. The two groups own Do It All. Ladbroke, owner of Texas, shed 4 to 195p. However, Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, basked in post-results comments and rose 6 to 550p. Shares in Laird Group, car components and industrial products, put on 4 to 280p, on speculation, confirmed shortly after the market closed, that it is to pay a second interim dividend of 6.3 p next month, instead of a final payment, making a total of 10.5p for 1992. Market watchers said the move was related to the revised ACT rules announced in the Budget earlier this month. A 22 per cent profits fall and unfavourable analysts' meeting sent shares in APV, the food manufacturing equipment maker, tumbling. They gave up 11 to 101p, having been lower earlier in the session as analysts reduced current year estimates. Trading worries, general profit-taking and a broker's sell recommendation combined to exact a toll on Weir Group, the Glasgow- based engineering company, which reported a 14.5 per cent improvement in profits earlier this week. The shares gave up 11 to 638p. NatWest Securities advised investors to sell saying the company, 'will not so much disappoint as fail to provide the acceleration in earnings growth that will be essential during the recovery phase to avoid the shares underperforming.' Lines of shares were said to have been available in several stocks in the engineering and aerospace sectors. These included Siebe which closed 4 lighter at 445p, and TI Group, also down 3 at 299p. Smiths Industries also suffered from the same fate with a block of around 250,000 said to have been looking for a home. The shares closed 2 off at 334p. Merchant banks fell heavily on profit-taking. Hambros, unsettled by news that the Norwegian Guarantee Institute is appealing against a judgement for Hambros relating to the collapse of the Reksten shipping firm in the late 1970's, dropped 19 to 332p. Schroders non-voting stock fell 68 to 1495p, Kleinwort Benson 8 to 385p and SG Warburg 15 to 626p. The NatWest Securities buy recommendation continued to drive BT shares higher. They closed 10 1/2 up at 430 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 14m shares.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: Economists look in vain for the spectacular ON THE face of it, 1993 looks as though it could be a tough year for the US bond market, a year of rising interest rates, revived inflation and a widening federal budget deficit. This is the pessimists' view. Recent figures suggest that the anaemic economic recovery may finally be picking up pace, something which could quickly feed through into higher interest rates and higher inflation. Moreover, a Democrat is heading for the White House, a Democrat who has promised to cut middle-class taxes and increase government spending, while offering little in the way of a credible policy to reduce the government deficit. If all this is true, then why are some of Wall Street's most respected economists predicting that bond market prices will rise and long-term yields fall this year? Although there is no real consensus among economists about what will happen to the economy in 1993, on balance economists seem more confident predicting that long rates will stay at or drop lower than their current levels of 7.3 per cent, than they do about warning of higher rates. Those forecasting lower rates - the most bullish predicts the yield on the long bond will drop to 6.5 per cent by the middle of next year - are pinning their hopes on sluggish economic growth in the first half. They believe the rise in economic activity seen since the third quarter of 1992 will be a bout of unsustainable post-election euphoria. They point out that incomes remain depressed, that the labour market has shown few signs of recovering from the recession, and that consumers remain debt-averse, all of which should act as a drag on economic growth. Recessionary conditions in overseas economies are expected to hold back US growth. The optimists believe that inflation, the long bond's greatest enemy, looks soundly beaten, for now. Nothing in the most recent prices data suggested that the long-established disinflationary trend would be reversed soon. Commodity and oil prices are likely to remain low. Productivity will continue to improve, which with the lack of real job and income growth, will depress the rate of price rises. The final piece in the puzzle is politics. In the latter stages of last year's election campaign, bond prices dropped sharply and yields jumped on fears that President Clinton would introduce an aggressive fiscal stimulus package that would widen the deficit and lead to an overheated, inflation-plagued economy. However, since his victory, Mr Clinton has softened the tone of his growth-oriented campaign policy pledges, partly because he has faced up to the political realities of a large budget deficit, and partly because he has been encouraged by the improvement in economic conditions. If growth does remain weak, inflation and domestic interest rates low, and President Clinton introduces only modestly stimulative fiscal policies, and especially if German interest rates finally begin to come down, then the forecast of long-term bond yields at or below 7 per cent does not look overly optimistic. However, for every bull, there is a bear, and economists do not have to be especially bearish to warn that rates could begin to pick up in the second half of this year. On the economic front, growth could improve if the labour market responds to fiscal stimuli aimed at creating jobs - which Mr Clinton insists remains his biggest priority. As Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities in New York, said: 'Somehow, somewhere there's going to be stronger growth, and that flies in the face of expectations that interest rates will go down a lot more.' Whoever is right or wrong, the bond market is unlikely to do anything spectacular this year. Economic growth in 1992 will probably end at about 3 per cent, and a recent survey of Wall Street forecasts for 1993 showed that economists expect growth this year to be between 2.7 per cent and 3.2 per cent. Hardly the recipe for bond market madness.</p>

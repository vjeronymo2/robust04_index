			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: Cost of expansionary fiscal policy in Japan of key significance Sir, I would like to comment on the recent editorials (August 19 and September 1) regarding the Japanese fiscal authority's inaction over the current economic problem. Because these attributed the delay of measures solely to the authority's misjudgment of the economy, I think the most important factor in the argument was missing. This is the cost of expansionary fiscal policy, which the authority always calculates much higher than others do because of its belief that the budget deficit cannot be reduced at an economically desirable pace. The higher the cost, the more the economic situation needs to be recognised as serious to adopt a drastic expansionary policy. l wonder how many economists and journalists, not to mention politicians, who strongly advocated Japanese fiscal expansion on this occasion will show the same enthusiasm about reduction of the budget deficit if the fiscal authority has difficulty with it at a later stage. If the fiscal authority thought it would have as much support for cutting the budget deficit as for expanding it, its judgment would come closer to one based on purely economic factors. Although the articles cited the general government budget surplus of Japan as evidence of room for flexibility, the central government budget shows one of the worst situations among G5 countries, with debt-related service exceeding 20 per cent of the total expense. The difference between the deficit of the central government budget and the general government surplus is mainly attributable to the surplus of the social pension fund. However, this is the source of future payments to pensioners and is mainly used through the Fiscal Investment Loan Programme, which also plays an important role in economic policy. Owing to the rapid ageing of Japanese society, future payments from the pension fund are expected to increase dramatically. Under such circumstances, if the government used up this surplus in expenditure not loans, as your articles suggest, it would soon face severe difficulties. Certainly, the authority should make optimum effort to achieve accurate economic assessment. But the others, or at least the economists and the journalists, also need to pay more attention to the political reality of the budget cut process. Until we reach this situation we may have to live with the ironical balance between neglect of the economic reality and of the political one. Naturally the result will have to come with some delay, owing to the present distance from reality. However, this may be the second best solution at the moment.

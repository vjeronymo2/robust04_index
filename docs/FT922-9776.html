			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Edgars falls short of management forecasts EDGARS, the clothing and footwear group in the South African Breweries chain, unveiled an increase in earnings in the year to March, but significantly underperformed management forecasts. Sales rose by 11 per cent to R2.75bn (Dollars 950m) but tighter margins saw operating profit rise by only 6 per cent to R373.2m. Attributable earnings rose by 5 per cent to R157.5m. The figures compare with management forecasts, made in July last year, that sales would rise by 19 per cent and profits by 17 per cent. Mr Mark Bower, financial director, said that management had not foreseen the continued stagnation of the gold price, the drought, and continued high interest rates, all of which hurt consumer spending. Mr Bower said sales had risen by 17 per cent in the first three months, but a precipitate decline had set in in September when official figures indicated sectoral sales dropped by 3.4 per cent. He added that sales in the first quarter of 1992 had been 'disastrous'. He forecast sales and earnings growth for the year of about 12 per cent  - in line with inflation. Earnings and dividends per share rose 5 per cent, to 310 cents and 119 cents respectively.</p>

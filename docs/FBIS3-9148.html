			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Robert Levi: "Prince Turned Out To Be a </F> Beggar"]    [Text] Before the plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  [BSP] held yesterday, 13 March, there was much talk about the  luxurious cloak of pluralism that the BSP wanted to show off in  the fashion show that they called a "debate." A show did indeed  take place, but the models on the catwalk lacked variety, and  this clearly demonstrated that the king was naked.    The gray-hairs were the first to gasp with horror at the  cloak. They started complaining that the fashion designers had  not included some very important accessories that they had  suggested. In the "Panorama" program on television on the  evening of 12 March, [BSP leader] Zhan Videnov assured them that  the king's clothes were made up of at least five pieces, and  that one of these was theirs.    However, in the show itself it turned out that the assembled  fans of the king prefer one-piece designs, such as a sack with  holes cut out for the head and arms. This was what the chief  tailor Aleksandur Lilov actually proposed. He presented his  design, called "New Times, a New Bulgaria, a New BSP," but at  the very start apologized because, due to lack of funds, it was  a more gaudy version of the miserable garments in which the  party emerged from the 39th and 40th BSP Congresses, which were  the "Manifesto for Democratic Socialism" and the "Platform for  Further Renewal of the BSP." Aleksandur Lilov passed over with  smile the creation of his chief competitor -- the house of  Kyuranov, Yonchev, Dureva, and Sons. The public also ignored  them, finding their well-known extravagance all too familiar.  For this reason, the debates centered on the draft document,  not the draft documents. This time, the extravagance of the  social democrats in the BSP showed itself in the fact that the  only difference between their draft document and Lilov's was its  length -- they set their faith in placing "personnel mines"  (again due to lack of funds).    The other designers, from the "Marxist Platform,"  Alternative  Socialist Association, and "Road to Europe," contented  themselves with saying that they would present their versions in  a week's time, and that they would not be different, but merely  a critical comment on the main design. Some wanted to tack onto  the latter a piece on the left side, others wanted to put it on  the right side, and yet others wanted to cover up the holes cut  out in the front -- that is, in the center.    Some observers on the sidelines expressed their amazement  that all the models looked as if they had come out of the same  fashion house, with all of them carrying the same decoration in  the very front, namely "democratic socialism." In addition, all  of them circle around the hat of "power."    At the end the chief advertising agent [DUMA Editor in  Chief]  Stefan Prodev complained that no money was available to publish  individual photographs of the models, which were in any case  identical.    In the final analysis, what emerged from the meeting will be  demonstrated to the people in the next elections, so that all  will be able to see that the king is naked and the prince is a  beggar. Otherwise, the show goes on.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / CBI calls for change in audit control THE AUDITING Practices Board should be moved from the control of the professional accountancy bodies and placed under the independent umbrella of the Financial Reporting Council, the Confederation of British Industry has recommended, Andrew Jack writes. In a detailed submission to the board, the CBI opposes big changes in the existing framework of auditing, but says a change in control of the board is desirable. The submission was first made several weeks ago, but in new documents in response to the Cadbury report on corporate governance, the CBI renews its call for a rationalisation of accounting and auditing bodies. The CBI criticises proposals to rotate audit firms or audit partners and also attacks the idea that the audit requirement for small companies should be lifted. It says auditors could not be put under a duty to detect fraud or other illegal acts. Auditors could not be expected to act as a public watchdog without consulting a company's directors and are constrained by evidence, confidentiality and defamation. The CBI says auditors should continue to be allowed to offer consulting services to clients and that proposals for rotation of audit firms would bring a risk of greater audit failures. It also criticises suggestions from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and from Cadbury that interim and preliminary accounts should be audited. Two thirds of accountants believe the existing self-regulation mechanisms for auditors are inadequate and half support the idea of an independent body created by the government, a survey by Robert Half, recruitment consultants, indicated yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- As expected, none of the five  candidates for the office of federal president has achieved the  necessary absolute majority of 663 votes in the first Federal  Assembly ballot. Of the l,317 valid votes cast, 604 went to the  CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]  candidate Roman Herzog. The SPD [Social Democratic Party]  candidate and North Rhine-Westphalian Minister-President  Johannes Rau received 505 votes. The FDP [Free Democratic  Party] candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher received l32 votes.  The east German civil rights campaigner Jens Reich received 62  votes, and the candidate of the right-wing Republicans, Hans  Hirzel, received 12 votes. There were two abstentions, and two  votes were invalid.    Thus a second ballot is required where once again an  absolute  majority for the election of the new federal president is  needed. A simple majority is sufficient in a third ballot.</p>

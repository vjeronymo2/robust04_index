			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Plot-boiling 900 Oneonta - Theatre The plays of Tennessee Williams are like bowls of exotic tropical fruit captured on the turn from bloated ripeness to nascent rottenness. David Beaird, in this impressive pastiche of the master of Deep South Gothic, glories in portraying the fruit in galloping decay. He is totally over the top, leaving audiences suspended in that strange hinterland between the heart-grip of melodrama and the hysteria of farce. This is the day that Dandy, the oil-rich tycoon who rules his Louisiana brood like an oriental despot, knows he is to die. He has done with hypocrisies and wants his family to finally face up to the home truths - the usual melange of incest, abortions, drugs and drink and low sperm counts. As the skeletons tumble out of the capacious closet so do the yawns of recognition. But Beaird, who also directs, has an ace up his sleeve. Dandy is to make a new will, leaving everything to ne'er do well grandson Tiger, who by whoring, shooting and boozing his way through town at least shows signs of having enough spunk in him to keep the dynasty going. If Tiger does not come to his senses enough to accept the fortune, and responsibility for the business, within an hour then the money goes to the Church, represented by Father Bourette (Kieron Jecchenis) who has popped in to supervise the last rites. This makes for an exciting second half, much stronger than the first in every way. At the opening Leland Crooke as Dandy conveys the approach of hell-fire in a screeching, stressful, performance which wearied me as much as it wearied him. After the interval, as the family's future falls on Tiger, so does the burden of carrying the whole play. Ben Daniels, all blond mane and bare-chested glory, copes magnificently as he toys with wimpish brother Gitlo (Jon Cryer, a mess of nervous body wringing and manic self-justification); bombed-out sister Burning Jewel (Elli Garnett); and whore Palace (a tough, tart, performance from Sophie Okonendo). Having got his plot boiling away like a bowl of jambalaya Beaird has problems coming to a conclusion. There are any number of false curtains, and in the end he goes for the Big One, with Dandy's family assuming a metaphor for the United States, which has squandered its inheritance in dissipation, and should hand over to a new generation - a generation with its blood flowing fresh and uncorrupted from a cultural melting pot. Some of the acting is hit and miss, perhaps because the format of the play favours caricatures - the alcoholic wife; the faithful black servant. But when Beaird lets himself go in a rich, sensual, erotic, often witty, language, especially in the speeches of Tiger and Dandy, then the play transcends its hotchpotch origins and becomes a powerful, poetic force. Tim Shortall has designed a convincingly realistic set, all slats, rich vegetation and whirring fan, with enough thunder and lightening to suggest that God is taking a close interest in his potential inheritance. This is the first work of the West End Producers Alliance, which hopes to bring a new audience to the theatre by cutting seat prices. It is an excellent introduction, an out-of-control roller-coaster, but with enough gripping images to show just how real the unreality of the stage can be. The Old Vic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Meteorological  Bureau stresses cultivation of Tibetan professionals for the  weather forecast sector.    Since 1981, the bureau has selected 520 Tibetans from the  region and sent them to study in specialized schools and  universities in inland provinces.    Now the proportion of Tibetan weather men to the total has  increased from 18.6 percent to 70.3 percent.    Of all technological personnel in the Tibet meteorological  sector, the Tibetan technicians account for more than 50 percent.    Purpu Cering is the first Tibetan to graduate from Nanjing  Meteorology Institute, China's most prestigious in the field,  with a master's degree. Last year, he went to the United States  to participate in a modern meteorology program with the  recommendation of the National Meteorological Bureau.    The 25-year-old engineer completed several research projects  and returned with high praise from Chinese and foreign experts.    This year, the Tibet Meteorological Bureau selected six  young  Tibetans to enter Nanjing Meteorology Institute's master's  program.</p>

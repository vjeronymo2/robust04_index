Jordanian political sources said the government ordered out  the Iranians because of their contacts with Islamic  fundamentalists.    The ministry informed the Iranian authorities about the move  at the beginning of January, giving the diplomats two months to  leave.    The official reason was that Jordan wanted to reach a  balance  between the number of diplomats in each country, as Jordan had  only two in Tehran.    Jordan and Iran resumed diplomatic relations in January 1991  after a 10-year break.    Tehran severed relations with Amman because of its support  for Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988.    The Iranian embassy in Amman reopened in March 1991 and  Jordan's embassy in Tehran soon after.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Books: Along the humdrum highway THE GRANTA BOOK OF THE AMERICAN SHORT STORY edited by Richard Ford Granta Books Pounds 16.99, 710 pages 'ALL MODERN American literature' said Ernest Hemingway, 'comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.' Hemingway was referring to Twain's vernacular style which, if he did not actually invent it, he made triumphant use of. This, often coupled with the use of the first person, has enabled post-Twain American writers to tackle in a wholly satisfying way an area of life which can sometimes prove a minefield. Simply put, this area of life deals with the superficially humdrum experiences of ordinary people, and in particular the poignant transition from innocence to experience. Sherwood Anderson's story 'I'm A Fool' is a good example, but Ring Lardner, William Carlos Williams, John Steinbeck, Erskine Caldwell and Hemingway himself have also made this area their own. Nowhere is their skill more apparent than in the short story. It is therefore particularly interesting to have a 700-odd page anthology of American stories selected by one of their younger writers. Somerset Maugham, who produced an equally large collection in 1947, asserted that 'in none of the countries of Europe has the short story been so assiduously cultivated as in the United States.' Richard Ford does not seem convinced. In his rambling introduction he is strangely offhand about the distinctive contribution of American writers. He quotes - with some disbelief - Frank O'Connor's praise in 1962, but he does not seem to have read Maugham or any of the other commentators who have hit the same note - HE Bates, for example, who professed an 'abiding respect for the short story in America'. Apart from this one feels that The Granta Book of the American Short Story should have been sub-titled . . . since the Second World War, for that is where it starts. Everyone else begins with Irving, Hawthorne, Poe, Melville, James, Crane et alia. Not that this matters very much, provided the guidelines are made clear. But Richard Ford does not make them clear. In fact he is so downbeat that we could be dealing with his namesake, Harrison. It is only after reading all of his selected 43 stories that one realises what he is driving at. He begins with some old chestnuts of the forties and fifties - for example, Paul Bowles's account of the professor who had his tongue cut out in North Africa, Robert Penn Warren's 'Blackberry Winter', Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery' and Flannery O'Connor's 'Good Country People'. These stories reveal the underside of human nature without any attempt at catharsis. With Donald Barthelme's 'The Indian Uprising' (another favourite anthology piece) we enter the post-modernist sixties. But there is only a breath of this before we are ushered into the true holy land, the land of Raymond Carver, Oregonian manual labourer and master of the minimalist mode. Carver is king because he successfully follows Ford's own approach to fiction, that is, that you write because 'lived life somehow isn't enough'. Carver's contribution is therefore a significant advance over the nastiness of Bowles and the naturalistic melodrama of Flannery O'Connor. His writing is not only in the vernacular but flat, low keyed, understated. It is also strangely moving, reminiscent in fact of that neglected master Ring Lardner, who was so admired by that other Middle Western writer, Ernest Hemingway. And it was of course Hemingway who propounded the iceberg theory of literature - that you show only one-fifth of your material. The other four-fifths lie below the surface. The criterion is what Hemingway called 'writing truly', for which purpose he said the writer had to have a built in 'shit-detector'. Carver undoubtedly had one of these useful pieces of equipment and so presumably does Ford, although he modestly leaves himself out. Blake insisted on 'minute particulars'. TS Eliot said that the art lay in finding the 'objective correlative'. Ford calls it finding the 'fact' ('Standards almost always come after the fact'). That is why the last story - 'The Things They Carried', by Tim O'Brien, about the Vietnam war - strikes the right note. Richard Ford's anthology shows how successfully contemporary American writers have returned to the path that Twain trod, even though that path is by now a six-lane highway.</p>

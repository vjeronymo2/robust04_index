A series of resignations  have been noted, which is quite unfortunate. "From Mauritania,  Salem Meshbour Salem reports:"    [Begin Salem recording] "The UDP represents the third  political force in Mauritania, after Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed  Taya's ruling Democratic and Social Republican Party and Ahmed  Ould Daddah's Union of Democratic Forces, which is the leading  opposition party. The UDP was established in June 1993 by Hamdi  Ould Moukniess, a former foreign minister between 1960 to 1978  under the First Republic." At the time he established the  party, Moukniess, who was already very famous in his country,  was joined by most of the former ministers of Mauritania's first  president, Moctar Ould Dada, with the aim of initiating dialogue  between the government and the opposition to resolve the serious  problems confronting Mauritania. "Among these problems was  national unity, since the fabric of the community had been  seriously damaged in 1986, 1987, and especially 1989 during the  incidents with Senegal. UDP leader Moukniess belongs to the  first group of Mauritanian intellectuals, who rejected the  falsification of the cultural identity of the various  communities which compose the Mauritanian people." For  Moukniess, Mauritania belongs to both the Arabo-Berbers and the  Negro-Africans, while nationalists believe that Mauritania is  simply an Arab country.    "The UDP, which straightaway involved itself in the real  problems confronting Mauritania, has just suffered a staggering  blow with the resignation of many key personalities from its  executive committee. The reason given was differences over  political policy. Significant among those who have left are,  Mohamed Ali Cherif, former secretary general of the presidency  of the Republic under Moctar Ould Dada and chairman of the  external relations committee of the party; [name indistinct],  chairman of the economic committee; Yarba Ould Tayir, youth and  sports officer; and [name indistinct], UDP information officer.  The party leadership has not reacted yet to the founding  members' resignation. Their departure, of course, weakens the  ranks of the Mauritanian opposition." [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority, place not given, by Sa'id  Mu'addi; date not given; from the "With The Midday Events"  feature -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the Palestinian  [National] Authority will hold its first meeting in Tunis  tomorrow. What is on its agenda?    [Sha'th] The first meeting is needed to determine the action  plan for moving toward Gaza and Jericho and the Palestinian  land. This is the first meeting. Portfolios or responsibilities  should be distributed among the members. We will complete the  appointment of the other members. The total number of members  should be 24. We will prepare a detailed plan of action for  this authority and for its departure as soon as possible for  Gaza and Jericho. We will also discuss the plan for completing  the negotiations that will enable the early assumption of powers  in the West Bank and the completion of what has not been  completed in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    [Mu'addi] Will the names of the remaining members of the  Palestinian Authority be announced tomorrow?    [Sha'th] This will be discussed tomorrow. If agreement is  reached on all the names, then they will be made public.  Otherwise, some of the names will be announced, and the others  after going to Gaza and Jericho.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, reports mention that the  Palestine National Council [PNC] will soon meet in Gaza to  strike off the National Charter provisions on Israel. What do  you have to say to this?    [Sha'th] This is one of the matters brother President Yasir  'Arafat and Minister Peres had agreed upon. What is important  is the the PNC meeting in Gaza will be an important meeting  because it will bestow more legitimacy on the new Palestinian  authority and will discuss many issues, and most certainly the  PLO's commitments vis-a-vis the reciprocal recognition that took  place last September.    [Mu'addi] When do you expect the PNC to meet?    [Sha'th] I do not expect it to meet before the Palestinian  National Authority is firmly established on the ground and there  is a real beginning of work, and complete security. I do not  expect this to take place very soon.    [Mu'addi] Major General Amnon Shahaq communicated to you  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's request concerning Mr. Yasir  'Arafat's commitment to the agreement in light of the recent  statements in Johannesburg?    [Sha'th] The truth is that there is an ongoing dialogue  between us. It goes without saying that President 'Arafat  abides by this agreement which he himself signed in Cairo on 4  May. He has no intention not to abide by what he has committed  himself to. I believe that the Palestinian National Authority  will certainly reemphasize the Palestinian side's abidance by  this agreement.    [Mu'addi] Has Mr. 'Arafat replied to Mr. Rabin's request in  this respect?    [Sha'th] The truth is that there are psychological and  political matters in politics. I do not believe that what is  requested is political, meaning that the one who signs an  agreement abides by it. If he does not abide by his first  signature, how can he be asked for another signature? The  question is one of confidence. I believe there can be no doubt  as to President 'Arafat's commitment to this agreement.  President 'Arafat does not need a new piece of paper. If there  is no confidence, then to what extent can one trust the new  piece of paper? I believe the question is purely psychological.  President 'Arafat is committed to what he had signed. We hope  that the Israeli side is too. I hope that we would not wage  this battle of statements. If one wages such a battle, then  there are many statements by the Israeli side which one cannot  accept as an expression of good intention about maintaining this  agreement and its other requirements. I specifically have in  mind Mr. [Yosi] Sarid's statements on President 'Arafat as mayor  of Jericho municipality. This is something that is not in line  with the agreement that President 'Arafat and Prime Minister  Rabin had signed. I hope that this period of no confidence will  be brief and that we all prove on the ground that we are  completely serious in our commitment to all that we have signed  and that we wish to proceed forward because this agreement is a  transitional agreement, and we want to complete it by many other  stages until we reach the definitive peace agreement that will  set the bases of just and lasting peace among our two people.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question: Is 10 June the date  when Mr. 'Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the self-rule area?    [Sha'th] This is what we will discover tommorrow in the  meeting in Tunis, God willing.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian  Authority, thank you.</p>

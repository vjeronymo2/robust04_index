			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW ELLIS, GARY LARSON GOT TO 'DOGGIN' AROUND' COVER  </P> <P> The Gary Larson/Herb Ellis connection isn't as far out as it seems. A few years  ago, a friendship developed following a performance that Ellis gave at the Jazz  Alley in Seattle. Larson, a Seattle resident and Ellis aficionado, is the  cartoonist whose Far Side strip appears in more than 900 newspapers. He is also  a guitarist who took one of Ellis' albums to the club for an autograph.  </P> <P> Larson is known as the creator of an absurdist, sometimes sinister world where  animals do the unnatural, i.e. act like humans. A female moose, for example, in  a slip and curlers, hands a phone to her husband, who's sitting in an easy  chair, and says: "It's the call of the wild."  </P> <P> Larson says he is inspired by listening to Ellis and a handful of other jazz  musicians while he works. When the cartoon juices aren't flowing, he stops to  strum for awhile, he has said.  </P> <P> When Ellis asked Larson to design the "Doggin' Around" album cover, the  cartoonist agreed on the following terms: payment could be rendered in the form  of a $5-million check or a guitar lesson.  </P> <P> Ellis accepted the teaching gig. The 39-year-old cartoonist flew to Fairfield  Bay, Ark., and the lesson turned into a three-day session with Ellis at his  home.  </P> <P> Larson then designed the Herb Ellis and Red Mitchell album cover with typical  flair. The guitarist and bassist are hound dogs, as are the club's customers  being served by a poodle at tables with cards that read, "Please keep table  barking to a minimum."  </P> <P> Mutts are featured on a wall of fame. The lavatory is indicated by a fire  hydrant symbol and a stuffed cat hangs in the far corner. On the back of the  jacket, Larson writes: "Nothing gets my own juices going like the sounds  (Ellis) and Red have turned out here."  </P> <P> What's next for the odd couple? Ellis has told Carl Jefferson, president of  Concord Records, the company that produced "Doggin' Around": "I asked him  (Larson) to do a guest shot on my next album."  </P> <P> On hiatus in New York after completion of his book, "The Prehistory of the Far  Side," Larson is "seeking out good guitarists, meeting with them and playing  with them," according to Concord Records' Merrilee Troost. Among those  guitarists is Ellis, whose weeklong engagement at the Blue Note in Manhattan in  June drew Larson there each night.  </P></p>

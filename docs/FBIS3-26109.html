Civil rights are rights protected by the coercive power  of the state.    In accordance with laws and regulations, citizens and legal  persons are entitled to many kinds of civil rights. According  to different standards, civil rights can be classified into  various categories:    1. Personal rights and property rights (classified according  to whether or not civil rights are directly composed of  property).    Personal rights are civil rights which are inalienable from  the subject of the rights and do not consist of property.  Personal rights are also called non-property personal rights.  Personal rights can also be classified into personality rights  and right of status. The former is a civil right that is  inalienable from the civil subject and is in force throughout  the period of his existence. The latter is a civil right whose  existence is based on a definite relationship of status.    Property rights are civil rights that have material content  and directly embody economic benefit. Property rights mainly  include ownership, creditor's rights, and inheritance rights.    Under some circumstances, personal rights and property  rights  are combined. For example, intellectual property rights include  both property rights and personal rights.    2. Absolute right and relative right (classified according  to  the scope of obligatory subjects involved in civil rights).    Absolute right, also called right in rem, refers to  obligations which all persons other than the subject of the  right shall not interfere with or violate. Therefore, as a  general rule, the exercise of absolute right does not depend on  the action of an obligatory subject. Personal rights and  property rights are both absolute rights. Their exercise does  not depend on actions initiated by other persons.    Relative right, also called right in personam, refers to the  right enjoyed by the subject of a particular right to the  subject of a particular obligation. As a general rule, the  exercise of relative right depends on actions intitiated by the  subject of a particular obligation. Creditor's right is a  relative right, which finds its expression in the fact that only  the creditor has a right to claim payment from the debtor, and  his right as a creditor can only be realized by the debtor's  fulfillment of his obligation.    It should be noted that all civil rights, being not above  the  law, are limited and restricted. Absolute and relative rights  do not mean such rights are absolute or relative. They are  classified in accordance with the scope of obligatory subjects  who are under the restriction of the rights, that is, whether  they refer to a particular person or not.    3. Right of petition and right of initiative (classified  according to function).    Right of petition refers to a right by which the subject of  the right makes other persons undertake or not undertake a  certain action. Creditor's right is a right of petition.    Right of initiative refers to the right by which the subject  of the right brings about changes in the effect of a civil law  through his own actions. The right of referendum and right of  recall are rights of initiative.    4. Primary right and secondary right (classified according  to  the degree of interrelatedness and interdependence of civil  rights).    Among two or more interrelated and interdependent civil  rights, the one whose independent existence does not depend on  any other civil rights is called a primary right; the one whose  existence is based on the premise of other civil rights or  depends on other civil rights is called a secondary right. For  example, mortgage right is a secondary right, while creditor's  right, which is guaranteed by mortgage right, is a primary  right. Mortgage right has been established to guarantee the  primary claim. The existence of mortgage right depends on the  primary creditor's right; when the latter ceases to exist,  mortgage right also ceases to exist.    China's "General Code of Civil Law" stipulates that a legal  person's legitimate civil rights and interests are protected by  law from violation by any organization or individual. While  confirming and protecting the legitimate rights of civil  subjects, the "General Code of Civil Law" demands that the civil  subject exercise his civil rights in accordance with law.    Civil rights consist of certain interests. When the owner of  such rights realizes these interests, he exercises his rights.  When the owner of such rights realizes the content of the  rights, through certain action performed by himself or someone  else, he exercises civil rights. Civil rights can only be  enjoyed by their owner; but civil rights can be exercised by  someone else. This is the main difference between exercising  civil rights and enjoying civil rights.    The legitimate civil rights and interests of citizens and  legal persons are protected by law. No one is allowed to  violate such rights and interests. Persons who violate the  legitimate civil rights and interests of citizens and legal  persons shall bear legal responsibility according to law. When  his civil rights are violated, the owner of such rights is  entitled to ask his violators to stop such violation and  compensate for the losses. He can also request, through  administrative procedure, relevant government departments to  protect his rights or directly initiate legal action with the  people's court and ask for protection. Lawsuit protection is  the most effective legal protection for civil rights.</p>

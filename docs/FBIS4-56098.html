			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 26 May (TANJUG) -- The Executive Council of  the Party of Democratic Action [SDA--Stranka Demokratske Akcije]  in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM], also referred to here as "the imported party" or  "Izetbegovic's party," issued a statement expressing its  indignation at Stojan Andov, the president of the Macedonian  parliament. The statement says that Andov "is deliberately  trying to deny the existence of a considerable group of citizens  who nationally consider themselves Muslim." The SDA has not  been invited to take part in the talks that members of the  commission of the European Council's parliamentary assembly, who  are not Council members, [as received], held with members of  ethnic groups in Macedonia in Ohrid on 24 May.    It has been noted several times over the past two or three  years in Skopje that the SDA has been trying to turn the Islamic  population originally from Serbia, Montenegro, and former  Bosnia-Herzegovina--who arrived in Macedonia in the 1950's to  facilitate their emigration to Turkey, but have remained in  Macedonia because the Turks suspended immigration--into a new  national community in Macedonia.    Some Macedonian parties and associations believe that the  SDA  has recently been trying to turn these Muslim people in  Macedonia--with Serbian as their mother tongue--into some kind  of a "Bosniak" nationality. Observers in Skopje believe that  attempts to affirm the alleged existence of "Bosniaks" are part  of the Islamic fundamentalism strategy in the Balkans and  elsewhere. Journalists in Skopje noted that during his visit to  Skopje in mid-May, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Murat  Karayalcin spoke, and certainly not by accident, about the  Muslims in former Bosnia-Herzegovina--who speak the Serbian  language--as "Bosniaks." Commenting recently on the  increasingly frequent insistence that some kind of a "Bosniak  culture" exists in Macedonia, Ljubisa Georgijevski, the  president of the Forum for the Freedom of Media in Macedonia,  said in a TV program that neither "Bosniaks" nor "the Bosniak  language" exist.</p>

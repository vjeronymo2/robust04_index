			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING AT NOA NOA  </P> <P> "See this," says Kenji Seki, bouncing around with the impish energy that  endeared him to people when he was maitre d' at Chinois on Main. "Everything  custom made."  </P> <P> "Everything" includes the gorgeous wrought iron chairs, the colorful rug, the  Polynesian sconces on the wall and the crumpled copper front on the bar. It  also includes what may be the best looking restrooms in town -- also  custom-made. Put it all together and you've got Noa Noa, 464 N. Bedford Drive,  Beverly Hills, (213) 278-1904, the most extraordinary new restaurant in town.  </P> <P> The food by chef Ralf Marhencke is custom-made too. And unusual. The green  salad has Roquefort croutons, lots of flowers and a kiwi vinaigrette. Warm  oysters come in a sesame seed crust. Roasted scallops are bathed in a spicy  Thai sauce and roasted breast of chicken shares the plate with purple mashed  potatoes. Desserts include chocolate dim sum filled with banana mousse (don't  ask) and something called "hot passion," which is every bit as good as its  name. Entrees run $16.75 to $24. There's a long list of single-malt Scotches,  and an interesting wine list. RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swiss insurer on course for 'good' year Zurich Insurance, one of the world's largest insurers, said its gross premium income rose 1.4 per cent in the first half, to SFr14.2bn (Dollars 11.1bn). All three business areas - life, non-life and reinsurance - grew at roughly the same rate. Losses resulting from natural catastrophes were considerably higher than in the comparable period in 1993. The group said insurance and assumed reinsurance claims arising from the California earthquake earlier this year would reach between Dollars 85m and Dollars 90m. The life insurance division made a greater contribution to growth than in recent years. The group published no profit figure for the first half, but said it expected a 'good overall result' in the full year, provided there were no extraordinary developments on the claims, foreign exchange or financial fronts. The strength of the Swiss franc restrained premium growth rate in the first half.</p>

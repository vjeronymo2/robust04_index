			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated the following:    The Government of the Republic of Yemen has stressed its  sincere commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 924. To  this end, brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, issued repeated instructions to the forces of legitimacy  and unity to abide by the cease-fire, and he set specific hours  for that. The latest decision in this regard was conveyed to  brother Lakhdar Brahimi, representative of the UN secretary  general, who expressed appreciation for this new attempt and  hoped that it would be complied with. However, the apostate and  secessionist gang deliberately and premeditatedly insisted on  aborting all those decisions in the hope that it would be able  to peddle its criminal scheme against the homeland.    To put an end to this gang's plotting and treason, and out  of  concern to enable brother Lakhdar Brahimi to fulfill his mission  successfully, the brother chairman of the Presidential Council  and supreme commander of the Armed Forces set a new date for the  apostate and secessionist gang to comply with the cease-fire,  starting Friday midnight, 10 June. That decision was  accompanied by the new initiative of entrusting the Yemeni  military officers of the military committee, which had been set  up by a decision of the supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  with the mission of supervising the cease-fire. The committee  had been slated to meet at 1100 yesterday, Saturday, 11 June.  Although the mischievous secessionists' knew that that  initiative and new date for their compliance with the cease-fire  was conveyed to the United Nations, the permanent UN Security  Council member states, the Gulf Cooperation Council states, and  the Arab League, they persisted in their arrogance, exposing  their ill intentions, of which we had been aware. Thus, they  violated the UN Security Council resolution, hoping they would  able to continue their plotting against the homeland's unity and  safety. In this context, they have been continuing their  ground, naval, and air bombardment of the positions of the  forces of legitimacy and unity in the Aden Governorate up to the  time this statement was drafted.    Persisting in defying the will of the Yemeni people and  international legitimacy, the elements of apostasy and secession  declared rejection of the military committee's supervision of  the cease-fire implementation. They demanded that international  forces be sent to the homeland. The Government of the Republic  stresses that this is merely a new attempt to violate the  homeland's sovereignty and independence, and that that demand  has exposed premeditated intentions against UN Security Council  Resolution 924. They want to abort the basic element of that  resolution, which is ceasing fire in preparation for holding a  dialogue. The Government of the Republic of Yemen has informed  the UN envoy of its absolute readiness to start a dialogue  immediately. However, the apostate and secessionist elements'  ill intentions have been proved by the fact that they have  demanded that international forces be brought in.    Concluding his statement, the source said: The criminal,  conspiratorial schemes concocted by the plotting and agent gang  will be confronted. This gang's continued cease-fire  violations, which aim to achieve treasonous objectives, will be  confronted firmly and forcefully. This gang must bear the  consequences of its conspiracy. Seeking to dismember the  homeland and shed the Yemeni people's chaste blood, this  conspiracy proves this gang's treason and subservience. And  soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their  affairs will take [Koranic verse].</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hypo-Bank plans rights issue BAYERISCHE Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank) plans to raise around DM910m (Dollars 545m) in the next few months, through a one-for-six rights issue, to help finance its expansion. Like other German banks, the Munich-based institution experienced a big jump in profits last year. In the first 10 months, operating profits rose 24 per cent to DM1.1bn. Partial operating profits, which exclude trading on the bank's own account, were 11 per cent higher at DM972m. The bank said the new shares would be offered at DM330 each, probably from the end of April, and would rank for the full 1992 dividend. Yesterday, Hypo-Bank's shares closed at DM343, down DM2. Mr Eberhard Martini, chief executive, hinted in December that a capital increase might be implemented this year in line with the growth of the bank's business. Hypo-Bank has been expanding in east Germany, where it has 27 branches, and has just opened a subsidiary in Prague. Part of last year's higher earnings are being used to increase the bank's provisions against uninsured Soviet debt. Cover is being raised from a quarter of its exposure of nearly DM600m to more than two-thirds. It is keeping the dividend unchanged at DM13 a share.</p>

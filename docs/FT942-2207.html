			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Big oil find off Vietnam - Production of about 130,000 barrels a day expected Mitsubishi Oil of Japan yesterday announced the discovery of what could be a significant oil find off the coast of Vietnam, an area which has proved disappointing for a number of international oil companies. The find was in shallow water near the mouths of the Mekong River, well away from disputed areas further offshore. The exploration block, known as 15-2, is adjacent to the Bach Ho, or White Tiger field, which produces about 130,000 barrels a day. Officials yesterday said they 'strongly expect that the discovery will . . . lead to production on a similar scale to the Bach Ho field.' Oil from the newly discovered well is also expected to be of a similarly high quality, the company said. The Japan Vietnam Petroleum Company, a Mitsubishi subsidiary, said the 10,346 barrel a day flow rate from the exploratory well was 'one of the highest flow rates from a single production test in south-east Asia'. Another exploratory well is due to be drilled in the area, but Mitsubishi and PetroVietnam, the Vietnamese state oil company with which it has a production sharing contract, have decided to begin a feasibility study on the possible development of the field. Analysts say its proximity to the coast and shallow water depths should help to keep development costs down. Mr Gavin Law, who monitors oil developments in south-east Asia for Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh brokers, said there had been 'a lot of eagerness' on the part of the Vietnamese authorities to get another significant offshore discovery.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Klyuchenkov and Marat Salimov: "New </F> Customs Duties Evoke Protest: City Leaders and Importers Decided  Not To Allow a Price Hike"]    [Text] Russian consumers have been given hope of  keeping prices of imported food products at the existing level  and importers--of avoiding bankruptcy. The mayors of Moscow and  St. Petersburg, the chief of the administration of  Yekaterinburg, and the largest Russian importers have spoken out  against the introduction of unprecedentedly high import duties  that violate the existing system for supplying large cities with  food. Yesterday they appealed to the president and prime  minister to abolish as "ill-considered and unsubstantiated" the  government decree concerning the introduction of new customs  duties on foodstuffs.    The mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg, Yuriy Luzhkov and  Anatoliy Sobchak, and also the chief of the administration of  Yekaterinburg, Aleksandr Chernetskiy, in an open letter to the  president stated that the decision to introduce duties on  foodstuffs would inevitably lead to a sharp reduction of import  deliveries of food products and, consequently, to a considerable  increase in their prices within the country. The leaders of the  three largest cities of Russia think that the goal set with the  introduction of customs duties on food shipped into Russia--to  protect and support the domestic producer of agricultural  products--will not be achieved and instead of that the food  market in large cities will decrease to dangerous levels. In the  opinion of experts, the government, hiding behind the idea of  the need to protect national producers, is deliberately  provoking a new wave of inflation that will begin with a sharp  increase in prices for imported food, and following inevitably  after that will be higher prices for domestic food products as  well. Since the level of self-provision of food in Russia has  not even reached 90 percent, a reduction of imports could place  the largest Russian cities on the brink of famine. Of course,  after a certain time interval importers would adapt to the new  conditions, but this would be done mainly through their  reorientation toward purchasing low-quality goods from less  developed countries. In parallel with this, prices of Western  European goods, which now dominate on the markets of the large  Russian cities, would increase by no less than one-third. In any  case the Russian consumers stand to lose.    A similar demand--to abolish import duties on  foodstuffs--was  submitted to the president and government by the 12 largest  importers, including the Eksportkhleb Association, the Menatep  Trading House, the Eksimer, Medeya, and Kontinent joint-stock  companies, and the Agrointorg VTO [foreign trade association].  The traders are also demanding that their import contracts paid  for before 15 March be exempted from the decree. In this case,  if the government does not soften its position, large food  importers, about whose financial might nobody had any doubts  even a week ago, could end up on the verge of bankruptcy.    At the present time the majority of large importers have in  hand paid contracts for the delivery of goods not only in March,  but up until the end of April. These contracts have been used as  a basis for concluding agreements with large buyers. Dissolving  them will entail payment of immense fines by import firms. Since  all the traders are working using credit resources, delay in  paying interest automatically bankrupts them. According to  available information, in recent days representatives of  importers have been conducting active negotiations with a number  of highly placed members of the government in order to achieve a  softening of the conditions for the introduction of the new  rates. It is quite possible that at Viktor Chernomyrdin's  meeting with Boris Yeltsin in Sochi they will also discuss the  question of changing import conditions. Here, if one takes into  account the broad reaction evoked by the introduction of duties  on food, one can quite possibly expect that the president's  reaction (and, in concert, that of the government) will be  positive.</p>

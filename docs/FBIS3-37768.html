			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 22, BNS -- The head of political  department at the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Toivo Klaar, met  with Russia's Charge d'Affaires Anatoli Ivanov in Tallinn today  to discuss the incident that took place at the gates of a  Russian-held air base in northwestern Estonia in early hours on  Monday [21 February].    The Estonian Foreign Ministry departmental head expressed  the  country's regret at what had happened and said the Estonian  authorities will do everything to find out those guilty in the  incident. The regional police of the local Harjumaa country is  conducting the investigation, he said.    Klaar spoke about the initial results of the investigation.    But he also said Estonia considered it inadmissible that  Russia in its recent statements has presented the incident as  standing in connection with Estonia's official policy, the  Estonian Foreign Ministry press office reports.    Klaar said that Russian troops staying in Estonia against  the  will of the Estonian people are a source of potential risk.    He expressed bewilderment over the position voiced Monday by  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krolov, who sharply  denounced the pickets that took place in front of the Russian  naval garrison headquarters in Tallinn.    Klaar said Estonia as a democratic country was guaranteeing  the freedom of expression for its people, and that it is the  freedom of parliament members to take part in such pickets. He  was referring to Russia's protests over a deputy speaker of the  Estonian parliament and the former foreign minister having taken  part in picketing.    The statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry followed after  Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn had been called to the ministry in  Moscow Monday to be delivered Russia's protest on the attack  against guards in the gatehouse of the Amari air base, Estonia.    Five armed men had attacked the guardhouse, allegedly  searching for weapons and ordering a Russian officer and a  sergeant to lie on the ground outside. The attackers drove away  in their car after setting the house on fire.    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krolov turned over to  the Estonian ambassador the protest, calling the incident a  provocation and an "extremely dangerous, purposeful action that  may lead to consequences difficult to predict."    In the words of another senior official at the Russian  ministry, Sergei Prikhodko, Russia demanded from Estonia  "exhaustive explanations and punishment of the authors of and  participants in the provocation."    At the same time the pickets in front of the Russian naval  headquarters in Tallinn were termed by the official an action of  incitement. "It is namely such actions that fuel reciprocal  hostility and serve as ground for provocations like the one that  occurred at Amari," the diplomat said.</p>

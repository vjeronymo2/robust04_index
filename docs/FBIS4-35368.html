			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zaki Abu-Halawah and Muhammad Abu-Khudayr] </F>   [Excerpts] Jericho -- Brigadier General al-Hajj Isma'il  Jabr, commander of the Palestinian national security forces in  Jericho, has welcomed the decision of the Islamic Resistance  Movement, Hamas, to stop liquidating collaborators. He said:  We view this decision with great appreciation. This decision  will strengthen our national unity and mutual understanding to  overcome the current problems and frustrate all those who are  wagering on intra-Palestinian conflict.    In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, Jabr said that this  decision will restore to the Palestinian Authority its prestige,  power, and respect. This is a positive decision that will  ensure the success of the political process.    He affirmed that the Palestinian forces will resort to law  to  bring to account any Palestinian who violates security, order,  or the law. Anarchy will not be tolerated.    Jabr expressed surprise at Israeli statements calling for  moving Palestinian institutions from Jerusalem to the  Palestinian self-rule areas. He said that such statements  contradict the provisions of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement,  which put off the discussion of the future of Jerusalem to the  final stage. These statements are unilateral and unacceptable  to the Palestinians.    He said that preparations and construction are underway to  complete the main passage way for the residents of Gaza and  Jericho. The dignity of the Palestinians will be respected on  this passage way. [passage omitted]    Regarding the preparations for the arrival of Palestinian  president Yasir 'Arafat in Jericho, Jabr said that preparations  are going ahead. We are awaiting instructions on the arrival  date. There are special security arrangements that cannot be  divulged now, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Double-income family can do with this boost: Cuts 'will make a considerable difference' Mrs Keiko Miyaguchi is happy with the compromise tax plan which she expects will be a significant boost to her spending plans this year. 'We have been penny-pinching these days because the outlook has been uncertain, so it will be nice to see a cut in those taxes which make up a large proportion of our tax burden,' Mrs Miyaguchi says. With two children in college, a mortgage and an active social life, the Miyaguchis, both in their early 50s, feel they can use a boost to their double income. 'I don't think I would save the money but use it to travel, buy a new car and other goods that we have refrained from purchasing,' says Mrs Miyaguchi, who works as a filing clerk at a large firm of lawyers in central Tokyo. 'Besides, interest rates in Japan are so low it is hardly worth saving. 'My understanding is that we are in the income bracket that benefits most from the tax cut, so I think it will make a considerable difference to us,' she says. Her husband works for a large construction company and is among those who have been fortunate enough not to see their pay suffer significantly despite the recession. But not all families are as fortunate as the Miyaguchis, who receive two pay packets each month and have already bought their own home, and will see their financial burden ease as the children graduate from college over the next few years. The tax cut will have a minimal beneficial impact on lower-income families, according to studies conducted by several private think-tanks. A family with income of Y5m (Pounds 30,978) a year, will have an extra Y40,000 a year to spend, according to an independent study. That is enough for one member of the family to make a day trip from Tokyo to Kyoto, or for the family to buy a dozen or so extra beers a month.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     JAPANESE TAX CUTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal   Details                         Size   Revenue year                                     Y bn   source  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1983     Raising basic deduction,         150   Surplus in          deduction for spouse and               previous years          deduction for dependant          by Y10,000 each  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1987     Income classification          1,500   Tax free savings          simplified and special                 abolished in          deduction for spouse                   principle          introduced  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1988     Advance enforcement of         1,300   Increase of income          revision tax                           tax revenue  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989     Radical revision of            2,400   Introduction of          income tax                             consumption tax  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994     Radical tax cuts.

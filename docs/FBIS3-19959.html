Angry EU governments fear the British government has decided  to bow to the Conservative Euro-sceptics and will kick the  problem into touch until after the European Parliament elections  in June.    The last flickering chance of an agreement now rests on a  Greek presidency proposal under which the blocking minority vote  in the Council of Ministers would be set at 27 -- as the  majority want -- not 23 as the British insist. But countries in  a minority with only 23 votes could seek a delay of a few months  to try and to reach a compromise -- well short of the British  demand for an indefinite delay of such sensitive issues to at  least 1996.    If the weekend meeting of foreign ministers in the northern  Greek town on Yannina breaks up, as so many others have in  recent weeks, without an agreement, the other EU governments  will seek to ensure that the British government carries the full  blame.    It is felt that the collapse of the hoped for accession of  Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden next January would deal a  fearsome blow to the credibility of the European Union just when  it was recovering from the Maastricht controversy and the  disintegration two years ago of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.    The most likely result of renewed deadlock at Yannina is  that  the problem would be referred to the Corfu heads o government  summit in June -- after the European elections. However, even  if an agreement is then reached by the 12, the European  Parliament would not begin to discuss the treaties of accession  until the autumn.    That would rule out the four newcomers joining as planed in  January next year.    Some optimists in the Nordic countries hope that the entry  date might be put back to July next year, but most fear  accession to the EU will have to be delayed until 1996.    "Do the British realise what a powerful weapon they have  given to the anti-Europeans and do they care?" one Scandinavian  diplomat asked yesterday.    The language being used even by some governments normally  more sympathetic to London about the tactics of the British  government was unusually robust. "I can tell you that British  relations with the Netherlands will not be the same again after  the way in which Mr Major spoke about us and the Belgians in the  House of Commons this week," one senior Dutch official said  yesterday.    Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission  said  in a French press interview yesterday that a full blooded crisis  was preferable to a bad compromise in the dispute about voting  rights. "Although I prefer consensus to conflict, I am not  scared by the consequences of a crisis, which would be better --  experience proves -- than a bad compromise."    Conservative MEP's [members of European Parliament] are  pleading with John Major to find a quick compromise to settle  the European Union voting crisis and avert what they fear will  be an electoral disaster at the Euro-elections in June.    After a panic-stricken group meeting in Brussels on  Wednesday  evening [23 March], they instructed Sir Christopher Prout, their  leader, to write to the Prime Minister about the dangers of what  they see as his increasingly negative stance.</p>

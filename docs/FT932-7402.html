			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Observer: Muti groupie It is not only a love of opera that GEC boss Lord Weinstock and soprano Dame Elizabeth Schwarzkopf share. They also have a rather specific taste in records judging by their choices for the BBC's Desert Island Discs programme. The German-born opera singer made a name for herself by choosing eight of her own records, and yesterday Lord Weinstock restricted his musical selections to the works of his old friend, the 51-year-old conductor Ricarrdo Muti. He admitted he was a 'Muti groupie' and said that he had been present at all the performances chosen. His choice of book was If This Be a Man, by Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi, and his luxury was a photo album of his family, friends and horses. GEC seems to be on a bit of a roll at the moment judging by the improvement in its share rating. Indeed, Lord W, 69 in July, let slip that he has just had his office repainted.</p>

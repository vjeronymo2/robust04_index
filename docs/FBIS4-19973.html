			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mouna Naim: "A Kurdish Leader Calls For Active </F> Support for the Opposition in Paris"]    [Text] On a visit to Paris since Monday 18 April, Jalal  Talabani, who is joint chairman of the "Presidential Council" of  Iraqi Kurdistan (virtually autonomous since it was placed under  international protection), will ask France to ensure that the  Iraqi Government is forced to implement Resolution 688 passed by  the UN Security Council in April 1991 (at France's initiative),  which demands that Baghdad respect human rights.    To this end, France and the other members of the UN Security  Council must, in Talabani's opinion, adopt the following  approach: "Send UN observers to Iraq (against Baghdad's wishes  -- LE MONDE editor's note), increase the isolation of the Iraqi  regime by forcing it from international bodies, and bring Saddam  Husayn, in absentia if necessary, before a court for crimes  against humanity."    But Jalal Talabani admits that what he is advocating is  difficult to achieve, particularly because the international  community at present has other priority concerns, especially  following its failure in Bosnia. However, he expects the  members of the Security Council to "give political, moral, and  financial support to the Iraqi opposition and to the formation  by that opposition of an Iraqi coalition government which would  have its seat in Irbil," the capital of Kurdistan. He stressed  that such a government should only be formed if it enjoys prior  international support. "Then," he said, "the Iraqi Government,  which is already totally rejected by the entire population,  irrespective of background, will fall." Mr. Talabani is  convinced of it.    In the same way, he is convinced that France, Russia, and  China will not oppose the embargo imposed on Iraq by the  Security Council since the Gulf War. He maintains that  everybody, including the oil companies which are currently  negotiating with the Iraqi authorities, knows that the Baghdad  regime is politically and economically bankrupt.    It would be nice to admit that he is right, but even THE NEW  YORK TIMES recently suggested that it was time for the United  States to review its attitude "in the direction of a possible  end to the military and economic confrontation" with Baghdad.  Mr. Talabani admits that there is no absolute guarantee that  the isolation of the Iraqi regime will be maintained, but he  states that the opposition is determined to make every effort to  ensure it is continued, or even strengthened, and leads to the  fall of Saddam Husayn. Meanwhile, Mr. Talabani wants  international aid to Kurdistan "no longer to be in the form of  humanitarian gifts, but aid to rebuild the infrastructure." He  also asked for the lifting of sanctions on some products which  are "essential for rebuilding and for getting industry working  again." Finally, he expressed the hope that the Western  protection of Kurdistan since April 1991 will continue and will  no longer be subject to a six-monthly extension as is currently  the case. The Kurds have been making these demands for a long  time. In vain. [passage omitted]</p>

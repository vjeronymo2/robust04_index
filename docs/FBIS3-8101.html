			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bogdan Chirieac: "Our Integration -- Between </F> Euphoria and Pragmatism"]    [Text] The accord on Romania's association with the  European Community -- the most important document signed after  1989 -- was negotiated under the pressure of a deadline. The  Trilaterale -- Hungary, Poland and the (then) Czechoslovakia --  had already concluded their accords one year before Bucharest.  As a result, the Romania-EC negotiations that began in May 1992  were concluded very rapidly by sealing the association accord on  17 November 1992 and its initialing on 1 February 1993 in  Brussels. The accord will soon become effective after it is  ratified by the parliaments of "the Twelve."    The price that had to be paid for such haste is quite high.  Romania -- at that time considered "the black sheep" of Eastern  Europe -- was compelled to accept less advantageous association  terms than the ones offered to the Trilaterale. As far as  commerce with agricultural products is concerned -- considered  to be the most important hard currency source of East European  countries -- Romania was coerced to declare itself satisfied  with very little, although in that domain it has the largest  potential in the whole area. It might be significant that  during the negotiations conducted in view of concluding the  accord, Frans Andriessen, the EC commissioner in charge of  community issues, expressed his "deepest regrets" for the terms  imposed on Romania in the agricultural chapter. Being more  confident in their own forces, the Trilaterale countries had put  up a fierce fight to protect their interests. Dissatisfied with  the EC terms, Poland and Hungary in 1991 left the negotiating  table, although, as a matter of fact, the offers made to them by  the European Community had been much more generous than the ones  made to our country. The favorite countries of the West  assessed that they could afford to gamble -- and they won.    Surprisingly enough, shortly before the accord on Romania's  association with the European Union [EU] is to become effective,  the latter radically changed its stance, offering our country an  unhoped-for present. During the Athens conference of the EU  member states' ministers of commerce, EU High Commissioner Sir  Leon Brittan said that the agricultural terms imposed on Romania  have to be adjusted to those offered to Hungary, Poland,  Czechia, and Slovakia. Furthermore, Romania should benefit from  an even more rapid access to EU markets in order to compensate  for its one-year delay compared to "the four."    This is a remarkable change in the EU's stance with respect  to Romania. This gesture indicates the fact that the West is  not prepared to divide East Europe into "first class" and  "second class" countries.    However, pragmatism should prevail over euphoria in the way  Bucharest views this unexpected offer made by the European  Union. In other words, it will be easier for us to export  agricultural products to EU countries, but the problem is  whether Romanian agriculture has sufficient quantities of such  products. For the time being, owing to the "priceless"  contribution of the Ministry of Agriculture, our country has  gained the status of one of the major importers of basic  agricultural products (wheat, edible oil, and sugar.) The  unexpected chance given to us by the European Union should not  be missed because that would cause delays in the transition  process, as the country would be deprived of one of its major  sources of hard currency. It would be a pity if those general  terms offered by the European Union would end up the same way  the most-favored-nation status did, namely that we chased that  status over almost four years just to realize, after we received  it, that Romania's economy is not sufficiently ripe to make any  substantial bids on the U.S. market.</p>

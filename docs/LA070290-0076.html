			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POUND ANIMAL SALE FOR UCSD RESEARCH A GROWING ISSUE  </P> <P> A growing number of public officials in North County are voicing opposition to  a policy of the county's Department of Animal Control that allows the sale of  stray dogs and cats to UC San Diego for medical research.  </P> <P> The city councils of Encinitas, Solana Beach and Carlsbad have rewritten their  county contracts to oppose the practice -- and have gone so far as to entertain  the notion of operating their own animal shelters, or contracting with other  agencies that don't sell animals for medical research.  </P> <P> The cities of Poway, San Marcos and Vista have adopted contractual language  with the county to make sure they're put on notice if their strays might end up  at UCSD, but those cities stopped short of threatening specific action if  animals from their communities are sold to UCSD.  </P> <P> Monday night, the Del Mar City Council will take up the issue.  </P> <P> All this suits Bob Melvin just fine.  </P> <P> Melvin, who lives in Solana Beach, heads the animal rights group called STOP,  for Stop Taking Our Pets, which is opposed to so-called "pound seizures," or  the practice by the county of selling strays to UCSD for medical research.  </P> <P> UCSD officials note that the number of dogs and cats they buy from the county  pounds is relatively small, but meets a critical need in their work. In the  1988-89 fiscal year, 526 dogs and seven cats were purchased by UCSD -- 1.4% of  the 39,347 animals taken in by the county during that period.  </P> <P> Melvin has been attending one North County city council meeting after another  in recent weeks, drumming up opposition to the county policy, and he's finding  an increasing level of support for his agenda.  </P> <P> In a sense, Melvin's campaign is moot. While animals from two other county-run  animal shelters -- one in Mission Valley, the other in Bonita -- may be  purchased by UCSD for medical research, none are now taken from the Carlsbad  animal shelter, which handles the strays and abandoned animals from most of  North County. (The cities of Oceanside and Escondido have separate contracts  with their community-based Humane Society shelters for animal control, and  those organizations do not sell animals to UCSD.)  </P> <P> The county's contract with UCSD allows the university to buy animals from the  Carlsbad shelter as well, as long as the university gives 60 days' notice of  its intent to tap the North County stray animal pool.  </P> <P> It's that possibility that sparked Melvin's campaign.  </P> <P> "There's no place in laboratories for our pets," he says. "We have an animal  shelter system supported by the taxpayers that is supposed to humanely take  care of animals that are lost, stolen or stray. The system has a three-fold  mission: to reunite pets and their owners, or if it can't, to adopt them out to  suitable families, and failing those two objectives, to humanely euthanize  them.  </P> <P> "These shelters, though, were never conceived as warehouses for research  laboratories."  </P> <P> This is the time of year when 10 of the county's 18 cities renew their annual  contracts with the county -- and it gives the opportunity for Melvin to argue  for stronger language in those contracts to protect the animals in those  cities.  </P> <P> The county's biggest animal control customer is the city of San Diego, which  has taken no action to object to UCSD's use of pound animals for research.  </P> <P> But elsewhere, the number of cities objecting to the county practice is  growing.  </P> <P> In Encinitas, Solana Beach and Carlsbad, there's already talk among city  officials of dropping their contracts with the county to protest the policy of  allowing sheltered animals to be used for research.  </P> <P> "We already have a contract that tells the county, in so many words, 'You will  not take our animals for medical research.' And now we're preparing a  resolution, just to emphasize our point, telling the county to stay the hell  out of our city if they want to turn our animals over for research," said  Carlsbad City Councilwoman Ann Kulchin.  </P> <P> "We're giving them fair warning," she said. "We don't want them to think we're  not taking this seriously."  </P> <P> The Encinitas City Council's contract with the county animal control  department, approved last Wednesday night, puts three restrictions on the  county that are intended to make sure no stray cats or dogs from its city are  sold to UCSD.  </P> <P> The contract states no animals seized in Encinitas can be sold to the  university, requires that the city be given 60 days' notice if any animals from  the regional shelter in Carlsbad are to be sold to UCSD, and allows the city to  terminate its contract with the county with only 30 days' notice.  </P> <P> Since no animals from North County are now taken for medical research, county  officials had no problem signing the contract.  </P> <P> Encinitas officials already have contacted the North County Humane Society in  Oceanside to see if it can handle business from Encinitas. Ed Araiza, manager  of the Humane Society, said his board of directors will consider the request.  </P> <P> Said Encinitas Mayor Pam Slater, "We're not contesting the issue of animal  research. But we think it's entirely inappropriate for a citizen's pet to be  impounded and to maybe be turned over to UCSD without that citizen's permission  just because maybe that person is on vacation, or is ill, or was taken to a  rest home, and couldn't retrieve his or her animal. That person should feel  secure that his animal will never end up as a research animal."  </P> <P> Monday night, the Solana Beach City Council -- which already has approved its  contract with the county that also calls for the 60 days' notice of possible  pound seizures -- will consider sending a letter to the county formally  objecting to the policy.  </P> <P> "If our pets are picked up, we want to know where they are, and not where they  might be -- at UCSD," said Mayor Marion Dodson.  </P> <P> She said she is interested in forming "a coalition with other cities who  support our position, because there is strength in unity." Such a coalition  might consider forming a regional animal shelter operated by the member cities,  she said.  </P> <P> Some cities outside of North County also oppose the county practice, even  though their stray dogs and cats may end up in the pound-seizure pool in  Mission Valley or Bonita. Santee, for instance, asked the county to  specifically promise that none of its animals would end up at UCSD. But the  county said it couldn't do that, and that if Santee were going to specifically  craft a contract prohibiting its animals from ending up in the medical research  pool, the county simply would not serve Santee.  </P> <P> Santee officials looked elsewhere for animal protection, but couldn't find  another agency willing to take on the job, said city public information officer  Bill Adams. Neighboring El Cajon, which operates its own animal control  department, said it couldn't take on any more work.  </P> <P> Santee officials, resigned to working with the county, nonetheless sent a  letter earlier this month to the County Board of Supervisors, protesting the  sale of animals to UCSD.  </P> <P> From July 1, 1989, through the first of this year, the county has sold 174 dogs  from its Mission Valley and Bonita pounds to UCSD, at $55 each. The university  can also buy cats, at $25 each.  </P> <P> In comparison, the department handled 22,579 animals during that same time  period -- of which about 16,000 were euthanized because they were neither  reclaimed by their owners nor adopted by others. The balance were either  reclaimed by their owners or adopted out to new owners.  </P> <P> In fiscal year 1988-89, UCSD paid the county about $35,000 for 533 animals that  were purchased for medical research.  </P> <P> Critics argue that the county is risking losing hundreds of thousands of  dollars in money paid for animal control by the various cities that contract  for it, simply to preserve the slight UCSD income.  </P> <P> Encinitas alone, for instance, pays the county about $70,000 for animal  control. But Sally Hazzard, the animal control officer for the county, notes  that if a city were to terminate its contract, the county would save that much  money by reducing its operating costs, which it bills the various cities on a  an actual cost-incurred basis, determined by the number of calls or animals  handled in a particular city.  </P> <P> When a stray or abandoned animal is picked up by the county, the shelter holds  onto it for at least three working days, in case the owner calls for it. After  that, pound officials determine whether the animal is "adoptable," given its  characteristics and depending on how many similar animals are in the adoption  cages.  </P> <P> If the animal is deemed unadoptable and doomed to be destroyed, officials check  to see whether that particular type of animal -- say, a particular size and sex  -- is desired by UCSD. If so, the animal is then put in a five-day holding  cage, where it is given a second chance to be claimed by the owner or adopted.  If it isn't, the animal is offered to UCSD for purchase.  </P> <P> The contract between the county and UCSD has been in existence since the early  1960s, said Hazzard. County officials most recently re-evaluated the policy in  November, 1987, when a citizen advisory panel said there was no reason for the  county to reconsider the pact with UCSD. The issue never got to the Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> Stuart Zola-Morgan, an associate professor of psychiatry at UCSD who chairs the  university's animal subjects committee, said that importance of university  access to pound animals cannot be overstated.  </P> <P> The pound seizures, he said, provide a "crucial role" for medical research  because, at a time of reduced funding for university research, they are less  expensive than animals that are specially bred for research purposes.  </P> <P> Moreover, he argues, why breed additional animals for research if suitable  animals are available locally and are doomed anyway because of pet owners'  carelessness in controlling their pets?  </P> <P> "You'd be killing two animals instead of just one," he says. "Close to 15  million animals are put to death every year in pounds around the country. Only  2% to 3% are used in research. Why aren't the animal protectionists out there  with education programs about proper care of pets, and with spaying programs?"  </P> <P> The animals taken from the pound are anesthetized before they are subjected  either to surgical procedures or drugs, Zola-Morgan said. After the procedure,  most of the animals are killed with an overdose of the same anesthesia -- "the  same way they would be killed at the pound," he said.  </P> <P> Some animals are allowed to recover, to measure the effectiveness of certain  treatments and procedures, he said.  </P> <P> "This is a very defensible and noble cause," he said. "The animals suffer no  pain and provide us with information that will increase the welfare of humans  and animals alike."  </P> <P> Melvin, of STOP, said he isn't necessarily opposed to the use of animals in  medical research -- but that he is intent on stopping medical research on stray  animals that are picked up by county animal control officers.  </P> <P> County Supervisor John MacDonald, whose district includes the North County  cities that are debating the issue, said he favors the policy, partly because  "the options those animals face are very limited, anyway."  </P> <P> Still, given the controversy, MacDonald said he is considering suggesting a  ballot measure in November -- either binding or advisory -- that would measure  public support or opposition to the practice.  </P> <P> "It's a very volatile issue, but I'm not sure that there is strong public  opposition to the policy," he said. "It's something we need to get a handle  on."  </P></p>

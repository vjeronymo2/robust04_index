			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Help for long-term unemployed urged The Adam Smith Institute, the independent free-market research group, calls today for measures to create work for the long-term unemployed. It suggests that they should be exempt from paying tax and National Insurance for two years after they secure work. The institute also calls for the creation of 'green-light zones or estates' for two years in inner cities, where companies with an annual turnover of Pounds 500,000 or less could establish themselves without being subject to planning permission or other regulations. It says this would create jobs in areas such as retail distribution and mini-cab services. It adds: 'These measures will provide a rung to help the long-term unemployed and economically deprived areas to climb up into the normal wage-earning and productive economy.' Operation Underclass. Adam Smith Institute, 23 Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BL. Pounds 10.00</p>

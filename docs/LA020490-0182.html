			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY WOULD FINE AIDES IN SMEAR DRIVES  </P> <P> Councilman Bill Colon has placed two proposals on the agenda that would outlaw  the involvement of city staff and City Council members in political and smear  campaigns.  </P> <P> Colon also has asked that the city take possession of the Cudahy Social Service  Agency, which occupies a city-owned building and recently was served with an  eviction notice.  </P> <P> He has requested that the agency's controversial director, James Graham, be  given a five-month contract for $14,900.  </P> <P> A similar proposal by Councilman John Robertson was passed by the council at  its last meeting in January, but was ruled invalid several days later by City  Atty. Glenn Watson. Colon said he is requesting urgency ordinances prohibiting  staff, under threat of termination, from engaging in political or smear  campaigns because of "constant political games" in City Hall.  </P> <P> "It's time the city grew up and stopped playing kid games," Colon said.  </P> <P> Under Colon's proposal, council members involved in smear campaigns would be  fined at least $5,000.  </P></p>

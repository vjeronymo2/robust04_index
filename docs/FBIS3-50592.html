			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 3  January 1994. Source is cited in parentheses following each item.    The Economy Ministry reported the following figures for  1993:     -  Inflation was 12.1 percent (government goal: 12  percent).    -  GNP increased 5 percent (last year's total was 4.6  percent).    -  Fiscal deficit was 1.8 percent of GNP.    -  Exports equaled  $600 million. Despite a drop in coffee prices, exports  increased 22 percent, and exports of assembled goods increased  39 percent.    -  Net international reserves were $663  million.    -  Increase in formal employment, according to Social  Security affiliation, was 13 percent.    Economy Minister Enrique Cordova believes that 1994 could  see  an economic upswing in El Salvador but warned that "economic  growth must be maintained until the year 2000 to recover  pre-1978 levels." (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 29  Dec 93 p 3)    The 1992-93 coffee harvest reached 3.3 million quintals,  while the 1993-94 crop is expected to reach 2 million quintals.  Some of the reasons for the reduced production is the  development of new neighborhoods on land previously used for  growing coffee, the lack of adequate attention to coffee  plantations, and the 20 percent export retention in force since  October to improve prices.

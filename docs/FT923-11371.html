			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Thousands turn out for funeral of anti-Mafia judge in Palermo Some 8,000 Sicilians who turned out to mourn leading anti-Mafia judge Paolo Borsellino in Palermo yesterday clapped the cortege and hurled insults at Italy's police chief, Reuter reports. Judge Borsellino was killed by a car bomb with five bodyguards last Sunday. Police said they had charged a private security guard with aiding crime. He was alleged to have refused to testify although he was present when the bomb went off. The Italian government yesterday used a confidence vote to push a tough anti-Mafia package through the Senate, parliament's upper house. The Senate approved stiff new laws against organised crime by 163 votes to 106. The legislation now goes to the Chamber of Deputies. A new anti-Mafia chief prosecutor and other investigators will have wider, streamlined powers to fight gangsters, including the use of undercover 'sting' operations, wiretaps and infiltrators. The package also gives police the power to carry out searches without warrants, a measure previously adopted in the fight against terrorism of the 1970s and 1980s. Security was strict at yesterday's funeral. Several hundred police and paramilitary police lined crash barriers outside the church, and sharpshooters manned the tops of nearby blocks of flats. Police had warned that both Mr Borsellino and a judge investigating the corruption scandal in Milan were on the Mafia's death-list, newspapers reported yesterday. A report by paramilitary police, dated three days before Mr Borsellino's murder, warned that organised crime was preparing to kill both him and Milan judge Antonio Di Pietro.</p>

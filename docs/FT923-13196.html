			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Bronfmans suffer from investors' unease: The problems facing the Canadian family's convoluted empire A striking trend on the Toronto stock exchange (TSE) in recent months has been the unremitting decline in the share prices of companies controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family. At the very least, the falls signal the investment community's growing discomfort with the convoluted structure of the far-flung group, which includes such pillars of Canadian business as Noranda, the country's biggest mining and forestry group; Royal Trust, the second-largest trust company; and Trizec, North America's leading publicly-traded property developer. But the selling may also reflect a deeper unease at the intricate cross-holdings that are a hallmark of the Bronfman empire, which controls assets worth about CDollars 100bn (Pounds 43.6bn) and between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of the market capitalisation of the TSE. Investments by individual companies in each other's preferred shares may have created the perception that difficulties in one company could ripple through others. Between them, property companies Trizec and Bramalea have a debt load of CDollars 14.7bn - CDollars 1bn more than the ailing Olympia &amp; York. 'This is a group that functions on dividend payments,' says the head of research at one Toronto securities firm. 'If it doesn't get them, it runs out of oxygen.' Brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman are cousins of the heirs to the Seagram liquor fortune, although the two businesses are completely separate. The 64-year-old Mr Edward Bronfman began disengaging himself in 1989, leaving Peter, 62, and his family with majority control of Edper Holdings, the top company of the group. Most of the remaining shares in Edper are held by the senior managers - led by South African-born Mr Jack Cockwell, 51 - through Pagurian, a publicly-traded company. Mr Cockwell and his colleagues decline to be interviewed. A spokesman said that they blame the drop in share prices on a misconception that problems at property developer Bramalea, which is struggling to stave off bankruptcy, could undermine the rest of the group. The property companies have taken the heaviest pounding in the stock market. Earlier this week, Bramalea plunged to 78 cents, down from almost CDollars 5 at the beginning of this year. Trizec's shares are bumping along at their lowest level for more than two decades. Bramalea last month halted both common and preferred share dividends and Trizec cut its semi-annual dividend from 18 to 12 cents a share. Cut off from the debt markets, Trizec also heavily diluted its equity last month with a CDollars 275m private placement which was priced far below the value of its assets. The question is whether other Bronfman companies will be forced to follow Trizec and Bramalea's lead in trimming dividends. Judging by their share prices, the market seems to believe they will. Hees International, the group's merchant banking arm, has fallen to a 52-week low of just above CDollars 10. Royal Trust has tumbled from CDollars 8.25 at the end of March to CDollars 5.38 this week. Edper Enterprises, the most senior publicly-traded company, also touched a one-year low of CDollars 4.10 earlier this month. Beyond the property developers, concern is centred on Royal Trust, whose main business is home mortgages and other financial services. RT's quarterly earnings have failed to match dividends for the past two years, first as a result of a string of problems in its European and US operations, and more recently, the property slump in Canada. Mr Kersi Doodha, analyst with Maison Placements Canada, said in a recent report that 'management is of the view that so long as there is no 'permanent impairment' in profitability, payout of dividend higher than earned is justified. More conservative investors may have a contrary view.' An RT official insisted that the company was financially sound and knew of no reason why the share price should have dropped as far as it had. Nonetheless, share prices indicate that investors believe the quarterly dividend, currently at 18.5 cents a share, will be cut when interim results are published on July 23. Noranda is another Bronfman company whose CDollars 1-per-share annual dividend has far exceeded its profits in recent years. Second-quarter earnings are also likely to be mediocre, and it is committed to heavy spending to curb pollution at its pulp and paper mills. But the directors appear to be hoping that profits will soon recover smartly on the back of a further upturn in commodity prices. Mr Julian Baldry, analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, predicts that 'if necessary, (Noranda) will sell assets to maintain the dividends'. If anything, the plunge in share prices could stiffen the resolve of some Bronfman companies not to cut dividends. Compulsory share purchase schemes, often financed by bank loans, are another hallmark of the Bronfman management style. The last thing that executives, already staring a big capital loss in the face, want to see is a cut in their personal income stream.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        KEY OPERATING COMPANIES:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London Life        (Insurance)         Noranda      (Resources) John Labatt        (Brewing)           Royal Trust  (Financial Services) MacMillan Bloedel  (Forestry)          Trizec       (Real Estate) Norcen             (Oil and gas)       Bramalea     (Real Estate) Royal LePage       (Property services)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / International Company News: Simint steady at L17.48bn SIMINT, the Italian clothing group partly owned by Mr Giorgio Armani, reported virtually unchanged net group profits of L17.48bn (Dollars 14.83m) for the year to April 30 against L17.23bn the previous year. The group, which is pushing ahead with an ambitious expansion drive in the US, raised sales by 6.4 per cent to L352.9bn. The increase stemmed from a mixture of early receipts from the US initiative and higher sales in European markets. Pre-tax profits rose 13.2 per cent to L23.06bn from L20.36bn. The dividend is unchanged at L150 a share for both ordinary and preference stock.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA COUNCIL'S DECISION TO EVICT SOS  </P> <P> Shame on the Costa Mesa City Council (except Vice Mayor Mary Hornbuckle) for  voting to evict Share Our Selves (SOS) in six months (July 19). For 19 years  this all-volunteer, private, nonprofit agency has been a shining example of  what President Bush calls "a thousand points of light."  </P> <P> SOS provides food, clothes, free medical and dental care and emergency  financial aid to 6,000 poor families a month. And SOS spends less than 3% of  its funds on administrative overhead. Not many groups, public or private, can  claim such success.  </P> <P> Now a small vocal band of neighbors has pressured the city into canceling SOS's  lease at the Rea Community Center -- its home since 1981. The tenor of the  neighbors' comments at Monday's hearing was telling: "I don't want to see poor  people lining up for food. It's depressing."  </P> <P> Mayor Peter F. Buffa's explanation for allowing the SOS medical and dental  clinic an extra year before eviction was equally offensive. He said the people  who come for medical care are of a different (presumably better) "set" than  those who come for food. Apparently, for those of discriminating tastes (like  the good mayor), a poor person who is ill is less objectionable than one who is  hungry.  </P> <P> We are now seeing the true trickle-down effect of Reaganomics: selfishness and  loss of compassion in our neighborhoods.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN ESFAHANI  </P> <P> BAHRAM ESFAHANI  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

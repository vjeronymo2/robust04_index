			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Teaching unions closer to merger TWO OF the smaller non-striking teachers' unions took a step towards merger over the weekend. If the merger succeeds, the National Union of Teachers may soon cease to be the largest teachers' union. The 130,000-strong Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association and the Professional Association of Teachers, with 39,000 members, have reached provisional agreement on merger and final proposals are likely to be put to members by next year. Neither union is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. The merged union would be larger than the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (Nasuwt), with 20,000 members fewer than the NUT's 190,000. In a joint statement, the two unions emphasised the need for a new, moderate and professional image for the teaching profession. Mr Peter Dawson, PAT general secretary, said the union would speak for the 'moderate majority' and mark 'a new beginning for the education service'. The new union would 'concentrate on representing the professional and educational interests of practising teachers and lecturers'. The merger terms involve the PAT giving up its no-strike constitution in return for a commitment to 'respect and safeguard' those opposed in principle to any industrial action. Mr Peter Smith, AMMA general secretary, said: 'We still have a lot of work ahead, but we are seemingly on course to create a genuinely democratic union which will represent the authentic voice of practising teachers and raise their professional esteem.' If established, the new union would further increase the isolation of the NUT. The NUT is the only teachers' union opposed to the setting up of a pay review body for teachers. Last month the NUT conference voted to boycott the government's standard assessment tests, a move overwhelmingly rejected in a ballot of members last week. NUT membership has been falling steadily, from 250,000 in the mid 1980s. Combined AMMA/PAT membership has risen from 115,000 to nearly 170,000 today. Nasuwt membership is stable.</p>

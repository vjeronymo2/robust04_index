			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops below 21,000 as yen falls against dollar THE NIKKEI average fell below 21,000 as worries ahead of testimonies by a leading politician concerning a political bribery scandal, scheduled for today, and the dollar's rebound against the yen discouraged investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index finished 318.57 down at 20,973.24 after opening at the day's high of 21,286.70 and hitting the day's low of 20,890.37 just before the close. Turnover shrank to 130m shares from Friday's 200m, the lowest so far this year. Declines overwhelmed advances by 639 to 287, with 188 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 14.84 at 1,536.82, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.90 to 1,172.72. News that Mr Zenko Suzuki, the former prime minister, will testify in today's parliamentary session regarding his involvement in a political bribery scandal prompted light selling. Hopes of a cut in the discount rate, which had buoyed share prices last week, also receded, and rumours of a rise in the capital gains tax sent jitters through the market. Pessimism about the expiry of March futures contracts also prevailed. Concern about corporate earnings depressed the high-technology sector. Nippondenso, a car air-conditioner maker with close ties with Toyota, weakened Y60 to Y1,260 on reports of record low sales and pre-tax profits for the current year to March. Companies predicting that they would fall into the red in the current year lost ground. Victor of Japan fell Y50 to Y1,110 and Ricoh Y13 to Y550. Tokio Marine and Fire dipped Y20 to Y1,060 on reports that claims for typhoon damages would erode its earnings. Speculative issues were among the few gainers of the day, on short-term buying. Clarion rose Y40 to Y1,230 and Nippon Carbon Y80 to Y1,920. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 5.19 to 22,673.97 in volume of 181.9m shares. Traders attributed 95 per cent of the activity to cross-trading ahead of the March book closing. Companies with connections to the Sumitomo group were briskly traded. Sanyo Electric, the day's busiest issue, held at Y493 and Sumitomo Chemical was flat at Y435. Roundup AUSTRALIA recorded its highest close for more than a month, while the rest of the Pacific Rim was mixed. AUSTRALIA rose on optimism about tomorrow's economic statement. The All Ordinaries index gained 5.5 to 1,627.0 in turnover of ADollars 208m, against ADollars 235m. CRA climbed 16 cents to ADollars 13.98: analysts said a weaker Australian dollar and hopes of an upturn in commodity prices was boosting the mining sector.

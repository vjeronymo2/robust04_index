			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Algerians to brief west on human rights TWO senior Algerians are to visit western capitals to brief foreign governments in response to concern about the country's stability and respect for human rights. Unrest has followed the cancellation five weeks ago of Algeria's first multi-party elections and the detaining of at least 5,000 Moslem fundamentalists without charge in internment camps. Mr Ali Haroun, a lawyer who for six months was minister in charge of human rights and is now a member of the country's five-man collegiate presidency, will visit Belgium, Germany and Spain. Mr Redha Malek, a former ambassador, will visit the US and Canada. Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, Algeria's foreign minister, returns tonight from a 10-day mission to the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia.</p>

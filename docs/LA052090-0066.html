			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS GET TAKEN FOR RIDE WITH STUDENT LOANS  </P> <P> To the newly legalized immigrants, it must have sounded too fantastic to be  true.  </P> <P> With their temporary resident cards in hand, about 3 million men and women  throughout the United States who qualified for the immigration amnesty program  in 1988 were suddenly eligible for $5,000 or more in federally backed student  loans.  </P> <P> Attracted by aggressive marketing campaigns, the immigrants began flocking to  vocational schools, hoping to learn word processing, computer repair and other  skills that would help them escape the near-minimum-wage jobs that had been  their lot as undocumented workers.  </P> <P> Only now have many of the student-immigrants concluded that the trade schools  have taken them for a ride, cheating them of thousands of dollars each. They  tell academic horror stories of classes without books or teachers and of school  administrators who taunt them with racial slurs.  </P> <P> As complaints pile up, government regulators, public interest attorneys and  immigrants' rights advocates have reached the same conclusion: Thousands of  recently legalized immigrants have become the newest and, in some cases, the  preferred targets of trade schools that use them as mere funnels to collect  millions of dollars in federal funds.  </P> <P> Although most of California's 2,500 vocational schools have not generated  complaints, the state attorney general's office is investigating cases  involving one-fifth of California's 500,000 private voca tional and trade  school students, according to Deputy Atty. Gen. Ron Reiter. Many of the  complaints involve recently legalized natives of Asia and Latin America.  </P> <P> "The schools just look at us and see the pesos on our foreheads," said Alvaro  Lopez, a 26-year-old Mexican immigrant who is one of about 20 students who have  contacted public-interest attorneys and asked them to take legal action against  Webster Career College, a Long Beach vocational school.  </P> <P> The students say they received little or no instruction at the college. No one  will hire them to work in the vocations for which they were ostensibly trained  -- such as accounting and computer data entry -- because they clearly are  unqualified. And yet they must repay the loans.  </P> <P> Webster officials deny having misled the immigrants.  </P> <P> "We have a qualified faculty with credentials to back up their training," said  Lourine Hodge, director of operations at the Long Beach campus.  </P> <P> But one student, Carmen Chacon, 33, a packinghouse worker, said school  administrators took advantage of her desire to better herself. With her poor  command of English, she said, she has no chance of becoming a computer operator  -- despite the $5,041 she spent for three months of course work at Webster.  </P> <P> "To succeed, that's what you come to this country for," she said in Spanish.  "You don't want to end your days in a factory, tired, with some foreman yelling  at you. . . . The school made so many promises to us. And of all those  promises, not one has come true."  </P> <P> Eventually, students like Chacon and Perez will receive terse letters from  bankers and the federal government demanding payment of the loans. They are  made by private banks, which do business with the immigrants and other  economically disadvantaged students because the loans are backed by the federal  government.  </P> <P> If the students refuse or are unable to pay the loans, the Internal Revenue  Service will place liens on their federal income tax refunds. The student  immigrants thus face a cruel irony: Now that they have lost their fear of "la  migra" (Spanish slang for the immigration authorities), they must contend with  IRS agents.  </P> <P> Emiliano Herrera, an unemployed metal worker, said he incurred a $5,500 debt by  enrolling in a course at Beta Technical Schools, also in Long Beach. His  three-month class in automobile repair cost more than an academic quarter at  Stanford University. And, according to affidavits on file in Los Angeles  Superior Court, the school didn't even have a garage or cars to work on.  </P> <P> "They didn't have any tools; they didn't have anything," Herrera, 37, said in  an interview. "If they're going to charge that kind of money, they should at  least have a workshop. . . . When I complained, they told me, 'Don't worry,  we'll have it all in a couple of weeks.' "  </P> <P> The state attorney general filed suit in March against Beta Technical Schools,  alleging that the college misrepresented its auto repair courses. In April, a  Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order  preventing Beta Technical from operating auto repair courses that are not  certified by the state. The school, however, is still providing other courses  at its Long Beach campus.  </P> <P> Richard Posell, an attorney representing the school, said the state was to  blame for some of the problems because, he said, it delayed issuing the school  permits that would have allowed the teaching of the auto course. Posell added  that former students also bear some of the responsibility.  </P> <P> "A lot of the people who come to trade schools are people who aren't successful  in the normal educational system," said Posell, who has represented vocational  schools in civil suits for more than 15 years. "They really don't like going to  school. That's what it comes down to."  </P> <P> In recent years, state and federal regulators have sharply criticized trade and  vocational schools for defrauding low-income men and women of millions of  dollars in federally backed loans. Four states, including California, have  enacted legislation designed to curb the most serious abuses. More than a dozen  other states are considering similar laws.  </P> <P> California's law went into effect Jan. 1. By then, aggressive recruiting  campaigns in the Spanish media had already attracted thousands of immigrants.  Newly legalized immigrants became eligible for the loans after May, 1988, when  they began completing the first stage of the amnesty program.  </P> <P> "The immigrants are a whole area that had been untapped before," said Elena H.  Ackel, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. "This is a  group that was disregarded because they didn't have access to government loans.  The amnesty was like opening up another bucket of money for the schools."  </P> <P> The loan payments are made directly to the schools. Students who drop out, even  after only a few weeks, must still pay the bulk of their loans.  </P> <P> Many student-immigrants are only now receiving their first notices that they  are delinquent in repaying loans. As a result, in recent months, many have  arrived at legal aid clinics throughout Los Angeles seeking help.  </P> <P> This month, the Los Angeles public interest law group Public Counsel is  assisting 240 students who are taking legal action against their school  operators, said Kenneth W. Babcock, director of Public Counsel's poverty law  programs.  </P> <P> At one Los Angeles-area trade school, Babcock said, most "instruction" in an  English class consisted of viewing rented video movies.  </P> <P> "(The students) kept seeing 'La Bamba' over and over again," Babcock said.  "They complained. They thought it was ridiculous they were paying all that  money to watch videos."  </P> <P> Advertising in the Spanish media is not the only draw to the vocational  schools. Students said there are "employment offices" that double as school  recruiters. This practice is called "blind advertising" and is illegal in  California. Still, blind advertising is common in the vocational school  industry, according to Deputy Atty. Gen. Margaret Reiter, who has filed fraud  suits against several schools.  </P> <P> She said schools will typically pay recruiters about $500 for each prospective  student "delivered."  </P> <P> Olga Betancourt, 51, said she was recruited to a Los Angeles business college  by an employment office in the downtown Greyhound bus terminal. A low-paid  seamstress for more than 20 years, Betancourt said she had gone to the office  in search of a job in housekeeping or any other better-paying field. Instead, a  woman at the office persuaded her to try her luck at computer classes.  </P> <P> "She told me, 'Why do work (as a housekeeper)? Earning $100 per week doesn't  suit you. If I were you, I would go to school. It won't cost you much money.' "  </P> <P> "Training equals jobs," read the flyer Betancourt was given at the employment  agency. With that slogan in mind, Betancourt walked the few blocks from the bus  station to the business college on Spring Street, hoping to become a computer  operator.  </P> <P> Betancourt is among 40 former students who are preparing to take legal action  against the school with the help of attorneys at Public Council. Among other  complaints, she says that computers at the school were in various states of  disrepair and that with her limited English she stands little, if any chance,  of finding work as a computer operator.  </P> <P> "The school didn't show me any more English than I knew already and they didn't  show me anything at all about computers," she said.  </P> <P> And besides, Betancourt said, paying the roughly $12,000 she said she owes the  school and the banks would be impossible on her salary of $20 a day.  </P> <P> Similar concerns motivated a group of more than 20 Latino students to organize  itself at Webster Career College in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The former students claim that instructors were in such short supply at Webster  that one teacher has, at times, simultaneously handled five or six classes.  Under pressure to make room in their crowded classrooms for more students --  and thus more tuition money -- instructors handed out final grades even to  those who hadn't completed their course work, the students said.  </P> <P> "This grade is for a class I never took," said Rene Chavez, 42, as he held a  grade slip showing he received a B in business communication. "How are we going  to take that kind of class if we don't even know (English) grammar?" he added  in halting English.  </P> <P> Hodge, the director of operations at Webster, denied the allegations of the  former students. She said the school provides its students with a quality  education. "We are definitely not perfect, but we do try," she said.  </P> <P> Regulations governing the trade schools will be debated this week in Sacramento  when the Senate Education Committee holds hearings on Assembly Bill 1401, which  would strengthen the law.  </P> <P> Lobbyists for the private trade school industry, however, are attempting to  loosen restrictions that require at least 60% of the students to complete  course work and at least 70% to be placed in jobs for which they were trained.  Trade school representatives say the law's requirements are an unnecessary  financial burden to the colleges.  </P> <P> "By and large, the schools offer what they say they offer," said Anthony  Pitale, president of the California Assn. of Private Post-Secondary Schools,  one of the lobbyists. "There are problem schools, just like there are problems  in any sector of business. But I think a majority of the people in the (Latino)  community are being helped. . . . It's not something that requires a Draconian  solution."  </P> <P> No matter what action the Legislature takes, Carmen Chacon, the packinghouse  worker who spent $5,041 for three months of course work at Webster Career  College, says she doubts she will ever set foot in another private vocational  school.  </P> <P> Instead, she is paying $8 per semester to study English at Paramount High  School. After she completes her English studies, she may one day enroll in  nearby Compton College, where vocational courses typically cost about $50 per  semester.  </P> <P> "Now that all of this has happened to me, I just want to study English first,"  she said. "That was the problem in (Webster Career College). We didn't speak  the language; we couldn't fight back."  </P></p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Outrage from press body: Lay members of complaints commission protest at Calcutt comments LAY MEMBERS of the Press Complaints Commission yesterday expressed outrage that their independence had apparently been called into question by Sir David Calcutt's review of self-regulation of the press. The Calcutt report described the commission as 'the creature of the newspaper industry', and said that it could not hold the balance fairly between the individual and the press. Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, former chairman of the Inner London Juvenile Courts and a founding member of the commission, said yesterday: 'I think it is highly offensive to suggest we are a creature of the newspaper industry.' Lord Colnbrook, who as Mr Humphrey Atkins was once a Conservative minister, said: 'All the lay members of the PCC are totally independent. I'm retired now and I don't give a damn about what the press think of me.' He believed Sir David's assessment that the commission and self-regulation had not worked had been 'strongly coloured by the fact the government didn't carry out all the things he recommended'. Lord Colnbrook said Sir David had not been to see the commission at work. Lay members say Sir David had lunch with them, but declined an invitation to stay to watch an adjudication session. The lay members are outnumbered by those with newspaper connections on the commission. They include Dame Mary Donaldson, a former Lord Mayor of London, Professor Lesley Rees, dean of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College in London, and Professor Robert Pinker, professor of social work studies at the London School of Economics. Sir David Chipp, a former editor-in-chief of the Press Association, said yesterday that he was 'very cross indeed' about any questioning of his independence. Lord Rothermere, chairman of Daily Mail and General Trust, today denies in a letter to The Times that he told Lord McGregor, chairman of the complaints commission, that the Prince and Princess of Wales had each recruited newspapers to give their own accounts of their marriage rift. 'I informed him from information at my disposal that it appeared to me that the royal couple were seeking to use newspapers,' he writes, adding that they had not 'attempted to forge links with our news-papers'. The remarks allegedly made by Lord Rothermere to Lord McGregor were at the heart of this week's controversy about whether the prince and princess had exploited the press or had been exploited by it.</p>

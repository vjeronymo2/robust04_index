			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bo Yibo (5631 0001 3134), deputy head of the </F> Central Leading Group for Party History Work: "Mao Zedong Was  an Unswerving Explorer of Truth"; editor's note at the end of  the item states: "This is the speech made by Comrade Bo Yibo at  the `Seminar on Mao Zedong's Life and Thought'; the headline was  provided by the editor"]    [Text] The CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department and  four other units are jointly holding a "Seminar on Mao Zedong's  Life and Thought" as the whole party, the whole Army, and the  people of all nationalities across the land are marking the  centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth. This is a major event  for ideological and theoretical circles and is also an important  component of the nationwide memorial activities. As a veteran  party member and a veteran fighter who worked for a long time  under Chairman Mao's leadership, I sincerely hope the seminar  will be lively, serious, practical, and of a high level and  yield valuable results so as to push forward the study of Mao  Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Comrades who sponsored the seminar hoped I would express my  views on ways to commemorate Chairman Mao in connection with my  book A Review of a Number of Major Policy Decisions and  Events. In my view, at a time when our reform, opening up  to the outside world, and modernization drive has entered a new  stage and when Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping has just come out, the most important thing for  the ideological and theoretical circles to do in marking the  centenary of Chairman Mao's birth is to follow Chairman Mao's  example by integrating the fundamental tenets of  Marxism-Leninism with China's realities and by upholding the  principle of proceeding in all cases from China's actual  conditions so as to promote in an all-round way the study and  propaganda of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, speed up reform, open  China wider to the outside world, and stimulate a sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.    Great leader Chairman Mao was an steadfast explorer of  truth.  In the late 1920's and early 1930's, when Marxism was regarded  as a dogma and the Communist International's resolutions and the  Soviet Union's experience were considered sacred and inviolable  by those engaged in the international communist movement and by  many comrades in our party, a group of Chinese communists  represented by Chairman Mao independently pondered over the  problems concerning the Chinese revolution in the scientific  spirit of seeking truth from facts, braving all difficulties.  Through long-term efforts, they gradually integrated the  fundamental tenets of Marxism with China's realities and  developed a strategy of encircling the cities from the rural  areas and finally capturing the whole country. They formulated  a complete set of theories, lines, principles, and policies for  the new-democratic revolution, as well as the strategies and  tactics for the people's war, which complied with China's actual  conditions. It was by arming itself with these theories, lines,  strategies, and tactics that our party was able to lead the  people of the whole country in winning the great victory in the  new-democratic revolution.    In the process of putting the economy back on its feet and  of  turning China from a new-democratic country into a socialist  country after the founding of New China, we copied the Soviet  Union in its set-ups, systems, and economic strategies because  we lacked experience, because the Soviet Union was the only  socialist country at that time and enjoyed high prestige in the  world, and in particular because we began the first five-year  plan for the economic development with the great support of the  Soviet Union. Nevertheless, our party still managed to make  innovations of its own. As far as I can remember, our party  made following innovations in the socialist transformation and  other fields in the early days of New China.    1. The party carried out socialist transformation and  socialist industrialization simultaneously, which was different  from the Soviet Union's strategy of putting state  industrialization before the collectivization of agriculture.    2. The party transformed agriculture, handicraft, and the  capitalist industry and commerce step by step, going from low  levels to high levels, thus only causing a comparatively small  shock in society, while the Soviet Union took over capitalists'  factories and carried out collectivization in one step.    3. Adopting a peaceful buying-out policy toward national  capitalists' means of production and subjecting the capitalists  to education and transformation, treating them as our treasure  instead of sending them packing, so that they would become  self-supporting workers, which was different than the Soviet  Union's practice.    4. From the very beginning the party made Chairman Mao's  "all directions" policy its fundamental principle for economic  development, which called for taking public and private  interests into account, benefiting both labor and capital,  mutual assistance between town and country, and exchange of  goods between town and country. The party followed the law of  value in handling its economic relations with peasants, which  found expression, for example, in the policy of unified purchase  and marketing of farm produce by the state in early days of New  China. All these were entirely different from the Soviet  Union's "system under which the peasants were committed to  deliver and sell farm produce to the state" and its policy of  exacting a large amount of money from the peasants to set up the  accumulation fund.    5. In the early days of New China, while giving top  priority to heavy industry in developing the economy (which was  necessary at that time), the party did not neglect the  development of light industry and agriculture. Chairman Mao  frequently told us at that time: "Never neglect light industry  while giving priority to heavy industry." As a result, while  our heavy industry grew rapidly, our light industry and  agriculture also made progress. This was different from the  policy of the Soviet Union and of other Eastern European  countries of "walking on one leg."    6. With regard to the political system, we upheld the system  of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the  leadership of the communist party while the Soviet Union  introduced the one-party system.    7. "To settle the problem concerning ethnic minorities, the  party introduced the system of regional national autonomy rather  than setting up a federal republic. We believe this is a good  system, because it complies with China's actual conditions."  (see page 257 of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. Only the page number will be given when the book  is quoted hereafter.) This system has played an important part  in strengthening the unity of various nationalities over the  last 40 years and more following the founding of New China.    8. The Chinese Government, together with the Indian  Government, first put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful  Coexistence -- mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial  integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's  internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful  coexistence -- as the guidance for handling state-to-state  relations. This principle has been widely accepted in the world.    The above shows that the party Central Committee headed by  Chairman Mao successfully solved the problems concerning the  setting up of a socialist system in China by creating original  principles for carrying out socialist transformation, which were  suited to China's actual conditions. Some of the original  principles were designed for the stage of the new-democratic  revolution, but they still hold good for the stage of socialist  construction.    Our comrades must remember that in early 1950's the  organization responsible for the international communist  movement actually preached two "whatevers": Whatever Stalin  said brooks no skepticism; whatever experience the Soviet Union  created must be copied indiscriminately. Our party did not  follow their advice in every respect. Later we even clearly  told leaders of the CPSU (the Communist Party of the Soviet  Union) that we do not agree with some of the things they have  done and with some of their practices." (see Chairman Mao's  Speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central  Committee) This distinctly displayed the spirit of maintaining  independence and the originality of the party Central Committee  headed by Chairman Mao. If we had copied the Soviet Union's  experience indiscriminately from the founding of New China,  China's socialist transformation would not have proceeded so  smoothly.    At this point, I would also like to speak about my  reflection  on Chairman Mao's instructions on the focal point of work. At  the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee,  which was held immediately before the founding of New China,  Chairman Mao said: "From the first day we take over the city,  we must keep a close watch on the restoration and development of  the city's production. We must not act rashly so that we will  not forget the central task." All other work in the city "must  be subject to and serve the central task of production and  construction." On 1 June 1949 he clearly pointed out: "From  now on, emphasis must be placed on development. Friends in all  quarters are expected to join forces. In September 1954, in his  government work report, Premier Zhou set the goal of achieving  modernizations of industry, agriculture, communications and  transportation, and defense. This is the first expression of  the four modernizations. On 31 March 1955 when making a  concluding speech at the national party congress, Chairman Mao  said: We have entered a new historical period when we will  apply ourselves to socialist industrialization, socialist  transformation, modernization of defense, and studying atomic  energy. He gave a speech at the Supreme State Conference on 25  January 1956, clearly pointing out: "The socialist revolution  is aimed at liberating productive forces." This clearly  indicated that while focusing on socialist transformation,  Chairman Mao never forgot the central task of economic  development and worked for a shift to this central task at an  early date.    In our party, Chairman Mao was the first person to discover  the drawbacks of the Soviet Union's set-ups and economic  strategy. After the death of Stalin, the Soviet Union's  deep-seated problems were exposed in turn. This made Chairman  Mao realize that the Soviet Union's experience was not flawless  and perfect. Hence, in late 1955, immediately before the 20th  CPSU National Congress, he talked about his idea of "taking  warning from the Soviet Union" at a meeting attended by only a  small number of members of the central leading body. Guided by  this idea, he took more than two months to listen to reports  made by 30 ministries and commissions and then set about  evaluating our own experience so as to blaze a new path to  socialism, a path which suited China's actual conditions. His  speech entitled "10 Major Relations," which was his distillation  of combined wisdom of the entire party, advanced a basic  principle of bringing into play every positive factor at home  and abroad to serve the cause of socialism. This was of  far-reaching significance and served as a guide for a long time.  I personally witnessed Chairman Mao's strenuous efforts to  explore truth in this period. I profited greatly from his  spirit and all sorts of feelings welled up in my heart. I will  not say more about this because a special chapter of my book "A  Review of a Number of Major Policy Decisions and Events" has  been devoted to the matter. Here, I would only like to  summarize the important viewpoints Chairman Mao raised or  approved in the one-year period from the time he made the speech  to the summer of 1957 and to discuss in brief the significance  of these viewpoints.    To my knowledge, the important viewpoints raised in this  period can be summed up in the following 14 points.    1. The theory of two types of contradictions. This theory  played an important part in deciding on the main subject of the  political life of the country and party, in creating political  unity and stability, and in focusing on socialist construction.    2. The theory concerning the shift of the principal  contradiction and of the focal point of work. Since the  "Decision about the Political Report" adopted by the Eighth CPC  National Congress had confirmed that the contradiction between  the material and cultural demands of the people and the failure  to meet these demands had constituted the primary contradiction  of the society rather than the contradiction between the  proletariat and the capitalist class, it was undoubtedly logical  that the focal point of work was shifted to socialist  construction.    3. The theory of fundamental contradictions in a socialist  society. This theory confirmed that fundamental contradictions  in a socialist society remain the contradiction between the  relations of production and productive forces and that between  the superstructure and the economic basis and that the  contradictions are no longer antagonistic in nature as they were  in the old society. This indicated: The contradiction in a  socialist society can be solved through self-regulation. The  constant development and constant solution of the two  contradictions provide driving force for the development of the  socialist society. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "More than 20  years of practice reveals that such a formulation is better than  others." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 1975-82,  page 168) This theory can still serve as a guide for our  present reform.    The above three points constituted a whole set of theories  concerning the contradictions in a socialist society. They were  the scientific results Chairman Mao obtained by applying the law  of the unity of opposites to observing the socialist society.  They also made a major breakthrough of the traditional idea  that only moral identity but no contradictions exist in a  socialist society, representing an important development of  Marxism.    4. The idea of giving play to the initiative of the central  government and of localities. This meant that central  government must delegate a part of its power over state affairs  to local governments. Chairman Mao formulated this idea by  integrating China's experience in national development and  Western countries' experience in developing the economy.    5. While making it a rule that state-owned enterprises must  be run by the state, allow enterprises to enjoy a certain degree  of autonomy, and while stipulating that the state market must  play a dominant role, allow free markets to serve as supplements  to state- controlled markets in certain areas.    6. Allow individual economy to serve as a supplement to the  public and collective sectors, "allow capitalism to be  reinstated after being eliminated"; give underground factories a  legal status and allow them to hire workers; and stipulate that  overseas Chinese- funded factories will not be taken over for 20  or even 100 years. This represented a breakthrough in the  traditional concept that regarded public ownership as the only  ownership in a socialist society.    7. The principle of taking into account the interests of the  state, the collective, and the individual in interest  distribution. This was a principle based on the Soviet Union's  lesson.    8. The economic strategy of developing industry and  agriculture simultaneously and of developing of heavy and light  industries simultaneously, which is a strategy of achieving  industrialization the Chinese way.    9. The call for "marching toward the modernization of  science," for "catching up with the advanced world scientific  level," and for building up a mighty contingent of technicians  of the working class.    10. The policy of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a  hundred schools of thought contend. This reflects the objective  law governing the development of science and arts. This policy  was different from the Soviet Union's policy favoring only the  opinions of a certain theoretician and a certain school of art  to the exclusion of others.    11. The principle of long-term coexistence and mutual  supervision. This principle was the product of Chinese history,  adding new content to the system of multiparty cooperation under  the CPC leadership, a system formed under China's historical  conditions.    12. The goal of strengthening democracy and the legal  system. The goal is "to create a political situation in which  there are both centralism and democracy, both discipline and  freedom, both unity of will and personal ease of mind and  liveliness" so as to facilitate socialist construction and to  put the country in a better position against risks.    13. The idea of "all patriots belonging to one big family,  whether they rally to the common cause early or late" and the  proposal to liberate Taiwan in a peaceful way. These were  announced by Premier Zhou in his report to the third session of  the first NPC in June 1956.    14. The strategy of "uniting all the international forces  that can be united, persuade the forces that have a bias to  observe neutrality, and split up and utilize the reactionary  forces."    Most of the above viewpoints were not put into effect and  some of them were still under deliberations, but they showed  that Chairman Mao did try to shake off the yoke of the Soviet  Union's ossified formula and of Stalin's "leftist" ideological  guidance in search of a system which is flexible and an  ideological guidance which suits China's actual conditions.    Regrettably, after the second half of 1957, Chairman Mao  overestimated the gravity of the class struggle at home and  abroad and developed arrogance and conceit and was overanxious  for quick results because of a series of major successes. As a  result, he provided "leftist" ideological guidance for China's  economic and social development as well as for the state and the  party's political activities, which led to "leftist" failings in  the following 20 years. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Comrade Mao  Zedong's mistakes lay in going against the correct principles he  had upheld." (p 262) According my understanding, "the correct  principles" refer, among other things, to the ideological line  of seeking truth from facts, which Chairman Mao upheld for a  long time, and the correct viewpoints he raised in the process  of his exploration.    Nevertheless, Chairman Mao, after all, was a great  explorer. After 1957, especially in early 1960's when the  mistakes resulting from the Great Leap Forward and from "setting  up the people's commune" were being corrected, he still put  forward on a number of occasions many valuable opinions, which  radiated with his ideology of marching forward in exploration.  To the best of my memory, he raised six valuable opinions.    1. The law of value is "a great school." After suffering  the serious setbacks in "removing bourgeois rights," "providing  free meals," and the "communist wind characterized by extreme  equalitarianism and the indiscriminate, unpaid-for transfer of  resources from one collective to another or from one level of  ownership to another," he realized that China is a country with  an underdeveloped market economy, that it is necessary to  vigorously develop the production of commodities as well as  commodity exchange, and that peasants must not be exploited.    2. It would take China 100 years to catch up with advanced  capitalist countries. China's socialist society could be  divided into two stages: Underdeveloped socialist society and  developed socialist society. He also predicted that the latter  would last longer than the former.    3. The economic strategy of taking agriculture as the  foundation and industry as the leading factor and the opinion of  arranging the national economic priorities in the order of  agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry.    4. The idea of attaining the strategic objective in two  steps: First, set up independent and comparatively complete  industrial and national economic systems; and second, achieve  the four modernizations of agriculture, industry, national  defense, and science and technology. This idea was advanced in  Premier Zhou's government work report to the first session of  the third NPC held at the turn of 1964 and 1965. The standard  term of the four modernizations in use now originated from this  report.    5. Support for the pilot scheme of leading comrades of the  central authorities in establishing trusts. This indicated that  Chairman Mao was aware of the drawbacks of managing the economy  by administrative means by the early 1960's.    6. The idea of "two participations, one reform, and  three-way combination (cadre participation in productive labor  and worker participation in management; reform of irrational and  outdated rules and regulations; and close cooperation among  workers, cadres, and technicians)." This meant applying the  party's mass line to management of enterprises, a practice which  was never found in enterprise management in the Soviet Union or  in capitalist countries.    At the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central  Committee in September 1957, Chairman Mao mistakenly changed the  scientific thesis of the Eighth CPC National Congress on the  primary contradiction of society, but at the 10th Plenary  Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee in 1962, he still  made socialist construction a central task. In January 1958, he  said: From this year on, "the party should focus on  technological revolution." In late 1958 when meeting with  foreign guests, he said that China is making a new revolution, a  revolution against earth and nature. In the period around the  National Day of 1959 when receiving foreign guests, he also  said: In the next 10 to 20 years, we will concentrate our  energy on economic development. Only in reality, he did not act  as he said.    Launching the Great Cultural Revolution was a glaring  mistake  which had a bearing on the overall situation. Nothing of the  movement itself can be regarded as positive, and a historical  conclusion on it was made long ago. Nevertheless, during the  Great Cultural Revolution Chairman Mao still made important  contributions to improving the international environment for  China's socialist construction. He put forward the theory of  the three worlds and the important principle that China will  never seek hegemony. In addition, he succeeded in foiling U.S.  attempt to enforce a diplomatic blockade of China. Elderly  comrades must remember that one of the major events that  attracted worldwide attention in the 1970's was that Chairman  Mao and Premier Zhou made an important contribution to  normalization of Sino-U.S. relations by seizing upon the  opportunity offered by Richard Nixon, who expressed willingness  to improve Sino-U.S. relations after he became master of the  White House. Immediately after that, China established  diplomatic relations with Japan, Canada, Italy, the Federal  Republic of Germany (FRG), and Australia, thus greatly breaking  the 20-year-old blockade initiated by the United States. After  establishing diplomatic relations with these countries, China  also improved economic relations with them. At that time, the  Gang of Four, while keeping up a terrific row, tried by hook or  by crook to prevent China from making contacts with the West.  The "snail incident" [not further specified] must remain fresh  in the memory of many comrades. However, with the support of  Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou prevailed over all dissenting views  and opened the door wide to introduce Western technology and  equipment into China. In the 1970's, China imported 22 sets of  major equipment from 10 countries including Japan, the FRG, and  the United States. Does everybody not see clearly the positive  role the equipment has played in China's economic development?    At this point I recall the well-known verses of our great  patriotic poet Qu Yuan: "The way stretched endlessly ahead, I  shall search heaven and earth." On the endless road of China's  revolution and development, Chairman Mao made untiring efforts  to explore and clear the way to forge ahead. In the early days  of New China he pondered over the strategy for building up  socialism which complied with China's actual conditions. He  made concentrated efforts in this respect in 1956 and in the  first half of 1957. Thereafter, he committed "leftist" mistakes  but did not give up his exploration until he died. We may sum  up his efforts this way: He was correct when he made first  explorations and advanced many important ideas which can serve  as long-term guidance. Later his exploration proceeded in both  correct and incorrect directions and ended up with the  10-year-old tumultuous Great Cultural Revolution. Therefore, it  should be admitted that his exploration was not successful.  There are no ready-made models to copy in building socialism in  a big country in the east with a backward economy and culture  like China. Making mistakes in such an exploration is  understandable, but is still deplorable. Concerning this point,  the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of the  Party" pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes are, after  all, ones committed by a great proletarian revolutionary." "His  tragedy lies in the fact that when he committed great mistakes,  he still repeatedly called on the entire party membership to  earnestly study the works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin and still  believed that his theories and practice agreed with Marxism and  were necessary for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship."    Fortunately, with the end of the Great Cultural Revolution  and the rectification of the party's guiding ideology, our party  finally discovered the strategy for building up socialism which  tallies with China's actual conditions. This strategy was  gradually formed after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, and this is the path charted by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, a path which has been confirmed by the 14th CPC  National Congress. This is the road we must follow in  developing socialism in China, in enabling China to become a  prosperous and strong country and to gain a foothold among other  countries in the world, and in ensuring that our socialist cause  will withstand risks in a more effective way and be always  invincible. Our comrades can decide for themselves: If we had  followed the course favored by those who advocated resolutely  upholding whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made and  unswervingly following whatever instructions he gave, rather  than the course charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, would the  historic leap forward over the last decade and more have been  possible? Would we have been able to stand up to the tests of  the political upheaval and of the drastic change in the former  Soviet Union and Eastern Europe several years ago?    The theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics  is the product of the great practice of reform and opening up  and bears the distinctive imprint of the times. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping has made important and historic contribution in this  regard, which everybody can see for himself. In fact Comrade  Deng Xiaoping began to rectify the erroneous ideological and  political lines as early as 1975, displaying his great political  and theoretical courage. At that time he said: "It is  necessary to overhaul and consolidate the Army, to reorganize  industrial production, and to straighten things out in every  field of work." Because all this, in essence, amounted to  negating the Great Cultural Revolution, which was not allowed by  Chairman Mao, Deng Xiaoping was ousted once more. After 1977,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping undertook the strenuous task of leading  the whole party in rectifying the erroneous ideological and  political lines, beginning the mission by repudiating the  doctrine of the "two whatevers." The documents included in the  1975-82 volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  convincingly reveal that after being reinstated, he was a de  facto principal policy decisionmaker of the campaign against the  erroneous ideological and political lines. After the 12th CPC  National Congress, the party Central Committee adopted a series  of major policy resolutions on the reform, opening up, and  modernization drive to bring up a new situation of socialist  construction, but most of these resolutions were based on  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's suggestions. The documents contained in  the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"  recorded accurately the historic contributions he made in the  10-year period and his foresight and sagacity as the chief  architect of our reform, of the opening policy, and of the  modernization program. While reading the two books our comrades  will have little difficulty in finding out most of the nine  contents of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics summarized in the report to the 14th CPC  National Congress are contained in the two books, where you can  find the source of the contents and their brilliant expositions.  Therefore, it occurred to me that just as Comrade Mao Zedong  was worthy of the practice of crowning the thought created in  the course of China's revolution and development, which was an  embodiment of the combined wisdom of the entire party, with his  personal name, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is also worthy of the  practice of preceding the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics created under the new historical  conditions, which is also an embodiment of the combined wisdom  of the entire party, with his personal name.    In the process of exploring the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, Comrade Xiaoping incorporated all  the positive results Chairman Mao achieved in his exploration,  which can still serve as guidance at the present stage including  those correct ideas which were not acted on or were in fact  later negated by Chairman Mao himself. However, what is most  important is that Comrade Deng Xiaoping drew lessons from  Chairman Mao's mistakes, especially his mistakes in initiating  the Great Cultural Revolution, thus changing the bad thing into  a good one. So Comrade Xiaoping said: "It appears the event  (the Great Cultural Revolution) was a bad thing, but, in the  final analysis, it was a good thing, because it enabled people  to think things out for themselves and see clearly where our  drawbacks lie." "The present principles and policies are  exactly based on the conclusion we deduced from the Great  Cultural Revolution." (pp 172, 223)    How has the erroneous Great Cultural Revolution prompted the  formation of new ideas and new theories? Comrade Xiaoping said:  "The most fundamental lesson is that we must gain a clear idea  of socialism as well as communism and of the way to build  socialism." During the Great Cultural Revolution, the Gang of  Four absurdly claimed that poor socialism and communism is  better than affluent capitalism. Comrade Xiaoping said: "It  stands to reason that affluent capitalism is undesirable, but  how can we advocate poor socialism and communism? As a result,  China has stagnated. This compelled us to reconsider our  problems. After consideration we decided that the first thing  we must do was to uphold socialism. To uphold socialism, we  must first of all shake off poverty and backwardness, vigorously  develop productive forces, and give expression of priorities of  socialism over capitalism. To achieve this, we must shift the  focal point of work to the four modernizations and regard the  four modernizations as the objective to be attained in the  coming years. At the same time, to avoid making the same  mistakes as we did in the past, we must not close the country to  international interchange any more, must arouse the people's  enthusiasm, and must formulate open and reform policies." (pp  223-224) In this passage, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly told us  the relationship between the formation of the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the positive and  negative historical experiences. The task of achieving the four  modernizations, the need for the whole party to focus on  developing productive forces, to give expression to the  superiority of socialism over capitalism in helping develop  productive forces, and other viewpoints, were set forth by the  first generation of central leadership headed by Chairman Mao,  but they were discarded afterwards. The erroneous Great  Cultural Revolution proved from the negative side the  correctness of these viewpoints. After the disastrous Great  Cultural Revolution, when the questions of peace and development  have become two top priorities on the international agenda,  after socialism has suffered serious setback in many places in  the world, and after we have introduced reform and the open  policy for a certain period, however, we were not content with  correcting our mistakes and restoring correct viewpoints, but  greatly developed the correct viewpoints and put forward new  viewpoints, which are, for instance: The socialist economy was  a planned commodity economy based on public ownership; China was  still in the primary stage of socialism; socialism was not  antagonistic to the market economy; China could not separate its  economic development from the rest of the world; and so on. It  was on the basis of these viewpoints that the series of  principles and policies for reform and opening up, the basic  line of "one central task, two basic points," and the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics gradually took  shape.    Studying and propagating the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics is an important and long-term task  for our comrades in ideological and theoretical circles.  Gaining a clear idea of the relationship between this theory  and the explorations Chairman Mao made will help us understand  the source of this theory and the enormous cost we have paid for  it. This in turn will help us understand the difficulty in  theoretical exploration and deepen our understanding of this  theory. All this will prove useful in making our work a success.    The current domestic and international situation provides us  with a rare and favorable opportunity for economic development.  Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines laid down by the  14th national party congress and after conducting earnest  studies and investigations and evaluating past experience, the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee timely  made the "Decision on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a  Socialist Market Economic Structure," which drew up a blueprint  for setting up a socialist market economic structure. The  decision is our program for action in economic restructuring in  the 1990's. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently said: "We must seize  upon the opportunity to step up reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive in an effort to initially set up a socialist  market economic structure by the end of the century, achieving  the second-step strategic goal of giving the people a  comparatively comfortable life, and elevating our overall  national strength to a new level." The task is heavy and the  road ahead is long. In his talks given during his south China  tour, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in all earnestness and  sincerity: "We have engaged in building socialism for several  decades only. China is still in the primary stage of socialism.  It will take a long historical period, as well as the  unremitting effort of several generations, a dozen generations,  or even scores of generations, to consolidate and develop the  socialist system, so we must not treat the task lightly." (pp  379-380) I hope our comrades, under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, will firmly uphold the party's basic line for a  hundred years, get down to earth to work, evaluate their  experience while taking part in practice, study new problems,  and explore new ways for solving new problems, thus making their  due contributions to enriching and developing the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

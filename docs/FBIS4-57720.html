			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the five federations [of coca  growers] of the Cochabamba tropical region has said that  mobilizations could start at any moment. The coca growers are  threatening to start blocking highways and stage rallies in  Cochabamba demanding the abolishment of the supreme decree  regulating the industrialization of coca leaf.    We will now listen to what Jorge Martinez has to say about  the matter:    [Begin recording] [Martinez] [words indistinct] to again  implement measures of pressure to demand the fulfillment of the  claims made by the whole of Cochabamba because, so far, the  government has done nothing but sign agreements and hold  meetings, while in practice it has done nothing.    [Unidentified reporter] In addition to protest, will  highways  be blockaded?    [Martinez] There will probably be road blockades and protest  marches in Cochabamba and the tropical regions. [end recording]    We wish to announce, moreover, that during our visit to the  tropical region of the Chapare we were able to see for ourselves  that there is no such militarization of the region; there are no  troops in the tropical region of the Chapare, as has been  reported.    This fact has been confirmed by William Condori, leader of  the coca growers:    [Begin recording] In (Villa Catorce) and further inland, in  the Simon Secure Park, we have confirmed reports that there is  no type of militarization of the tropical zone in Cochabamba. We  have also heard government spokesmen talk about the possibility  of a militarization of the Cochabamba tropical region, but so  far we have seen no troops. [end recording]    As you have just heard, there are no troops in the tropical  Chapare region.    Condori also said there are no narco-guerrillas in the zone,  and that it would be good for a special commission to enter the  region to investigate reports of the alleged existence of  narco-guerrillas.</p>

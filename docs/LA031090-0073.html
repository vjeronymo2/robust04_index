			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAA GROUNDS PLANE CREW CHARGED WITH DRINKING  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday revoked the licenses of three  Northwest Airlines crew members charged with flying from Fargo, N.D., to  Minneapolis under the influence of alcohol.  </P> <P> The three Boeing 727 crew members -- a captain, second officer and flight  engineer -- were taken into custody by airport police officers Thursday morning  at the gate in Minneapolis after a citizen's arrest by an FAA inspector.  </P> <P> He had received an anonymous tip that the three had been drinking in the Fargo  area Wednesday night.  </P> <P> A Northwest spokesman said that there had been no irregularities during the  flight.  </P> <P> FAA regulations prohibit drinking within eight hours of flying a plane.  Northwest has a stricter rule -- 12 hours.  </P> <P> Federal air regulations also prohibit flying a plane with a blood-alcohol level  of .04 or more.  </P> <P> FAA Administrator James B. Busey issued a statement saying: "Safety and alcohol  do not mix. We have taken quick and effective action in this case, and we will  take equally forceful action against any other pilot who violates the agency's  regulations against alcohol."  </P> <P> Bob Gibbons, director of media relations for Northwest, said it is "wholly  appropriate" for the FAA to take any action it feels necessary, and that the  Northwest investigation continues.  </P> <P> The crew members have 10 days to protest the FAA action.  </P> <P> In an unrelated move, the FAA fined Northwest $200,000 for improper maintenance  in an incident Jan. 4 over Florida in which a chunk of "blue ice" broke off the  fuselage of a Boeing 727 and knocked off an engine.  </P> <P> The FAA said a faulty valve on a lavatory leaked, causing ice to form outside  the plane. It said the valve leak had been reported several times but was not  properly repaired. The 727 flew 53 flights with the faulty valve, the agency  said.  </P></p>

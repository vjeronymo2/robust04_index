			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MURDER SUSPECT IS RETURNED FROM SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY  </P> <P> A suspect in the murder earlier this month of a 23-year-old Escondido woman was  returned to San Diego on Sunday from the San Joaquin Valley community of  Kingsburg, where he was captured Friday.  </P> <P> Filomen Huerta, 23, of Escondido was wanted on a arrest warrant, with bail set  at $1 million, in the slaying of Sylvia Flores, whose decomposing body was  found along San Pasqual Road near the San Diego Wild Animal Park on Sept. 16.  Flores died from a blow to the face with a blunt instrument, the county  coroner's office said.  </P> <P> Huerta's automobile was spotted in Kingsburg on Friday by law enforcement  officers, who arrested him without incident.  </P> <P> San Diego police homicide detectives returned him to San Diego on Sunday. His  arraignment is expected early this week.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Dave Cohen said investigators no longer believe that Flores'  slaying was related to a series of murders of young women, many of them  prostitutes, over the past several years.  </P> <P> Huerta was identified as a suspect in the Flores murder by a joint  investigation conducted by San Diego and Escondido police and the Metropolitan  Homicide Task Force, which is investigating the more than 40 unsolved murders.  </P> <P> The suspect and victim were acquainted, Cohen said, but no motive has been  found for the murder. Huerta is not a suspect in any other killings, Cohen  said.  </P></p>

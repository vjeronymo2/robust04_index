			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carline and different countries of assembly. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  AAMA supported NHTSA's tentative conclusion that carline is not distinguished by country of final assembly. That organization noted that the statutory definition is similar to the definition used in other Federal regulations and is also used in industry to establish carlines. AAMA argued that to maintain consistency among Federal regulations and to minimize the administrative burden, the definitions and interpretation of carline used for the Labeling Act should be the same as those used for CAFE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA also commented that it disagrees with including additional information on the label for carlines that are assembled in more than one country. That organization argued that separate content carline calculations, one set for each assembly country and the entire carline, would cause unnecessary burden and confuse consumers. According to AAMA, this method would create the same or more confusion than allowing manufacturers to separate carlines based on country of assembly. That organization also commented that vehicles produced in both the U.S. and Canada would have similar content values, and listing information twice would cause confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the United Auto Workers (UAW) did not submit a comment on the NPRM, it made the following argument in response to the agency's 1992 request for comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (I)n doing the model line calculations, imported vehicles must be combined with vehicles produced in the United States. The automakers do not have the option of splitting the two groups of vehicles. The definition of ``carline'' in the new statute is based on the definition under the CAFE program. Since those standards do not permit foreign and domestic versions of the same carline to be split, this should not be allowed under the vehicle content labeling statute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AIAM commented that failing to allow manufacturers to distinguish between countries of production within a particular carline directly contradicts the Act's stated purpose of providing consumers with the best and most understandable information possible. That organization stated that it believes that NHTSA has the authority to adopt a country-of-production split for determining the parts content percentages for carlines, in order to follow this stated intent of the Act. According to AIAM, without carline subdivision, the information presented to the consumer will be at best misleading, and at worst totally inaccurate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JAMA urged that separate calculations for carlines manufactured in more than one country at least be permitted. That organization stated that the failure to specify such percentages separately would result in an overstated domestic content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically produced vehicles. According to JAMA, the U.S. consumer cannot possibly be served by such misleading information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota stated that it believes the agency's tentative conclusion that country of assembly should not be considered in making carline determinations is incorrect as a matter of statutory construction and Congressional intent. It argued that the statute does not compel NHTSA to require averaging of equipment content information on a worldwide basis for a particular carline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota stated that since section 210(b)(1)(A) requires disclosure of the percentage of U.S./Canadian-origin equipment ``installed on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> such <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  vehicle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> within <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a carline,'' the Labeling Act contemplates that the percentage disclosed will have a relationship to both the individual vehicle and the carline to which it belongs. (Emphasis in Toyota's comment.) That company recognized that section 210(b)(2) requires the calculation of the percentage to made ``for such carline,'' but argued that it is incorrect to read section 210(b)(2) out of context and ``in disregard of the requirement imposed by the literal language of section 210(b)(1)(A).'' Toyota argued that a model carline percentage that fails to approximate the level of content on the particular vehicle would not satisfy this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota also argued that the lack of a reference in the statutory definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> carline <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the country or countries where a carline is assembled indicates that the agency may exercise a level of discretion in determining how the (b)(1)(A) calculation is to be performed with respect to carlines manufactured in multiple countries. That company stated that NHTSA's exercise of that discretion should be guided by section 210(d)'s requirement that the ultimate purchaser should be provided ``the best and most understandable information possible.'' Toyota argued that consumers reading the label will expect the equipment content percentages disclosed on the label to apply to a class of vehicles of which the particular vehicle being observed is representative. That company argued that any such disclosure that attempts to average, for example, vehicles manufactured in the United States or Canada with vehicles manufactured in Japan cannot possibly provide the consumer with meaningful information because of dissimilarity with respect to the sourcing of equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota also argued that it believes the treatment of carline under CAFE regulations is irrelevant to the issue of whether Labeling Act equipment content reporting must be averaged for a carline produced in more than one country. That company argued that the two statutes have completely different purposes. Toyota stated that it may be appropriate under CAFE to average fuel economy data, because fuel economy of a carline is determined by vehicle design, an element that vehicles in a carline have in common regardless of where they are produced. That commenter stated that the opposite is the case for sourcing patterns, which typically differ greatly by country of manufacture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda argued that the agency's tentative decision to combine ``dual nationality'' nameplates into a single carline is fundamentally inconsistent with the stated goal of the sponsor of the legislation_providing consumers sufficient information to ``buy American'' if they so choose. That company argued that, under the agency's proposal, the domestic content of the equipment on U.S./Canadian built ``dual nationality'' vehicles will be understated, while the domestic content of the equipment on their foreign-built twins will be overstated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda stated that there is no reason to read the law to require such a result that it believes would frustrate the fundamental purpose of the Labeling Act. It noted the agency's stated concern that determining carlines based on country of origin would permit identical cars to be placed in different carlines, and argued that this result will occur under the agency's proposal. That company cited the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable as an example. Honda also cited NHTSA's stated concern that consumers might be confused if they took delivery of a vehicle with a label indicating a different ``carline'' than the vehicle they test drove. That company stated that this potential for confusion is not greater than that which might arise if the delivered vehicle shows a different final assembly point or country of origin of the engine or transmission than those on the label of the test driven model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

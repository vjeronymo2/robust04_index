			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 22 KYODO -- Price differences between  domestic and foreign rice and wheat should be reduced by 20  percent by the year 2000 to protect Japanese growers from  foreign rivals with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks, a government calculation indicated  Sunday [22 May].    According to the calculation, the producer rice price  averaged 17,700 yen per 60 kilograms from 1986 to 1988, more  than 10 times higher than the price of Thai rice, the cheapest  on the international rice markets.    Under the agreement signed in mid-April by a ministerial  meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in  Marrakech, Morocco, Japan will open 4 percent of its long-closed  rice market to imports under a "minimum access" formula with the  rate increasing each year until it reaches 8 percent.    After a six-year grace period, Japan will have to convert  all  rice import restrictions into tariffs.    Under such conditions, the government should slash its  purchase price of domestic rice by 18 percent and that of wheat  by 16 percent from current levels by the year 2000 to make  domestic production competitive on the international markets,  according to the government calculation.    Base on the calculation, the government plans to gradually  reduce producer prices of rice and wheat from this year.    Under the staple food system, the government buys much of  the  rice crop at a set price and resells it at lower prices to  consumers by subsidizing the price gap.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Warning over rail privatisation TWO academics who support the government's rail privatisation plans warn in a report published today that ministers may have seriously underestimated the political risks of their policy. Mr Stephen Glaister and Mr Tony Travers of the London School of Economics say they welcome the introduction of more market discipline to the railways because it should bring big improvements in productivity and service quality. They warn, however, that privatisation will create losers as well as gainers and that 'the political or financial cost of placating them will be high'.</p>

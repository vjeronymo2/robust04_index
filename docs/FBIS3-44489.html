Since a province-wide anti-corruption campaign was mounted  last May Anhui has discovered that public funds have been  misappropriated to the tune of 826 million yuan, of which 774  million yuan has been recovered, according to the local  authorities.    Over the years some government cadres in Anhui routinely  embezzled public money and deposited it in their bank accounts.  They also used public money to offer high-interest loans, build  private houses, buy high-class furniture, gamble and visit  prostitutes.    These corrupt practices have sparked widespread public  resentment, which led to a government-orchestrated clampdown.    The number of officials involved in the spending of public  funds on the education of their offspring and relatives totalled  more than 300,000, including hundreds of government  functionaries at bureau and county levels.    The campaign also uncovered some cases dating back to as  early as the 1950s. This revealed flaws in the system of  management of public funds, said a provincial official.    The investigations further revealed financial and accounting  problems at the village level, which had resulted in the  peasants' mistrust of the government.    A provincial official said that thousands of offenders have  been detained and prosecuted. The resolute actions of the  government have restored the confidence of the public and  advanced the goal of building a clean government, he noted.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO TO SEEK EXTRADITION IN KIDNAPING  </P> <P> The Mexican government said it would formally request today the extradition of  two men who allegedly plotted the kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor accused in  the murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique S. Camarena.  </P> <P> The bulletin from the Mexican Foreign Ministry, released Thursday, also stated  that the U.S. State Department has replied to Mexico's requests for information  about the abduction and the return of the doctor for questioning by Mexican  authorities. The contents of the reply were not revealed.  </P> <P> The Mexican government, which has objected to the kidnaping of Dr. Humberto  Alvarez Machain as an insult to its sovereignity, was said to be studying the  reply.  </P> <P> The Mexican ambassador to the United States has been instructed to ask that  U.S. authorities arrest Hector Berrellez, a Los Angeles-based Drug Enforcement  Administration agent, and Antonio Garate Velarde, a DEA informant.  </P> <P> An arrest would be the first step toward turning them over to Mexican  authorities. Mexico's attorney general previously issued warrants for the  arrest of the men. Six other suspects in the kidnaping, including three Mexican  police officers, have been arrested here.  </P> <P> Garate, a former Mexican police officer, said in an interview last April that  he arranged the abduction of Alvarez in Guadalajara on April 2 and his delivery  to three Los Angeles-based DEA agents who were waiting in El Paso.  </P> <P> Garate claimed that the operation was approved by Berellez, who headed the  investigation into the torture and murder of Camarena in Guadalajara and was  one of the agents who arrested Alvarez in El Paso. Berellez has refused to  comment on Garate's account of the kidnaping and other DEA agents have said he  was not aware of the details of the Alvarez kidnaping until after it occurred.  </P> <P> DEA agents had long sought Alvarez, who allegedly administered drugs to revive  Camarena, permitting drug traffickers to torture him further. In 1985, Camarena  was kidnaped off the streets of Guadalajara. His mutilated body was found  several weeks later, and a massive manhunt for his killers was conducted.  </P> <P> About two dozen people, including drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero, have been  convicted in Mexico for their involvement in the murder. Mexican authorities  reopened the case in May, shortly after the trial of four suspects in the  killing opened in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Depending on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA. However, in many situations, licensees who have little or no site contamination should be able to readily achieve a dose level well below the limit. The NRC will provide guidance as to how such licensees can demonstrate compliance with Section 20.1404(b) without having to perform sophisticated analyses to demonstrate that residual radioactivity levels at their sites are ALARA. This should substantially reduce the administrative burden on licensees who have little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short lived radioisotopes). There are approximately 17,000 NRC and Agreement State licensees, many of which are small businesses, that are expected to benefit from this guidance without any compromise to public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Time Frame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated in the rationale for the proposed rule, the Commission believes the 1000 year time frame proposed by the NRC staff is reasonable for estimating annual doses from residual radioactivity from decommissioned sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When predicting thousands of years into the future, uncertainties become very large because of major potential changes in the hydrogeologic regime at the site over these long periods of time. When the potential consequences of exposure to the radioactive source are great; e.g., as in the case of a high level waste repository, distant future calculations may provide some insight concerning the relative magnitude of consequences. However, the consequences of exposure to residual radioactivity at levels near background are small and considering the large uncertainties, long term modeling of near background doses may be virtually meaningless. Thus, the Commission does not believe it would serve any useful purpose to attempt to estimate radiation doses from residual radioactivity thousands of years into the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Individual vs Collective Doses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that collective dose should be used by the NRC to evaluate costs and benefits of alternative radiological criteria. The Department of Energy suggested that an ALARA analysis, based on collective dose and competing risks for certain sites with low population exposure, might indicate that the criteria proposed by the NRC may not be justifiable. Most commenters favored using dose to individuals to ensure protection of the public health. Many citizen/environmental groups disagreed with the proposal to limit individual dose to the ``average member of the Critical Group.'' They recommended that the goal and limit as described in the staff's draft rule be applied to the maximally exposed individual in the exposure group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with the commenters that collective dose should be used by the NRC to evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative radiological criteria. In fact, this has been incorporated in the assessment of the total risk for the respective alternatives in the GEIS and the RA. Although these documents were unavailable for review by the commenters, the technical analyses in the GEIS and the RA support the criteria in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission considers the use of TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group to be a more useful concept for the purposes of decommissioning for the reasons discussed in the Rationale for the Proposed Rule. The discussion of ``Critical Group'' in the Rationale has been revised to make it clear that the critical group must be reasonably homogeneous. This clarifies that the licensee cannot average doses over a group whose members may be expected to get widely differing doses for the purpose of ``averaging down'' expected doses to highly exposed individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Consistency and Compatibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As was the case at the earlier workshops, commenters urged that the NRC and the EPA work together to develop consistent standards. Conservation of Federal resources and avoidance of imposing different standards on regulated parties were considered to be important. However, the NRC was advised not to lower its risk limit simply to accommodate the EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters recommended that the degree of consistency that the NRC will require between NRC standards and Agreement State standards be clearly stated. One commenter suggested that the Federal standard be set to ensure adequate protection of the public and that if a State or local community requires a licensee to decommission to a lower standard that does not provide a significant benefit, then the State or local community should fund this extra effort. Agreement State commenters requested that the statement of considerations for the proposed rulemaking discuss the extent to which they must implement specific provisions of the rule to maintain continued regulatory compatibility with NRC regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the comments concerning the relationship between NRC and EPA standards, NRC and EPA are developing decommissioning criteria in parallel rulemaking efforts. The NRC and EPA are coordinating their efforts in this area to ensure that effective and consistent site decommissioning standards are established, while minimizing duplication of effort. Accordingly, the EPA was an important participant in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC has also consulted extensively with EPA throughout the rulemaking process. The objective is that EPA will be able to make a finding that NRC decommissioning criteria provide adequate protection for the public and the environment and will exclude NRC licensees from the EPA cleanup standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the question of NRC/Agreement State compatibility, the Commission is developing a new policy on Agreement State compatibility which will be issued for public comment in the near future. Because the compatibility determination for this proposed rule will be considered in light of the new compatibility policy, the Commission believes it would be premature to propose a compatibility determination at this time. However, to facilitate ultimate resolution of the compatibility determination for this rule, if adopted as a final rule, the Commission is requesting comments on whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances, an Agreement State should be authorized to establish more stringent requirements than those set forth in this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Finality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finality of decommissioning was a major issue among commenters. Various commenters stated (1) that revisiting sites should be based on new site-specific information and not on new evaluation methods and (2) that the criteria for revisiting sites are too subjective and require clarification or refinement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees that the wording in the NRC staff draft was ambiguous. Therefore, &sect;20.1401(c) has been revised to make it clear that the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determined that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Community Involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff draft specified that the Commission will inform the public of each receipt of a decommissioning plan from a licensee and of each proposal for restricted release of a site. In addition, it specified that licensees who propose to release sites under stipulated conditions of restricted release must convene a Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) for purpose of providing advice to the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several industry commenters questioned the need for these additional requirements on the grounds that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Present procedures for public participation in licensing procedures are adequate and provide an appropriate way to deal with the concerns of those affected by decommissioning;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) There is no demonstrated need; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The provisions of SSABs would put managerial, regulatory, and financial matters of licensees in the hands of people who have no responsibility for the consequences of their recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most other commenters supported the proposed new community involvement proposals and some commenters additionally urged the NRC to require establishment of an SSAB for all decommissioning cases, including sites suitable for unrestricted release. Others recommended that an SSAB should be used in cases involving Native American lands, sites surrounded by high density residential uses, ocean or waterfront sites, or sensitive ecosystems unless the three (3) millirem per year decommissioning goal would be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional comments on the use of SSABs included:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The rulemaking should delimit SSAB roles and responsibilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / KPMG discusses option to incorporate KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the UK's largest accountancy firms is considering abandoning its traditional partnership status in favour of incorporation. A meeting later this week of senior partners will decide whether to proceed with plans that could lead to it becoming a company as soon as this autumn. The move would be the first by a firm of any size to incorporate, although it has been theoretically possible by law and under professional ethical rules for the past two years. Sources within the firm suggest that the action has been driven primarily as a method of protection against the rising costs of litigation in respect of audit and other clients. Incorporation would be unlikely to lead to the introduction of outside investment or a stock market flotation. It would almost certainly force public disclosure of the firm's financial performance. Accountancy firms are secretive about their results, revealing only their billings. KPMG showed reported revenue of Pounds 498m last year. The firm's decision to consider new options follows radical plans for reorganisation being considered by the larger firms in the US, where the scale of the liability crisis is more serious. A number of other large UK accountancy and other professional firms have discussed incorporation, but none is believed to have gone as far. The 25 'general partners' who control KPMG will meet on Friday and are expected to consider options for the future structure of the firm. Partnerships have unlimited liability when sued - they can be forced to surrender not just the firm's assets such as buildings, but also the personal assets of all the partners. Most senior staff in an equivalent limited liability company would be protected from such claims on their personal assets, except for those who were most directly involved in any negligent advice for which they were being sued. Mr Colin Sharman, head of the firm, would not comment publicly but said: 'I believe incorporation for both accounting and other major firms will be unavoidable.' Background, Page 11</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "What To Expect From G-7 </F> Summit?"]    [Text] Washington, June 28 (XINHUA) -- The annual summit of  the Group of Seven industrialized countries next month will be  the first such meeting in four years when all of the seven  nations are experiencing positive economic growth.    Although such summits rarely accomplished miracles, the  leaders gathering in Naples, Italy, on July 8-10 are expected to  reassure the world with promises of cooperation in dealing with  currency market turmoil.    The leaders of the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Italy,  Britain, and Canada will also have a chance to underscore their  commitment to implement the Uruguay Round agreement, observers  said.    The meeting comes at a time of cautious pride for the G-7  nations, when each of them has brought inflation at below three  percent and some, like the U.S. and Canada, are enjoying robust  economic growth.    There are underlying concerns. The jobless rate in Western  Europe is hovering at between 11 and 12 percent. Current  account and trade imbalances are big worries for Washington.  Japan's economy stays flat.    "There is a law that tends to govern the summit process, the  law of unintended crises. This time, clearly, is the  difficulties of the dollar," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman  of Goldman Sachs International.    The dollar hit a historic low last Tuesday, its worth less  than 100 Japanese yen. Government interventions by major  industrial nations, which own two thirds of the world gross  national products, have largely failed.    The Clinton administration, which stressed that it did not  intend to use the dollar as an instrument to cut U.S. trade  deficit, still has a long way to go to eliminate such concerns  in the markets.    While dumping the issue of dollar decline is impossible at  the summit, the leaders have to walk a fine line between  recognizing the importance of this issue and avoiding raising  expectations too high, observers said.    Summit participants are not central bankers. And if they  cannot deliver, the markets, hoping high for breakthroughs on  currencies and macroeconomic policies, will be disappointed and  bring in new volatility.    Although U.S. Federal Reserve is not considering  intervention  before things get worse, it can raise interest rates in  coordination with the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan for  market stability.    Is it possible? "They'll talk about intervention, but I  doubt  that we'd see a coordinated interest rates changes coming out of  this summit," said C. Michael Aho, senior international  economist at Prudential Securities.    While the Clinton administration still shows considerable  interests in the reforms in Russia and other former Soviet Union  republics, aid is clearly not a priority concern for the White  House now.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is scheduled to attend  the summit, will not see new big aid sums under discussion.  Moscow was promised with 43.4 billion dollars of aid at last  year's G-7 summit in Tokyo.    Without U.S. leadership, noted Robert Legvoid, a political  scientist at Columbia University, "I don't think other members  of the G-7 know how to get their act together in terms of the  industrialized West dealing with Russia."    The meeting is also a follow-up to the G-7 jobs summit held  in March in Detroit, Michigan, although until today, there is no  money or deadlines attached to the jobs proportion of the summit  agenda.    "This was an overall rubric that had to do with  macroeconomic  stimulation, deregulation, renewed commitment to free trade,"  said Robert Stokes, director of the International Trade Project  for the Council on Foreign Relations.    The summit, the 20th of its kind since 1975, also provides  the leaders, both the new and old faces, a chance to reflect on  the summit process. It is a kick-off for Cairo's U.N.  Conference on Population.</p>

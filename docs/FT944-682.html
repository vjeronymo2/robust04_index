			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: The year of the tweaked snouts - The changing attitudes towards boardroom pay For one institutional fund manager, 1994 holds fond memories: 'I will remember it as the year those with their snouts in the trough - Maurice, Cedric and all the others - finally had them tweaked.' The tweaking of snouts refers to huge changes in attitude which have taken place over the past 12 months towards the spicy issue of boardroom pay. Government, fund managers and even directors all now accept the need for change. 'What has happened is that the net of legitimate interest in directors' pay has widened so that many people representing a variety of interests now believe they can have a say,' the fund manager explained. For Maurice Saatchi, the proposing of Pounds 5m-worth of super share options recently led to US and UK institutional shareholders forcing his departure from the board. Cedric Brown's 75 per cent pay rise, which took his basic salary to Pounds 475,000, has been followed by a government examination into the issue of executive pay. The Cabinet inquiry is the first time in several years that the government has deviated from its traditional stance that directors' pay is a matter for shareholders only. Another area of controversy, large pay-offs by companies to directors who have been forced to resign, has also been tackled for the first time this year. In June Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel, the fund management group, launched a campaign to reduce the length of directors' contracts and therefore the size of pay-outs to directors who are forced out. Mr Ross Goobey announced he would be using PosTel's shares to vote against the election and re-election of directors who had rolling service contracts longer than two years. 'At the end of the year, it looks like two-year rollers are now the norm,' Mr Ross Goobey said yesterday. 'But we will have to wait and see over the next two years or so if the shortening of contracts will make much difference to the level of pay-offs'. The significance of 1994 for corporate governance is recognised elsewhere in the City. 'Enormous strides have taken place in the past year,' confirms Ms Anne Simpson, joint managing director of PIRC, the corporate governance consultancy. 'Shareholders are now more aware of their responsibilities.' An academic report, published in August, bolstered the case for change. Drawing on research involving about 170 companies, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research concluded that there was only a small connection between the performance of a company's share price and dividend - the so-called shareholder return - and increases in top executive pay. Worst of all, it stated that there was no relation between directors' pay and profit performance. There were plenty of examples of this during 1994, particularly among directors of the privatised regional electricity companies and water companies. Yesterday, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow Chancellor, published research which claimed that since privatisation every rec chairman had made a million. 'We do not need to scour the country to find men who win the national lottery every year,' Mr Brown said, 'they are sitting in the privatised boardrooms.' While there is little evidence to suggest that directors have tempered their pay rises, the year has seen companies willing to provide a far greater level of pay details to shareholders. At the heart of this move has been Mr Richard Giordano. As chairman of British Gas and BOC, he has pushed both companies towards providing far more details about executive pay in the companies' annual reports. BOC, for example, now gives five pages of information on pay including, for the first time, directors' pension details. This trend is likely to continue next year with Grand Metropolitan, the food and drink conglomerate, and British Gas expected to provide the same level of detail. Mr John Rogers, investment committee secretary of the National Association of Pension Funds, spotlights several other areas to watch in 1995: US pension funds: rule changes in the US mean that fund managers are now likely to vote their shares in the UK. Executive share options: companies are likely to come under pressure to make directors' exercising of their options dependent on more stringent performance measures. Non-executives: the NAPF believes that companies' remuneration committees should comprise solely non-executives, who should stand for re-election annually. Length of directors' contracts: a majority of NAPF members want the norm to be one year rolling contracts.</p>

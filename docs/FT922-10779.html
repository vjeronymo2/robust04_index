			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / World Trade News: NEC, AT&amp;T 'agree pact on chip sales in Japan' NEC, the Japanese electronics company and AT&amp;T Microelectronics, the semiconductor subsidiary of the US telecommunications group, plan a joint venture to sell AT&amp;T chip products in Japan. NEC announced the venture in Tokyo yesterday and stressed its value in reducing US-Japanese trade tensions. But in the US, AT&amp;T Microelectronics said it had only 'initialled a memorandum of understanding' with NEC and 'a lot of work remains to be done' on details. AT&amp;T said the joint sales venture plan had arisen from talks aimed at enhancing an established strategic partnership between the two companies, begun two years ago with a technology exchange accord. AT&amp;T has annual sales of about Dollars 200m (Pounds 112.9m) a year in Japan, but declined to say how far the venture might lead to expanding its sales there. NEC's announcement shows its determination to help resolve the chip trade dispute by boosting US sales in Japan. Last year, the US and Japan agreed the foreign share of the Japanese chip market should reach 20 per cent by the end of this year. But latest data shows the foreign share at only 14.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991 and flat for the past year. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, has expressed concern at the lack of progress, and US chip makers may seek economic sanctions unless sales grow soon.</p>

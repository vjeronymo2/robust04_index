			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A distraught man who allegedly had just killed his ex-wife commandeered a small  plane and held the city of Boston hostage for three hours, firing a  semiautomatic weapon while flying within 50 feet of motorists and buildings  before his capture. Traffic controllers at Logan International Airport said the  pilot buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the facility for an  hour and reroute several late-night flights. Controllers fled the tower twice.  Alfred J. Hunter, 42, pleaded innocent to one count each of murder and armed  robbery after a flight that began late Tuesday and reportedly included a dip  beneath a harbor bridge. Essex County District Judge John T. Doyle ordered  Hunter held without bail at Bridgewater State Hospital for psychiatric  observation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT FUND  </P> <P> The first thing that we found is that our members and seniors generally are  very concerned with the fact that Social Security is considered in  budget-deficit calculations. There is a very large reserve in the Social  Security Trust Fund, and this reserve is loaned to the government to finance  the programs that have been carried on in the last 10 years.  </P> <P> And that money, of course, will have to be repaid. The problem is further  compounded by the fact that in determining what the deficit is in the budget,  the amount of that reserve is deducted from the actual deficit. This gives a  very unrealistic result.  </P> <P> Social Security should be as it was originally, namely an independent agency --  independent of the Congress and independent of the President. Since Social  Security is unique, it's a social insurance program that's paid for by the  people that are members. And as I have indicated, the program is in surplus; it  has a large reserve and so it doesn't require any money from the general  taxpayer.  </P></p>

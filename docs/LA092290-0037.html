			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: POLICE MISTAKE CELTICS' BROWN FOR BANK ROBBER  </P> <P> Dee Brown, a member of the Boston Celtics, said he was held at gunpoint by  several Wellesley, Mass., police officers who apparently thought he was a bank  robbery suspect.  </P> <P> Brown told WCVB-TV in Boston he was sitting in his car with his fiancee,  reading through mail, when police approached him and ordered him to get out and  lie on the ground.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked . . . terrified," Brown said.  </P> <P> Brown said he and his fiancee were considering buying a home in Wellesley, a  wealthy suburb outside Boston. But Friday's incident changed his mind.  </P> <P> "Now I don't want to live there," he said. "I see myself laying on the ground,  a gun pointing at the back of my head."  </P> <P> Brown said he believed police singled him out because they thought he matched  the description of someone who robbed a nearby bank last week.  </P> <P> A Wellesley police dispatcher, who declined to be named, said bank employees  had called the bank because they were suspicious.  </P> <P> "There was just a misunderstanding. The bank employees thought it was somebody  else," he said.  </P></p>

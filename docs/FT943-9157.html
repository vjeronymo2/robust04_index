			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodwill Games hurt TBS income Turner Broadcasting System, the US entertainment and news group, yesterday reported a sharp drop in second quarter net income from Dollars 31m to Dollars 13m following losses on the 1994 Goodwill Games in St Petersburg, and poor results from film releases. Although revenues for the three months rose to Dollars 678m from Dollars 487m, helped by acquisitions, operating profits fell by Dollars 23m to Dollars 74m. Earnings per share dropped to Dollars 0.05 from Dollars 0.12. Mr Ted Turner, president, said: 'With continuing network expansion domestically and internationally, as well as telecasting the Winter Olympics and the Goodwill Games, we knew 1994 would be financially challenging.' Revenue from entertainment operations rose by Dollars 178m to Dollars 459m, of which Dollars 132m was contributed by acquisitions - New Line Cinema Corp, acquired in January, Castle Rock Entertainment, in December 1993, and Hanna-Barbera Holding, of which TBS bought the outstanding 50 per cent at the end of last year. Advertising revenue rose by Dollars 24m, driven mainly by increased rates for Turner Network Television and an increase in sports revenue. However, entertainment operating profits fell by Dollars 46m, due partly to Dollars 26m in second quarter losses from the Goodwill Games. In the 1980s, Mr Turner created the games as an alternative to the Olympics, but so far they have cost TBS Dollars 39m. News revenue rose Dollars 10m partly from more advertising at Cable News Network.</p>

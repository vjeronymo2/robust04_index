			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Venture capital fund-raising falls 70% INDEPENDENT UK venture capital companies raised Pounds 250m last year, against Pounds 840m in 1990 and Pounds 1.7bn in 1989, according to the British Venture Capital Association, Charles Batchelor writes. In spite of the 70 per cent drop in fund-raising, independent venture capitalists - which account for about 45 per cent of all venture capital investments - still have more than Pounds 1.6bn available to invest, the association said. That is equivalent to two years' worth of investments. The decline in fund-raising last year was due in part to a more critical attitude towards venture capital by investors, the association said. It was also a reaction to the record fund-raising levels of the preceding two years. Venture funds normally take three to four years to invest their money before they need to raise new finance. Mr Adrian Beecroft, the association's chairman, said: 'Given the liquidity of independent venture capital funds, it is hardly surprising that very few firms attempted to raise capital in 1991.' It was natural for investors to want to assess the impact of the recession on venture capital before committing significant new funds, he added. Earlier this month Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, a venture fund, and Venture Economics, a research group, estimated that Pounds 400m had been raised last year. The Confederation of British Industry is to undertake a review of the provision of finance for smaller companies. It will look at the difficulties they face and make recommendations for action. Small businesses are often over-reliant on overdrafts when term loans or equity finance would be more appropriate, it said.</p>

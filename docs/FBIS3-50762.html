The  ambassador reaffirmed his support of the Governors Island  agreement and the willingness of the U.S. Government to work  toward the restoration of democracy in Haiti. Daly Valet reports:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The meeting of the U.S.  ambassador and the Office of the Senate of the Republic focused  on the political crisis the country has experiencied since 30  September 1991. During this meeting, the U.S. diplomat  reaffirmed the Clinton administration's support for the  Governors Island agreement, an agreement which still remains --  willy-nilly -- the sole valid framework for resolution of the  political crisis, according to the U.S. ambassador.    Senate Vice President Serge Joseph, who participated in this  meeting, says he is very satisfied with the fact that the U.S.  ambassador gave formal guarantees that the Clinton  administration will continue working toward the return of  democracy to Haiti.    [Joseph] The ambassador and political [word indistinct] who  were with him, as well as we, the members of the Office, are  satistified, satisfied [repeats] in the sense that, according to  the ambassador, the Governors Island agreement is valid until  something that can replace the agreement can be found. But he  has formally declared that as long as there is nothing to  replace the Governors Island agreement, his government will  stick to the agreement.    [Valet] During a news conference after the meeting with the  U.S. ambassador, Senator Serge Joseph, just back from the United  States, gave an explanation about the retirement letter  President Aristide sent to General Cedras. Sen. Joseph explained  that it was not a letter of dismissal but of retirement, as  requested of the president by Gen. Cedras in a letter dated 14  October 1993. [passage omitted]    A source close to President Aristide in the Haitian Embassy  in Washington offered the same explanation as Sen. Joseph. In a  telephone conversation, he told us that it was never a question  of dismissing Gen. Cedras. According to our source, President  Aristide was simply replying to Gen. Cedras, who had written him  on 14 October to request early retirement. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Sport: Warm hopes for a summer of flair - England have won at last. Can they build on the triumph, asks Teresa McLean / Cricket Everyone knows England are easy to beat; ask Australia or Pakistan, visitors and comfortable victors the last two summers, or the West Indies, hosts and victors this winter. But at least we English have cheered up a bit. Whether or not England can now win in Antigua as well as Barbados, there is reason to return with just a touch of thoughtful confidence. I find myself thinking how good it would be to have a strong personality playing for England in his own way - a huge Colin Milburn, a fearless Ian Botham or an elegant David Gower, untroubled by fitness training or technique corrections, a character at the crease with enough of his own initiative to unnerve the opposition. All that is needed to produce such figures is that good players with strong individual styles be given room. Perhaps Alec Stewart can serve as an example, after his epic performance in Barbados. It is easy to see how much better he plays when he is free of wicket-keeping duties. When he is free to bat in his own belligerent and unpredictable style, leaving the anchor role to his captain at the other end. 'He plays the way a West Indian would play . . . very positive,' said Richie Richardson after the match. Mike Atherton learnt when he was captain of Cambridge University that it is a waste of time to try and get a uniform response from the team; all it does is cramp team resources. Better to let individuals flourish than to try and tame them. Ray Illingworth, the new chairman of selectors, sympathises with this view, believing that: 'There are not enough variations in the game and it is too stereotyped.' Illingworth had little in common with Gower when he captained him at Leicestershire, but he was shrewd enough to help Gower's cricket develop by letting him play it in his own style. The England squad, with its large contingent of young players trying to establish themselves, needs to do the same. I was interested to hear some Sussex members express dismay last year at the way they felt young Ian Salisbury's bowling had been damaged by his MCC training before the 1992-3 tour of India and Sri Lanka. Not just the technical problems of the artificial 'spinmats' used at Lilleshall, but also the over-ruling of the advice he had been getting from Sussex's experienced cricket manager, Norman Gifford. County policy, locals claimed, had been to help Salisbury perfect his leg-breaks. MCC coaches, on the other hand, urged Salisbury to get more variety into his bowling, to unsettle the batsmen with off-breaks and disguised deliveries as well as leg-breaks. Both aims make sense but both at once unsettled Salisbury more than anyone else and upset his bowling. The Sussex view may be no more than resentful county patriotism, but it is certainly true that after a dismal tour Salisbury started last season in poor form, troubled by an annoying shoulder injury. Fortunately, he regained some of his confidence later in the summer and was picked for the West Indies. It has not been easy for him there, not being able to rely on a full-time spinner at the other end to turn the ball away from the bat while he turned it in. In Sussex, Salisbury lethal when he formed a partnership of assorted spin with veteran off-spinner Eddie Hemmings. Killer instinct is life-blood to a spinner and Salisbury's bowling, unlike left-arm Phil Tufnell's cruelly flighted bowling, looks a bit polite when it is unhappy. Salisbury is one of a number of English players who must come back from the West Indies bolder, if more battered, prepared to play more aggressively this summer. It is a strange affair, this summer. A split series: first half New Zealand, second half South Africa. The last split series was in 1990, when England managed to defeat both New Zealand and India. I never like split series, but the South Africans did not want a full series, after their long absence from Test cricket and their recent, fierce combats with the Australians. It will be good to have a different Test team in England and the South Africans will be the centre of interest. In the 1990 split series Atherton topped the batting averages against New Zealand (71) and was fourth against India (63), adapting well to the changing demands. He has a penchant for keeping going, come what may. If he can lead steadily this summer, it should help to release some of England's unfulfilled talents. Another trigger for this is often a good spell of fast bowling. Very fast, like very slow, bowling can induce a touch of abandon in cricketers and if the bowling is good, the advantage belongs to the bowlers. I look forward to seeing Devon Malcolm competing with New Zealand's much improved Daniel Morrison and their young paceman Simon Doull. Later he may have to bowl to the new, confident leader of South African batting, Hansie Cronje. Let fast bowlers buy their wickets if need be, as long as they enliven the series by bowling fast and furious. But bowlers, fast or slow, only flourish in co-operation with good fielders, in particular good wicket-keepers. Illingworth was lucky enough to bowl his off-spin with Alan Knott behind the stumps. At the 1968 Headingley Test, Knott stumped Australia's Bob Cowper, Paul Sheahan and Noel Jarman in one innings, off Illingworth's bowling. No wonder Illingworth has always thought of English spin bowling as an under-used weapon of war. He will need a top-rate keeper to resuscitate it, younger and fresher than 'Jack' Russell. Sheahan, one of Knott's Headingley victims, used to draw spectators for his devastating fielding as much as his batting. It was worth going just to watch him field. I belong to the generation that remembers Colin Bland and his fellow South African team members introducing that new brand of fielding, with its predatory leaps, sprints, catches and, above all, throws. It sounds as if South African fielding is still hot, especially in the hands of Jonty Rhodes and Gary Kirsten. They field with spirit, which is as exciting for the crowd as it is for the players. To play with spirit is to bring victory one step nearer. England must make spirited, challenging use of the players they already have. To that end, I hope Atherton keeps his captaincy intelligent, looking for astute ways to operate, in spite of the harsh baptism his leadership has received in the Carribean. He has survived it well; he still makes plans. I was glad when Keith Fletcher replaced Micky Stewart as England team manager because I have always thought Fletcher was a canny customer, used to interpreting cricket situations with an element of guile. He too has had a rough time and needs a clear working agreement with Illingworth. Shrewd men now abound and my worry is no longer that we are short of thinking; rather that the thinkers may get in each others' way. Roles must be defined, so that in plotting as well as playing everyone has room to perform with flair. Or at least to have a go.</p>

They see King Husayn's brave stand as a reflection of  their deep feelings of being deceived throughout the past.    This is especially so since the siege imposed by the U.S.  Navy on the Port of al-'Aqabah encroaches on what is most  valuable for Jordan -- its dignity and its national reputation.  The siege directly encroaches on Jordan's sovereignty, in  addition to the economic losses it causes and the difficulties  it produces, which add to the difficulties Jordan faces in the  wake of the Gulf war.    In light of this, Jordan justly and legitimately demands the  lifting of the unfair and unjustified siege of the only port  linking it to the outside world. It demands that naval forces  stationed in international waters stop dealing with Jordan as an  outlaw country that is secretly violating international  resolutions.    Hence, any measure intended to be a quick solution to the  siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah will be rejected if it is  conditional on the presence of U.S. barges in the Jordanian  port. This is especially so because such a solution would be a  blatant violation of the sovereignty of an independent country  and a UN member that has not committed any violation that  stipulates such punishment.    In return, Jordan -- which accepted the UN Security Council  resolutions without being convinced about them and which avoided  as much as possible appearing as a violator of international  legitimacy resolutions that deal with the ongoing siege --  accepts the presence of international employees to inspect the  goods arriving at the Port of al-'Aqabah. In other words, it  accepts the presence of a neutral international party delegated  by the United Nations to inspect incoming ships.    We believe the stand bravely expressed by His Majesty King  Husayn reflects the feelings of every citizen in this patient  and mobilized country. We realize at the same time that the  siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah is an issue that goes beyond  implementing the UN embargo on Iraq. It reaches the level of  exercising political pressure and compelling Jordan to accept  what it did not accept in the ongoing peace process. This  prompts us to stand together in support of King Husayn's stand  to reject every encroachment on our sovereignty and national  dignity.</p>

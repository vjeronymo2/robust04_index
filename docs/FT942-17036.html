			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Technology: Spider's route through jungle - A look at a device to cut the cost of telecommunications As companies send larger amounts of data between countries, the task of finding the cheapest route becomes more tricky. This month sees the launch of a system that aims to cut corporate telecommunications bills by up to 40 per cent. Developed by Spider Systems of the UK, it will enable businesses transmitting data electronically to pick their way through Europe's jungle of telecommunications systems and always choose the cheapest method for their needs. Edinburgh-based Spider Systems, a computer networking company whose main competitors are North American rather than European, claims that the SpiderIntegrator is the first product of its kind in the world. The device is an advanced kind of router, a box loaded with circuit boards and software which companies connect to their local area networks of computers and workstations. A router selects the route for communication between two LANs in different places. The SpiderIntegrator offers the extra ability to select the cheapest route. Most companies will need to use all the available methods - comprising leased lines, ISDN (integrated services digital network), packet switching systems and external modems - and grapple with charging structures. These differ across Europe and mean that, for example, leased lines are much more popular in the UK than in continental Europe. In Germany, ISDN is the commonest method while in France packet switching, hitherto popular, is being overtaken by ISDN. According to Steve Collen, Spider's product line manager, some 85 per cent of the cost of a data communication network over its lifetime is accounted for by charges paid for using it, with the cost of the hardware accounting for only 15 per cent. 'Tariff management is about cutting down on the 85 per cent,' he says. To do so, SpiderIntegrator offers three features. First, it can be configured to select different types of circuit for particular times of the day, to take advantage of different charges and the user's needs. Second, SpiderIntegrator can respond to demand for transmission capacity or bandwidth by automatically opening up additional circuits and shutting them down when they are no longerneeded. This facility might be needed to augment leased line capacity at peak times. Third, it incorporates a feature called triggered RIP (router information protocol). Normally, routers exchange information about the state of the network every 30 seconds or every minute. But these calls are costly. SpiderIntegrator incorporates a protocol (a set of rules in software) by which the routers only exchange information when the information about the network changes, thus saving running costs. Spider is offering this protocol, which it says is unique, as an international standard to encourage other manufacturers to incorporate it in their products. 'Inter-operability is in our interests,' says Martin Ritchie, Spider's managing director. Another feature of the SpiderIntegrator is that if it knows that at particular times of day it is cheaper to make a call from one country to another rather than vice versa, it can call another router automatically and ask it to call back. A network manager will operate the SpiderIntegrator by plugging his personal computer into it and making selections from a menu. But it will be up to him to keep abreast of changes in tariffs and services and update the settings. Collen says the SpiderIntegrator is flexible enough to accommodate the many changes likely in European telecommunications over the next few years. Spider has spent Pounds 3m developing the SpiderIntegrator and expects sales of about Pounds 8m next year, believing it will appeal both to individual teleworkers and multinationals. The machines will come in two models priced at between Pounds 2,100 and Pounds 3,000 to distributors.</p>

In his opinion, the main regional problem is refugees.  Fateyev stressed the Ingush and North ossetian presidents can  agree between themselves on the return of refugees to places of  their permanent residence.    North Ossetian president Akhsarbek galazov supported the  pronouncement and said "the interested sides should have a  chance to agree between themselves and the federal bodies should  listen to the opinion of regional representatives". He added  they have agreed with Ingush leader Ruslan Aushev on further  negotiations.    Aushev agreed with Galazov, but said "they should remember  about refugees". In his words, the participation in the  conciliatory commission has brought no results and the North  Ossetian president should name the exact date of his solution of  the Ingush refugee problem.    The Russian Parliament deputies decided to continue the  problem analysis in committees and discuss their proposals at  the chamber meeting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Erl." report: "Banque de France and Bundesbank More in </F> Agreement Than Ever"]    [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main, 25 Mar -- The French and the  German central banks are determined to continue to place price  stability at the center of their policy. Both central banks are  in closer agreement than ever regarding their views and goals.  This was stated by the presidents of the two central banks,  Jean-Claude Trichet and Hans Tietmeyer, at the financial forum  in Frankfurt. This event, which dealt with the French capital  market and German- French cooperation in the financial sector,  was organized by Paris Europlace and FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. In  Paris Europlace more than 100 public and private organizations  have united with the goal of making Paris internationally more  important as a financial center.    Speaking to about 500 leading domestic and foreign financial  experts, the central bank presidents stressed that it is  particularly important to present the policy of stability in a  credible way. The newly created European Economic Institute is  comprehensively supported in its work by both central banks.  Trichet expressed readiness to give those countries of the  European Union, which might need it, time to fulfill the  necessary criteria of convergence during the development toward  a European monetary union.    When describing the current German situation, Tietmeyer  warned against postponing necessary decisions. More flexibility  on the labor market must be a priority issue at the moment,  Tietmeyer said. Only then can the high unemployment be reduced.  The latest wage agreements show that this is now seen more  clearly than in the past. However, one is still hesitant about  corrections.    Both central bank presidents agreed that extending the  fluctuation ranges in the European Monetary System, with which a  crisis was mastered in August 1993, was a correct decision.  Trichet called for a pragmatic and realistic method of action  if the mechanism were to be changed again one day. Tietmeyer  said that a potential date for narrowing the fluctuation ranges  cannot yet be predicted. The advantages and disadvantages of  such a measure must be weighed carefully. "I believe that, for  the time being, one should be content with keeping the exchange  rates de facto stable," Tietmeyer said. He promised that the  Bundesbank will continue to examine whether there is leeway for  further reductions of the interest rate. "However, this must  not endanger the necessary further progress concerning  stability," he added. He promised a continuing "policy of a  calm hand." At a time of nervous markets the Bundesbank must  and will keep to its course, he stated. [passage omitted]</p>

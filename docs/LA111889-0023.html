			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORNETS DEFEAT SHAKY WARRIORS  </P> <P> The Golden State Warriors, one of the big surprises in the NBA last season, are  off to a slow start this season.  </P> <P> Dell Curry sank a three-pointer at the buzzer Friday night at Charlotte to give  the Hornets a 99-98 victory and drop the Warriors' record to 2-6.  </P> <P> Two free throws by Rod Higgins gave the Warriors a 98-96 lead with 52 seconds  left, but they contributed to their own downfall when they failed to beat the  24-second clock on two of their last three possessions.  </P> <P> Tyrone Bogues, who has 46 assists in the last three games, controlled the ball  in the closing seconds, then passed it to the left corner to Curry, who made  the big shot.

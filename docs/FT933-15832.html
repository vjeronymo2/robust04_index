			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / People: Russell to chair 3i Sir George Russell, chairman and chief executive of Marley, the building materials group, is set to emerge as the new chairman of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital company, at the end of this month. A formal decision on his appointment has still to be taken but the firm indications are that Sir George, currently a non-executive director, will take over the chair vacated so hurriedly in April by Alan Wheatley. A formal announcement is expected at 3i's annual meeting on July 28. Wheatley, a former senior partner with accountants Price Waterhouse, stepped down when 3i's shareholders, the banks, decided to postpone indefinitely a decision on a public listing for the company. Sir George, who is 57, is no stranger to controversy. He is chairman of the Independent Television Commission, which is opposing plans by the independent television companies to reschedule News at Ten to an earlier evening slot. A commonsense Geordie who once considered joining Sunderland United, he joined ICI as a graduate trainee at the start of a long career in the chemicals and aluminium industries. His television connection started in the late 1980s when he became deputy chairman of Channel Four. 3i has not traditionally been an exciting part of the financial community. Providing equity and loan finance to small and medium sized companies is a cautious long term business dependent on a careful assessment of companies and their managements. It is only in the past three years that the proposed flotation and a succession of postponements as the recession deepened have made the job of chairman a high profile position. Sir John Cuckney joined 3i with the mission to take it public but retired early in frustration. Alan Wheatley was in place for only nine months before shareholders decided to wait for a strong recovery before floating and he left.</p>

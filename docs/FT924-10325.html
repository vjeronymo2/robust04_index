			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / French fume over smoking curbs FRANCE, a country renowned for its smoke-filled bars, Gauloises and pipe-chewing detectives, will severely restrict smoking in public from tomorrow. Smokers will be allowed to light up only in areas expressly set aside for them - at present, smoking is allowed everywhere except where expressly forbidden. Individual offenders will face fines of up to FFr1,300 (Pounds 155), rising to FFr6,000 for restaurants or companies that fail to provide proper ventilation or to set smokers well apart. Similar measures have been proposed by the Italian cabinet presided over by Mr Giuliano Amato, an acknowledged smoker, and will be considered by parliament. Why is France doing this to itself? Some 40 per cent of the adult population of France smokes, more than in most European countries, and France even invented the word nicotine. Jean Nicot, a 16th century diplomat, introduced tobacco to Catherine de Medicis, French queen at the time, as a cure for migraine. A survey to be published in today's Le Parisien newspaper said 71 per cent of adults polled intended to abide by the law. Some 27 per cent said they may break it. Everybody knows the ban is unworkable outside areas such as government offices, airlines and railways - where the cleaners on the Paris Metro sweep up three tonnes of cigarette-ends a day. The restaurant trade is a bastion of resistance. It has asked for a two-year grace period while its members find the money to install smoke extractors - indicating a measure of compliance - but few are prepared to insult their smoking clients. 'If one of my guests calls the police, it's quite simple - I will pay the fine in the place of the smoker and let him go,' promises Mr Alain Dutournier, proprietor of the celebrated Carre des Feuillants in central Paris. 'It is a smokescreen, an idiotic law,' fumes Mr Joel Robuchon, owner of the Jamin, another top Paris restaurant. 'Some of my clients have said that if they can no longer smoke cigars, they will no longer come.' The Patronat employers' organisation says the ban is socially divisive, because privileged people with private offices - not public places - can smoke as much as they like, while those who work in open-plan offices will have to go to a special smokers' area.</p>

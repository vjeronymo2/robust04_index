			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Blue Circle Industries slips 4.9% to Pounds 93.8m BLUE CIRCLE Industries, the cement, central heating and bathroom products group, yesterday reported a 4.9 per cent decline in full year pre-tax profit and a sharp drop in earnings because of higher tax charges. Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, group managing director, said the results showed BCI's 'resilience during adverse trading conditions,' but added 'we as a board are not satisfied with them.' Pre-tax profits at the group, which has adopted the new FRS 3 accounting standard, fell from a restated Pounds 98.6m to Pounds 93.8m on turnover which grew by 19.2 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn (Pounds 1.15bn). The 1991 pre-tax figure was previously reported as Pounds 124.2m. After a substantially higher tax charge of Pounds 53.1m (Pounds 35.9m) earnings fell to 4p (8.6p). Nevertheless, as promised at the time of the group's Pounds 241.6m rights issue last year, the final dividend is being maintaining at 7.5p, giving an unchanged total of 11.25p. Operating profits, before exceptional costs of Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 42.1m) and net interest of Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 22.8m), fell to Pounds 131.4m (Pounds 163.5m). Profits from the group's cement, concrete and aggregates businesses slipped by 8 per cent to Pounds 98.1m (Pounds 106.5m) on turnover of Pounds 611.2m (Pounds 619.8m). Although the recession in the UK hit demand and profits and the group's South African operations were sold in March, other overseas operations, particularly those in the US and Chile, increased their profit contributions significantly. Operating profits from the fast growing home products division which had a turnover of Pounds 657.8m (Pounds 422.2m) increased to Pounds 60.2m (Pounds 51.1m) including a Pounds 12.2m second-half contribution from the recently acquired Celsius French and German central heating businesses. The property division made an operating loss of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 11.6m profits) largely as a result of a write-down of its 50 per cent investment in the Chafford Hundred new town project in Essex. The Pounds 11.8m exceptional charge comprised Pounds 62.1m in reorganisation costs in the UK cement business and a Pounds 9.4m property write-down, partly offset by Pounds 59.7m in profits and provision release from the sale of businesses in South Africa and the UK. The group's net debt was largely unchanged at Pounds 404.5m (Pounds 396.3m), representing gearing of 40.1 per cent. See Lex</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Forceful Campaign Against Drug Mafia"] </F>   [Text] The operation against growing and smuggling  narcotics that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has announced is  equivalent to a jihad against the trade involving this deadly  addiction. The prime minister has directed in the high-level  meeting of the Anti-Narcotics Task Force to arrest all major  narcotics smugglers at any cost, and not to accept any kind of  political pressure in this context. Under this campaign not only  the major crocodiles in this dirty pool will be arrested but  cases against them will be heard in a special court. The  government will provide all the necessary resources for this  important campaign. The prime minister has combined all the  small and large agencies related to drug control at the federal  level to form an effective agency. All related officials have  been instructed to present a special report immediately.    No doubt that production, trade, and smuggling of heroin is  a  major curse in Pakistan. While it has given a bad name to  Pakistan at the international level, it has also poisoned our  new generation. It is unfortunate that no government from Ziaul  Haq to Nawaz Sharif took any effective step to end this curse.  The main reason for this neglect was the lobbies formed by the  drug Mafia in every political party. All the anti-narcotics laws  were ineffective, and even in the law enforcement agencies  responsible for curbing this curse, there were persons who  protected the Mafia interests. However, some major narcotic  smugglers were arrested during the caretaker government. The  present government passed the law to give death sentences and  confiscate property of arrested drug smugglers. Now a solid  campaign is being launched against these death-dealers. The  people are hoping that no major drug dealer will be able to  escape the long arms of the law. Still, in addition to this  legal campaign, it is important to stop poppy cultivation in  tribal areas and to take all necessary steps to protect the  youth from this deadly habit with the help of reform agencies.  Special far-reaching efforts must be made to treat and  rehabilitate the chronic addicts.</p>

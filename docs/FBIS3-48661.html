			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address was carried by the Indian  papers WORUM and INDEPENDENT, the Indian magazine SOCIALOOK and  the Mozambican magazine TEMPO.    Seminars on the New Year address were held in Harare  Province, Zimbabwe, and at the group for the study of the chuche  idea of President Kim Il-song in Vienna, Austria, and a branch  of the Malian Youth Revolutionary Front of Self-Reliance.    The reporters and speakers at the seminars said the Korean  people last year made great achievements in socialist  construction despite the unprecedentedly vicious machinations of  the imperialists and fully demonstrated the superiority of  Korean-style socialism, the embodiment of the chuche idea.    They estimated the confederacy formula of reunification put  forward by President Kim Il-song as the most fair and aboveboard  proposal for a peaceful reunification of Korea.    They demanded the South Korean authorities renounce the  policy of depending on outside forces and choose to reunify  Korea by confederacy formula.    The United States must immediately stop the anti-socialist,  anti-DPRK campaign and fairly settle the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks, they urged.    A meeting explaining the New Year address was held in West  Mashonaland Province, Zimbabwe, and its reading session at the  Guyana torchlight Taekwon-to group for the study of the chuche  idea of Comrade Kim Il-song.</p>

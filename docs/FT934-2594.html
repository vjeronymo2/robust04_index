			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sale of Renault to go ahead as planned The privatisation of Renault will go ahead as planned in spite of the failure of its merger with the car and truck activities of Volvo of Sweden, Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday. In an interview on French television, Mr Longuet said the privatisation date would be set by the cabinet, but that it could still take place in the second half of next year. The timing of the privatisation of the combined group was one of the principal concerns of Swedish investors, whose opposition to the deal forced Volvo to abandon the merger. Mr Longuet said the collapse of the merger did not threaten Renault and that the state-owned car group 'can live on its own'. However, he added that Renault would continue to seek international alliances to strengthen its position in the world car market. The development of Renault's strategy was a matter for the car group's management, said Mr Longuet. 'It is up to the company to establish its projects.' Mr Longuet also said the state was likely to retain between 10 and 15 per cent of the shares in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group due to be privatised early next year. In the case of Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer, Mr Longuet said the government would consider privatisation 'when the horizon is clearer'.</p>

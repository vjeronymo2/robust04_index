			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Deflator paints wrong picture of export volumes Sir, Samuel Brittan ('Two-way switch in the world economy', December 9) reports with approval Peter Sinclair's figures purporting to show that there was a radical slowdown in the growth of the volume of trade for the G7 countries in the 1980s. The table (right) shows why deflating the value of G7 exports by the gross domestic product deflator (in contrast to the normal procedure where the price index of exports is used) suggests that most of the slow-down in the growth of world trade happened after 1979, not after 1973 as we had hitherto assumed. Export prices rose faster than GDP prices over the period 1973-79 because energy and commodities, whose prices rose especially rapidly, comprise a much higher proportion of exports (as intermediate inputs and final sales) than of G7 GDP (which excludes any imported energy and materials component). This exceptional development obviously boosted the value of world trade. But why should we regard this as boosting its volume. Sinclair says his measure shows the 'real value of export receipts, defined in terms of the general basket of goods that its firms, households and public authorities buy' (Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Autumn 1993, p116). This is inaccurate since the GDP deflator excludes the value of imports which comprise a proportion of the purchases of all domestic sectors. But in any case this is a measure of the real incomes of the export sector. This may be interesting but it is not a measure of real output. If Samuel Brittan's or Dr Sinclair's new computer is half the price (in relation to the GDP deflator) of their old one, would they describe it as only half a computer?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AVERAGE ANNUAL % GROWTH RATES             1960-73   1973-79   1979-90  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) Export volume (conventional)             7.8       5.6      5.0 (2) Export prices                            3.1       9.5      3.1 (3) GDP Prices                               4.3       8.6      4.8 (4) Export volume (Sinclair) = (1)+(2)-(3)   6.6       6.5      3.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Source: OECD Historical statistics 1960-90  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Glyn, fellow and tutor in economics, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, OX1 4JF</p>

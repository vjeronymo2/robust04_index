			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the </F> Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, by 'Adnan Husayn in London; date  not given]    [Excerpts] [Husayn] Your said recently that you had asked  some European governments to supply the government of the  Kurdish region with weapons so that it can defend itself and to  help it to train local police and security forces. Is that the  main aim of your current tour?    [Talabani] It is one of several aims. I discussed with the  officials with whom I met all the issues related to Iraq,  including the Kurdish issue. [passage omitted]    [Husayn] What was their response as regards armament and  training of police and security forces?    [Talabani] They were understanding and sympathetic. In  France in particular, the position was understanding and  encouraging -- which prompted me to be more optimistic.    [Husayn] And how do you think Turkey will react to your  armament?    [Talabani] I do not know exactly. I believe it will not  agree.    [Husayn] And Iran?    [Talabani] It will strongly oppose it. It will consider it  an imperialist Zionist conspiracy...through to the descriptions  the Iranian press is so good at when it comes to making up lies  and fabrications about anything to which it is opposed.  [passage omitted]    [Husayn] The war between the Turkish Government and the  Kurdish Workers' Party has intensified in recent months, and  Turkish forces do not hesitate to carry out operations inside  Iraqi Kurdistan. You opposed that, but what have you done to  prevent it?    [Talabani] We have made great efforts with the two parties  to prevent the fighting from being moved to our areas. We asked  the Kurdish Workers' Party to operate away from our areas, and  we asked Turkey to leave to us the task of guarding and  protecting the border on the Iraqi side. But the two sides have  taken account of that and continue to violate the sanctity of  Iraqi territory. [passage omitted]    [Husayn] There are reports that the Iraqi Government is  seeking to resume negotiations with you over self-rule, that it  has expressed willingness even to accept the federal formula  proposed by you, and that France and Turkey tried to mediate  between you. Is there any possibility of resuming the  negotiations?    [Talabani] First of all I would like to stress that neither  France nor Turkey has spoken with us in this connection, either  directly or indirectly. All that has been said in this  connection is baseless. The essence of our current position is  that the Kurdish movement and the Kurdish people in Iraq have an  elected parliament and a government. And that this movement and  this people are part of the Iraqi opposition movement. Any  dialogue or negotiations with the government must be decided by  the two councils representing the Iraqi opposition and the  Kurdish people. I mean the Executive Council of the Unified  Iraqi National Congress and the national assembly (parliament)  of the Kurdistan region. I personally believe that there is no  hope or benefit from a dialogue with the Saddam regime, with  which we tried dialogue and negotiations in the past and even  recently. As is known, I have since 1963 led and participated  in negotiations with successive Iraqi governments. After all  this time, I have reached a firm conviction, namely that there  can be no solution to any of Iraq's numerous problems --  including the Kurdish problem -- without the establishment of a  democratic system in Baghdad. The Saddam regime in particular  does not want a solution to these problems, so "whoever tries it  will regret it."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The Trade  Negotiation Committee (TNC) ministerial meeting closed on  Friday, officially winding up the tough Uruguay Round (UR) talks.    Trade ministers from 125 countries adopted the Marrakesh  declaration, signaling the end of the UR negotiations, and four  ministerial decisions before they signed the final act wrapping  up the seven-and-a-half-year UR process.    South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su  signed the final act and the government procurement agreement  but did not initial the accord on establishing the World Trade  Organization (WTO), an annex to the final act.    The government plans to sign the accord after the National  Assembly ratifies the UR agreement.    Under the final act, participating countries promise to  accept the results of the UR negotiations and adopt domestic  legal procedures to launch the WTO system as soon as possible.    With the signing, legal conditions were satisfied for  inauguration of the WTO, which will replace the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) system that has regulated  global trade since World War II.    The Marrakesh declaration established a preparatory  committee  for the WTO and devised the necessary measures to effectuate the  WTO accord on Jan. 1, 1995, or the earliest possible date next  year.    The four ministerial decisions cover trade and the  environment, establishment of the preparatory comittee for the  WTO, acceptance of and accession to the agreement establishing  the WTO, and the organizational and financial consequences of  implementing the agreement establishing the WTO.    The decision on trade and the environment regulates the  establishment of the trade and environment committee in order to  study the two areas' linkage at the WTO's first council meeting.    That on the creation of the preparatory committee concerns  the effort to carry out a smooth change from the GATT to the WTO  system.    GATT Secretary-general Peter Sutherland was appointed  chairman of the preparatory committee in a private capacity.    The decision on the acceptance of and accession to the  agreement regulates procedures in dealing with original members  of the WTO and those countries which do not participate in the  WTO or which have not confirmed country schedules in the goods  and service fields.    That on the organizational and financial consequences  flowing  from implementation of the agreement establishing the WTO  regulates donations for the WTO budget and the working terms of  WTO staff.    Meanwhile, Minister Kim said South Korea should concentrate  on using the WTO system effectively in the future.    "The UR negotiations confirmed free trade and  multilateralism, and will serve as the most important momentum  in world trade history," Kim said after signing the final act.</p>

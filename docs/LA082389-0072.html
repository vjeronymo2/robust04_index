			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUCKEY'S EX-LOVER ENDS TESTIMONY  </P> <P> A woman who claims she had sex with McMartin Pre-School trial defendant Raymond  Buckey in 1982 completed her court testimony Tuesday, and the last scheduled  defense witness -- the father of the boy who triggered the investigation of  child abuse -- took the stand.  </P> <P> After the father's testimony the defense is expected to rest its case in the  Los Angeles Superior Court trial now in its third year.  </P> <P> Barbara Dusky Goles had testified Monday that she had sexual intercourse with  Buckey at a Lake Tahoe motel after meeting him at a convention in Reno in  November, 1982.  </P> <P> Her testimony corroborated previous testimony from Buckey, 31, who said that in  his mind, adults who have sex with other adults cannot be child molesters.  Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin maintains that medical literature states adults  who have sex with other adults can still be child molesters.  </P> <P> Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are on trial on one count of  conspiracy and 64 counts of child molestation for allegedly sexually assaulting  11 of their pupils at the now-closed preschool in Manhattan Beach from 1978  until 1983.  </P></p>

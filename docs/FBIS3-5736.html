Christopher made  the call in a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at  his official residence, saying Japan has not yet produced  results in correcting its trade imbalance or boosting imports.    Hosokawa told Christopher the Japanese Government is working  on a market-opening package that is "substantially meaningful,"  the officials said.    Earlier in the day, Christopher met with Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata and agreed the United States and Japan should make  efforts to prevent existing tension from escalating and try to  solve problems through negotiations, they said.    Christopher told the prime minister that the U.S. is trying  to reduce its fiscal deficit and to strengthen its  competitiveness.    Christopher noted the need to improve bilateral economic  relations and remove the current negative elements, the  officials said.    The prime minister told Christopher that he is devoting  great  energy into pushing for "changes" in Japan because they are  important for consumers and the public. Hosokawa explained that  although other countries may think the speed of change is slow,  it is not easy to transform systems that have long existed in  Japan, they said.    Christopher expressed respect toward Hosokawa's efforts,  including political reform, they said.    Christopher told Hosokawa that the U.S. and Japan have good  relations in the political and security fields, noting the  planned "two-plus-two" security talks on Friday and the  International Conference on Aid to Cambodia which began in Tokyo  in a two-day session. Christopher and Hata, both of whom  attended the opening day session of the Cambodia aid conference,  are scheduled to meet again Friday in a security forum session  to be joined by Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi and  U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner.    During the 45-minute meeting with the prime minister,  Christopher conveyed President Bill Clinton's message to  Hosokawa, the officials said. In the message, Clinton gave high  marks to the February summit and a breakfast meeting with  Hosokawa in Washington and noted that he respects the prime  minister very much as a best friend, they said.    On the international front, Christopher urged Hosokawa to  convey the U.S. stance to place importance on China's human  rights record in considering extension of its the  most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status when Hosokawa visits  China from March 19 to 21, the officials said.    Christopher, who will visit Beijing on Friday after wrapping  up the three-day trip to Japan, said if no improvement in  China's human rights record is seen and Washington does not  extend MFN status, the entire economic system in Asia would be  negatively affected. Hosokawa replied that he will bear that in  mind when he visits China, officials said.    Earlier, Christopher held two-hour talks with Foreign  Minister Hata.    Hata told Christopher tension exists over economic problems,  and that although it is unlikely to negatively influence  bilateral ties immediately, the two countries should not  underestimate it, they said.    Hata was also quoted as saying it is important that Japan  and  the U.S. keep their ties in good form because Asia, Europe and  the rest of the world are watching.    Ties between Tokyo and Washington turned sour last month  when  Hosokawa and Clinton announced the collapse of the trade  framework negotiations aimed at redressing Japan's huge trade  surplus with the United States. The two sides have since been  in a cooling-off period.    Japanese figures show Japan registered a third straight rise  in its trade surplus with the U.S. in 1993, gaining 15.2 percent  to 50.19 billion dollars, the third-largest amount. U.S.  figures put the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 1993 at a  record 59.3 billion dollar.    Christopher told Hata that Washington wants to closely watch  what Tokyo hammers out as a market-opening package and then  decide on what to do with the framework talks, the officials  said.    Christopher, who arrived in Japan late Wednesday night for a  three-day visit to Japan, called for "tangible" results and said  the U.S. does not want "ambiguities" or just procedures, they  said.    The officials said Hata and Christopher did not discuss  specific economic problems. They did not take up the U.S.  Government's reinstatement last week of a trade law known as  Super 301, which gives the administration power to impose  sanctions against countries it determines guilty of unfair trade  practices, they said.    Japanese officials believe the action is aimed at pressing  Japan into opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus.    Christopher and Hata agreed Japan and the U.S. have  commitments to their alliance relations based on a bilateral  security pact and that both countries have joint  responsibilities for maintaining peace and prosperity throughout  the world, they said.    Christopher expressed worries about possible deterioration  of  the relationship of trust between Japan and the U.S., noting  voices in the U.S. that Tokyo is not sufficiently making  efforts to reduce its current account surplus or to boost  imports while the U.S. is fulfilling its responsibilities to  reduce its fiscal deficit and strengthen competitiveness, the  officials said.    The two men agreed that Tokyo and Washington should both try  to offer ideas to seek a solution, they said.    Hata told Christopher that Japan is making "voluntary"  efforts and is compiling a package of market-opening measures,  such as deregulation and import-promotion steps. He added Japan  is making such efforts not only for the sake of relations with  other countries but for the improvement of its own people's  lives.    Earlier in the day, Christopher told reporters that Japan,  in  the course of its reforms, could benefit from advice from the  U.S.    "I think there is a change and reform taking place in Japan  and, if they'll permit an outsider to be heard, it may be  helpful to express our views about the importance of the  relationship we have with Japan," Christopher said. He  mentioned security, diplomacy and economy as areas in which the  bilateral relationship has particular importance.</p>

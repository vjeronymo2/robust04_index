			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Samir 'Abdallah] </F>   [Text] The economic topics brought up in the negotiations  are no less important than defining the features of the future  and defining the larger goals we seek vis-a-vis the topics set  out in the negotiations, which will be the foundation upon which  a Palestinian development strategy must be based. First: the  volume of sources which will be available, at the disposal of  Palestinian citizens and authorities.    Unfortunately, although Palestinian rights and demands are  clear, it is not clear what natural and economic sources will be  granted to Palestinians and the Palestinian authorities. Here we  are speaking principally, or most importantly, about land,  water, and about tourist resources, specifically Jerusalem.  Additionally, we may be in a position to exploit the fishery  resources in Gaza and the Jericho area. The other part,  regarding resources, is decision-making power in the management  and independence of these sources, which is another very  important topic in these negotiations.    The other important matter is the nature of relations with  Israel. It is a known fact that over the past 27 years of  occupation, interlocking economic relations were imposed  unilaterally. These relations were characterized by hegemony and  inequality; will the negotiations bring about a reformulation of  these relations on new bases of equality, mutual benefit, and  the right of reciprocity? This is a very important issue, and  may be even more crucial than the time factor, given the  vagueness that surrounds these elements. Perhaps if we wish to  adopt a development strategy, we may be compelled to get into  strategic scenarios and not into defining strategies.    In addition to these factors, which, as I said, will be  settled by the negotiations, there are some factors or  relatively stable, or more stable characteristics, and some  utterly unstable ones, but because they are linked to some  extent with some objective factors, these factors, too,  influence or form, with other factors, the framework in which  this strategy will be built. These elements are:    First: Limited Natural Resources    It is well known that, even should we obtain all independent  Palestine's sources and resources (God willing), we must look to  a development strategy. This is because in general it does not  possess natural resources and raw materials sufficient to supply  local industry and local agriculture with input. This means an  inability to obtain foreign parts and foreign currency by  exporting resources. There will be a significant dependence on  commercial markets to supply our productive sectors with input.  This is very important, and sheds light on the importance of  foreign trade and our freedom to gain access to other markets.       Second: The Small Local Market    Palestine's market is known to be very small, and this in  turn means that the expansion of production or of commodity  production basically rests on our ability to gain access to new  markets abroad. This is another example of the elements defining  our development strategy; that is, the growth of the Palestinian  economy will depend to a large extent on our ability to market  our products in foreign markets. If they are closed, or if we do  not succeed in that, there will be severe limits on the growth  of our commodity markets.    Third: Structure of the Economy    There is no easy way out of this. The general structure of  the economy is known to depend greatly on agriculture, which  comprises 25-30 percent of the economy; on local products and  weak industry, which represent no more than 10 percent; and the  building and construction sector, which represents 15 percent.  The rest is mostly domestic services and other services. If we  go into the makeup or structure of the sectors in depth, we note  that they were formed under the influence of many factors;  chiefly, and most ominously, perhaps, is that the structure of  our industries was formed by Israeli demand. This is highly  significant when we look at our strategic options in the nature  of the relations we want to establish and create with  neighboring countries.    Fourth: The Palestinian Economy's Level of  Development    There is no escaping from this when the development strategy  is released. And so this means that our ambitions, in order to  be realistic, must be linked to our level of development. We  cannot say, "Our strategy must include..." and then add, for  example, possibly complex and intense industries, such as are  sometimes considered. At our level of development, we must look  at the most important elements, and the most important elements  or components at the level of development.    Our economy suffers from very severe infrastructural  backwardness in all areas. I would here like to point out that  over the past 27 years the Israelis have spent no more than $15  per Palestinian on infrastructure, while spending per Israeli on  infrastructure was $1,000 per year. In Jordan, the figure is  more than $100, at various times; even in the current period of  crisis, with the dinar crisis and the economic crisis in Jordan,  this spending has not fallen below $100 per person; it remains,  practically, seven times what is spent here. According to World  Bank experts' very conservative estimates (with which we do not  agree), the Palestinian people have the infrastructure necessary  for its economic level. I believe we have one third of the  infrastructure needed for a balanced economy; the importance of  the material and social parts of an infrastructure is well  known.    The second issue that characterizes our backward economy is  the lack of and severe weakness in institutions, specifically  the economic institutions that will be responsible for managing  the funding process. It is well known that most of these are  locally run institutions; we all know how marginal and weak the  municipalities' role is. In practical terms, we need a major  strengthening process in order for them to play a significant  role in the development process regarding the official authority  or institutions of civil administration that the Palestinian  authority will appoint. We may say that qualified people capable  of playing a leading role in the development process in the  future are few and far between. In spite of all the factors that  represent a framework in the development process or adoption of  a strategy, one must note some of the positive elements that  should be taken into consideration when we formulate a  development strategy. They are:    The first element: the relatively excellent level of human  resources provided or available to the Palestinian economy. When  I speak of human resources, we must not forget that it is  possible to multiply their capabilities if we can attract  qualified Palestinian people from abroad. This is highly  significant, and I hope the coming Palestinian authority will  offer incentives to qualified Palestinians abroad to come here  and work on developing their economies.    The second element: in our economy, also, we have a relative  distinction in the agricultural sector, and this relative  distinction has limits, as a matter of course. I may say,  however, that it will play a basic role when it comes to new  funding for the other sectors, the relative distinction we have  in terms of work productivity and reliable technical ability.  This could be of primary benefit during the transitional period,  in order to form a basic tributary of development.    The third element, also important and positive, and to which  attention must be given, is tourism potential, or the power of  the Palestinian economy to turn tourism into a key element and  primary funded sector of the Palestinian economy. But this  requires great attention in this sector, and an infrastructure.  It could be taxable in the early phases, and as a matter of  course I do not expect the Palestinian authority to be capable  of adopting sufficient funding for this sector, but it can  create an appropriate framework and sufficient incentives for  the Palestinian, Arab, and foreign private sectors.    The fourth element, important, though perhaps not of great  importance, but necessary to take into consideration: our  economy, which has faced major confiscation by the Israelis. The  Palestinian economy has been a commercial free zone for the  Israelis; this in itself powered our industries, in some form or  another, industries that were faced with very intense  competition, and that were able to survive and evolve in highly  competitive circumstances. They compelled them to increase  productivity and improve quality, in order to open horizons, as  there would be competitive industries abroad, especially in Arab  markets. These are the components of the general framework on  which the strategy is built, but where is the centerpiece of  these components? This is the real question. I believe--and I  may be wrong--that the nature of the commercial system upon  which we are agreeing with the Israelis--as is known from the  negotiations--is based on two contradictory positions.  <H5>  The Israeli Position </H5>   It desires and seeks to consolidate the status quo, with  some  minor improvements, in the sense of maintaining the customs  union as a limited framework for the commercial system, a system  of exchange between Israel and Palestine. This means that the  Palestinian market, and the Palestinians, will not be able to  achieve the freedom of foreign markets, but that they would have  the freedom to formulate their foreign trade policy. This  framework might allow Palestine to benefit from the agreements  Israel has concluded with the Common Market and the United  States. It will be easy for Palestinians to get concessions from  these groups, but it will completely deprive the Palestinians of  the fabric of independent economic relations in some markets,  including the Arab markets. This is, in my view, a very great  problem, because the markets--and I have spoken of the factors  that make foreign trade for Palestine very important, with a  very great role in economic growth--our markets are not the EEC,  or America. If we were to succeed in this phase (the development  phase) in finding markets abroad, these markets would be Eastern  Europe, the former Soviet Union, Africa, and the Arab countries.  These are the markets in which we can find wide areas for  marketing our agricultural and industrial surpluses. At the same  time, we can get raw materials and industrial input from these  groups more cheaply, meaning lower production costs. Thus it is  possible, if we are deprived of this framework, for us to have  very great development problems. In return, we Palestinians ask  for the customs union to be replaced by a free trade agreement  and a trade accord that would mean our continued benefit from  the Israeli market.    We depend on the Israeli market for our imports and exports.  The Israeli market is the primary market now, and we cannot do  without it. A trade accord would allow us access to the Israeli  market as before, but as a matter of course there will be  barriers to re-exporting some of the products we import, and we  can re-export them according to the free trade agreement. This  is the key point that would enable us to have an independent  economic policy suited to the needs of our economy and  developmental level; at the same time it would enable us to  benefit from our existing relations with the Israeli market.  With this definition of the strategy in the transitional phase,  my view is that our strategy in the transitional period perhaps  must focus on primary elements: The first and most important  element, in my estimation, despite the fact that the necessary  investments for it are less, is the building of institutions and  the creation of an administrative and organizational structure  for the development process. Without it, I believe, it would be  difficult to rely on the present structure: the civil  administration framework is fragile and incapable of handling  the development process. At the same time, the local rule  framework and the municipalities too require a great deal of  effort in order to be able to play a primary role.    The second element, which might be less costly, but of  greater importance, is the creation of an appropriate legal  climate for the launching of the development process. Here the  issue of military orders and their replacement with contemporary  laws provides an appropriate framework for private sector  activity and the use of foreign investments, which is a side  issue.    The third element is a basic one in the field of  development:  the rebuilding of the infrastructure. All interest is now  focused on the infrastructure, without which appropriate  services cannot be provided to the people and citizens; at the  same time, investment cannot be facilitated, so this is a key  issue.    The fourth element in our developemnt strategy is education  reform. Education reform begins with basic education, and  education reform is a key issue, and possibly merits a  conference to itself.    The fifth element in the features of the strategy is to  accelerate the developemnt of the banking system. Without a  banking system, one which provides investors access to  facilities, it will be difficult to achieve development. Here I  hope I have succeeded in setting out the features of a strategy.  I say, and emphasize, that the strategy must be based, and  generally is based, on specific political goals. The political  goals thus far are clear, and yet they are not sufficient. Our  political goal is to establish an independent Palestinian state,  and bring back the refugees. This goal in itself does not give  or contain information sufficient for the adoption of a  development strategy. We are familiar with and have begun to  introduce the transitional period we speak of. Also, in a  general way, we have said it is a step on the road to an  independent Palestinian state. From another aspect, at various  levels, the phase, as it is structured, lacks clear details upon  which one might base the adoption of a sound and appropriate  development strategy.</p>

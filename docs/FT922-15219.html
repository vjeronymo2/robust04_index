			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The PLATINUM price extended this week's gain on the London bullion market with a Dollars 4.50 rise to Dollars 362.50 a troy ounce, up Dollars 12 since the end of last week. It continued to be helped by Tuesday's announcement that Russia's Almazyuvelirexport was maintaining its monopoly on the sale of platinum group metals, deflating fears metal would leak into the market. A more hopeful mood on US economic prospects also continued to have a bullish influence. A trader commented that the market's reaction to these factors on Tuesday had shown that 'the shorts were less confident than the longs'. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices rallied on talk of Chinese buying, with the three months delivery price pushing up to Dollars 2,250 a tonne on short-covering after breaking through resistance at Dollars 2,230 a tonne. At the close the cash price was quoted at Dollars 1,300.50 a tonne, up Pounds 23.50 on the day. TIN prices made further gains and the cash premium over forward metal widened as concern grew about the tightness of supplies for delivery this month. The cash price rose Dollars 85 to Dollars 5,802.50 a tonne, while the three months price was up only Dollars 40 at Dollars 5,772.50 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

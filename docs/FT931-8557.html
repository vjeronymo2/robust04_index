			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China invites explorers to prime oil areas AFTER YEARS of procrastination China yesterday invited foreign oil companies to explore in promising onshore areas, including the vast Tarim basin in the country's remote north-west. Mr Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation, said yesterday that exploration bids for five blocs covering 72,730 square km (28,000 square miles) in the south-eastern sector of the Tarim basin would be called in March. There would be a second round of bidding for additional acreage by early next year, he said. Worries about flagging domestic production - China may become a net importer by 1995 - and the need to speed exploration in remote areas apparently dispelled lingering reservations about opening up territory to foreign explorers. The booming economy - GNP growth reached 12 per cent last year - is putting added strain on dwindling oil reserves. Oil company representatives welcomed China's decision to open its 'wild west' to exploration - Shell and BP in particular expressed strong interest  -but they indicated caution about commiting resources to such a remote region. Transporting oil to the coast would require a 2,000 km pipeline across some of the world's roughest terrain. Many offshore explorers had their fingers badly burnt in China in the 1980s. A representative of Australia's BHP Petroleum noted ruefully yesterday that the company had drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and the Pearl River Delta. China had previously allowed foreign participation in onshore exploration, but restricted this to relatively unpromising areas in 11 southern provinces. The extension of foreign exploration leases to northern and western regions is certain to excite considerable explorers'interest. Based on fairly sketchy seismic data, China claims that the Tarim basin contains massive reserves of perhaps more than 100bn barrels. Even if only a fraction of such deposits are recoverable at reasonable cost the region would become one of the world biggest oilfields. Mr Wang Tao also announced the opening of existing oilfields to foreign participation. China's 'mature' fields face increasing difficulties maintaining production without sophisticated enhancement techniques. China at present produces about 2.8m barrels a day and its exports are hovering around 400,000 b/d. The country ranks sixth in the world in oil production.</p>

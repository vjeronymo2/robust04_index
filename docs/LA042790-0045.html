			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: CROSS SECTION OF ASIAN DELIGHTS AT KIM TAR  </P> <P> When newspaper editorials talk about Los Angeles as the new melting pot, East  Hollywood must be what they have in mind, an agglomeration of more  nationalities than ever competed in the World Cup or signed a nuclear  non-proliferation treaty.  </P> <P> You might find a Colombian grocery, a Romanian dry cleaners, a Cambodian  doughnut shop in the same mini-mall; the owner of a restaurant might be  conversant in Armenian, Arabic, Spanish and Thai. You can buy a jar of beans or  a soft-porn videocassette from practically any country in the world.  </P> <P> On the fringe of this community of strangers is Kim Tar, an expanded barbecue  stand specializing in the foods of the Chiu Chow -- the East's ultimate  strangers. These are the ethnic Chinese who migrated from North China to  Southeast Asia dozens of generations ago, and their cuisine, at least here,  seems a true hybrid: classic Cantonese-style dishes inflected with the exotic  fruits and pungent fermented sauces of Thailand. Kim Tar's menu is printed in  Thai and Vietnamese in addition to the usual Chinese and English, you can  choose between Chinese black tea and Thai red tea, and the tables are set with  both cruets of Chinese soy and Thai fish sauces. Customers talk to each other  in Cantonese, eat everything but noodles with fork and spoon rather than  chopsticks, and bring in bags of the sweet Thai fruit durian from the Bangkok  Market across the street. Half the dishes are studded with what look like  sesame seeds but are in fact confetti of minced garlic.  </P> <P> The bulk of the menu is devoted to the usual stir-fries: clams with black-bean  sauce, beef in sate sauce, volcano chicken. These are done as well, if not as  cheaply, at any Westside Chinese restaurant. You'd do better to order steamed  fish in Chinatown.  </P> <P> Most of the really good stuff is listed toward the beginning of the menu under  the heading "Dishes." There's anise-scented beef stew, similar to a Cantonese  beef stew spiked with an extra wallop of fish sauce, irresistible if you like  the slithery texture of long-cooked tendon. Kim Tar also serves the best  Chinese barbecued pork this side of Monterey Park, sweet and full of juice.  Anybody would like crisp fried dumplings stuffed with fragrant sauteed leeks;  tiny taro egg rolls the size of a baby's thumb; delicious roast duck and  barbecued spareribs. It's also safe to say that Kim Tar is the place in East  Hollywood to come if you're looking for salted pig's intestines, pig's kidney  hot pot or a party-size portion of soft, young pig, which you're probably not.  </P> <P> If they could work up the guts, everybody would like the fried pig's intestine.  (We can't vouch for the salted pig's intestine, or the intestine with preserved  vegetables, or the kishke noodles, though.) The crunchy little rounds of  bias-cut entrails, deep-fried and looking something like cut figs on the plate,  have something of the clean richness of slab bacon, not the musky horror you  might imagine. If you didn't know what they were, you might gobble them like  pork rinds; if your spouse made you try them, you'd probably smother one small  piece with chile-garlic dip and chew it up real fast.  </P> <P> Just as crunchy is fried hen, a small chicken chopped up before frying so that  the maximum possible surface area has the chance to crisp -- more crunchy bits  than you'd ever thought a chicken could develop.  </P> <P> An extraordinary Chiu Chow-style hot-and-sour soup -- closer to an intense  Cantonese sweet-and-sour sauce thinned into soup than to either a Thai or  Sichuan hot-and-sour -- bathes chunked tomato, pineapple and either fish or  shrimp, bright with cilantro and the hotness of fresh chiles. A seaweed soup,  its rich, briny taste underlaid with salt and fried garlic, comes with little  fish quenelles whose relative blandness is a nice contrast to the soup.  </P> <P> And you'll want to try the Chiu Chow hot pot, similar to the Thai sook. Over a  portable propane burner lugged to the table, a pot of broth, red with tomatoes  and chiles, is brought to a quick boil. You feed the broth from plates piled  with vegetables, thick rice noodles, raw beef and seafood (if you've ordered  the combination); fish out tidbits with little wire strainers; trail slices of  beef through the broth until they just whiten . . . until 15 minutes into the  process you tire of the ritual and dump everything into the pot, including a  raw egg that thickens the mess into something resembling tastier sukiyaki.  </P> <P> Kim Tar is incredibly cheap: a party of four can stuff themselves on the most  expensive dishes and spend only about $30, and a set menu that includes some of  the best dishes in the house feeds three for $15.  </P> <P>  Kim Tar, 4806 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 669-1180. Open daily 9:30 a.m.  to 9:30 p.m. Parking in back. No alcohol. No credit cards accepted. Dinner for  two, food only, $7-$15.  </P> <P> </P></p>

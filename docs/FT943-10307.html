			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: ICC jumps to Bt364m International Cosmetics, Thailand's leading quoted distributor of garments, cosmetics and other consumer products, yesterday announced a 27 per cent rise in net profits to Bt364.3m (Dollars 14.6m) in the first half of this year from Bt287.3m in the same period of 1993, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Second-quarter net profits, however, were up only 4.8 per cent to Bt167.1m from Bt159.5m a year earlier. With consumer spending rising, the company predicts profit growth of about 13 per cent for the full year. ICC says first-quarter profits were artificially inflated by a switch to credit sales from a consignment system.</p>

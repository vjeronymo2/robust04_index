Kliridhis added that he does not expect anything from his  meeting tomorrow with Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department  special coordinator on the Cyprus issue.    The president said there is nothing new to justify the  convening of a National Council meeting. He added: When there  is, I will convene it. Asked whether he will stop over in  Athens upon his return from Strasbourg where he will address the  Council of Europe parliamentary assembly, Kliridhis said this  will depend on his schedule.</p>

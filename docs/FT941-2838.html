			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: BASF shows improvement in first two months of year The first firm signs of recovery after a four-year slump in the German chemicals industry emerged yesterday as BASF reported improved earnings and sales in the first two months of the new year. Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman, said he expected the trend to continue. All divisions except plastics and fibres were making operating profits but they, too, should be back at break-even levels by the end of the year, he added. An improvement on last year's net earnings of DM858m (Dollars 507m) was possible despite an expected sharp increase in corporate taxes. Group turnover of DM6.7bn in January and February was up 4 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Mr Strube also noted a double-digit rise in new orders at the German parent company, BASF AG. No profit details were given. 'We have come off the starting blocks well,' Mr Strube said, reflecting mounting confidence elsewhere in the sector. But he warned that recovery was likely to be slow and a worldwide improvement in chemicals markets could not be expected before next year. BASF's pre-tax profits last year, confirmed yesterday at DM1.06bn, down 14.6 per cent on 1992, were less than a quarter of the record DM4.4bn earned in 1989. Sales have fallen by DM7bn in the same period to DM40.6bn. A breakdown of 1993 sales, published yesterday, clearly showed the impact of the European recession. While turnover from North and Latin America increased by 7.6 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, generating DM11bn in revenues, European sales dropped 8 per cent to DM25bn. Germany, which accounts for around half the group's European business, showed a 12 per cent fall. Plastics and fibres, BASF's biggest single division, and agricultural chemicals - both plagued by overcapacity and price erosion - recorded sales declines of 6 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. Mr Strube, who was appointed at the start of the slump in 1990, said restructuring would continue. Product areas offering no long-term prospects of acceptable results would be examined to see if co-operation with other manufacturers, sale or closure would yield improvements. Restructuring efforts last year included the purchase of Mobil Chemicals' polystyrene business and ICI's European polypropylene operations.</p>

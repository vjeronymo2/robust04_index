			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Anglia Secure Homes cuts deficit to Pounds 2.3m ANGLIA Secure Homes, the builder and manager of retirement homes, achieved a reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 5.08m to Pounds 2.3m in the six months to end-March. Turnover improved to Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 6.57m) including a Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.1m) contribution from Haven Services, 51 per cent owned by Anglia. The pre-tax result was after a fall from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 508,000 in exceptional costs and reduced interest payments of Pounds 748,000 (Pounds 1.31m). Losses per share fell to 7.2p (15.4p) and there is no dividend. Anglia last paid a dividend in respect of the year to September 1989. Its share price reached a peak of 458p in March that year, before a collapse in demand for housing. The shares closed unchanged at 6p yesterday. However, Mr Peter Edmondson, chairman, said that prices 'do appear to have reached their floor'. Average prices on the 61 units sold in the six months were Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 60,000). He said that five projects to develop and operate nursing homes were underway with Haven Healthcare Holdings, in which Anglia had a 28 per cent stake. The group was in discussions with its principal bankers to separate its property assets and associated debts from the Haven operations, on which the group had pinned its future hopes, he added.</p>

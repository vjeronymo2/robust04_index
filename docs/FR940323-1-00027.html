			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the procedures under &sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.912 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifying individuals of actions on applications would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to presumptive eligibility decisions for ambulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prenatal care, they would apply to regular Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications filed after the presumptive eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination is made. Because we do not consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for Medicaid per se, and because termination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambulatory prenatal care benefits occurs automatically after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified time periods under section 1920 of the Act, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also propose not to apply the existing provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that require Medicaid agencies to provide timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written notice of reduction or termination of Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits and rights to appeal of an adverse action (part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 431, subpart E and &sect;435.919). As indicated earlier, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose to require a qualified provider to provide written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of the date a pregnant woman can expect presumptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care to end. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we propose not to grant rights to appeal a denial or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination of ambulatory prenatal care services under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive eligibility decision. A presumptively eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant woman who subsequently files a regular Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application that is denied would have the right to appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the denial of her regular Medicaid application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that we are imposing an undue burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on qualified providers by requiring that notification by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified provider be in writing. We do not foresee that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this written notice will be individual personal letters. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered requiring States to supply qualified providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with preprinted notices. However, we decided to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States the flexibility to determine how to best arrange for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this notification within each State program. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly solicit comments on whether the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that notification by a qualified provider be in writing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposes an undue hardship on qualified providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing regulations at &sect;435.914 permit States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide Medicaid for an entire month when an individual is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for Medicaid under the plan at any time during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month. We propose not to permit States to provide full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month eligibility for presumptive eligibility periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because by definition a presumptive determination is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of Medicaid eligibility but eligibility for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special status. Therefore, special status eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begins on the exact date a presumptive eligibility decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made and ends on the last day of the month following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month in which the presumptive decision is made when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid application has not been filed, or on the date a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal decision of Medicaid eligibility is made if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application has been filed. However, full month regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid eligibility is available during the approval month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a regular Medicaid application in States that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elected full month coverage in their approved State Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9407 of OBRA '86, as amended by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 411(k)(16) of MCCA, provides that, for purposes of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial participation, ambulatory prenatal care services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are covered under the plan, are furnished by a provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is eligible for payment under the State plan, and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished to pregnant women during a presumptive period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility, will be treated as expenditures for medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance under the State plan and thus are regarded as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid plan services. If the State makes any payments for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambulatory prenatal care furnished by an eligible provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the presumptive period for women who are later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to be ineligible for Medicaid, these payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be counted in determining a State's excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erroneous payments for purposes of disallowing Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial participation. In general, Medicaid quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control will not review the accuracy of presumptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility determinations in terms of predicting a pregnant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> woman's eligibility for Medicaid, and any erroneous payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made cannot be counted in determining the State's erroneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for purposes of quality control eligibility errors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, quality control will review claims for services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished to presumptively eligible pregnant women to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether these claims were, in fact, made for women  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who were pregnant and were for ambulatory prenatal services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered under the State plan, were furnished by a provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is eligible to receive payment under the State plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and were furnished during a period of presumptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility. There will be situations in which the services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished by a qualified provider will include verification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a woman's pregnancy. The services that are furnished for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification will be covered as presumptive eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services for FFP purposes only if the woman is actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant. Section 1920 covers only ambulatory prenatal care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made available to a pregnant woman during a specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. Services furnished to deliver or remove an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> embryo/fetus from the mother or furnished following that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery or removal will not be covered as presumptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility services for FFP purposes. That is because, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the embryo/fetus is no longer viable, the woman is no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be a pregnant woman. Also, we do not believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the services involved in delivering either a viable or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonviable fetus constitute prenatal services. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any services furnished following removal or delivery would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be furnished to a pregnant woman nor would they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute prenatal care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

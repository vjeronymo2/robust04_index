			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: 2 LEAVE DIRECTOR POSTS AT EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS  </P> <P> Everest &amp; Jennings International, Camarillo, announced the resignations of  Robert G. Sutherland, chairman, and Terry Vandewarker from its board of  directors.  </P> <P> Both Sutherland and Vandewarker are affiliated with Industrial Equity (Pacific)  Limited (IEP), a substantial stockholder and creditor of Everest &amp;  Jennings.  </P> <P> The reason given for the resignations was possible conflict of interest.  Everest &amp; Jennings said potential conflicts between the company and IEP  might arise as Everest &amp; Jennings seeks to reach agreement with its primary  domestic lender on long-term financing arrangements. The wheelchair  manufacturer has been operating for several weeks on the basis of informal  day-to-day waivers and extensions by its primary domestic lender.  </P></p>

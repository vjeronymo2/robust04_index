			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Jobs: A sad final bow for the polytechnics - At best only temporary work for nearly Pounds 650m worth of the products of UK higher education FIRST the good news. Last year was the worst on record for young people seeking work after winning degrees at Britain's universities, polytechnics and colleges. At the end of December, near a fifth of the summer's crop of new graduates were left with no more productive employment than a temporary job expected to last at most three months. The precise number registered as in that pickle was 24,893, 19 per cent of the total bachelor-degree output of 130,685, and representing a taxpayers' investment in higher education approaching Pounds 650m. The bad news is of course that the present year, although not yet on record, looks sure to be still worse. The most sober-minded estimate puts demand by employers at 40 per cent down on the meagre level of a year ago. An idea of what happened to the crop of 1991 is given by the table alongside. Unfortunately, owing to a certain laggardliness in official number-crunching, it omits the lowest of the then three tiers of degree-level teaching institutions: colleges of higher education which produce 8.5 per cent of Britain's graduates. To complicate things further, the two upper tiers are hence-forth to be as one, with even the few polytechnics that haven't already become universities about to undergo said apotheosis. But, since they were still polys in 1991, I have differentiated them as such in the table. It begins with the total numbers of bachelor's-degree winners produced by the then two upper tiers last summer, together with the totals the year before. After the separate figures for the universities and for the polys, come their combined output for 1991 and the number of graduates by which it differed from the corresponding figure in 1990: an increase of 6,905. Reading downwards, we next have - in bold type - the overall numbers who found jobs in the United Kingdom which were 'regular' in the sense of holding out career expectations. Below that, in light type, is a break-down of the types of jobs found. Then comes a similar analysis of the numbers who continued in education or training in the UK. Lastly we have other activities broken down into three different groups. The first lumps together overseas students who returned home with Brits who moved abroad. The next consists of graduates who had disappeared from their Alma Mater's ken by the end of the calendar year. The last - 'At best short-term UK job' - itself includes three types of people. One is those believed still unemployed at the end of the December. The second is those deeming themselves not available for employment at all, as distinct from having re-joined some organisation which had kept them on its books during their studies. The third is those with only a temporary UK job likely to last at most three months. The results of the continued plunge in employers' demand from 1990 to last year can be seen from the changes in the table's right-hand column. Every sort of regular work was down except teaching/lecturing, and the miscellaneous category. There were rises in all types of continued education. The same went for all the 'other activities', whose combined increase of 7,627 was over 10 per cent greater than the 6,905 rise in the universities' and polytechnics' total output. The single category showing much the biggest increase was 'At best short-term UK job'. On that particular measure, the universities fared least badly with 17.2 per cent of their 1991 crop so afflicted. (The colleges of higher education, not in the table, weren't much worse with 17.9 per cent of their total graduate output of 11,308 - or 2,027 individuals who, with the addition of the two upper tiers' 22,866 in the same sad position, produce the 'precise number' of 24,893 I mentioned earlier.) The polytechnics fared worst with 22.7 per cent, which is doubly disturbing when one recalls that it is the reverse of what was promised when most of them being set up a generation ago. The politicians responsible pledged that, while having 'parity of academic esteem' with universities, the polys would be far more geared to serving the employment market. In the event, of course, they have turned out otherwise. Indeed it seems odds-on that, of the final output of graduates they have produced under the name of polytechnics this past summer, at least a quarter will be in the at-best-short-term category at the end of the year. Still, that is far from the only example - let alone the most recent - of politicians' breaking their pledges, or of failing to control the mechanisms they have brought into being at the taxpayers' expense. And besides, perhaps the polys' elevation to the title of universities will help them to do better all round. After all, there is evidence that some employers snobbishly refused to recruit at them simply because they went under a lower-status name.</p>

"We are nowadays often flooded with news which, on the one  hand, are beneficial to the interest of advanced countries  while, on the other hand, destroy the image of developing  countries," he said, opening the 18th general assembly of the  Confederation of ASEAN Journalists and International Press  convention.    Suharto stated the striking disparities, inequalities, and  injustices in the relations between the developed and developing  countries did not occur only in the economic sphere but also in  other fields, including the press.    "It is incumbent upon us to spare the responsibilities of  changing these inequalities and injustices," he said.    Touching on human rights issues that draws international  attention lately, Suharto said that the improvement on and  protection of the human rights should be seen as a whole and not  separately.    He reiterated that the implementation of human rights was  dependent and colored by the different economic, social, and  cultural conditions of individual countries, saying that human  rights is the right of every nation to have its own national  characteristics and culture, as well as the right to determine  its own social and political systems.    There should not be an excessive evaluation or emphasis on  one right over others, he said.    "As a nation that was colonized for 350 years, the  Indonesian  nation fully understands the meaning and essence of human  rights," he added.    Suharto also said the press should also bear in mind that  there were regional and national differences on the  understanding, institutionalizing, and implementation of human  rights.    "The differences in the level of progress and living  standard  brought a meaningful impact on the practice of human rights.  Hopefully these issues also draw the attention of the press," he  added.    President Suharto warmly welcomed the conference's choice of  theme of North-South and South-South dialogues, saying that in  the current globalized world, solution to the world's problems  should be sought and implemented jointly by both developed and  developing countries.    "Therefore, only through constructive dialogue between North  and South countries based on partnership, mutual interest,  shared benefit, and responsibility, can the world free itself  from the present apprehensive situation," he said.    He also expressed the hope that a sound, free, and  responsible press would assist the press and other media in the  region in encouraging the development of the society.</p>

We explain how these attribution rules would apply with regard to any holding and limited transfer period for entrepreneurs' block licensees should such rules ultimately be adopted. During this holding period, an entrepreneurs' block licensee could not sell more than 25 percent of its passive equity to a single investor if the resulting attribution of that investor's gross revenues or total assets would bring the company over the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million personal net worth cap. Similarly, while individual members of the control group could change (if it would not result in a transfer of control of the company), the control group would have to maintain control and at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent of the voting stock. <FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>  A company would be permitted to grow beyond these gross revenues/total assets caps, however, through equity investment by non-attributable (i.e. passive) investors, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development or expanded service. <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A minority of woman-owned company would have to continue to adhere to the attribution rules applicable to it, set out above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These rules would continue to apply in this manner throughout the license term with regard to firm's continuing eligibility for installment payments, ``enhanced'' installment payments and bidding credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 43. We seek comment on these proposed eligibility requirements for the entrepreneurs' blocks. In particular, parties should discuss the equity and control requirements for the control group and investors in both the corporate and partnership context. In addition, commenters should discuss the alternative option for women and minority-owned companies and the ability of small businesses to form consortia. With regard to all of these issues, parties are asked to comment on the proposals' impact on the ability of entities to obtain financing as well as on the Commission's goals of deterring shams and fronts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Definition of Women and Minority-Owned Business <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 44. As discussed above, we have proposed steps in this order to address the special funding problems faced by minority and women-owned firms and thereby to ensure that these groups have the opportunity to participate and become strong competitors in the narrowband PCS service. <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>  We previously adopted a tax certificate program for women and minorities to allow more sources of potential funding, and in this Order have relaxed the attribution standard used to determine eligibility as a qualified small business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed to use the same criteria set forth in the Second Report and Order, and consider the members of the following groups ``minorities'' for purposes of our rules: ``[T]hose of Black, Hispanic Surnamed, American Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian and Asiatic American extraction.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Statement of Policy on Minority Ownership of Broadcasting Facilities, 68 FCC 2d 979, 980 n.8 (1978); Commission Policy Regarding the Advancement of Minority Ownership in Broadcasting, 92 FCC 2d 849, 489 n.1 (1982). Moreover, as adopted in the Second Report and Order, minority and women-owned businesses would be eligible for special measures only if the minority and women principals are also United States citizens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 45. For purposes of implementing these steps, we propose to depart from the definition of a minority and women-owned firm that was adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have adopted relaxed attribution standards for businesses owned by women and minorities for purposes of qualifying for small business provisions. We are proposing relaxed standards for businesses owned by women and minorities to qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we found generally that to establish ownership by minorities and women, a strict eligibility standard should be adopted that required minorities or women to have at least 50.1 percent equity stake and a 50.1 percent controlling interest in the designated entity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para; 68; 47 CFR &sect;1.2110(b)(2). For future narrowband PCS auctions, we propose to retain the requirement that minorities and/or women control the applicant and hold at least 50.1 percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock. However, to establish their eligibility for certain benefits, summarized below, we propose an additional requirement that, even where minorities and women hold at least 50.1 percent of the applicant's equity, other investors in the applicant may own only passive interests, which, for corporate applicants, is defined to include as much as fifteen percent of the voting stock. In addition, provided that certain restrictions are met, we propose to allow women and minority-owned firms the option to reduce to 25 percent the 50.1 percent minimum equity amount that must be held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46. We emphasized in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that we did not intend to restrict the use of various equity financing mechanisms and incentives to attract financing, provided that the minority and women principals continued to own 50.1 percent of the equity, calculated on a full-diluted basis, and that their equity interest entitled them to a substantial stake in the profits and liquidation value of the venture relative to the non-controlling principals. We noted, however, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that different standards that meet the same objectives may be appropriate in other contexts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para; 278. In view of the evidence of discriminatory lending experiences faced by minority and women entrepreneurs and the exceptionally great financial resources believed to be required by narrowband PCS applicants, we conclude that it may be appropriate to allow more flexibility with regard to the 50.1 percent equity requirements for this service in order to open doors to more sources of equity financing for women and minority-owned firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

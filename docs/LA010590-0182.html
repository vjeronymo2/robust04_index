			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BRADLEY, BUSINESS LEADERS TO DISCUSS FUTURE OF NFL IN L.A.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley has scheduled a meeting Monday with local business leaders to  talk about Los Angeles being in jeopardy of not having a National Football  League team in the future.  </P> <P> The Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982, but the team's future  home is uncertain.  </P> <P> "Whether it's the Raiders or some other professional team, this city, the  second-largest city in the country, must have a professional football team,"  Bradley said today.  </P> <P> "I have called a group of community leaders together for the purpose of  supporting a professional football team in Los Angeles and to help us in  generating the same kind of community spirit we were able to generate when a  similar kind of committee was appointed that brought the Raiders to Los Angeles  in the first place."  </P> <P> Bradley wouldn't say whether the group's top priority was to keep the Raiders  playing at the Los Angeles Coliseum, their home for eight seasons, or whether  he supported the Coliseum Commission's most recent tentative offer to Al Davis,  the Raiders managing general partner. Coliseum Commission President Richard  Riordon has said the offer includes a tax-free $20-million payment to the team  and a promise to raise $145 million from private sources to refurbish the  Coliseum, which was built in 1923.  </P></p>

"The most important thing now is to develop a mechanism for  implementing this message," Galazov stressed. "The president  counts on the Russian Constitution. Boris Yeltsin has confirmed  that the state's unity and integrity can be preserved on the  basis of Russia's federated arrangement," he said.    The president shared gave his assessment to the activities  of  the parliamentary commission in the state of emergency zone in  North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The North Ossetian and Ingush  presidents are capable of settling their differences without any  mediation, he emphasised. They can solve all complicated issues  by themselves. "A negotiating process between the two republics  has got underway, it should be continued," Galazov said.    Commenting on the results of the Zheleznovodsk meeting of  North Caucasian leader with the participation of the chief of  the Russian president's staff, Galazov described it as "another  attempt to settle relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia  by peaceful means." According to him, "North Ossetia is ready  to work consistently for establishing normal relations with all  its neighbours. I insist that the problem of refugees cannot be  solved by use of force. The final word is to be said by  reconciliation commissions," he emphasised.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Automotive suffers Pounds 12.5m losses Automotive Products has fallen into the red for 1993 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.5m. This compared with profits of Pounds 16.2m and was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 283.5m to Pounds 246m. The directors of this Guthrie Corporation offshoot, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBA Group, said that a difficult year was exacerbated by continuing overcapacity and competition in the aviation components business.</p>

Funds To Pay Debts Have Been Raised but  Problems Remain"]    [Excerpts] The day of 10 February will go down in the  history of domestic TV and radio broadcasting next to the other  "black" date -- 3 October. Communication workers managed to do  more than the coupists: in October, when Ostankino went off the  air, Russian TV and radio worked all night. This time, however,  both TV and radio went out completely in more than 60 regions of  Russia. In a number of regions only morning and evening news  bulletins were broadcast. Reports coming into Ostankino from the  morning were reminiscent of front-line reports as though they  were about an enemy capturing cities, one by one: Yakutsk,  Irkutsk, Kirov, Kazan, Kemerovo, Nizhniy Novgorod, Saratov,  Ivanovo, Ulyanovsk, Arkhangelsk, Smolensk, Voronezh, Volgograd,  and Chita -- a total blackout. Tver, St. Petersburg, Novgorod,  Krasnodar, and Izhevsk: Only "Novosti" and "Vesti" were aired.  The greater part of Russia's population was on the verge of a  full information vacuum. Moscow has avoided such a fate: the  communication workers saved this "argument" as a last resort.  According to another version, the director of the Moscow TV and  Radio Center (as well as the main communication centers in  several more oblasts) did not obey the decision of their trade  union and boycotted the protest action.    Be that as it may, the threat by the communication workers  to  reduce or stop TV and radio broadcasting, which many dismissed  as not serious enough, was made good. And it worked, confirming  the eternal Russian truth: Until thunder has struck, the muzhik  will not cross himself. [passage omitted]    What happened on 10 February has shown that our perception  of  the present information system as democratic is illusory. The  system whereby TV is controlled from one point and can instantly  be switched off throughout the country remains essentially  totalitarian. [passage omitted]    This time it turned out all right in the end. But everyone  understands: The situation can be repeated. Something must be  done. Even Viktor Chernomyrdin, who only a month and a half ago  at a meeting with Ostankino's board of directors stated  decisively: "The government will provide for state TV no matter  what," on 10 February, in an interview with "Novosti," called  into question the need for such a proportion of state  TV (in Russia there are three federal and 90 regional  companies): "One should look to see what needs to be  corporatized and what should be privatized."    Ostankino alone will require 1.267 trillion from the budget  in 1994. Out of this amount, 88 percent will go to pay for  communication services.    Valentin Lazutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian Federal TV  and Radio Broadcasting Service, is certain: the nongovernmental  sphere does not have this sort of money. Additional funds  received from corporatizing Ostankino (if it takes place) will  allow to recoup program production costs, not pay for the  transmission. Even if several large financial groups become  stock holders, there will not be enough money to pay the  communication workers.    Nor is it possible, according to V. Lazutkin, to introduce  subscription fees or a TV tax: First, the condition of the tax  system and the way taxes are collected are well known; second,  the population cannot be coerced to pay TV bills; third, it is  politically inexpedient to impose high charges while the modest  sums that will eventually be returned will not cover the  expenses.    Therefore, TV cannot do without large state subsidies. V.  Lazutkin believes it necessary to undertake a qualified economic  assessment of the whole system of financial settlements: with  the communication services, the power services, and so forth.  Many prices have been established arbitrarily: real prices, on  the other hand, will allow to reduce these astronomical sums  substantially.    Reorganization within the companies themselves -- cutting  bloated staffs (especially in Ostankino), streamlining  advertising, rationalizing the broadcasting regime (eliminating  what sociologists call idle time) -- all this will also save  budget resources and allow state TV to survive. And that it is  on the verge of collapse is clear to everybody. [passage  omitted]</p>

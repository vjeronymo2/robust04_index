			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): New business shifts towards a few winners - Barry Riley analyses the performance of the managers and finds that the top four have opened up a gap Within a virtually static market place, the pension fund management business continues to show marked changes. The big four active managers have opened up something of a gap, Gartmore's Pounds 16bn under management at the end of 1993 being more than Pounds 4bn ahead of the Prudential's total. BZWIM's inclusion in the top group is for rather different reasons: it is the leader in index-tracking, which represents Pounds 17bn of its UK pension fund business, and it also looks after Pounds 7bn of the Barclays group's in-house pension funds. The biggest winners of new business in 1993, according to the newsletter Global Money Management, were Gartmore, Schroder and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management. Good progress was also made by Baring, Morgan Grenfell, Baillie Gifford and Legal &amp; General (the latter in index funds, where it is number two to BZWIM). Net losers included Cazenove, Fleming and BZWIM. Mighty Mercury Asset Management, too, suffered a modest net loss of business last year, although it remains the clear industry leader. With well over 400 clients, MAM is bound to lose several each year, for instance through mergers and restructurings, even if it performs well; and it is having to run hard to stand still. As always, the performance league table explains a lot. Last year there was a very wide dispersion of total returns within the top 15 managers, from 25 per cent to 37 per cent. Over five years, the differences are much less, but there is still a 3 or 4 percentage-point gap between the top few and the bottom group. That implies a 20 per cent difference in the size of a client's fund after five years. The performance figures have been supplied to the Financial Times and are certified to comply with the industry code. However, the gradual shift towards specific asset allocation benchmarks, rather than full manager discretion, may mean that the figures do not always reflect the actual experience of clients. Moreover some managers decline to publish figures. Mercury Asset Management is believed, for instance, to have a particularly wide dispersion of performance, and it refuses to disclose a house median (although it is thought to have been close to the industry average in 1993). Newton, a fast-growing independent firm, easily retained its leadership of the five-year performance table in 1993, but has been closed for new business for a while. Stewart Newton is anxious to keep the rate of growth under control, and will only accept a small number of new clients in the remainder of this year. The tendency for business to cascade in an unmanageable way towards the performance leaders is something which advisers and consultants seek to resist, but with little success. Baillie Gifford, the lone current success story from Scotland, raised its funds under management by 60 per cent last year, although it was also said to be turning away business at one stage. The much bigger Gartmore did almost as well in the wake of its brilliant 1992 performance. Rivals have been watching closely, however, to see whether Gartmore could cope with such a heady pace of expansion at the very time that the company's November stock market flotation might have been expected to take the management's eye off the ball. Performance did, in fact, wobble in 1993, but a good final quarter, when high exposure to the Far Eastern equity markets boosted the results, enabled Gartmore to close the year respectably, just inside the second quartile of returns. The use of aggressive strategic switches is a feature of Gartmore's style, and it is significant that it is asking its clients to approve the use of derivatives so that it can continue to apply this approach to funds which have expanded 2 1/2 -fold in two years. Elsewhere among the leaders, PDFM also had an indifferent year for performance, going heavily bearish and raising liquidity during the final quarter's bull run in global equities. However, its value-oriented stock selection has been very good, and it will be reaping the benefit of its recent caution in 1994's much more difficult markets. In contrast Schroder, which had a strong suit in its emerging markets expertise, enjoyed a brilliant year, and was the only one of the Big Four managers to shine. Its performance was almost too good, because it promotes a steady, just-above-median style, and racy figures might not always go down well with its risk-averse clientele. However, with funds under management up by almost 50 per cent last year, Schroder is in a purple patch. But while some of the merchant banks and independent managers are doing well, life assurance companies are going through a bad period. Prudential Portfolio Managers has suffered from poor performance and Scottish Widows is also slipping back. Legal &amp; General at least has a niche in index funds. The only upwardly-mobile life office in segregated pensions at the moment is Clerical Medical, which jumped past the Pounds 2bn milestone last year. 'The only life companies who are going to succeed are those who think like merchant banks,' says Mark Henderson, senior investment manager at Clerical Medical, which is comfortably in the top half of the performance table. Positions in the lower part of the league are making business difficult, however, for two waning ex-stars of the pension management business, Henderson and Fleming. Of the two, Fleming had a better time in 1993, however, and one more good year might take its five-year performance up to the median level. Last year, Fleming beat the median through well-judged asset allocation, says its head of balanced funds, Chris Tracey. There were profitable moves into and then back out of Japan. But Fleming was underweight in UK second-line stocks, which was costly. As recently as 1986, Fleming was the second-biggest manager; now it is ninth. So the houses now at the top of the list certainly cannot relax. They will lose business if performance slips, but at the same time the market has become more concentrated. The big four were running Pounds 115bn at the end of 1993, up 37 per cent in a year. This was about 27 per cent of the UK occupational scheme total, and a much larger proportion of the free market, given that many of the biggest funds are run in-house. There were indications at one stage that specialist mandates might provide an opportunity for new small competitors to come into the external management business, as they have in the US where boutiques in fact dominate pension fund management. But the only specialisation to have succeeded in the UK has been index fund management. Even this may be reaching a ceiling as a proportion of the market, at somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent. One of the minor players, Bankers Trust, pulled out earlier this year by selling its Pounds 1.2bn UK index funds business to Invesco. A number of international financial institutions with London operations are trying to break into the UK pension fund business by offering specialist services such as global bond management. They range from Swiss banks like Lombard-Odier and Julius Baer to overseas life companies such as the Australian-owned AMP. Progress is very slow in the UK, but as it happens there are many new mandates on offer at present from US pension funds, which are greatly stepping up their international exposure. Those genuine boutiques that survive in London mainly do so by marketing to US clients. This applies to Marathon Asset Management, for instance, and to quantitative boutiques like Panagora and Pareto Partners. According to Nigel O'Sullivan, of consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow, UK pension fund sponsors find it hard to accept small firms' names on a short list. In the post-Maxwell climate there is an even greater inclination to play for safety. When one of the high-profile stars of Mercury Asset Management, Leonard Licht, left in 1992 to move to the little-known Jupiter Tyndall, he took negligible amounts of business away with him. In the US such a move by a personality manager would have had much more impact. In fact, it is the big balanced managers who are, by and large, taking the specialist briefs. Not only has the shift to specialisation in the UK proved quite modest, but it is strengthening the stranglehold of the established leaders rather than weakening it. Unless one of the Big Four spectacularly blows up, the process of concentration within the UK's pension fund management industry could have some way further to go.  --------------------------------------------------------- PERFORMANCE OF SEGREGATED FUNDS (TO DECEMBER 31, 1993)  --------------------------------------------------------- Annualised total return (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------                                     Over 5 yrs   Over 1 yr  --------------------------------------------------------- Newton Investment Management              19.9        37.4 Gartmore Investment Management            18.8        29.4 Queen Anne's Gate Asset Man.              18.5        33.8 Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management           17.8        28.6 Schroder Investment Management            17.8        32.7 Baring Investment Management              17.3        31.2 Clerical Medical                          17.3        31.7 M &amp; G Investment Management               17.2        34.0 HSBC Asset Management Europe              17.2        29.4 Morgan Grenfell Asset Management          17.1        32.6 Cazenove                                  16.9        30.0 Rothschild Asset Management               16.9        27.0 Hill Samuel Investment Man.               16.8        30.2 Caps Median Fund                          16.8        29.2 Lloyds Investment Managers                16.6        29.5 Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inv.

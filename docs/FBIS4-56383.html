			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manuel Robles] </F>   [Text] The leader of the National Peasant Confederation  (CNC), Hugo Andres Araujo, said that he was willing to have all  leaders of the confederation investigated to clear up any links  with the Zapatist National Liberation Army. Adolfo Orive, the  CNC's director of training, denied that he had contributed to  the violence in Chiapas, asserting that "a paramilitary group is  using the peasants to set them at odds" and clarifying that his  presence more than 15 years ago in Chiapas "is just history."    "We always promoted peasant economic organizations all over  the country, but we have nothing to do with the violence in  Chiapas," says Orive, the founder and head of Proletarian Line,  a Maoist organization that is prominent in teacher struggles in  Oaxaca and worker struggles in Monclova, Coahuila, and that  "influenced" Chiapas political parties and peasant groups as of  1974, according to Mardonio Morales, a Jesuit priest who has  lived for more than 30 years in the Lacandon Forest (PROCESO  888).    Orive explains that a week after Mardonio Morales said that  he [Orive] and Hugo Andres Araujo paved the way years ago for  the emergence of the guerrillas in Chiapas, the vicar general of  the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, Gonzalo Ituarte  Verduzco, denied the charge.    Ituarte said that he met Orive when the latter was indeed in  Chiapas, promoting credit unions and holding dialogues with  peasants. "I am not aware of the rest. I do not know of his  record as an official" (PROCESO 881).    Last September, the Jesuit priest revealed the existence of  guerrilla groups in Chiapas, after asserting that the Torreon  Group, whose visible leaders were Orive and Hugo Andres Araujo,  had planted the ideological seed in 1974.    On Tuesday 4 March at the Agrarian Reform House, as a  meeting, chaired by Araujo, about the impact of GATT on the  country's farm sector was about to begin, Orive declined to go  into detail about his work in Chiapas, although he did agree to  talk about the charges against him:    "Unfortunately, there are a lot of newsmen who latch onto  labels, which I imagine are very appealing...So there is really  not much to talk about."    A nervous man of few words, the CNC official says that he  worked in Chiapas 15 or 16 years ago, when he set up a credit  union.    "That is history. It was a long time ago. All of it is in  writing back there."    He was asked what he thought about Mardonio's comments and  whether it was true that through those peasant organizations he  contributed to the violence in Chiapas. He denies it, asserting:    "Otherwise, I would not be here. And that is not all. In  documents from those people, when we were there, 15 years ago,  they criticized us severely for being pro-government. The people  of Chiapas know all this."    "So you had nothing to do with it?"    "Absolutely not. Our line is a public line, a very obvious  one. We always promoted peasant economic organizations all over  the republic. We never had anything to do with violence.  Obviously we think that the rule of law, which has been  violated, ought to be respected, that the peasants are being  used to set them at odds...Because the problems of the peasants  are one thing, and a paramilitary group that is using them is  another."    Orive is in a hurry to join the meeting.    "What about the formation of the Proletarian Line  groups...."    "That is all history. Let me get to the meeting."    "How do you see the situation in Chiapas?"    "It is stable, stable."    Also on 4 March, Hugo Andres Araujo stated that he and some  of his colleagues promoted "successful economic organizations"  in Chiapas.    He said that he knew "all of the Chiapas organizations" and  that the first ones to come out against violence in Chiapas were  Pajal, ARIC, and the Union of Unions, among others, which were  "formed back in those years but are now without external  guidance."    And he voiced this complaint:    "Now they want to keep quoting me...I do not want to get  into  a debate because it is irrelevant. The results of the work are  there to see. My training inside the CNC has mainly been in  economic organizations; today, it is in the economic and the  political area."    He explained that he did most of his work in the La Laguna  Region, Tamaulipas, Sonora, and San Luis Potosi ("which I can  indeed talk about"), and he reiterated: "Many colleagues who  formed those organizations are today leaders of municipal  committees, mayors, or leaders of leagues that I am called upon  to head today."    He then added:    "This clarification is in order because I will answer for  all  my work and its results. But it makes no sense for them to  attack me now, really...What I will accept is that for 25 years  I have been committed to the country's peasant organizations."    A day later, in an interview with the news program "Desde  Mexico, Buenas Noches" [Good Night From Mexico City] on the  Azteca TV Network, the CNC leader said that he was willing to  have all CNC leaders investigated "to clarify any ties with the  rebel group that took up arms in Chiapas."    Lastly, he clarified that the investigation should not be  limited to the CNC but should instead include "all areas related  to the state of Chiapas." And he asserted that if culprits are  found, "the law should be enforced."    Gustavo Gordillo de Anda, the current undersecretary of  agrarian reform and another of the founders and leaders of the  peasant organizations, explains in his 1988 book "Campesinos al  asalto del cielo; de la expropiacion estatal a la apropiacion  campesina":    "Mass Line or Proletarian Line has been a political faction  that has opposed the party framework which emerged from the 1968  student movement and since then has done political work in major  social movements."    His book, which relates the experience of the Coalition of  Collective Ejidos of the Yaqui or Mayo Valleys in Sonora,  clarifies that the faction's main goal, in contrast to leftist  parties, was "that its political activities would not conform to  instructions from outside the mass movement."    It adds: "The Popular Action Movement arose in the late  1970's out of a confluence of union groups, intellectuals, and  activists in the peasant movement. Subsequently, along with four  other political organizations, it began what later led to the  formation of the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico."</p>

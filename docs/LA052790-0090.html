			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENURED RADICALS?  </P> <P> I share Donald Lazere's dismay at the reductive, fraudulent arguments that  conservative cultural critics have been aiming at American higher education.  Lazere's efforts to set the record straight by doing the research that the  Kimballs and Sykeses only pretend to do are valuable for checking the  misperception of what goes on in colleges and universities across the country.  </P> <P> For that reason, I was dismayed to read in his litany of what "leftists" and  Kimball find distasteful: " . . . Paul de Man (whose posthumous exposure as a  Nazi collaborator confirmed leftists' belief that deconstruction was a  conservative movement)." Lazere's comment is no less scurrilous than the gossip  for which he rightly chastises Kimball. It substitutes the reviewer's bogeyman  for the author's and begs an equally irresponsible analogy between left culture  criticism and Stalinism.  </P> <P> I do not want to explain away De Man's wartime journalism . . . (some  anti-Semitic comments in newspaper reviews, as Lazere does not tell us -- did  he rely on Newsweek's sensationalism, or does he suppress the information  hoping that we will think the worst?) but its mention here is a red herring.  His "leftist" objection is to a certain moment in deconstruction's  Americanization that threatened to reduce it to a method of close reading,  conservative in being apolitical. De Man's wartime writing, obviously  political, did not produce deconstruction or vice-versa, as Lazere deceptively  suggests. . . .  </P> <P> KEVIN McNAMARA  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER  </P></p>

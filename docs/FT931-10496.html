			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / European group may seek radio licence CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcasting group, has renewed its interest in investing in UK radio and television, and is examining the London commercial radio frequencies to be advertised next month. Mr Gaston Thorn, president of CLT and former president of the European Commission, was in London last week to express his interest to Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, which regulates commercial radio. The frequencies to be advertised include those used by LBC, Melody, Jazz and Spectrum radios. CLT is interested in setting up a music-based station in the south of England and would like to repeat the success of its Atlantic 252, which broadcasts mainly to the north and Midlands. Atlantic broadcasts pop music and has a weekly audience of 4.25m adults, according to Radio Joint Audience Research. It is unlikely that CLT would be granted a London licence to broadcast just pop music. The radio authority has a responsibility to broaden choice in the area and Capital, whose licence will not be re-advertised until next year, is a well-established pop station. Mr Thorn says CLT is also interested in television. It would like to take a minority stake in an ITV company, and then look at joint ventures in continental Europe.</p>

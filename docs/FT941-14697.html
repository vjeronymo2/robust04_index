			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Leading Article: BES, EIS and other carrots Part of the received wisdom about the British financial system since the 1930s is that small and medium-sized companies are starved of funds. A recurring feature of British budgets over the same period has been the unveiling of new fiscal and financial incentives for investment in the small business sector. Mr Kenneth Clarke's November budget was no exception. The question is whether the successor to the Business Expansion Scheme (BES), the Enterprise Investment Scheme, along with the forthcoming introduction of Venture Capital Trusts, will make any more difference than previous initiatives; and, indeed, whether the whole approach is not fundamentally misconceived. It is easy enough to make the case that the fiscal and financial systems contain a bias against the small end of the corporate spectrum. For much of the time since it was introduced in 1965, capital gains tax has been a powerful disincentive to potential owner-managers and investors. Its present 40 per cent level is one of the highest in the developed world. In practice it can be higher still, since losses cannot be carried back or offset against other taxes. Because the tax is charged on realisation, it has a locking-in effect that distorts investment decisions. Capital gains tax has thus reinforced the existing fiscal bias to institutional investment, whereby a majority of company securities are owned by insurance companies and pension funds. For them, the effort of managing unquoted investments is disproportionate to the reward; all the more so with difficult types of venture capital such as start-ups. Moreover, insurance company solvency regulations tend to penalise unquoted investments. So, too, does the maturity of occupational pension schemes. With cash flow only marginally covering pension payments, fund managers have to pay greater attention to the liquidity of their investments. Problem area The banks, meanwhile, find the bottom end of the corporate spectrum a problem area - witness their huge recent provisions against small business lending. Specialist institutions such as 3I have done their bit. Yet the debate about a financing gap continues. The BES undoubtedly removed much of the fiscal disincentive to invest in unquoted companies. Relief was available both on the investment made, and on income and capital gains. The same will be true, with variations, in the Enterprise Investment Scheme, but with no relief available for investment in rented housing and a new opportunity for investors to become paid directors, or 'business angels'. The charge to capital gains on other investments will be deferred if the proceeds are invested in qualifying companies. When the consultative document on Venture Capital Trusts appears shortly there will no doubt be reliefs of comparable attraction. Below average Yet the striking thing about the BES is how little investors prospered from the relief. On some estimates only 20 per cent of the 1,300 publicly funded companies set up under the scheme returned any cash to their investors. That suggests that, if the tax relief really did encourage additional investment in unquoted companies, it was chiefly in projects with below average prospects of showing economic returns. Meanwhile, private individuals have been encouraged to shun quoted shares in favour of unquoted ones. This is symptomatic of a more fundamental problem about the taxation of savings that successive chancellors have ducked. Income, which is the central element of the present tax base, is hard to define. When the rates of tax on income and capital gains are substantially aligned, as they have been since the 1988 budget, investment decisions may be less distorted. But the accretion of new reliefs and restrictions immediately makes a nonsense of the genuflection to fiscal neutrality. The best answer would be to move to an expenditure tax, since this eliminates, inter alia, the need to make the difficult distinction between capital and revenue. That, in effect, is how pension funds are now taxed. Extending the principle to the whole tax base would provide a more coherent set of incentives for savings, investment and enterprise. It is overdue for a more sympathetic hearing from the Treasury.</p>

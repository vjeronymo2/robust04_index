			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Leading Article: A rail link for Heathrow THE GOVERNMENT cannot afford to give Britons all the transport they want. Last week, ministers announced their intention to enlist private sector support for the task. Days later, an ugly row over the funding of an express rail link between central London and Heathrow airport risks mocking the notion that public and private sectors are capable of working together successfully. At Pounds 300m, the Heathrow Express project is relatively cheap for what it does. Fast, non-stop trains would travel along a new 4-mile spur linking the airport with British Rail's main line, then along existing tracks for the remaining 12-mile stretch into London Paddington. Journey times of an hour by road or London Underground would be cut to just 16 minutes. BAA, Heathrow's private sector owner, says state-owned British Rail is undermining the viability of the project by asking too high a price for the use of its tracks. British Rail counters that Heathrow Express would take up 43 per cent of its main line capacity, and BAA can hardly expect to get that for nothing. BAA retorts that it is surely worth keeping the track charge low if that means giving the country a significant piece of privately funded infrastructure that it would not otherwise have. Nonsense, says BR: if BAA wants the line subsidised, let it subsidise itself. For whom, after all, is it being built? Tough negotiating It would be wrong to make too much of this row. There may yet be a solution: tough negotiating positions are an everyday feature of commercial life and it is, perhaps, reassuring to see BR adopting one in defence of taxpayers' funds. But in the wake of two other unsuccessful attempts by private companies to embark on the operation of rail services - Virgin on the passenger side and Charterail on the freight - an eventual collapse of the Heathrow Express project would augur badly for rail privatisation. At the heart of the issue is whether private train operators can hope to make a commercial return if they are paying a full commercial price for the use of the tracks. The evidence so far suggests the answer is no. In the case of Heathrow Express, a full track charge would require fare levels so high that few would consider them worth paying so long as other modes of transport offered a cheaper alternative. Little optimism Under the railway privatisation plans proposed by the government, all private train operators will pay track charges to the public authority which will own the track. The government is currently awaiting the results of a study which will say what those charges will be. But there is little sense of optimism in the private sector that the study will pave the way for a new golden age of rail: the charges, it is feared, will simply be too steep. And yet, by accident or design, the government seems to be fumbling its way towards a solution. Last week Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, promised to produce a green paper early in the new year which will dare to ask whether car and lorry owners pay enough for their use of the roads; whether the right balance has been struck between the charges imposed on rail users and road users; and whether road users should be charged in the same way as rail users - in other words, at the point of use. Clearly, charging for roads at the point of use would increase rail's competitiveness. Higher charges for road use would increase it more. The green paper on these issues will therefore bear just as directly upon the prospects for the privatisation of British Rail as the study being conducted into track charges. Indeed, it is hard to see how the two can be rationally be conducted in isolation from one another. So far the government has made no attempt to make this connection. Yesterday's news that the timetable for the privatisation of British Rail is slipping gives it the opportunity to do so. Meanwhile it should resist the temptation to press British Rail into a one-off deal which would give BAA cheap access to the railways on terms unavailable to other would-be train operators.</p>

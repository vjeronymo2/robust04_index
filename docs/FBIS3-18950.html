			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "A.V.": "Conclusion of Uruguay Round Will </F> Have Slightly Favorable Impact on French Industry"]    [Text] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round on 15 December  1993 within the framework of GATT will have a positive impact on  French industry. This impact will, however, be minor: Our  exports of manufactured products will increase by 1.15 percent  and our imports by 0.34 percent, according to a study published  on Monday, 7 March by the Ministry of Industry, Postal Services,  Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade.    The study was carried out by BIPE [Office for Economic  Information and Forecasts] on behalf of the government. BIPE  estimates that average customs duties affecting exported  industrial products will drop from 4.6 percent -- the level they  were at before the agreement -- to 3.2 percent when the  agreement enters into force, i.e., within a maximum period of 10  years. It is because industrial customs duties were already so  low that these products were not the focal point of the Uruguay  Round negotiations, unlike agricultural products, textile  products, services, and intellectual property issues. This also  explains the fact that, generally speaking, the impact of the  anticipated drop in customs duties (30 percent) on exports and  imports of manufactured products will not very large.    The study shows that the impact is unequal in different  sectors. For exports by French industry, it is obviously the  most highly taxed products which benefit from the greatest  effects of the planned drop: leather, shoes, clothing,  textiles, professional electrical equipment, followed by  mechanical engineering, and -- lastly -- parachemicals,  pharmaceuticals, printing, and publishing. On the other hand,  products from the aeronautics and shipbuilding sectors, as well  as the nonferrous metals, paper and cardboard, wood, and  furniture sectors will not benefit as much from the Uruguay  Round agreement.  <H5>  Minor Impact on the Economy </H5>   For imports, average customs duties will drop from the  current 1.1 percent to 0.8 percent. Sectors which will see  imports rise most will be leather, shoes, textiles, clothing,  professional electrical equipment, and household equipment.  Steel-making, aeronautics, shipbuilding, glass, and  construction materials will scarcely be affected.    All in all, the positive impact of the GATT agreement will  be  stronger on exports than on imports, and will therefore favor  French industry. This can be explained by France's lower level  of taxation compared to other countries -- primarily, of course,  developing countries.    The impact on the economy will only amount to 0.2 percent of  overall production within the next 10 years -- a very modest  impact indeed. However, the study stresses that a failure in  the Uruguay Round would have certainly had a negative impact on  world economic growth. Sixteen thousand jobs will be created  (up 0.1 percent for the trading sector), more than half of which  will be in industry: 3,000 in the manufacture of professional  electrical equipment; 1,700 in mechanical engineering; 1,400 in  foundries; and 900 in parachemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles,  and clothing.</p>

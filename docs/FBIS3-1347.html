			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council's [TEC] Sub-Council on Finance said on Thursday [24  March] the payout of pensions to public servants would have a  negative effect on the economy and South Africa's image abroad.    This was in apparent reaction to the recent swell in demands  by mainly civil servants for their pension contributions to be  returned to them before the April election.    In a resolution adopted on Thursday, the sub-council said  the  demand for immediate pension payments had been precipitated by  the "pre-emptive securing of excessive pensions and employment  benefits by certain political office bearers". Another reason  behind the demand for pension payments was that civil servants  had been denied access by certain administrations to  decision-making with regard to pension funds.    "The Sub-Council on Finance wishes to reassure all concerned  that their pension benefits are adequately protected in the  Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993. Section 236  (5) of the constitution specifically provides that pensionable  salary or pensionable salary scale of civil servants shall not  be reduced below the levels applicable before the commencement  of the new constitution.    "Section 212 (6) of the constitution specifically protects  the accrued benefits of members of official pension funds. In  essence it provides that any amendments to pension benefits,  which may be prejudicial to members, may not be instituted  retroactively."    The sub-council urged all concerned to exercise utmost  restraint and called on affected people to consider their demand  for immediate pension payouts.    "Such a call is made especially in the light of the fact  that  the longer-term disadvantages to the individual and the country  far outweigh short-term benefit that might accrue from an  immediate pension payout."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by A.Ye.: "There Will Be an Armenian Embassy in </F> Moscow"]    [Text] "I can only officially confirm that an edict on the  creation of a Republic of Armenia Embassy in Moscow is being  prepared by the president's staff," correspondent Arman  Kirakosyan, first deputy minister of foreign affairs, told  RESPUBLIKA ARMENIA in response to a request for a comment on the  rumors circulating regarding the appointment of Yuriy Mkrtumyan  as acting charge d'affaires in the Russian Federation.    According to Mr. Kirakosyan, the Republic of Armenia's  current permanent representation in Moscow does not have a legal  basis since it does not fall under any of the agreements signed  between Armenia and Russia. Essentially, it is still a  "representation of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR  under the USSR Council of Ministers." Naturally, its status has  to be changed sooner or later. There are reasons to assume that  the presidential edicts on the creation of a diplomatic  representation and appointment of a Republic of Armenia charge  d'affaires in Russia will be signed in the very near future.</p>

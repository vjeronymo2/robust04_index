			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Signals show delays ahead Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is not a man in a hurry, writes Kevin Brown. British Rail may gaze enviously across the Channel at the high-speed line on which its French counterpart will run 180mph trains when the Channel tunnel opens in May. But there is no Gallic elan about Mr MacGregor. Like a little-used Scottish branch line, he meanders slowly towards his destination, certain he will get there but unsure when or how. Announcing his 'final' decision on the high-speed line in the House of Commons, Mr MacGregor was given a relatively friendly reception by Kent's Conservative MPs. Bitter opposition was confined to Labour MPs from Essex and east London constituencies crossed by the line. But Mr MacGregor knows that almost every MP affected by the line will seek changes, some costing tens of millions of pounds. Worse, it will be time-consuming. Mr MacGregor says he wants to have fast trains running at full speed on the line around the turn of the century. Unfortunately for the government, Parliament has developed a special means of debating such legislation: the hybrid bill procedure. It is potentially a nightmare for Mr MacGregor. The main difference between a hybrid bill and a normal bill is the insertion of a second committee stage - the stage at which bills are considered line by line - by a select committee of MPs. A hybrid bill select committee has a quasi-judicial function. It takes evidence from supporters of the project and objectors, sets its own timetable, and is protected from party political pressures by the rules of the Commons. An objection, known as a petition, can be filed for Pounds 2; all petitions must be considered, although similar ones can be grouped. When the bill emerges from the Commons, the whole procedure is repeated in the Lords. The government hopes the bill will take about two years to pass through Parliament. But critics of the project think the tactical opportunities presented by the procedure mean it can be dragged out to at least three years. The Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill, they recall, took six. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, says the opposition will not formally oppose the bill. But it will support petitioners such as Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, who wants a 1 1/2 mile tunnel to protect householders in his Thames-side constituency. 'The skill is going to be in getting a large number of people to spend Pounds 2 to petition against the bill. I don't think we are going to have difficulty at all in doing that,' he says. 'John MacGregor says he can get this up and running by the end of the century . . . He is not going to get anywhere near that timetable unless he comes to his senses.' The sentiment, if not the language, is shared by some Conservative MPs. Mr Andrew Rowe, Tory MP for mid-Kent, also wants a tunnel, to protect the pretty Boxley valley between Maidstone and the Medway towns. Mr Rowe says he is anxious not to delay the bill unduly. But he adds: 'Delaying the bill is the only weapon we have, and if that is what we have to do then so be it . . . It should be possible to do a deal on the basis that if they are a bit less bloody-minded on what we want, we will be a bit less bloody-minded about the bill.' It is a view held privately by many of Mr MacGregor's nominal supporters. But finding a way through the maze of objections without seriously inflating the cost of the line will be a Herculean task. Mr MacGregor looks more like Sisyphus, condemned forever to push an uphill burden.</p>

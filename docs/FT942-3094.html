			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Free bankers and gold bugs Although the academic case against central banks, and for free banking, has failed, so far, to gather much practitioner support, should the current enthusiasm for central bank independence prove a disappointment, in terms of successful re-establishment of price stability, then it is possible, though far from certain, that the cause of free banking would obtain renewed support. The above is a quotation not from some maverick, but from the keynote paper by Professor Charles Goodhart and co-authors (The Development of Central Banking) at last week's Bank of England tercentenary seminar. The argument is about whether banking requires more regulation than any other industry. It helps to follow the argument if we make a clear distinction between 'currency', namely notes and coins plus bankers' reserves with the central banks, and 'money', which is a much wider concept including bank deposits and any other instruments used for settling debts. (Currency is also pretty close to the monetarists' idea of 'base money'.) The issue goes back to a division among the founding fathers of economics about the inflationary effects of banking. David Hume, who promulgated the Quantity Theory, regarded currency as consisting essentially of gold or other precious metals. He explained how a doubling of the amount of gold in Britain would lead first to a rise in prices and then to a redistribution of the new gold throughout the rest of the world. He regarded man-made substitutes, whether bank notes or deposits, as essentially counterfeit gold. Adam Smith disagreed on the last point. His view, which may be called the 'classical' one, was that price stability depended on the convertibility of notes into precious metals. The classical school argued that banks could not issue credit indefinitely as the public had to be persuaded to accept the notes and deposits thereby created. Banks would not only have to acquire a reputation for caution but offer interest, at least on deposits. So the multiplication of man-made money would come to an end where the extra interest from advancing credit was balanced by the extra interest that had to be paid to depositors as well as other banking costs. There are some factual observations which tell in favour of the classical school. The chief monument to the Quantity Theory (then called 'currency school'), was Robert Peel's Bank Charter Act of 1844. This tried to stop the multiplication of bank money by giving the Bank of England a monopoly of the note issue, the size of which was tied to its gold stock. The authors of the Act did not realise that deposits would become far more important than notes; and the Act did not prevent a vast increase in the effective money supply erected on a small gold base. There were no long-term inflationary or deflationary developments, while the pound remained convertible into gold. In our own day central banks have tried to limit the creation of deposit money; and critics have often scoffed that their efforts are dwarfed by the multiplication of deposits in the Euro markets and general innovation and globalisation. Yet none of these hyped-up forces has prevented central banks from curbing inflation once they had developed the courage to raise interest rates enough to do so, first in the 1980s and then in the 1990s. Some of the above arguments are taken from David Glasner's Free Banking and Monetary Reform (Cambridge University Press, 1989), to which I alluded in Economic Viewpoint last week. This book comes to grips with problems that many other free banking writers have ignored; and it is free of the fanaticism which frequently surrounds monetary subjects. Glasner maintains that Hayek was wrong to suppose that private enterprise money would be introduced in rival inflation-proof units. This overlooked the cost of switching from one unit of account to another, and especially into unfamiliar units. Thus, even at high rates of inflation, private enterprise suppliers of money are more likely to compete by paying interest rates containing an inflation premium. Glasner's argument is that we already have competitive money but that the state still has a function in defining an inflation-proof monetary unit. What then would a moderate free banker, like Glasner, now advocate? He does not seem to regard the central bank monopoly of the note issue, or even the legal tender laws, as important enough to crusade against. Nor does he insist on the immediate abolition of all central banks. His big criticism is of compulsory state-guaranteed deposit insurance. The fate of the US Savings and Loans institutions, which had to be rescued at the cost of the American taxpayer, gives him all the ammunition he needs. Such guarantees create a problem of moral hazard, as banking institutions feel safer about engaging in reckless lending. The argument does not stop here. There is implicit, if imperfect, understanding that central banks will not allow commercial banks that are household names to fail. The lender of last resort function consists today of deliberately ill-defined guarantees in return for acceptance of detailed supervision. It is this that gives central bankers the air of very important people who need to be engaged, not just with monetary policy, but with the highest figures in private finance. Without going so far as to abolish these responsibilities overnight, New Zealand's proposals for a switch of emphasis from supervision to disclosure are surely the direction in which to go. An implication is that ordinary citizens and small businesses not wishing to take a view on financial markets would be well advised to place their ready cash in low-interest deposits backed by virtually risk-free assets, such as short-term government paper. Glasner departs from some other free bankers in accepting a role for the state not only in declaring a monetary unit but in supplying a currency denominated in that unit, which would preserve its real value. He joins the new and old fogies who hold that monetary stability can, in the end, only be guaranteed by convertibility into a real asset. The one asset he discusses in detail is gold. But unlike the pure gold bugs, he recognises that gold itself can fluctuate in real value, especially as so much of the world's gold stock is in the hands of central banks. He suggests base money should be convertible into gold at a variable rate designed to stabilise the general price level. And he therefore advocates a variable official gold price. If, for instance, the price of gold fails to keep up with a general inflation index, the holder of currency would receive a larger amount of gold on conversion. But if the price of gold rose by more than the general price index - that is a threat of deflation - then a smaller quantity of gold would be paid out for each currency unity exchanged. A first inspection suggests that central bank gold stocks might be enough to give the plan a chance. IMF estimates indicate that they are worth over Dollars 400bn. But, clearly, plans for an adjustable gold standard will need to be fully investigated before even being proposed, let alone adopted.</p>

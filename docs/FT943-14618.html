			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Turkish privatisation derailed again Turkey's privatisation effort has again been derailed by the courts. Mr Tezcan Yaramanci, the privatisation chief, publicly insists the programme will continue regardless but the foreign bankers and investors looking to buy Turkish assets believe the government of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has been thwarted by last week's constitutional court ruling invalidating its use of decree powers to push through the sell-off programme. The court has still not published its justification, but it is expected to centre on the argument that the powers given to the executive infringe on the constitutional authority of the elected parliament. Investors already have a number of misgivings - the lack of a regulatory framework, and the absence of a pricing regime that would allow a buyer freedom to manage and restructure the labour force, not to mention the unfavourable external environment where the devaluation of the lira has made it all but impossible to put a value on Turkish assets. The prospect that any sale could also be challenged by the country's highest court fills investors with horror. Opponents of privatisation say it is not simply a procedural issue. Even where privatisation legislation has been approved by parliament as in the case of the recently passed telecommunications privatisation bill, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, the deputy masterminding the court actions to oppose state sell-offs, warns he will challenge the law. Mr Soysal argues that providing telephone services is a public service. Privatising the telecoms company would in effect be a concession to a non-government body to provide those services. And under the constitution, the award of a concession has to be approved by the administrative court. Few bankers are probably aware of the Aktas case, where a former employee of the state electricity utility Tek took a suit for wrongful dismissal against Aktas, a private power distribution company, contracted by Tek to provide electricity to parts of Istanbul. The case was referred to the administrative court in Ankara, which ruled that Aktas's contract with Tek was invalid because the court's approval for the award of a concession had not been provided. The legal conundrum deepens in that under Turkey's foreign investment law foreigners cannot own concessions. The terms are not defined. However, for many Turks, the mere word awakens uncomfortable memories of the nineteenth century when concessions were awarded to foreign interests, as part of the capitulations when the Sultan provided foreigners with the rights to the empire's tobacco crop, for example, in lieu of its massive debts to European treasuries. Given such a powerful historical resonance, most observers believe that if challenged on this issue, the courts will take a nationalist line. In the Aktas case the administrative court took a very broad definition of what is a concession, as any activity undertaken by government, not just public services.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Two  Chinese-Americans were sentenced to prison by a local court  today for swindling, and forging official documents and seals.    This was the final verdict made by the higher people's court  of Hebei Province on a case involving 200 standby letters of  credit to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars and the Hengshui  Branch of Agricultural Bank of China (HBABC) last April.    Francisco Hung Moy was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment  and his property confiscated, followed by deportation. His  accomplice, Raymond C. Lee, was sentenced to 14 years'  imprisonment, also followed by deportation.    Both Moy and Lee are U.S. citizens. According to China's  criminal law, they will be deported after they have finished  their terms of imprisonment.    Zhao Jinrong, former director of the HBABC, was sentenced to  11 years' imprisonment with deprivation of his political rights  for two years for dereliction of duty and revealing state  secrets; Xu Zhiguo, the deputy director, was sentenced to 19  years' imprisonment with deprivation of his political rights for  three years for dereliction of duty and providing state secrets  to people from outside the Chinese mainland.    The Hengshui Intermediate People's Court of Hebei Province  conducted public trials of the two cases on April 18, 19, 22 and  23.    The court notified the U.S. Embassy in China of the date of  the trial beforehand, in accordance with a Sino-U.S. consular  treaty. Moy, Lee and the other defendants hired defense lawyers,  who notified the relatives of the accused of the date of the  trial beforehand.    After the sentence, Moy, Lee and the other defendants  appealed to the provincial higher court, which rejected the  appeal and upheld the verdict after an overall review of the  whole case.    Moy, the 45-year-old chairman of the "United Asia (Group)  Corporation", and Lee, 44, finance manager of the corporation,  contacted the HBABC in March 1993, and passed on to Zhao Jinrong  and Xu Zhiguo documents regarding introduction of foreign  capital into China.    During discussions, Moy and Lee claimed that their  corporation had many powerful business partners in many  countries, and that they would mortgage their own negotiable  securities, treasury bonds and assets abroad to get funds from  outside China. The standby letters of credit issued by the  HBABC was only to certify that the foreign capital had been used  in China.    On April 1 and 2, 1993 Zhao Jinrong signed with Moy and Lee  three agreements on "co-operatively introducing foreign capital  for investment and development projects" to the amount of five  billion, 1.6 billion and 3.4 billion U.S. dollars, respectively.    Lee produced for the HBABC a "proxy statement on opening  letters of credit" afterwards, claiming that the HBABC was not  obliged to pay back any principal or interest on the funds being  introduced into China nor did it bear any economic or legal  responsibility arising from the issuance of the letters of  credit.    In the Chinese translation of the English original of the  standby letter of credit lee gave to Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo,  he deliberately left out the words, "accompanied by a signed  statement by the beneficiary certifying that the amount of  drawing represents indebtedness due from United Asia (Group)  Corporation in connection with loan accommodation granted to  United Asia (Group) Corporation".    Zhao and Xu issued 200 irrevocable and transferable standby  letters of credit to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars on  April 5. Moy and Lee sent all the standby letters of credit  abroad the next day.    When some foreign companies inquired about the authenticity  and reliability of the standby letters of credit, Moy and Lee  cheated Zhao again into agreeing to a reply letter prepared by  them, by repeating their lie that the letters of credit caused  no risk to the bank.    On April 18, in the name of the fabricated "United National  Republic Bank", Moy and Lee made up a standby letter of credit  to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars as security guarantee  against the standby letters of credit issued by the HBABC.    Meanwhile, Moy and Lee signed a "loan agreement" with a  foreign company, which stipulated: The United Asia (Group)  Corporation would borrow 7.5 billion U.S. dollars from this  company and "the collateral shall be one-year standby letters of  credit drawn on the Agricultural Bank of China". It also made  it clear that united Asia group "does not have the  responsibility to repay the principal."    Besides, Moy and Lee illegally engraved the official seals  of  the "Agricultural Back of China, Hebei Branch" and forged the  confirmation letter for two standby letters of credit to the  amount of 1.68 billion U.S. dollars for some foreign swindlers  from February to April 1993.    The court held that the swindle caused severe social damage,  infringed upon the rights and interests of the Agricultural Bank  of China and seriously hampered China's financial and social  order.    At the same time, Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo fell for the  lies of the swindlers. Violating the provisions on management  of foreign currency, they exceeded their power and issued  standby letters of credit for huge amounts of money. They also  transgressed the laws and regulations on keeping secrets and  provided state secrets to people from outside the Chinese  mainland, which infringed on the interests of the country.    It was learned that after the crime had been committed,  judicial departments and other relevant administrations of China  took a series of measures. And with the co-operation of police  and financial institutions of other countries, no money was paid  out during the validity period of the 200 standby letters of  credit.</p>

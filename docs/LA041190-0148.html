			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AIR FORCE LOFTS ATLAS ROCKET WITH 3 SCIENCE SATELLITES  </P> <P> An Atlas-E rocket roared toward space today, carrying three small scientific  satellites on a $22-million mission aimed at improving military communications  and aiding navigation.  </P> <P> The 96-foot rocket lifted off the pad at Space Launch Complex-3 at 8 a.m., said  Maj. Tom Worsdale, an Air Force spokesman at this sprawling coastal military  base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It looked excellent," he said. "It's the smoothest launch I've seen in the  year I've been here. Everything went perfect."  </P> <P> Worsdale said the rocket flew south over the Pacific.  </P> <P> The three satellites, which contain four experiments, were propelled into a  460-mile polar orbit by the Atlas, which was topped by a Scout-Altair  upper-stage booster.  </P> <P> The mission is named P87-2 Stacksat. The Air Force has not explained the  meaning of P87-2, but Stacksat means that the satellites were stacked atop the  rocket for launch.  </P></p>

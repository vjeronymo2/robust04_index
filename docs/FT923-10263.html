			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: More farms in Malaysia hit by cocoa pest MORE MALAYSIAN cocoa farms are being invaded by cocoa pod borers, and industry officials say the pest is threatening to spread throughout Peninsular Malaysia, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. Pod borers have affected about 24,000 hectares of cocoa farms or 20 per cent of the peninsula's cocoa crop, Malaysian Cocoa Growers Council officials said yesterday. Malaysian officials earlier said 9,400 hectares of the farms had been hit, 8 per cent of Peninsular Malaysia's cocoa area. Malaysia is the world's fourth largest cocoa producer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 15 Jun (INA)--The Saudi regime has mobilized  military units near its common borders with Yemen, and placed  them on high alert as part of its efforts to support the  secessionists in Yemen.    Political sources in Sanaa revealed yesterday that the Saudi  regime has mobilized 150 tanks in the Maydi area bordering Yemen  [as received].    The sources added that the Saudi regime, which has  intensified its blatant interference in Yemeni domestic affairs  by supplying the secessionists with military hardware, which is  reaching them over land, by sea, and by air, has recently  recruited large groups of mercenaries to support the  secessionists besieged in Aden and al-Mukalla.    The Saudi regime is practicing repression against the  Yemenis  hailing from southern and eastern Yemeni governorates to make  them join training camps launched to prepare them for fighting  on the side of the secessionists in Yemen.    Political and diplomatic sources in the Yemeni capital,  Sanaa, said that Saudi Arabia has earmarked large amounts of  money for supporting the secessionists and tearing Yemeni unity  apart. Saudi Arabia believes that it can, through arms deals  and unlimited support for the secessionists, influence the  course of the fighting and settle it in favor of the  secessionists.    It is to be recalled that the Yemeni people believe that  Yemeni unity is a sacred accomplishment, because it was achieved  by their own free will. The Constitution of the Republic of  Yemen was endorsed by the Yemenis in a public referendum on 16  May 1990. This Constitution deems unity an eternal right for  the Yemeni people.    The history of the Yemeni-Saudi conflict dates back to 70  years ago, when the ruling Saudi family imposed the current  borders on the al-Mutawakkilite kingdom, which ruled Yemen then.    The Saudi regime's concern for thwarting Yemeni unity has  prompted it to launch an office managed and supervised by Saudi  Defense Minister Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. This office was  launched to carry out acts of sabotage in Yemen and tear its  unity asunder. Several billions of dollars have been earmarked  for this office.    The Yemeni political sources noted that the Yemeni political  crisis was engineered by the Saudis. This took place when 'Ai  Salim al-Bid, leader of the secessionists, visited Saudi Arabia  months after the realization of unity, and met with [King] Fahd,  the leader of the Saudi regime. During that visit, al-Bid  secretly promised Fahd to renege on unity in return for  financial and economic support.    The Saudi regime is using this plan to put pressure on the  Yemeni leadership, which has rejected the Saudi conditions for  demarcating the common borders. The Saudis want the current  borders to be the final borders.    Since 1934, Saudi Arabia has occupied three oil-rich Yemeni  areas; namely, Jizan, 'Asir, and Najran, the area of which  exceeds 300,000 square kilometers. Saudi Arabia has refused to  return these Yemeni territories to Yemen.</p>

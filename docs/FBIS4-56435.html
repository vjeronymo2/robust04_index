			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Although new political forces have emerged, not one  of them has been able to surpass expectations. According to  last week's poll, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]  continues to be the foremost political force, while the PRD  [Party of the Democratic Revolution] and the PAN [National  Action Party] remain in second and third place, respectively.    ESTE PAIS, a monthly magazine run by journalist and  political  expert Federico Reyes Heroles, published the results of the  latest weekly poll conducted in the cities of Tijuana, Mexico,  Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Puebla. Some 320 people over the age  of 18 were asked for whom were they going to vote. The results  of the poll are as follows: the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de  Leon received 34 percent of the votes; the PRD's Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas received about 15 percent, much lower than what he  received in mid-March; and the PAN's Diego Fernandez de Cevallos  received about 12 percent.    The ESTE PAIS poll showed that the number of undecided  voters  is about the same as the number of Zedillo's voters; that is,  undecided voters amount to about 33 percent. There could be  many surprises to come. Other candidates garnered less than 5  percent of the votes. As I say other candidates, I am talking  about the ill-named second-rate parties. In short, this is the  current political scene.</p>

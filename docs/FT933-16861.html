			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bahlsen to restructure business BAHLSEN, the German cakes, biscuits and snacks maker, is to restructure its business with the aim of increasing European market share, according to Mr Werner Michael Bahlsen, managing director. Split into 'sweet' and 'snacks' divisions, the company will focus on three brands, Bahlsen for sweet products, Leibniz in the semi-sweet mainstream biscuit market, and Bahlsen Picanterie for savoury snacks. The group, which saw pre-tax earnings drop by more than 50 per cent last year to DM56m (Dollars 33m) on sales of DM1.8bn, compared with DM1.86bn in 1991, is also aiming to extend its eastern European business further. Bolstered by the recent purchase of a Polish confectionery group, sales in the region should reach DM80m this year, Mr Bahlsen said yesterday. Last year's turnover had been reduced mainly by currency fluctuations, he added. He pointed out that 1991 earnings had been boosted to DM127m partly by the sale of the Gubor subsidiary. Volume sales rose to 278,000 tonnes, from 271,000, while the value of domestic deliveries fell from DM969m to DM929, Mr Bahlsen said. He blamed the decline on consumers' switching to cheaper brands and the impact of the hot summer on sales of chocolate products. Profits were also affected by increased promotional spending. Despite the setbacks, the group claims a 19 per cent share of the German packaged cakes market, 37 per cent in biscuits and almost 27 per cent in savoury snacks.</p>

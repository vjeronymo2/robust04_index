			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V. Pronin, member of the Political Council of the </F> Ukrainian Socialist Party: "The Congress of Socialists"]    [Text] The third congress of the Ukrainian Socialist Party  [SPU] has taken place. The 494 delegates that represented the  31,000-strong party force and 120,000 of its sympathizer from  all Ukrainian oblasts and the Crimea listened to a report about  activities of the SPU Political Council (by O. Bozhko) and a  report of the revision commission (by O. Mishchenko). Central  to the congress was the report "On the Party's Electoral  Platform and Its Objectives" delivered by O. Moroz, head of the  SPU Political Council. N. Vitrenko and O. Yushchyk presented  reports on the platform ideology.    All those who presented reports as well as deputies who took  the floor later rejected Rukh's propagandist suggestion,  dutifully publicized by the mass media, holding communists who  supposedly remain in power personally responsible for the  catastrophic situation in Ukraine. Former CPSU activists  crowding the leadership of all anti-communist parties -- Rukh  among them -- proved plain renegades. By approving the  Rukh-made program of building capitalism in Ukraine through  privatization and liberalization and allying themselves with  nationalistic patriots and criminal bourgeoise, which made  fabulous fortunes on this, reduced Ukraine to its present  condition.    They have no right to retain power and should surrender it  to  representatives of workers that were most affected by the  unheard-of looting of Ukraine.    The delegates to the congress spoke for the reinstatement of  soviets and the liquidation of presidential structures, and  demanded that the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets be called as  soon as possible, that people's and workers' control be  restored, and that a transition constitutional law be adopted  instead of the proposed draft constitution.    Major emphasis was placed on the party's tactics and  strategy  on the eve of legislative elections. The congress reconfirmed  that the SPU will approach the elections as an independent  political force with its own program and candidates, which does  not rule out the possibility of cooperation with like-minded  public organizations of a social orientation. A declaration on  this kind of cooperation was signed at the congress by  representatives of the SPU, the Ukrainian Communist Party [KPU],  and the Ukrainian Peasants' Party.    The congress approved the party's electoral campaign -- it  will be published in the nearest issue of the TOVARYSH [Comrade]  paper --- and adopted a resolution on the report by the  Political Council and the Revision Commission. The decision by  the SPU and other leftists parties to participate in the  upcoming elections provides an opportunity to get out of the  crisis by peaceful and legal means. The party's electoral slogan  will be: "For Social Justice, Power of the People, Lawfulness,  and People's Safety."    In an appeal to the Ukrainian people, the congress called on  electors not to make the mistakes from the previous elections,  when they allowed antisocial and antipeople forces sneak into  the Supreme Council, which vastly used funds from their foreign  sponsors. We have no right to make the same mistake. The SPU  appeals for all electors to go to the voting stations. A low  turnout would abet further pillaging of Ukraine.    The congress warned that an antipopular course of the  Ukrainian leadership raises protests of workers that might turn  into a social explosion. Coal miners, shipbuilders, defense  industry workers, etc. are standing up to defend their  interests. The SPU has repeatedly warned that the current  course leads to catastrophe. Before it is too late, the SPU  calls on the authorities to meet all demands of striking  committees, including those urging resignation of the president  and the government, and altering the course of reforms to the  advantage of the majority of the people.    The congress elected O. Moroz chairman of the Political  Council and O. Mishchenko head of the Revision Commission.    After the congress ended, the Political Council held a  meeting where O. Bozhko, I. Musiyenko, and V. Romashchenko were  elected its deputy chairmen, and the 15-strong Council's  Presidium was established.    The congress was attended by P. Symonenko, first secretary  of  the KPU Central Committee; M. Brokiavicius, the Lithuanian  Communist Party Central Committee; B. Bondarchuk, co-chairman of  the Socialist Party of Russian Workers Central Committee; K.  Nikolayev, deputy chairman of the SKP-CPSU [expansion unknown];  S. Dovhal, leader of the Ukrainian Peasants' Party;  representatives of Belarusian Socialists, "Working Ukraine," the  Ukrainian Communist Union, the Association of Working Women,  "For the Future of Our Children," the Ukrainian Leninist  Communist Youth Association, veteran and other organizations as  well as V. Hranycharov, member of the Executive Committee of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party, and Cuban and North Korean  ambassadors.</p>

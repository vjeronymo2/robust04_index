			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / US rebuffs Russian mediation on Kuwait The US yesterday rebuffed Russia's attempts to mediate between Iraq and the west and said it would continue to move more troops to Kuwait in response to the Iraqi threat. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said any consideration of lifting the economic sanctions against Iraq in exchange for Baghdad's promise to recognise Kuwait would be 'dangerously misguided' just one week after the build-up of Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border had 'again plunged the world into crisis.' And Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said just before he arrived in Kuwait yesterday that Iraq had not pulled its troops far enough back and warned that the US would take 'military action' if Iraq continued to entrench its Republican Guard at Nasiriyah, less than 100 miles from Kuwait. 'If they're digging in, we still have problems ahead of us .. We are talking about military action, but I won't go beyond that to describe what form of military action,' Mr Perry said. President Bill Clinton said yesterday at a White House ceremony to give President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti a send-off before he returns home today that he had ordered the deployment of troops and equipment to the region to continue. 'Let there be no mistake. The United States will not allow Iraq to threaten its neighbours,' Mr Clinton said. US officials have been dismissive of the joint statement from Iraq and Russia after a meeting in Baghdad between Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. In it, Iraq said it was ready to recognise Kuwait's sovereignty and the border mapped out by the United Nations if it received some assurance that the UN economic sanctions would be eased. Russia promised, in exchange, to support the lifting of a ban on Iraqi oil sales after a six-month test of the UN's monitoring of the Iraqi weapons programme. The US position remains that Iraq must comply unconditionally with the UN resolutions before any easing of the sanctions can be considered. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, adopted a similar line, insisting that the Iraqi statement was clearly inadequate. 'The statement is inadequate for two reasons,' he said. 'It appears to give Saddam Hussein a reward for the provocative actions of the last 10 days. That is clearly wrong. Even more important it does nothing to meet the concern which I met from all the Gulf states and very strongly from the King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, namely that they (the Iraqis) should not be allowed to renew this threat when the American and British soldiers have gone home. Unless something is done to prevent this then his mailed fist will still be over Kuwait and her neighbours.' Mr Hurd was speaking on the last stage of visit to the Middle East which has taken in Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. He added: 'We need to find some way of preventing the threat coming again. Work is now going on in New York and proceeding well. The Russians are involved in this. We are close to having a draft resolution from the Security Council which will begin to deal with that.' Mr Kozyrev stressed yesterday that Iraq would recognise the border and sovereignty of Kuwait with 'no conditions'. He added that keeping up sanctions against Baghdad would be an act of 'vengeance' if Iraq continues to comply with the UN weapons monitoring programme. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, is expected to clarify Iraq's position in New York next week, when he and Mr Kozyrev explain Russia's proposals to the Security Council.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Kohl coalition losing support Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition government has only a 0.5 per cent lead in popularity over the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens combined, an opinion poll showed yesterday. The findings of the poll by the Infas institute for ARD television have added relevance because the SPD and Greens are seeking an alliance in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. Any alliance of the two parties at national level would give them 44.5 per cent support, according to the poll, whereas the combined total for Mr Kohl's three-party government was 45 per cent. This government total was made up of the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, with 39.5 per cent, and the liberal Free Democrats with 5.5 per cent.</p>

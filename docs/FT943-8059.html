			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Arts: Miami 'Jewels' - Clement Crisp reviews Balanchine's Rubies, Diamonds and Emeralds / As the Edinburgh Festival gets into its stride, our critics review mainstream opera, theatre and ballet For the first time in too many years, the Edinburgh Festival is providing a strong, varied run of dance events. Gone, and I hope for good, those dim troupes, all title and no substance, that used to give the festival more the air of a torture chamber than a celebration. In what is the best of omens, Balanchine's works open the dance programme - not, alas, with New York City Ballet, but with a nonetheless happy substitute. Miami City Ballet is not quite ten years old. It was brought into being by Edward Villella, most dazzling, most ardent of NYCB's men, whose portrait is still the roles Balanchine made for him: the darting hero of Tarantella, the electric-muscled fire-cracker in Rubies, a mysterious Oberon, the powerful lover in Bugaku's duet. Villella's decision to root the Miami troupe in his own Balanchinian education has proved wise. As we saw a couple of years ago, when the company made its British debut in Northampton, Miami's dancers have already learned to speak Mr B's classic language as their own. There is an inevitable regional accent - we are in a province of the Roman Empire rather than Rome itself - but Balanchine's truths about musical responsiveness and dynamic clarity are respected. Indeed, one of the fascinations and rewards in watching MCB is to see how fresh Balanchine's ideas remain in performance, and how vivid are the Miami interpretations. The first of two Balanchine programmes this week was devoted to Jewels. It comprises three contrasted episodes, linked by no more than the thinnest of excuses: Claude Arpels, of van Cleef and Arpels, showed Balanchine some stunning gems, those emeralds, rubies, diamonds, which gave titles to otherwise unrelated plotless scenes. It is a marvel - Miami is the only company other than NYCB to dance it - whose message is no more (and no less) than the scores Balanchine chose. Emeralds uses Faure's Pelleas and Melisande and Shylock suites; Rubies is Stravinsky's Capriccio for piano and orchestra; Diamonds is set to the last four movements of Tchaikovsky's third symphony. Rubies' punchy, street-wise neo-classicism originally centred on Villella and Patricia MacBride. Diabolically fast, aggressive, it is very well done by the Miami cast, led by Maribel Modrono (beautifully clear and adorably sassy at every moment) and Marin Boieru (not quite rivalling Villella, but giving the dance the right pugnacious air), and Myrna Kamara, with an almost strident physicality that makes huge sense of the second woman's role. Neither Diamonds nor Emeralds received such authentic readings. Diamonds is Balanchine's homage to the Mariinsky of his youth, and more especially to the ballets of Ivanov (it has subliminal links with Swan Lake). It demands grandeur, which MCB does not yet possess, and is in no wayhelped by costumes that have a trumpery and ill-fitting air, and a set that rushes in at the last minute as if it had been hijacked from a down-town hairdresser's (gimcrack chandeliers and vulgar looking-glass). I admired very much Iliana Lopez in the exquisite adagio: she has a natural dignity, as well as a brave technique, that make entire sense of this homage to the ballerinas of Balanchine's youth. You believe in her as you do in the dances she shows you. Emeralds is the most subtle of these jewels (as the stones themselves are), and it is to MCB's credit that it has such gentle lustre. Its central role is by turns witty and elegiac - it was created for that most musical dancer, Violette Verdy - and Sally Ann Isaacks was very delightful in it. (Verdy's solo, to the Spinning song from Pelleas, is a tiny marvel which Miss Isaacks did enchantingly). The ballet ends with one of Balanchine's daring, simple conceits: as the music for Melisande's death comes to its close, three male dancers are left on stage, kneeling, one arm outstretched. That is all. That is everything. (And a pox on whoever brought the curtain down five seconds too soon on Wednesday night. The exquisite image was diminished). But Jewels made a fine start to the Festival for dance-lovers, and Miami City Ballet merits all our gratitude. The programme-notes to repertory, however, do not: they are altogether too garrulous and inexact. Miami City Ballet's appearance is sponsored by Hertz.</p>

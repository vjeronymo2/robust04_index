			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vilma Estrada; from the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] President Violeta Chamorro, upon returning from El  Salvador, reported that high-ranking U.S. Government officials  cite Nicaragua as an example of democratic transition in the  Central American region. She flew to San Salvador to attend the  inauguration of President Armando Calderon Sol. President  Violeta Chamorro said she met with Strobe Talbott, U.S. under  secretary of state, and Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of  state for inter-American affairs. The U.S. officials requested  her support for the U.S. initiatives at the United Nations and  OAS directed at restoring democracy in Haiti, because Nicaragua  is an example of democracy. This opinion is shared by the other  officials with whom she met during her visit.    [Begin Chamorro recording] Everyone looks positively at  Nicaragua and its people. I held interviews with  representatives of the United States, China, Spain, and many  other countries. All of them said: Dona Violeta, we  congratulate you for your good administration. I have heard  many expressions of support and received many ovations, which I  sincerely believe are for the Nicaraguan people. [end recording]    When asked about the U.S. request for support in receiving  Haitian refugees, she said that her colleagues in the region are  studying the situation and will respond during the December  Summit of the Americas in Miami.    [Begin Chamorro recording] I believe that working together  or alone to find well-being for Haiti is worthwhile. I remember  perfectly well when members of the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front came and asked me: What can we do, Dona  Violeta, to start talks in El Salvador and find peace there? I  told them that the best way was to try, and now they have peace.  That is what they told me. [end recording]</p>

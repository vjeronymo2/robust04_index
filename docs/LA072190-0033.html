			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TUMOR-STRICKEN ATWATER NAMES A GOP 'DESIGNATED SPOKESMAN'  </P> <P> Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater on Friday named veteran GOP political  consultant Charles Black to serve as his "designated spokesman" while Atwater  continues his struggle against a brain tumor.  </P> <P> It was the first official recognition by party officials of a problem that many  Republicans have discussed privately -- that the GOP has been handicapped by  Atwater's prolonged absence.  </P> <P> The announcement was made as President Bush, whose 1988 campaign was managed by  Atwater, is being buffeted by the two most serious political storms of his  White House tenure -- the breaking of his pledge not to raise taxes and the  escalating cost of the savings and loans scandal.  </P> <P> Some Republicans have speculated that, had Atwater been active, he would have  devised a more graceful way for the President to explain his recent shift on  tax policy and would have been more aggressive in responding to Democratic  criticism on the savings and loan issue.  </P> <P> Black's appointment was made a week after the semiannual meeting of the  Republican National Committee in Chicago.  </P> <P> In his statement announcing the appointment, Atwater praised the national  committee staff for its performance during the Chicago meeting, saying that it  had "demonstrated leadership aimed at supporting our President and our party  and getting the facts out to the American people through strong spokesmen."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Atwater said the meeting "made clear to me the need to have the  strongest possible spokesmen available to carry our message to the public on a  day-to-day basis."  </P> <P> After describing Black "as my best friend and political eyes and ears," Atwater  said: "I've now asked him also to be my mouthpiece, and Charles has unselfishly  accepted."  </P> <P> The 42-year-old Black, like Atwater, has strong ties to Republican  conservatives.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A test launching of the Arrow missile took place  this morning. The target missile was fired at approximately  1100 [0900 GMT] but during the countdown, there was a  malfunctioning in the ground system which prevented the  launching of the intercepting missile.    Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that  the technical problem had nothing to with either the target or  intercepting missiles. The date of the next launching will be  decided after the reason for the problem is located.</p>

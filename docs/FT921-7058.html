			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 45.5m flotation for CSI's building side CANNON STREET Investments yesterday announced the Pounds 45.5m flotation of its Avonside building arm in a move which will halve its borrowings. The mini-conglomerate, valued at less than Pounds 30m after its shares collapsed last year following a profits warning, will receive all of the flotation proceeds. The money is being raised half by the placing of shares, completed yesterday, and half from the offer for sale of shares to the public at 106p. Mr Robin Binks, chief executive, said: 'The sale will enable us to produce a better balance sheet. While we will still have gearing of about 100 per cent, it will be against a conservative and prudently stated balance sheet.' CSI last month had borrowings of Pounds 97m. Although the group's shares rose 4p to close at 26p yesterday, commentators questioned the wisdom of selling a housebuilding company at a time when the property market was experiencing one its worst downturns. Mr Robert Donald, an analyst at County NatWest, said: 'For any company to float a housebuilding business this side of the election must either be bearish about housing post-election or very keen for cash. This is not the best time to sell this type of business.' Mr Christopher Glynn, non-executive chairman of Avonside, concurred that it was a bad time to sell a housebuilding business but a great time to buy. 'If it was not for the blow-out we have had in the sector, we would not have to float at this price.' Avonside, which has been profitable over the past five years, operates in the north of England, North Wales and Scotland. Mr Glynn said that unit sales and house prices in these areas were expected to remain static, although he had glimpsed evidence of a slight upturn, particularly in North Wales. Three quarters of Avonside's land was surveyed before the decision to float. In the light of the valuation Mr Glynn said that the group was confident that there would be no need for any write-down in the value of its land. In 1991 Avonside's turnover increased to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds 45.7m) while profits before tax and exceptionals were Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.9m). Only one third of the sales were related to housebuilding; the rest came from building services such as plumbing and heating. The pro forma balance sheet for last year shows net assets of Pounds 21.4m and net cash.</p>

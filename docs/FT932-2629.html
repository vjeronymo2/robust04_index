			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: CIA expands into Italy with Blufin stake Correction (published 18th June 1993) appended to this article. CIA GROUP, the London-based media buying and planning group, has expanded into Italy via a stake in Blufin, parent company of the Medianetwork group of companies. The USM-quoted group is buying a 5 per cent stake in Blufin, for L2.5bn cash (Pounds 1.1m) and 400,000 shares from Blugroup, the privately-owned Italian company. CIA regards the move as essential to help it take advantage of the growing pan-Europeanisation of media buying and planning. The Medianetwork group includes Unilever, Quaker and Electrolux, among its clients. CORRECTION CIA, the media-buying group, has agreed to buy a 45 per cent stake in Blufin of Italy and not 5 per cent as reported yesterday.</p>

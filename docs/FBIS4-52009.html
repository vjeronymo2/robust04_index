			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yu Kun-ha] </F>   [Text] John Toppel, president of Samsung Hewlett-Packard  Co. (SHP), is getting increasingly impatient these days with the  Seoul government's ban on laser printer imports. Toppel feels  that it is time the Korean government lifted the ban as it is  staging a campaign to make the nation "the world's most  convenient place to do business in."    "I hear that the government is seeking to globalize its  economy. Then, it should begin with allowing foreign firms  operating in Korea to compete with local firms on an equal  footing," Toppel asserted. The ban, according to Toppel, is  forcing SHP to compete with local firms "with its hands tied."    Toppel's firm, a 10-year-old joint venture between Samsung  Electronics and Hewlett-Packard (HP) of the United States, is in  a dominant position in the domestic printer market. Backed by  HP, the world's unrivaled printer powerhouse, SHP enjoys a more  than 40 percent share of the total domestic demand valued at  about $360 million last year. SHP's market share is expected to  shoot up further as demand is rapidly shifting from  old-fashioned dot matrix printers to more sophisticated ink-jet  products, currently the firm's mainstay.    What makes Toppel uncomfortable, however, is the fact that a  local printer maker, Samsung Electronics, has recently launched  an attack against its ink-jet printers with self-developed laser  printers. Samsung has recently announced a 42 percent price cut  on its low-end laser model, making it clear that its target is  ink-jet printers, which are mostly imported from abroad.    Last year, Samsung exported some 100,000 units of the model,  a fact indicating that the firm has secured some competitiveness  in the low-end segment of the world laser printer market. "Under  this situation, it is unfair that we still cannot compete with  Samsung with the same laser printers, not ink-jet printers,"  Toppel said.    Toppel's point cannot be refuted. But to government  officials, policy priority still lies not with creating an  environment for equal competition but with fostering the  domestic laser printer industry. Officials at the Ministry of  Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) said that they still have no  plan to open the laser printer market. "We think the need still  exists for us to foster the domestic laser printer industry," a  MOTIE official said, adding that as laser printer technology is  important, the import ban will stay for a "considerably long"  period of time.    Toppel argued that Korea will have more to gain than lose by  opening the market. For one thing, it will stimulate efforts on  the part of Korean printer makers to upgrade their technology  and sharpen competitiveness.    At the moment, Samsung is the only domestic firm which is  mass producing laser printers. Although Samsung may be  competitive in the low-end segment, it is still not in fighting  shape in the high-end market. The same is true of Goldstar Co.  which, following Samsung, is seeking to explore overseas  markets. According to company officials, they are ready to  introduce a low-end laser printer model in the latter half of  this year for both domestic and foreign markets.    The new model, they said, will be competitive in the  international market in terms of both price and quality. But  they admitted that other models they are producing now are not  as competitive as the planned new one. This may imply that it is  still too early for the government to open the laser printer  market entirely. It may instead open the market on a  step-by-step basis, which will not only stimulate catch-up  efforts by domestic products but also diffuse pressure for  market opening from foreign firms.    Toppel expects the market will open in due course. At the  same time, he wants to see the import ban lifted soon. But the  SHP president emphasized that he will not loudly call for a  removal of the ban. SHP, he noted, has been very cooperative  with the Korean government while being a respectable corporate  citizen in the Korean business community.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Montedison close to stake sale MONTEDISON, the lossmaking Italian chemicals and agro-industrial group controlled by Ferruzzi, yesterday confirmed it was in the final phase of talks to sell an important stake in its profitable Erbamont pharmaceuticals subsidiary. The likely buyer is Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, which was rumoured to have been in talks on buying a stake last year. Montedison gave no indication of the size of the stake for sale or the potential price. However, analysts believe the group, which is struggling to reduce its large debts by disposing of non-core activities, will give up majority control. Montedison said the aim was to create one of Europe's biggest pharmaceuticals companies. Erbamont controls Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the leading Italian producer of prescription drugs. The group, which had sales of about L1,600bn (Dollars 1.1bn) and operating profits of about L250bn last year, is active in the US through its Adria Laboritories subsidiary. Procordia's pharmaceuticals activities are conducted through its Kabi-Pharmacia arm. The operation, which specialises in drugs for growth problems, eye surgery and patient feeding problems, has annual sales of about L2,600bn. Erbamont controls Antibioticos, a smaller bulk pharmaceuticals business, with turnover of about L175bn, which is not expected to be included in the transaction. In spite of its profitable agro-industrial and energy businesses, Montedison plunged into loss in the first half of last year as a result of the downturn in the world chemicals business and heavy interest payments on its debts. Apart from the sale proceeds, divesting a majority stake in Erbamont would allow the group to take about L1,000bn in Erbamont debt off its balance sheet.</p>

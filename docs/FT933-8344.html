			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Germany urged ERM nations to delay rate cuts GERMANY asked its European Community partners not to cut interest rates precipitately when the rules of the European exchange rate mechanism were changed this month, possibly explaining why interest rates in ERM countries have hardly fallen since the currency crisis. According to details that emerged yesterday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president and president designate, made the request in the early hours of Monday, August 2 after the EC's finance ministers and central bank governors agreed to widen the ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent. Mr Tietmeyer's request, which one European monetary official described yesterday as a recommendation to the ERM crisis meeting in Brussels, provides one reason for the failure of interest rates to decline rapidly among Germany's ERM partners from the high levels established to protect the 'old ERM' with its 2.25 per cent and 6 per cent fluctuation margins from currency speculation. Some officials had expected the German request to receive a cool response. But with the exception of Spain, the ERM countries have shown no hurry to exploit the wider fluctuation bands and cut short-term interest rates with the aim of boosting growth in their economies. Further details of the early August crisis meeting to emerge appeared to put an end to speculation that Germany and France might forge ahead with an economic and monetary union of ERM 'core countries' ahead of the Maastricht treaty timetable. This envisages European monetary union towards the end of this decade. When a Portuguese delegate suggested that the two logical solutions to the ERM crisis were suspension of the system or immediate monetary union of the French franc and the D-Mark, Mr Gert Haller, the newly appointed state secretary in the German finance ministry, said he hoped the proposal of immediate Franco-German monetary union was meant 'as a joke'. According to European monetary officials, towards the end of the meeting, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, came out on the side of the majority of ERM ministers who rejected a generalised floating of EC currencies in favour of the greatly widened bands. Although the chancellor later made clear Britain had no plans to rejoin the ERM, which it left last September, Mr Clarke backed Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC commissioner for monetary affairs, in saying that a generalised float was a bad solution for the EC.

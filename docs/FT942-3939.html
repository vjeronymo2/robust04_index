			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Gaidar founds party Mr Yegor Gaidar, former deputy prime minister and engineer of Russia's market reforms, yesterday founded a party called Democratic Choice of Russia which he promised would be the most disciplined of liberal parties to compete in elections scheduled for 1996, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. The party is being built on the rump of last December's ill-fated electoral alliance known as Russia's Choice, which united a variety of anti-Communist parties and movements but did badly in the elections despite support from the state-owned media. Mr Gaidar said the party, which would guarantee market reforms, would have to be disciplined 'otherwise our struggle with conservative forces will recall a battle between cavalry and an armoured division'.</p>

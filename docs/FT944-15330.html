			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Unsold mines to be sealed for good Two South Yorkshire coal mines which failed to attract bids in the government's recent auction of British Coal assets are to be sealed permanently. Goldthorpe Colliery near Doncaster and Kiveton Colliery near Sheffield were already on 'care and maintenance' - work had ceased, but they were being kept open for a new owner. Site clearance will take up to six months.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Little progress on US-Japan car deal JAPANESE and US car makers have made little progress in implementing the agreement to boost US car imports into Japan reached when President George Bush visited Japan in January. Toyota said yesterday it was still discussing with General Motors of the US a plan for Toyota to import 5,000 more GM cars a year. The deal between the two companies was the second largest component in an agreement in which five Japanese manufacturers agreed to import an additional 20,000 US cars by 1994. The agreement, designed to ease trade frictions, was signed by US car industry executives who accompanied Mr Bush and was one of the most controversial aspects of his visit. However, there were signs yesterday of a renewal of trade friction over cars after a lull since the start of the year. The Japanese Automobile Association accused the US Congress of erecting a non-tariff barrier against cars made at factories owned by foreign manufacturers by attaching labels which identify foreign-made components. According to the Japanese Automobile Importers Association, car imports from the US in the first nine months of the year were up just 2,713 to 25,730. Most of this reflected a surge in sales of the US version of Honda's Accord, not covered by the January agreement. Sales of GM cars fell from 7,146 to 7,041 in the first nine months; Ford's rose 48 to 2,419 and Chrysler's 50 to 1,171. Toyota, Honda and Nissan said they still planned to more than double purchases of US-made components by 1994.</p>

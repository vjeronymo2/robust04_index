			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["HH"-signed report: "SPD: Waigel Has Lost Perspective"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- The coalition and the opposition yesterday  accused each other of incompetence in financial policy. For  Joachim Poss, financial policy spokesman of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Bundestag group, it is obvious  that Finance Minister Theo Waigel "has completely lost the  necessary perspective in tax and financial policy." This seems  to have also been realized by the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] group, which, according to  newspaper reports, is working on a concept that envisages higher  excise and property taxes, as well as the introduction of a  road-use fee. In contrast, Waigel has stressed that there will  not be any further tax increases apart from the reintroduction  of the solidarity surcharge in 1995. The Finance Ministry and  the CDU/CSU group have not commented on Schaeuble's plans.    Waigel criticized the SPD by saying that its government  program would hurt medium-sized industry, even though it wants  to address "much more strongly" the "justified concerns" of  medium-sized industry. This applies not only to the 10-percent  supplementary tax, no matter whether it starts at a taxable  income of 56,000 German marks [DM], DM50,000, or less, but also  to the restriction intended by the SPD for the tax reduction for  conversions and sale of business (Article 34 of the Income Tax  Law), which would lead to a wave of sale and concentration in  medium-sized industry. The higher taxes on profits from the  sale of shares in corporations, which the SPD demands, would  also lead to a wave of concentration at the cost of medium-sized  industry.    The disagreement, which was criticized by Poss, is found not  only in the coalition but also in the SPD. In contrast to SPD  Bundestag Group Chairwoman Anke Fuchs, Poss wants to stick to  the solidarity surcharge for 1995, he told DIE WELT. Concerning  the tax exemption of the subsistence minimum, which has been  demanded by the Constitutional Court, he is working out a model  in a work group. Poss understands the constitutional assignment  in such a way that the exemption must be implemented in one step  in 1996 -- unless Waigel can use the ruling to prove that a  step-by-step solution is permitted.    From 1991 to 1995, additional burdens resulting from taxes  (annual amount) add up to DM68.6 billion and from social  security contributions to DM31.9 billion. This does not include  the contributions for nursing care insurance. This is stated in  a response by the Finance Ministry to SPD Deputy Helmut  Wieczorek. It is surprising that the solidarity surcharge,  which will come into effect in 1995 and which Waigel recently  calculated at DM28 billion, is now estimated at only DM26  billion. The solidarity surcharge, which was levied from  mid-1991 to mid-1992, on the other hand, yielded DM28.2 billion.</p>

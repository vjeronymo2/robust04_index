			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ernesto Zedillo, Institutional Revolutionary </F> Party, PRI, presidential candidate, on 17 June; place not given  -- recorded]    [Text] The peace commissioner's resignation is a personal  decision. By relinquishing the responsibility invested in him by  the president of the republic, Camacho Solis made the best  possible decision both for him and the country. I expressed my  position on the conflict in that state in San Cristobal de las  Casas on 21 April. I reiterate it today and quote what I said at  the time. Just like the rest of Mexicans, I am persuaded that  peace in Chiapas must be based on dialogue, understanding,  well-intentioned negotiations, and the best possible positive  attitude. Peace should be attained through agreements that meet  the just demands of the dispossessed, always respecting the  rights of those who obey the law.    Once again, all of my party's militant members and I call  for  the reopening, as soon as possible, of channels of negotiation  and understanding that make possible a permanent and just peace  for everyone. Tolerance and the broadest possible sense of  justice for all sides involved should prevail in the peace  process. I hereby reaffirm my full support for the efforts that  President Carlos Salinas has been making for a peaceful solution.    As for the peace commissioner's decision to resign, a  decision that he links with my dissatisfaction over the EZLN's  [Zapatist National Liberation Army] rejection of the agreement  derived from the talks that concluded in San Cristobal de las  Casas on 2 March, I have this to say:    1. My remarks at the time reveal the opinions of many  Mexicans who had expected a final solution as the result of the  San Cristobal talks.    2. The idea that peace was at hand was bolstered by the  peace  commissioner himself on 2 March, when he said this. Quote: The  formula for peace has been defined. The terms for the peace  agreements and cease-fire have been clearly established. A  serious and respectful dialogue, with specific purposes, has  been held, and there has been a call for in-depth changes in  Chiapas. I am happy that this conflict was resolved in Mexico by  Mexicans in a very short time. In addition, the EZLN's demands  have received answers.    3. It is those in the EZLN themselves who rejected the  proposal stemming from the San Cristobal talks and, therefore,  undermined the commissioner's efforts. I am confident that, in  response to the desire, shared by all Mexicans, for a just  solution, particularly for those who live in a situation of  misery and neglect, the EZLN will resume talks with the  government to find solutions leading to permanent peace.    4. In the light of the above, it is remarkable that the  peace  commissioner attempts to blame my demand for a permanent and  just peace for his resignation from a responsibility assigned to  him. In addition, I have learned that before the EZLN's  announcement and my own remarks, the peace commissioner had  already commented on his decision to relinquish his post and  devote himself to other activities. I hereby affirm that the  efforts for peace must go on. This is a matter that concerns all  Mexicans, not only one person or group. Given the conciliatory  disposition of the government and Mexican society in general,  the peace commissioner's resignation should not serve as an  excuse for acts of violence. Finally, again I express my  willingness, as well as that of my party, to contribute to any  effort that the government and the EZLN deem necessary to  strengthen the permanent peace process and ensure the  fulfillment of any agreement signed by the sides involved.  Thanks.</p>

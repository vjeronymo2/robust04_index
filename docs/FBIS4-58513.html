			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "End of a Round; Beginning of a Phase"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday's signing of the agreement to implement  the first stage of the Palestinian transitional self rule  constitutes the end of a long round of hard negotiations,  conducted over seven months in more than one capital and  interspersed with bloody, tragic events. This fact increases  the importance of the agreement and raises the stakes on it.    When the implementation of this agreement starts today, the  Middle East crisis is expected to enter a new and important  turning point, which will in the end lead to the achievement of  a just and comprehensive peace and the Palestinian people's  regaining their legitimate national rights, including their  right to full independence and the building of their state on  the soil of their homeland, Palestine.    The achievement of that aspired-for goal hinges on two basic  conditions. First, Israel must remain committed to it pledges.  It must also remain sincere in its peace intentions, especially  when moving to the next phase in the self-rule plan. Second,  the Palestinian national authority must know how to use this  opportunity to prove that the Palestinians are worthy of their  right to freedom and independence.    At any rate, and regardless of the importance of the step  that is expected to start today -- and it is an important step  indeed -- the desired peace in this part of the world will  remain incomplete and under threat unless it is completed on the  other fronts of the conflict and unless a parallel progress is  made on all the Arab-Israeli tracks, that is, until the  achievement of the objectives on the basis of which the Madrid  agreement was convened 30 months ago.    We hope the agreement to implement self rule is the start of  a new phase in the march of the Palestinian people toward the  achievement of their legitimate goals and a step that will be  followed by other steps on the path of achieving an Israeli  withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories . We also  urge the peace process cosponsors to take advantage of the  momentum generated by this agreement to work on achieving  parallel progress on all tracks of negotiations and a just and  comprehensive peace that can be accepted and protected by future  generations.</p>

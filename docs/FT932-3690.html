			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Markets: Why Sir Ernest can smile - The Bottom Line SIR Ernest Harrison, with much glee, this week firmly put the doubting Thomases back in their place. Chubb Security, Vodafone and Racal Electronics  -the three companies he chairs after the last five years' demergers - all reported sharply higher profits for the year to March 1993. Basking in the applause, Sir Ernest allowed himself to muse about the possibility that Chubb - capitalised at Pounds 865m - is not that far from the FT-SE 100 index. If Chubb reached this pinnacle Sir Ernest would join a select club who chair two Footsie companies built substantially by themselves. How plausible is this for Chubb? And what should shareholders with stakes in all three companies expect now, however thrilled they are by what Sir Ernest has achieved for them to date? Vodafone, which reported profits of Pounds 322.5m up from Pounds 272m, presents the clearest picture. A glimpse of the company's dominance of the UK cellular telephone operator, market can be gleaned from its cash flow. At 58 per cent of turnover, Vodafone's cash generating ability is matched by few companies. Operating margins of 46 per cent give an equally revealing snapshot of how its competitors have consistently failed to mount effective competition. What is more, as economic recovery emerges, there seems to be scope for further growth in its market and surprisingly little sensitivity about the price subscribers are prepared to pay. Racal Electronics - profits up from Pounds 16m to Pounds 52m - presents a more mixed picture, as might be expected from a company once described by Sir Ernest as the 'rump' of the Racal businesses. At the operating level, almost all the improvement in profits last year emerged from a sharp increase in margin in the Data Communications division, the largest division. Data communications produced margins of only 3.4 per cent on sales of Pounds 371m - including profits from high margin data network services. Irrespective of how competitive this market is - and like the personal computer market it is fiercely so - there is clearly scope for more improvement here. Elsewhere, Redac, the computer-aided design business which increased losses last year, and should be turned around ready for disposal. The potential of the other business is further down the track. The UK government is about to award the Bowman communications contract for the British army, which would be profitable to Racal later this decade; and the group has won some exciting orders in its avionics division to put telephones in aircraft. What is most encouraging for shareholders is that Racal has started to squeeze large quantities of cash out of what was a fairly relaxed organisation before demerger. On balance, Racal may not be the best recovery story around but the management has a lot to play with. Chubb Security's 64 per cent profits increase to Pounds 62m, has been a story of cost cutting and margin improvement - another reminder to shareholders how little the non-Vodafone businesses attracted management attention in the past. David Peacock, new chief executive, is setting that right and has stripped out working capital as well as enhancing margins. There is more room for margin improvement - although the easy bit has obviously been done. Once the business has been licked back into shape, the secret will be whether the electronic security side of the business can be grown. As the company points out, rising crime should mean Chubb is selling into a growing market but its own sales have yet to demonstrate this growth. Chubb has always been cash generative - in the Racal family it took over the role of banker to the group once Vodafone floated. But growing electronic security requires a heavy capital spend in the initial phase. At the moment Chubb appears to have a relatively modest capital expenditure. If Sir Ernest is to fulfil the dream of making Chubb a Footsie company, investment may need to increase and the group may need to move further into the domestic market.</p>

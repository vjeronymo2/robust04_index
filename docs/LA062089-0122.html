			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPENSE ACCOUNT LIVING: CHARGE!  </P> <P> There were sympathetic snickers in some parts of town after City Controller  Rick Tuttle scolded Department of Water and Power officials who had tried to  dine elegantly on city expense accounts.  </P> <P> "Outrageous," Tuttle huffed about a $1,013 lunch for 25. "Unreasonable," he  raged recently, denying payment of an $879 dinner tab for 12.  </P> <P> But Jeff Wald, for one, wasn't angry. "I laughed when I read about the DWP,"  says the president of television and management at Barris-Guber-Peters. "Those  Power Department guys should have had a power lunch. Someplace like Morton's or  Spago, instead of the Jonathan Club. They didn't show any power at all."  </P> <P> Wald is one of many who understand that expense account lunches -- and dinners  and wardrobes and laundry and limos -- are the oil that greases much of Los  Angeles life. Without T&amp;E tabs (travel and entertainment accounts), many of  the city's seemingly rich would live just as modestly as the rest of us. And  let those who have never taken home a pencil or made a personal phone call from  the office cast the first stone.  </P> <P> Wald remembers bygone days when expense accounts paid for chartered yachts on  which he held power meals. But now, "this is a publicly owned company and we  don't spend stockholders' money frivolously," he adds. "Nobody here even flies  first class -- I exclude myself, of course."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Multiple Meals  </P> <P> Producer Rob Cohen says most filmland types wouldn't relate to Tuttle's ire.  "Many executives double and triple-book their meals," he explains. "They have  multiple breakfasts, lunches and dinners. They go to the Polo Lounge, then they  take a 7:30 and a 9:30 dinner, all of which they pay for and put on their  expense accounts."  </P> <P> Why eat thrice in one night? "It's partly a sense of grandiosity, and partly a  way to pack more business into the day in a context in which the parent company  pays for it," he says.  </P> <P> Cohen, who produced "Witches of Eastwick" and is working on "Bird on a Wire"  with Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson, thinks Los Angeles' expense-account phenomenon  may never fade.  </P> <P> "Hollywood," he says, "is a town of illusion, and one of the greatest illusions  of all is the glamorous public life that people lead. Almost all of that is  paid for by studios and expense accounts."  </P> <P> There's a positive side to it, he claims. Expense account meals are "a kind of  upper-class welfare system in which people who are doing well take people who  are not doing well out to a public place" where everyone who sees them thinks  they're all doing well.  </P> <P> So much for glamour folks whose sense of ethics might be affected by the need  to keep their images afloat. But what about more righteous types, like  journalists, who sometimes risk their lives to bring America the news?  </P> <P> "They can be the worst," Peter Greenberg says with a laugh. Greenberg, a Los  Angeles-based syndicated columnist, says expensive meals are of minor interest  compared to some of the tall tabs submitted by foreign reporters at a news  magazine where he once worked. A favorite story, he says, concerns a  correspondent who did such good work that no one questioned his huge expense  reports.  </P> <P> "One night, this guy made a pretty bad mistake. He drank heavily, got into his  Lancia and hit a local gendarme on the way home," Greenberg says. "Magazine  execs rescued him from jail and almost fired him on the spot -- not because he  drank and hit a policeman, but because they couldn't figure out how he could  afford a Lancia unless it was from padding his expense account."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Large Taxi Bill  </P> <P> Greenberg also likes the absurd tale of the magazine reporter who did a story  on "a day in the life of an aircraft carrier," then submitted a $435 taxi bill.  "Why did he use taxis on that assignment?" the accountants asked. "Do you know  how immense an airline carrier is?" the reporter shot back. Greenberg says the  reporter got paid, in appreciation for his wit.  </P> <P> The Japanese contingent in Los Angeles doesn't like to do deals over meals.  They prefer to play golf while getting business done, says Kiku Kurahashi of A.  T. Cosmo and Co., a local firm that makes commercials for Japanese clients.  </P> <P> "Playing golf with colleagues is one of the most elitist things to do" among  the Japanese, she says, adding that the "ultimate" treat for visiting Japanese  tycoons is "to be taken to a great golf course at a prestigious country club."  </P> <P> Kurahashi says Los Angeles affiliates of Japanese-based firms often maintain  corporate memberships at golf clubs here, so business visitors can head  straight for the links. Expense account business gifts also tend to focus on  golf equipment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cars in the Budget  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, tales are legion of high-priced cars charged to corporate  expense accounts, although those who tell the stories don't want to be quoted  and can't prove they're true. Apocryphal or not, there is, for example, one  story circulating about eight BMWs allegedly purchased for one film; the cars  disappeared -- driven home, the story goes, by members of the staff.  </P> <P> Clothing also seems a big expense-account indulgence. Rick Pallack, a Sherman  Oaks menswear shop owner, says some networks provide expense account clothes  budgets for news anchors and other celebrities who "have to look good." Other  top shopkeepers in town say sales of high-ticket fashions would drop  precipitously if expense account spending were seriously curtailed. This,  though most corporate employees -- even the top dogs -- technically are not  permitted to put clothing on expense accounts. "If they see a blouse they like,  they buy it and then cover the cost by faking one or two high-price lunches on  their next expense account," one retailer says.  </P> <P> One of the most publicized examples of a dispute over expense accounts and  clothing occurred in 1981. Dennis Stanfill, then chairman of Twentieth Century  Fox, accused Fox Television chairman Harris Katleman of submitting restaurant  expenses supported by invoices, which, in fact, represented charges at a Paris  clothing store. That problem was resolved when Marvin Davis took over the  studio, where Katleman is now president of television production.  </P> <P> In some instances, employees feel entitled to a particular purchase, even if  the company refuses to pay. A classic case, cited by Wald, involves a music  company executive who lost his favorite $150 hat at a concert. He bought a new  hat, charged the company by expense account but was refused reimbursement.  </P> <P> "Three times he tried and was rejected," Wald recalls. "The fourth time, he  inflated his expense report with $150 worth of allowable items and wrote a note  saying 'You find the hat.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Business Watch  </P> <P> In 1986, the salaried president of the nonprofit Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn.  made what she called an "error in judgment" by charging a $5,000 Rolex watch on  a credit card provided to her strictly for business use. That same year, San  Francisco's top welfare official, on an annual salary of $93,000, resigned  after charging $2,141 in restaurant bills to a $4,000 city fund intended to  help feed the poor.  </P> <P> Though some cases of expense account abuse are clear, lines between right and  wrong, between chicanery and crime, tend to blur in many discussions of their  use.  </P> <P> But ethics, defined by Webster as "standards of conduct and moral judgment," is  just beginning to be taught at business schools. And Business Ethics only  recently became a mandatory course for students at Harvard's graduate school of  business.  </P> <P> Meantime, Tuttle's office continues to set a "reasonable and prudent" standard  for employees' expense account dinners by "calling a number of places"  considered appropriate. Like The Velvet Turtle, where Tuttle reports a meal can  be purchased for $5.95 to $13.95.  </P></p>

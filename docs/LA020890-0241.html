			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PAST NBC CHIEF JOINS LUCKY DUCK  </P> <P> Former NBC News President Reuven Frank has joined Linda Ellerbee's Lucky Duck  Productions as consulting producer. He will help develop nonfiction programming  for networks, syndication, public television and cable.  </P> <P> Ellerbee formed Lucky Duck in 1987 after leaving ABC News where her weekly "Our  World" drew critical praise but poor ratings on Thursday nights against NBC's  "The Cosby Show." A pilot project for a late-night show, "And So It Goes,"  featuring Ellerbee, failed to attract enough stations to go into syndication.  The Feb. 21 edition of PBS' "Smithsonian World" will include a segment called  "A Moveable Feast," produced by Lucky Duck and narrated by Ellerbee's co-anchor  at NBC News, Lloyd Dobyns.  </P> <P> A spokesman said Wednesday the production company expects to make an  announcement "very soon" regarding "various things in development on both  coasts." Frank, who served twice as head of NBC News, had an award-winning  career as a documentary producer at the network.  </P></p>

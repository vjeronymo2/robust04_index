			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero by reporter </F> Celia Chaim; date and place not given]    [Text] [Chaim] With the implementation of a new currency,  will Brazilians finally have a functional economy?    [Ricupero] I am very optimistic about what will happen in  the  short-term because all steps to make stability a reality have  been taken. We have ensured the fiscal reform through the  Social Emergency Fund. There is pressure and there are  difficulties but I believe we will achieve a good operational  result in the budget. We have the largest reserves in our  history and they are enough to cover our imports for 12 months.  We have reached agreement about our debt and reopened the doors  to the international market. We are even preparing a Treasury  certificate. I have appointed a working team to define the  details of this certificate. Through it, we will be able to  attract resources at lower interest rates in the domestic  market. We have also had unprecedented crops: 75 million  tonnes. Following the 1992 recession, the economy has grown 4.5  percent during the last 15 months. International conditions are  improving. There is a large group of favorable indicators that  convinces us that when the real is implemented, the inflation  rate will drop in a swift and accentuated manner.    [Chaim] How will this happen?    [Ricupero] The inflation rate will drop for several reasons.  Particularly because the de-indexation of the economy will be  very advanced. We believe the inflation rate will begin to drop  in an accentuated manner after the second month.    [Chaim] Will it be possible to maintain the inflation rate  at  very low levels for a long time?    [Ricupero] Until the end of this year, I am sure it will. My  main concern is about the medium- and long-term. The government  has never hidden that the consolidation of the economic  adjustment will demand structural reforms that will require  modifying the Constitution. This is why I made such a big  effort to see the constitutional reform continue -- not to  benefit from it. Even if the constitutional reform had been  very well advanced, its effects would only begin to be felt in  the medium-term. My effort sought to make things easier for my  successor.    [Chaim] How will you convince Autolatina [car-manufacturing  company] workers, and all other workers, that despite the  increase in prices, salaries need not be readjusted?    [Ricupero] As I have frequently said, it is an illusion to  think that salary hikes obtained through strikes will solve that  problem. These excessive increases -- as much as 19 percent --  currently being granted worry me. The worker rejoices, the  inflation rate is pushed up, and shortly after that the salary  increase is consumed. What you achieve with your left hand, the  right hand -- inflation -- destroys. People must realize that  the only salvation is stability, which is the pre-condition for  growth because economic growth depends on investment. With  inflation like ours, there is no investment. In 1992, our  investment rate dropped to 14.5 percent of the GDP, while in the  1970's it stood at 25 percent, like that of the Asian Tigers.    [Chaim] You have just eight more months in the government.  Do you have time to do something more concrete in such a short  period of time?    [Ricupero] I believe there is time enough to reestablish a  very high-level of stability in the economy.    [Chaim] How?    [Ricupero] We will adopt rules for the new currency that  will  create confidence about issuance control. We will also adopt  rules to link the real to international reserves. At the same  time, I will not limit my horizon strictly to the implementation  of the stabilization plan, which is my main task: I will act in  two areas that need defined policies; first I will define an  industrial policy that can be competitive abroad. I plan to do  that together with the Science and Technology Ministry and the  Industry and Commerce Ministry. Our commercial opening lacks  one detail: an industrial and competitive policy. At the same  time, I want to enter the job policy area, although this area is  not the responsibility of my ministry only. The best way to  solve social problems is first, to put an end to inflation and  second, to create jobs. I believe a lot can be done in eight  months regarding policy definition...    [Chaim] What is the job-generating policy that you intend  to implement?    [Ricupero] The main subject in all economies is the job  issue. The problem has not been solved either by market or by  socialist economies, which alleged attained full employment but  based on a surplus -- a company that needed 100 employees has  300. I think Brazil -- beside supporting the many different  small and middle-size enterprises, and gradually reducing taxes  -- must face a very serious problem which is the very high cost  of generating job openings, the so-called social cost. We, in  Brazil, with our poor economy, have higher social costs than  Denmark. What is worse, our social services are very bad. For  every dollar a Brazilian businessman pays in salaries, he pays  81 cents for social benefits. We must thus convince the left and  the labor unions that this situation cannot improve the workers'  wellbeing. The path to the wellbeing of workers is via a  productive sector that generates abundant, well paid, and good  quality jobs. That is how the social matter must be solved.    [Chaim] But there are powerful sectors that benefit a lot  from inflation and which are against stability...    [Ricupero] There are sectors that coexist and even prosper  under an economy like ours. We must create the conditions to  end this situation. Brazil must attain a stability like in  Europe, where it is a vindication of the people. I feel there  is hope for such a thing here. During the Cruzado Plan, with  all its mistakes, there was great pride in being Brazilians, the  people felt they had a strong currency. There is no reason why  this should not happen again. That is why I asked the president  to announce the new currency. The currency is a symbol of  sovereignty.    [Chaim] What is the acceptable inflationary expectation for  the real?    [Ricupero] I cannot give you a figure. It is difficult to  calculate, mainly because Brazilian indexes measure past  inflation. It is very complicated to explain that the first  indexes of the real will measure inflation from the former  month. That is why I cannot answer. But inflation will be very  low after the second month.    [Chaim] How will you prevent businessmen from excessively  readjusting their prices?    [Ricupero] By negotiating, by using the law we have, and by  increasing competitiveness.    [Chaim] But this formula has not worked very well.    [Ricupero] It is my responsibility to administrate the  economic plan. I believe the plan belongs to everyone. I do  not see any contradiction between the interests of a candidate  and the plan's consistency. Anyone who wishes to become  president will find an economy on the way to stabilization.  Even Lula said that. It is obvious. It is better to be  Rodrigues Alves [Brazilian president from 1902 to 1906] than to  be Campos Sales [Brazilian president from 1898 to 1902]. Campos  Sales left Catete Palace [then Government House in Rio de  Janeiro] booed by the public until he boarded the train for Sao  Paulo. Rodrigues Alves was popular because he inherited a  streamlined economy and he was able to do many things. Which do  the candidates prefer?</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'REPULSIVE' BUT ARTISTIC?  </P> <P> I've just read the April 13 review of "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &amp; Her  Lover" ("Cook": Grossness From Great Talents") in which Kevin Thomas calls the  film "repulsive," with scenes of cannibalism and of a man smeared with  excrement. Quick! Call the National Endowment for the Arts! I'm sure it will  want to sponsor the sequel in the name of artistic freedom!  </P> <P> BILL FARIS  </P> <P> Lake Forest  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE;  </P> <P> $200-MILLION PROJECT OPENING NEAR LAX  </P> <P> The first phase of Pacific Concourse, opening Thursday near Los Angeles  International Airport, is more than just another mixed-use business campus:  It's the first large-scale real estate project originated by the Economic  Development Corp., on behalf of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The $200-million, 30-acre project at 118th Street and La Cienega Boulevard is  in Del Aire, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County between El Segundo  and Hawthorne.  </P> <P> The project will serve as a buffer between the freeways and the remaining  houses and will bring suburban amenities to an area cleared for the Century  (105) and San Diego (405) Freeway interchange, according to Stanley Moore of  Overton, Moore &amp; Associates (OMA), Carson.  </P> <P> OMA is the project's developer with Copley Real Estate Advisors, a unit of  Boston-based New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. The architect is the Nadel  Partnership, Los Angeles. Project financing is being provided by Wells Fargo  Bank.  </P> <P> The first phase includes two 68,086-square-foot, three-story buildings and one  91,400-square-foot, four-story building, Moore said. The second and third  phases will add five buildings, including a hotel, he said.  </P> <P> Economic Development Corp. President Reginald Bottger said the 8-year-old,  not-for-profit group working for the county brought residents of the Del Aire  area into the design process from the beginning, after the EDC bought the land  at the southwest quadrant of the interchange from the California Department of  Transportation for about $14 million.  </P> <P> He said that, as part the negotiations with the community, OMA agreed to spend  $10 million on landscaping and infrastructure at Pacific Concourse.  Landscaping, designed by Emmet L. Wemple &amp; Associates, includes an  artificial lake, a jogging track and a two-hole chip-and-putt golf layout.  </P> <P> Bottger said the agreement with OMA Del Aire Properties calls for EDC to lease  the land for 75 years, starting at about $400,000 a year and escalating to  about $800,000. The money will be used to expand business counseling,  international trade and investment, business promotion and retention and small  business loan programs throughout the county and in the Century Freeway  Corridor.  </P> <P> He added that the project should create between 2,000 and 2,500 jobs and  generate $2 million a year in property taxes for the county.  </P> <P> Donald W. Koch, OMA's vice president/marketing, believes that Pacific Concourse  will create its own market, distinct from the LAX/Century Boulevard office  market that has about a 25% vacancy factor. The Seeley Co. is the leasing agent  </P></p>

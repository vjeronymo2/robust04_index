			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Dec 23 KYODO -- Japan will allow overseas  AIDS patients and HIV carriers to enter the country to attend an  international conference on AIDS to be held in Yokohama in  August 1994, government sources said Thursday [23 December].    The Health and Welfare Ministry and the Justice Ministry  will  permit those who have been infected with the human  immunodeficiencey virus (HIV) to come into Japan to attend the  conference, the first in Asia of its kind.    However, if attendants are proved to have once had a hand in  prostitution, the ministries will refuse them entrance, the  sources close to the ministries said.    About 1,000 AIDS patients and HIV carriers are expected to  take part in the 10th International Conference on AIDS to be  held from August 7 to 12 in Yokohama.    Organizers expect over 10,000 people from more than 140  countries to attend.    Japan's immigration law grants the government a right to  refuse entrance to those who are infected with a virus and run a  risk of spreading the virus among people.    The ministries, however, decided to allow HIV carriers to  enter the country because their purpose of participating in the  conference is clear, the sources said.    The law also enables the government to stop the entrance of  those who have a background of prostitution even if they are to  make speeches at the conference.    However, they can apply for special permission for entrance  with the Justice Minister if they wish, they said.    Nongovernment organizations overseas have urged Japan not to  shut the door to participants who have engaged in prostitution.    All previous conferences were in Europe or North America,  but  the organizers hope for greater Asian input next year because  statistics shows AIDS cases will explode in Asia toward the end  of the decade.    In Japan, there are currently over 3,000 people with AIDS,  or  infected with HIV, according to the Health and Welfare Ministry.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HERMOSA BEACH SAYS NO TO CYCLE SHOP  </P> <P> To the satisfaction of residents fighting the opening of a motorcycle sales and  parts store on Pacific Coast Highway, the Hermosa Beach City Council this week  delayed for at least six months any possibility that the owners of South Bay  Cycles will be able to sell Harley-Davidsons at their shop.  </P> <P> "It's just plain discrimination against bikers," said Maiko Saravia, who, with  co-owner William Campbell, had planned to run an upscale, pink-walled  "motorcycle boutique," specializing in Harley-Davidson sales, in a building at  640 Pacific Coast Highway that had been an auto parts and sales store.  </P> <P> Saravia and Campbell said they had been assured by city staff that they would  have no problem obtaining permission to sell motorcycles at their shop, since  the city's General Plan allowed auto sales -- a similar use -- on that strip of  the highway. Moreover, the owners noted, their store is flanked by auto  dealerships.  </P> <P> But homeowners near the commercial strip objected vehemently, contending that  the area is already noisy enough without the roar of revving engines that would  surely accompany the opening of South Bay Cycles. The uproar -- including  opposition by the wife of former Planning Commissioner Jerry Compton --  prompted the Planning Commission last week to deny Saravia and Campbell the  conditional use permit they needed.  </P> <P> Saravia and Campbell had intended to appeal that decision to the City Council  next month. Having invested nearly $250,000 in building renovations, the owners  said they are losing about $7,000 a month in mortgage and overhead because of  the delays.  </P> <P> But on Tuesday, the council decided that the General Plan should be amended to  specifically include -- or disallow -- motorcycle sales on that section of the  highway. Such amendments require public hearings and legal procedures that  normally take months to complete.  </P> <P> "There is a strong difference between motorcycles and cars -- the noise level,"  Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke said.  </P> <P> Councilman Roger Creighton noted too that there are no other motorcycle stores  in the area, nor have there been in recent memory.  </P> <P> "It's a relatively new use for the area," he said, "and it's a use that needs  to be reviewed and stringent standards set."  </P> <P> But Saravia said the city's public officials are persecuting his business at  the behest of a political crony.  </P> <P> "There has to be something illegal about this," he said, adding that he is  considering a lawsuit against the city.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bohumil Srajer: "A Signature That Has Brought Us </F> Closer to Europe"]    [Text] The PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland  and Hungary] guiding program, which specifies priority areas for  European Union [EU] assistance to the Czech Republic, was signed  by Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Bratinka and Leopoldo Giunti,  the EU Commission's emissary to the Czech Republic, in Cernin  Palace [in Prague] yesterday.    The program covers new trends in cooperation between the  Czech Republic and the EU. The principal change is the PHARE  shift from only technical assistance to support for specific  projects, particularly in transportation and the environment.  Great attention will also be paid to the preparation of Czech  institutions for future integration into EU structures.  According to Pavel Bratinka, the key sphere is private  business, with an emphasis on restructuring industry and  developing small and medium-size enterprises. Another sphere on  which PHARE will concentrate is education. The project also  intends to assist in reinforcing the social net. It is expected  that a total of 60 million ECU's (approximately 2.04 billion  korunas) will be spent on new obligations of the PHARE program.</p>

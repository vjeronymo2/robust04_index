			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: WWF seeks top role for environment THE WWF-World Wide Fund for Nature yesterday called on the Apec summit to ensure any new trade arrangements reflect environmental considerations from the start. Addressing environmental degradation as an afterthought was short-sighted, as had been amply demonstrated by the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks, the Swiss-based environmental organisation said . Nafta negotiators were obliged to negotiate sub-optimal side agreements later and these 'remain a source of dispute'. Uruguay Round negotiators 'have frequently claimed the initial omission of environmental issues cannot be rectified later', according to Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy analyst. The WWF is urging Apec to seek ways of making trade and environment policies mutually supportive, as agreed at the UN 'Earth Summit' in Brazil last year.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Mixed showing at Price Waterhouse Price Waterhouse, the chartered accountants and business advisory firm, yesterday announced fee income for the year to June of Pounds 384m, against Pounds 383.3m last time. Fees from audit and business advisory services rose 6 per cent to Pounds 146.1m - representing 38 per cent of the entire income for 1993-94. Income from corporate finance and recovery dropped by 11 per cent to Pounds 47.6m and management consultancy dropped by 2 per cent to Pounds 81.9m. Income from tax consultancy was unchanged. Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner, said: 'The welcome improvements in the UK economy have generated much needed growth in the audit practice with a particularly strong increase in business advisory services. 'However, this improvement has led to a reduced number of business failures and a consequent reduction in our corporate recovery business offset by an increase in the corporate finance income. 'In overall terms our business lags behind our clients going into recession and similarly lags behind them coming out. On the assumption that the UK economy continues to recover we look forward to some overall growth in the current year.' Fee income from Europe rose 1.8 per cent to Pounds 894m. Combined worldwide revenue was Dollars 3.98bn (Pounds 2.51bn) an increase of 2.3 per cent.</p>

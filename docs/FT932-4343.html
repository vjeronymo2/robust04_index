			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Abkhazia firm on independence demand: Georgia's stubborn Black Sea secessionists MR Vladislav Ardzinba, leader of Georgia's secessionist region of Abkhazia, says the Black Sea resort strip is not retreating from its declaration of independence, and that he is formally seeking federation with Russia. Although a ceasefire in Georgia'a nine-month war seems to be holding, Mr Ardzinba's position illustrates the difficulties of achieving sustained peace in the region. In refusing, at least publicly, to budge on the question of Georgian sovereignty over Abkhazia's 530,000 people, Mr Ardzinba matches the severity of Georgian nationalists, who insist that Abkhazia must stay firmly in their country. 'A big nation cannot force its will on a small nation. Otherwise we would not be living in the 20th century. It would be like the past,' Mr Ardzinba said in the breakaway Abkhazian capital of Gudauta. After months of acrimony between officials in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and Gudauta war broke out last August when Georgia's National Guard leader, Mr Tengiz Kitovani, sent tanks into the port city of Sukhumi. Mr Ardzinba retreated to Gudauta, and the Georgians dug in at Sukhumi. Abkhazians have been fighting for greater autonomy since at least 1978, when an uprising was crushed. Georgia points out that Abkhazians comprise just 17 per cent of Abkhazia's population, and so do not merit independence, but Mr Ardzinba asserts that former Soviet leader Josef Stalin purposely diluted the population by resettling Georgians, Russians and Armenians. The fighting since has raised tensions between Russia and Georgia and, according to Georgia's leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, threatened to bring Moscow and Tbilisi into direct conflict. Mr Shevardnadze has long accused Russia of giving military help to the Abkhazians, and Russian complicity on the rebel side is evident. In one example, a Russian airborne unit based at Gudauta has enforced an air exclusion zone over Abkhazia and, though a few Georgian sorties have penetrated, has warned Georgia not to bomb. At the same time, the Russians have placed no such net over Georgian forces, and Georgia-controlled Sukhumi is often the target of bombing runs. A separate matter is who is flying the bombers over Sukhumi. Mr Shevardnadze blames Russia outright, though Moscow denies this. Tensions have eased since Mr Shevardnadze dismissed the hawkish Mr Kitovani, and he and Russia's president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, signed a ceasefire agreement that went into effect last month. The truce requires both sides to withdraw heavy artillery from the front line. Meanwhile Mr Yeltsin's special envoy on Abkhazia, Mr Boris Pastoukov, has been shuttling between Mr Ardzinba and Mr Shevardnadze to find common ground. But the gulf separating the combatants remains wide. Mr Ardzinba compared Mr Shevardnadze to some of history's most brutal leaders. 'His policy toward Abkhazia is like Hitler or Mussolini, because it is based on the ideology of Nazism,' said Mr Ardzinba, who is an academic specialist in cuneiform, Hittite language. Saying that Georgia was increasingly alienating itself from Abkhazians, Mr Ardzinba said he would agree only to ceding some matters, such as foreign policy, to Georgia or Russia.</p>

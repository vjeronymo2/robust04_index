			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan eases after resignation of justice minister CORPORATE and political news dominated trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN turned lower late in the day as Justice Minister Claudio Martelli  - a member of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's Socialist party - resigned after being told he was under investigation on corruption charges. The Comit index ended down 3.53 at 496.15 and Italian shares quoted on the Seaq system in London continued subsequently to trade lower. The bourse had unexpectedly overcome a weak start to trade higher for much of the afternoon session. However, analysts expect that the ever-widening political scandal, together with technical account-end considerations, will make for a choppy ride for the remainder of the week. Strong overseas demand for Stet took the telecommunications holding company L23 higher to fix at L2,283, before L2,285 after hours. But Fondiaria, which announced a board reshuffle, dipped L192 to L29,008 before easing to L28,973 in late trade. FRANKFURT saw a battle between bulls and bears produce a surge in market turnover. The DAX index closed just 8.23 higher at 1,649.81, off an intraday high of 1,656.83, and the indications were that some of the remaining gains were being dissipated in after hours trading. Turnover rose to DM8.2bn from DM5.8bn. Banks fell again after last week's gains, BHF losing DM5 to DM440 on news of a rights issue. Chemicals were relatively weak on average, Bayer adding a mere 10 pfg to DM257.70 as it detailed a cut in staff bonus payments. The main winners were carmakers, where Daimler rose DM11 to DM614, and electricals with AEG up DM5.40 to DM168.90 and Siemens DM7.50 better at DM638.50. Dealers said that the main reason for the gains, with fund managers, especially foreigners, underweight in German shares, seemed to have operated irrespective of the depressing fundamentals for the car sector. PARIS sold Michelin after the tyre group reported a fall in 1992 second half sales. While the figures only confirmed the depressed state of the sector the shares dipped FFr8.90 or 4.5 per cent to FFr187.40. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's high of 1,899, closed barely changed, down 0.73 at 1,893.32. Turnover was FFr2.6bn. UAP was another faller, down FFr10 at FFr520, after releasing disappointing 1992 earnings after Tuesday's close. Schneider gained FFr11 to FFr666 on news that it was to sell a subsidiary in an effort to reduce debt. AMSTERDAM was interested in cyclicals while Fokker, which denied reports that credit lines had been suspended, fell to the day's low of Fl 8.40 before recovering slightly to close down Fl 1.00 at Fl 9.40. The CBS Tendency index was unchanged at 97.9 after a high of 98.5. BRUSSELS was flat after a day of heavy and hectic trade as the market focused on further pressures on the Belgian franc and a subsequent interest rate rise. The Bel-20 index finished virtually unchanged, losing 0.09 to 1,213.85 in high volume of BFr1.71bn. Electrabel lost BFr170 or 2.9 per cent to BFr5,720, but among dollar-oriented shares, Petrofina gained BFr170 or 2.3 per cent to BFr7,670. MADRID was active in Banesto prior to the bank announcing that it had reached agreement for a US investment group to take a minority stake. The shares saw a high of Pta2,545 before closing Pta70 higher at Pta2,435. The general index eased 0.77 to 234.26 in turnover of Pta18.6bn. ZURICH was easier in quiet conditions that left the SMI index 14.9 lower at 2,120.8. STOCKHOLM was encouraged by hopes of lower interest rates while Ericsson remained a favourite following the release of good 1992 results on Tuesday. Its B shares closed up SKr11 at SKr220 in high volume. The Affarsvarlden index gained 15.6 to 964.5 in turnover of SKr1.5bn. OSLO remained active with the all-share index gaining 4.76 or 1.2 per cent to 406.62 in turnover of NKr509.1m. HELSINKI extended its gains as investors anticipated a number of company results, and the HEX index rose 15.4 to 926.4. ISTANBUL broke through the 5,000 level in early trading before retreating on profit-taking. The 75-share index closed down 28.98 to 4,943.40 in turnover of TL500bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices February 10 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1125.44  1126.43   1126.19  1127.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1177.34  1176.00   1176.70  1177.76                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1126.07  1125.67   1122.00  1121.50 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1175.04  1175.80   1171.11  1171.08  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 9     Feb 8     Feb 5     Feb 4     Feb 3 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1124.14   1131.12   1129.52   1113.35   1097.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1177.40   1190.15   1189.21   1183.60   1171.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1127.61; 200 - 1179.39 Low/day: 100 - 1121.09  200 - 1170.48.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Refugee plea to Yemen factions The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees yesterday appealed to the warring sides in Yemen to let an urgently needed convoy reach a camp where Somali refugees have been killed in the civil war crossfire, AP reports from Geneva. The agency has been trying since the middle of last week to send the trucks with food, medicine and other supplies to Al Koud camp, 50km east of Aden. It said it had been unable to confirm the number of Somali refugees killed since open fighting erupted between northern and southern forces in Yemen on May 4. But camp elders had reported the death toll at 175, with an unknown number wounded. Previous estimates said between 100 and 270 had been killed. A team representing the UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross reached the camp from Sanaa on Saturday and found only 1,500 refugees left out of a population estimated at 6,000. The rest have fled to a nearby village or into the surrounding countryside. Refugees told the team that uniformed men had taken batteries and generators that had been used to pump water to the camp and had confiscated their food, leaving the camp with little or no water, food and medical supplies. The team brought in only four boxes of ICRC medical supplies, and much more was needed, the UNHCR said. A second team from Aden that has been trying to reach the camp with the convoy will try again today. The camp was set up to house 10,000 Somali boat people who fled the civil war in their own homeland two years ago across the Gulf of Aden. About 4,000 refugees are believed to have moved into Aden before the fighting began.</p>

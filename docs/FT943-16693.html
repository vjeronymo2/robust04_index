			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: All to play for and everything to lose - Peter Berlin in Washington previews the second-round knock-out phase, and argues that no team emerged from the group games head and shoulders above the rest The World Cup enters its serious phase today. The first 36 games have eliminated eight of the 24 starters. The next 15 matches - four knock-out rounds - will determine the winner. The group matches did not provide many clues to go on. No team won all their games and none has produced three good performances. Some have played well in patches, but all have looked beatable. The second round is often where the contenders start to flex their muscles. Reigning champions Germany have looked lumpen, and meet the plodding Belgians in Chicago this afternoon. The Germans are not happy. They dislike the heat. Their ponderous defence has depended heavily on goalkeeper Illgner's speed off the line and willingness to hurl himself at the feet of strikers. This risky ploy should be less necessary against Belgium, who have used four strikers, all of them, apparently, equally slow and clumsy. Against Saudi Arabia they attacked ceaselessly and uselessly from the air. The Belgian captain and their most influential player, Scifo, believes Belgium are at their most dangerous when they are the underdogs. But the Gemans have more potent weapons in Klinsmann and Riedle, who broke his drought with a goal against South Korea. They must have salivated as they watched Saudi Arabia slice through the Belgian defence on Wednesday. The Germans are being tormented by their press; there are tales of rifts in the team; and Effenberg, a talented but obnoxious mid-field player, has been thrown off the squad - for being obnoxious. Even so, they should be able to kick sand in the Belgians' faces. Today's other game features a pair of second-placed teams. Spain and Switzerland have produced passages of good play, but not enough to suggest that either can expect to grace the later stages of the competition. The Spaniards are in the finals for the ninth time, but have reached the last eight only twice, while the Swiss are hoping their occasionally fluid teamwork can take them past Spain for the first time in 17 games. Caminero, who scored twice for Spain against Bolivia, is missing because of a one-game suspension. Tomorrow, Saudi Arabia play Sweden at noon in Dallas, where temperatures topped 110`F in Tuesday's game between Germany and South Korea. The Saudis come from the desert but they seemed to wilt against Belgium in Washington on Wednesday. They still won. They showed pace and flair in attack and dealt comfortably with Belgium's aerial assault. But if they allow Sweden as much possession as they gave Belgium and Holland, they are unlikely to survive. Argentina - the perennial survivors - take on Romania in Los Angeles. Argentina looked overpowering in their first two games but underpowered in their last, a defeat against Bulgaria when they were missing Maradona's deft touch, most obviously at free kicks, where his accuracy and imagination was replaced by unrehearsed clumsiness. Yet they won the Copa America last year without Maradona and also without Caniggia, who has hurt a toe. Furthermore, since the Argentinians had already qualified for the second round they could be forgiven an evening off, particularly as they knew that the lower they finished the easier their second round opponents would be. Between them Bulgaria and Argentina set a single-game yellow-card record. Romania are as niggly as the Bulgarians and play an even more cautious counter-attacking game. Raducioiu will sit out the game thanks to picking up two yellow cards. Argentina could revert to their defensive posture of four years ago. But they know that victory will bring them a winnable quarter-final against Sweden or Saudi Arabia. Now is the time for Rodrigues, Redondo, Batistuta and Balbo to step out of the shadows. The Dutch - great under-achievers - still carry the aura of title contenders. Four years ago their team contained Gullit, Van Basten, Rijkaard and Koeman, all world-class, and yet played poorly for four games and were eliminated at this stage. Gullit and Van Basten are gone, to be replaced by Bergkamp, Overmars, Jonk and Roy. Holland remain less than the sum of their parts and on Monday meet the Irish who beat them 1-0 in Tilburg last April. But the weather was different there. Both teams have already played in steamy Orlando and both have said they cannot stand the heat. The Irish have played impressively, but their form dipped in their one game in Orlando, a loss to Mexico. Monday's game will be a test of will and water retention as much as of skill and tactics. The reward is a trip to Dallas, the hottest of the quarter-final sites, where the likely opponents will be Brazil, the most plausible pretenders to the trophy. Brazil play the US in San Francisco on Monday  - July 4 - and the Americans are excited. 'I think we're all psyched to play against Brazil,' said Lalas, the American centre-back. 'They're such a brilliant team and have such great players.' The organisers agree. This could not have worked out better. The US team have stoked public interest. Americans do not like losers, but defeat against Brazil, which even the most ill-informed American sports fans associate with soccer, would be acceptable, especially if Brazil can find the dazzling form they hinted at in the first round. The US will be without John Harkes, one of their most impressive players so far, who misses the game through suspension. Nigeria's injury-time goal against Greece gave the Super Eagles the honour of winning their group - an African first - but it brings a dubious reward: Italy. Italy have a habit of consolidating as World Cups progress. They are a big, fast team: Nigeria will not be able to out-run or out-muscle them. Nigeria have been breathtaking at times, but against Argentina they were out-manoeuvred, and the canny Italians will provide an equally severe test of their tactical sophistication. Yet Italy must answer some questions themselves. Will their fragile confidence start to strengthen? When will Signori and Roberto Baggio find their form? Is Massaro about to emerge as the Schillaci or the Rossi of this World Cup? The second round will finish with two teams whose abilities lie in attack if only they dared rely on them. The Mexicans are fast and skilful yet somehow lethargic when moving from defence to attack. The Bulgarians, who will be without three defenders after giving Jouini, the Tunisian referee, writer's cramp on Thursday night, possess two exhilarating strikers in Kostadinov and Stoichkov. Their chief offensive strategy has been to win penalties, which Stoichkov then converts. It could be an important skill: while the second round brings the stomach-wrenching tension of knock-out play, it also brings the prospect of games decided by penalty shoot-outs. If teams like Bulgaria opt to sit out two hours' play in the hope of winning spot-kick roulette, the good memories of the first two weeks of this World Cup will be obliterated.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Gonzalez faces call for early poll: Spain's economic woes herald unofficial start of election campaign THE Spanish parliament is to hold an emergency debate on unemployment today. It will pit Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez against his increasingly confident conservative opponent, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, in what Spaniards assume will be the unofficial start to a long 1993 election campaign. With polls showing Mr Aznar's Partido Popular (PP) rapidly gaining on Mr Gonzalez's Socialists, unemployment at a record 21.06 per cent and business failures at historic highs, today's debate promises to be one of the most acrimonious in the 10 years that the Socialists have held power. Mr Gonzalez has to hold an election by the end of November and is anxious to delay for as long as possible. As a first effort to put a brake on his party's declining popularity, he will today put forward a Pta300bn (Pounds 1.8bn) emergency economic package, agreed in cabinet last Friday. It aims to accelerate infrastructure spending, ease small business taxes and increase the statutory length of temporary job contracts to slow unemployment growth. The European Community will fund 80 per cent of the package, Madrid hopes, and thus limit its impact on the tight 1993 budget. But this is the first time opponents such as Mr Aznar and the leader of the communist Izquierda Unida (IU), Mr Julio Anguita, find themselves approaching an election with the economy in recession. These men believe that they are about to end Socialist party dominance in Spain, and will demand early elections. Mr Gonzalez is unlikely to do them that favour, but pressures on the government are immense. Unemployment is expected to continue to rise until the summer and, with both the business community and the opposition calling for Spain to float the peseta, cut interest rates and raise spending, the currency may see a turbulent period in the markets. Meanwhile, industrial production figures published yesterday showing a 5.6 per cent fall in December 1992 against the same month in 1991, and a 1.7 per cent fall in overall output in 1992, are likely to sharpen calls for drastic action to revive the economy. Despite persistent rumours, however, it is most unlikely that the government would unilaterally take the peseta out of the exchange rate mechanism. Signs that German interest rates may soften soon will probably make it easier for the Spanish to cut rates.</p>

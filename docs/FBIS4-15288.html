			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 31 (CTK) -- A delegation of Czech  economic experts led by Deputy Industry and Trade Minister  Vaclav Petricek and Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak  ended its talks here today.    The talks focused on the forthcoming visit of Czech Premier  Vaclav Klaus to the Russian Federation which is expected next  Monday and Tuesday [4 and 5 April].    In an interview with CTK Petricek said an agreement on  investment protection was ready for signing. He said Prague and  Moscow should now discuss possibilities for bringing the current  drop in their mutual trade to a halt, including lifting trade  barriers.    Regarding Russian debts towards the Czech Republic Rudlovcak  told CTK that Russia was now in a difficult payment situation  and considered supplies of Russian goods a basic mechanism for  repaying its debts. Rudlovcak said the Czech Republic would  agree with such a solution providing it was regulated in a  special agreement. Under favorable conditions such a document  could be drafted by the end of May, he added.    Rudlovcak said that during Klaus's expected visit to Moscow  the principles for such an agreement might be discussed.    After the breakup of the Czechoslovak Federation its claims  against the former Soviet Union were divided between the Czech  Republic and Slovakia in a two-to-one ratio. The claims worth  three billion USD ensuing from state loans and trade deficit  passed to the Czech Republic. Direct claims of Czech  enterprises against Russian consumers worth about 380 million  dollars make up an independent part of former Soviet and  currently Russian debt to the Czech Republic.</p>

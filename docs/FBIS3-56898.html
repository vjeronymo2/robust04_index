Kravchuk temporarily transferred the duties of his  representative in Sevastopol to Nikolay Glushko, first deputy  head of the city administration.    ITAR-TASS learnt at the press centre of the Black Sea Fleet  later in the day that the Union of Afghan Veterans, the  Sevastopol Russian community, the Crimean Movement of Voters,  the union in support of the Crimean Republic and the leadership  of city social services voiced support for Yermakov.    It is expected that the Sevastopol city council will call a  special session in the near future to discuss Yermakov's  resignation.    Local analysts believe that the resignation of the  presidential representative in Sevastopol was caused by his  participation in the election campaign as a candidate for the  post of Crimean president.    Yermakov made repeated statements during the campaign that  the problem of the Black Sea Fleet should be resolved in favour  of Russia.    According to analysts, Kiev was also evidently riled by the  fact that Yermakov did not support the candidacy of Crimean  Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bahrov during the election campaign.</p>

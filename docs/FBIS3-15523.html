"After the 5 months in the Lefortovo prison I realized the  tragedy which had happened," he stressed in a telephone  conversation with an Interfax correspondent.    Rutskoy said he was not guided neither by evil nor by  revenge. "Evil comes from evil. There was a bloodshed in  October 1993 and innocent people perished. If we start clearing  up our relations there might be a bloodshed again. We will have  to face the danger of total death," he pointed out.    Rutskoy announced that he was to complete his 3-volume book  within a month (each volume has about 400-500 pages). According  to him, he saw that the present leaders make nearly every  mistake against which he had warned. He believes there was no  reason to let the situation develop into the tragedy. He said  he did not try to cover politics in his book since he saw no  necessity to settle accounts or to criticize anybody.    Rutskoy believes that there must be civilized economic and  political relations established in Russia. The rule must be  carried out through motivation rather than through commands.    Commenting on the reforms, Rutskoy emphasized that they must  be based juridically. "All rallies finally lead to fights," he  said.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 5-A BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> EDISON USES GOOD FORTUNE TO STAY A STEP AHEAD, 56-51  </P> <P> Edison High School Coach Jon Borchert was happy to take all the good fortune he  could in a 56-51 victory over Los Alamitos Friday at Marina in the second round  of the 5-A Southern Section playoffs. He had some problems, however, analyzing  all his luck.  </P> <P> "It just comes down to the breaks," Borchert said. "Sometimes you get them.  Sometimes you don't. That's the only way I can explain it."  </P> <P> That explains Dan Lovelady's first attempt of a one-and-one that caromed above  the backboard and hit only net on the way down.  </P> <P> That also explains how 6-9 center Bill Martineau tore the sole of a new pair of  size 15s and had a replacement pair waiting for him on the feet of freshman  reserve Brandon Jesse, who had just been called up to the varsity for the  playoffs.  </P> <P> And all this while Los Alamitos was in the process of turning a third-quarter,  14-point deficit into a three-point disadvantage with less than a minute to  play.  </P> <P> "We needed a basket like that (Lovelady's free throw) and we were just lucky  that Brandon Jesse wears size 15," Borchert said. "It was real emotional. The  kids were raring to play all week."  </P> <P> The Chargers (15-12), who had a bye in the first round, had a 46-37 lead after  three quarters before Los Alamitos started its comeback attempt.  </P> <P> The charge slowly stalled, however, as three Los Alamitos starters fouled out  in the final three minutes after the Griffins (12-15) had pulled within three  points, 50-47.  </P> <P> "We played real well in the first half," Borchert said. "As usual, we ended up  with a tight game.  </P> <P> "Credit their defense. It was tight. They got their hands on the ball. Give  credit to their good defense, not our bad offense."  </P> <P> That good defense limited Sunset League champion Edison to 35 shots and forced  12 turnovers. But the Los Alamitos offense couldn't keep up, shooting 44% (18  of 41) from the field and 60% (15 of 25) from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Edison built a 36-22 halftime advantage as Martineau scored 10 of his 14  game-high points and Bryan Murphy also had 10.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos then chipped away in the third quarter, cutting the score to 46-37  by the end of the quarter behind two three-pointers by Griffins' leading scorer  Mike Wilson.  </P> <P> The Griffins opened the fourth quarter with a 9-4 run to pull within 48-45.  </P> <P> That's when the sole of Martineau's right shoe ripped at the heel, forcing him  off the court for less than a minute.  </P> <P> After he returned, the Chargers built a 54-49 lead on Lovelady's two free  throws. Los Alamitos then closed within three points again on a five-foot  jumper by Wilson.  </P> <P> But Martineau tipped in a missed shot, closing out the scoring.  </P></p>

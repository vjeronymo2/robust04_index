			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Military To Recruit More Women"] </F>   [Text] The military has begun a campaign to recruit more  women.    "Equality was introduced into the three branches long ago,  but presently women represent only 5 percent of military  personnel. This includes 59 officers, 150 sergeants, and 750  military police," said Lieutenant Colonel Jens Christian Lund,  director of Military Service and Recruiting. He added that the  military was hoping to increase that number.    The military's good experience with mixed-gender units was  given as the reason for the campaign. "Women are not merely  excellent soldiers and colleagues, they have brought a  much-needed change in attitudes and standards to the formerly  male-dominated milieu," said Lund.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Ideal opera for Drottningholm - Haydn's 'Orlando paladino' The abundant pleasures of visiting the Drottningholm Court Theatre - 50 minutes from Stockholm by lake steamer - have been recounted on this page before. But the single most satisfying experience there is of course a good opera production, and Haydn's Orlando paladino, the main project this year - the second season under Elisabeth Soderstrom's artistic direction and the chief conductorship of Nicholas McGegan - is very fine indeed. One of Soderstrom's aims is to explore the operatic genealogy of the Mozart and Gluck works that have been central to Drottningholm's repertory over the years. Orlando paladino was Haydn's most popular opera, and it is likely that Mozart heard it; certainly, there are pre-echoes of Don Giovanni in the characterisation of Medoro (a Don Ottavio figure) and Pasquale, whose catalogued grievances call to mind Leporello. Though the plot cannot stand dramatic scrutiny, it serves as a framework for marvellous music, much of it worthy of Mozart's operas. Orlando paladino is ideally suited to Drottningholm's 1766 jewel-box of a theatre. It was composed (1782) for a court theatre of about the same size and period - that at Eszterhaza, long since destroyed - which like Drottningholm was on the fringe of European culture but flourished under enlightened patronage. The libretto, stitched together from Ariosto's heroic legends, calls for all of Drottningholm's famous stage effects: the thunder- and wave-machines work their magic, Alcina descends sitting on a cloud, Orlando decapitates one statue and is himself transformed into another. Drottningholm's deep stage provides the dark recesses for Alcina's magic grotto. As if in a time capsule, the original, 18th-century stage machinery is still in place: scene changes are accomplished within a matter of seconds, dissolving with breathtaking beauty. Ivo Cramer's production, in Dominique Delouche's lavish costumes, catches the opera's naive blend of comedy, romance and heroism. Cramer, a choreographer of long experience, provides lively spectacle (Alcina's monsters were taken by dancers) that almost disguises the work's lack of stage sense. Drottningholm's cast was strong, with two especially good sopranos. Elisabeth Berg was bright and bell-like as the shepherdess Eurilla, and Pia-Marie Nilsson sang with almost perfect poise as the languishing Angelica. The tenor Klas Hedlund stood out for his expressively comic Pasquale and skilful patter singing. Gunnar Lundberg blustered powerfully as the swashbukcling but ineffectual king of Barbary, Rodomonte; Anita Soldh characterised the benign sorceress Alcina well; Stefan Dahlberg was more than adequate as the ridiculous, swooning Orlando; but Lars Magnusson's Medoro was too loud and unyielding. Haydn's score sparkled under McGegan's energetic direction, but it never seemed pushed. McGegan caught the music's essential lyricism, and the 'period' instruments - beautiful winds - sounded smooth in the theatre's intimate acoustics. The Festival runs until September 9.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: DESPITE A SEASON OF SPILLS, THRILL REMAINS FROM THIS SHOT  </P> <P> The Dodgers' season was a bust, but it couldn't erase the memories of 1988.  </P> <P> One of those memories will endure among sports fans everywhere. Kirk Gibson's  pinch home run off Oakland's Dennis Eckersley to win Game 1 of the 1988 World  Series was the greatest sports thrill of the '80s, according to Sport magazine.  </P> <P> The rest of the top 10:  </P> <P> 2. Doug Flutie's Hail Mary touchdown pass to Gerald Phelan with no time left on  the clock, giving Boston College a 47-45 victory over the University of Miami  in 1984.  </P> <P> 3. Dwight Clark's leaping catch of a Joe Montana pass in the back of the end  zone, giving the San Francisco 49ers a 28-27 victory over the Dallas Cowboys  and the 1981 National Football Conference title.  </P> <P> 4. Keith Smart's baseline jump shot with five seconds to play, which gave  Indiana the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. title in 1987.  </P> <P> 5. Marvelous Marvin Hagler's knockout of Thomas Hearns in the third round,  ending the fight now known as "Eight Minutes of Hell."  </P> <P> 6. Bob Tway's sand shot on the 18th hole to beat Greg Norman in the 1986 PGA  Championship.  </P> <P> 7. Lorenzo Charles' dunk that gave North Carolina State the 1983 NCAA  championship.  </P> <P> 8. Rookie Magic Johnson's move to center in place of the injured Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar in Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals, when Johnson scored 42 points  and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead the Lakers to the title.  </P> <P> 9. Pete Rose's single off Eric Show that moved Rose past Ty Cobb on the  all-time hit list.  </P> <P> 10. The collision of Cal's Kevin Moen with a trombone player in the Stanford  band as Moen crossed the goal line to complete a five-lateral, game-winning  kickoff return as time ran out.  </P> <P> Trivia time: The Angels' Johnny Ray played in 134 games this season, so there  now are only two players in the major leagues to play in 150 or more games each  of the last eight years. Who are they?  </P> <P> The Fitchburg State watch: Morning Briefing incorrectly reported that the  Falcons had the weekend off. Sadly, it was not to be; they suffered their 36th  consecutive loss, 10-0, to Massachusetts Maritime Saturday.  </P> <P> It could happen here: Toronto residents are rightfully proud of their new  SkyDome and their city's squeaky-clean image. But it's tough for any big city  to be perfect. Lewis H. Diuguid of the Washington Post quotes John Crispo of  the University of Toronto's business school: "The city fathers are close to  worshipping growth for growth's sake. We've destroyed our waterfront. . . .  We're not on the verge of being one of those dreadful American cities, but I am  worried."  </P> <P> Sabre-rattled: Arizona State punter Brad Williams, quoted by the Mesa Tribune's  Mark Emmons on his playing days at Oklahoma under then-Coach Barry Switzer: "I  saw some stuff that you wouldn't believe that even the papers didn't have.  There were linebackers beating up backup quarterbacks. One day I came out of my  room and saw a guy going down the hall waving a sabre and slicing chunks out of  doors. And stuff like that was minor."  </P> <P> Gumming the works: The Toronto Blue Jays' Lee Mazzilli keeps a Bazooka Joe  comic inside the sweatband of his cap. It says:  </P> <P> Teacher: "Where are you from?"  </P> <P> Joe: "Brooklyn."  </P> <P> Teacher: "Oh yeah. What part?"  </P> <P> Joe: "All of me."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The Baltimore Orioles' Cal Ripken and the Atlanta Braves' Dale  Murphy.  </P> <P> Quotebook: St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Danny Cox, sidelined for the entire  season because of elbow surgery, said he will build a mound on his property in  Freeburg, Ill. Asked if he would pitch to his wife, Nancy, during the  off-season, Cox said: "I don't want to be a widower." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

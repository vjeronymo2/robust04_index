			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (9): High on the agenda - Not many employers are willing to implement strategic partnerships with trade unions / Employee relations and workplace reform 'THE MUTUAL GAINS ENTERPRISE' by Thomas Kochan and Paul Osterman, Harvard Business School Press, Dollars 27.95, 272 pages 'RESTORING THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN LABOR LAW' edited by Sheldon Friedman, Richard Hurd, Rudolph Oswald and Ronald Seeber, ILR Press Ithaca, New York. Dollars 29.95 366 pages Workplace reform is high on the American labour policy agenda as companies adapt to the competitive pressures imposed by the global economy. But whether this will lead to a transformation in corporate America's mainly adversarial attitude to employee relations must remain doubtful. Trade unions are now an endangered species. Collective bargaining covers hardly more than 12 per cent of private sector workers. Organised labour's influence is minimal on Capitol Hill, as recent decisive defeats indicated over the North American Free Trade Agreement and the successful Senate filibuster against legislation making it illegal for companies to hire replacement workers in strikes. Ten years ago enlightened union leaders believed human resource management would provide them with a lifeline because companies would see it was in their competitive advantage to create more consensual workplaces based on agreements with recognised trade unions. But these two important and well-written books on the contemporary American workplace suggest not many employers are willing to introduce strategic partnerships with trade unions into their own businesses. 'The leading firms, managers and union leaders that advocate innovative human resource practices have become islands of innovation in a sea of traditional practices', lament Professor Tom Kochan and his MIT colleagues. They believe mere verbal exhortation in favour of 'good' labour practices is not going to change deep-seated employer attitudes. In their opinion, the federal government must stimulate more management-labour co-operation, through what they call the creation of 'a mutual gains coalition'. This means - they insist - providing a new role for government as 'mediator, facilitator and enabler of workplace change'. 'The momentum that has built up in the private sector requires government to become a partner in encouraging investment in human resources and diffusing the knowledge and innovative practices throughout the American workplace', argue Kochan and co. No doubt President Clinton's enlightened labour secretary Robert Reich, a former MIT colleague himself, would agree with that sentiment but it seems most unlikely it will lead to positive results. Professor Kochan and his co-authors have produced a sensible, thoughtful and what ought to be an influential contribution to the public policy debate on worker representation. The trouble is there are simply not enough companies willing to listen and act on their conciliatory message. An important reason for this indifference - they acknowledge - lies in what they call the 'organisational governance' of the American company. In Germany and Japan private corporations think and act with their long-term interests in mind but in the US maximising business performance for the immediate needs of the shareholders is the primary concern and workplace change has a low priority to them. The book calls for 'a new conception of the American corporation' which would ally shareholder and employee interests more closely together and building institutions to bring human resource policies into the core of corporate strategy. The formidable obstacles to American workplace reform are also well described in the collection of essays from Cornell University's ILR Press, a fruitful joint product of academia and the AFL-CIO union federation. The book asserts bluntly that US workers 'should not be denied the freedom to associate, to form and join organisations under their own control and of their own choosing, any more than African-Americans or other minorities should be denied their civil rights or women equal rights'. And yet this is what is happening in contemporary America. Apparently it is the 'escalating use of aggressive union-avoidance tactics' by employers, not any lack of interest by workers in joining a trade union, that lies at the heart of the problem. 'A climate of fear now stands in the way of a revival of American labor unionism', the Cornell study asserts. The Cornell essays provide a persuasive - sometimes eloquent - argument in favour of trade unionism as a protection for vulnerable workers in the labour market - especially women and African-Americans. But many companies regard trade unions as subversive institutions. This attitude is not new in US history. Indeed, except for the period between the passage of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act during the New Deal and the early 1960s, American unions have never found it easy to organise in the face of hostile employers. Moreover, as Dorothy Sue Cobble argues in a particularly insightful essay, the traditional industrial relations system was 'designed for a mass-production industrial workplace' not today's 'service-dominated, computer-based global economy'. As a result, she argues, industrial unionism needs to be replaced by what she calls 'occupational' unionism, a return to a system that caters for the needs of workers and employers outside mass production processes as happened in the US before the 1930s. However, for the vast majority of American workers non-unionism will remain the dominant fact in the workplace with little sign that most companies are willing to experiment with other forms of worker representation as an alternative to trade unionism. Negotiated workplace change might seem rational commonsense that pays off in a company's bottom line but a majority of American employers do not believe this to be self-evident. These books may point the way forward but alas those who would most benefit from them are the least likely to read them.</p>

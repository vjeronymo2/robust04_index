			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC CHANGES 'DRUG WARS' PROMOS AFTER NORIEGA ARREST  </P> <P> Following the surrender of former Panama strongman Manuel Noriega Wednesday  night, NBC said Thursday it was changing its promos of "Drug Wars: The Camarena  Story" to include mention of Noriega's alleged ties to drug traffickers such as  those depicted in the miniseries.  </P> <P> The six-hour drama, which airs Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, tells the story of  Enrique (Kiki) Camarena, a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent  whose abduction and murder in 1985 has been tied to drug lords in Mexico.  </P> <P> "Noriega was the funnel for drug lords in Mexico, and Kiki Camarena went up  against a major drug lord there," John Miller, the NBC vice president in charge  of promotion, said in an interview Thursday. "We began to mention Noriega in  headlines in our promos several days ago. But last night, as we were watching  news stories about Noriega's surrender and his ties to the drug trade, we  decided, 'This is a real connection to a major news event -- let's take  advantage of it."'  </P> <P> Exact wording of the new spots was still being worked out.  </P></p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Tax 'widens savings gulf': Research indicates concessions aid rich and exacerbate inequalities The distribution of wealth across the UK is extremely unequal, with most households having no substantial savings other than their houses and pensions, an economic study has shown. A further factor that may exacerbate inequalities is that the savings of the poor are apt to be taxed more than those of the rich, the research suggests. The study, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says the tax discrepancy is due to the different savings methods used by the rich and poor. According to the survey, the average amount of wealth held by households is about Pounds 3,000, excluding pensions and housing. This overall figure is skewed by a small number of very wealthy individuals - about half the households have savings of less than Pounds 450, the report notes. Poorer households tend to attract higher rates of taxation, primarily because their savings are concentrated in interest-bearing accounts at banks and building societies that are taxed more heavily than other forms of wealth. The poorer half of the population, for example, holds some 60 per cent of its assets in interest-bearing accounts. The richest part of the population, by contrast, holds much of its wealth in specialised financial assets which are given generous tax treatment. Shares, personal equity plans and other investments such as unit trusts account for about half the savings of the richest 5 per cent. The report, which drew on a five-year research programme by NOP involving almost 20,000 individuals, notes that this profile has shifted slightly in recent years, with a fall in the proportion holding interest-bearing accounts. Meanwhile, measures of wealth that include housing and pension funds show a more equal distribution pattern, partly because many owner-occupiers with low financial wealth benefited from house-price rises in the 1980s, the report adds. However, the institute concludes: 'Stocks of housing and pension wealth are the most important - often only - forms of wealth for most households. Only the minority of households have enough liquid financial wealth to provide for unexpected hardship, such as unemployment, before they actually retire.' The Distribution of Wealth in the UK.

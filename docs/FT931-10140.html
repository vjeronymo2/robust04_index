			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Management: Survival of the best qualified - Alan Cane examines the strange case of the vanishing IT directors Information technology directors, sometimes called chief information officers, enjoyed a brief moment of glory in the late 1980s. Since then, they have begun to resemble an endangered species. A surprising number of these highly qualified and capable individuals, including some well-known names, have either resigned or lost their jobs. Michael Earl, a professor at the London Business School, and Philip Vivian of the executive search firm Egon Zehnder were intrigued by the 'mystery of the vanishing CIOs' and set out to compile a survival kit* for what many now acknowledge as the toughest job in a company, combining technical competence with general management abilities. CIOs emerged in the 1980s as the realisation grew that IT could have an influence in a company well beyond cutting administrative costs. IT budgets increased sharply on the promise of computer-based competitive advantage and CIOs were appointed to manage and exploit the technology. But CIOs made chief executives feel insecure. One told Earl and Vivian: 'What keeps me awake at night is not knowing whether my IT director is doing a good job.' Careful comparison between 10 CIO 'survivors' and 10 who had failed to stay in post revealed five significant differences: Relationship building. Survivors actively built relationships with their peers and superiors in ways which enabled them to command support for IT within the organisation. It took time and effort. One survivor claimed it took two years to interest and educate a new senior executive. Non-survivors, on the other hand, fought shy of these relationships. One agreed he did not enjoy 'the diplomacy and politics required in a corporate role'. CEO relationship. Survivors were close to the CEO and enjoyed their support for IT investments. Non-survivors had a poor or non-existent relationship with their chief executive. Typical comments were: 'With successive organisational changes, I became more remote from the managing director and when we had a bad patch, I had no support or sponsor,' or: 'He was the wrong guy to take IT forward; he was obsessed with costs.' Shared IT vision. Survivors worked to create a vision for IT's contribution to the business and made sure it was shared with the company's senior executives. Non-survivors either hugged the vision to their chests: 'The global information systems strategy was my vision alone,' or complained about the lack of one: 'It was a very short-term sort of business.' Sensitivity. Survivors seemed to have a fine sense of which battles to fight and which to avoid: 'Be dynamic, but only in what the company is ready for,' concluded one. Non-survivors, on the other hand, were often at odds with senior management over important policy shifts. 'Being antagonistic once or twice works, but in the long run it is wearing on people,' said one sacked CIO. Credibility. Survivors delivered the goods operationally. 'We are a factory,' one survivor said. 'If the organisation is not satisfied with operations the whole view of IT is affected,' said another. Non-survivors often met neither performance nor financial targets. Survivors also combined technical know-how with social skills and had spent more time in data processing than non-survivors. General managers pressed into the role of CIO prove unsatisfactory, Earl and Vivian conclude. They suggest that chief executives should treat IT as a legitimate 'nursery' for the company's best talent and seek to develop young executives' IT expertise by a spell in data processing. But CIOs find it hard to break out of the IT mould, even at a price. One former CEO and CIO said: 'I want to take up a CEO job again, but I only get offered CIO jobs. I would want four times the rate for being CIO that I would accept for being CEO.' *The role of the Chief Information Officer: a study of survival.

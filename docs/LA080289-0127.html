			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KNEW RISKS IN KIDNAPING, RABIN ASSERTS;  </P> <P> DANGER FOR HOSTAGES 'AND WORSE' WEIGHED, ISRAELI MINISTER SAYS  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today that Israel's abduction of a Muslim  clergyman was carried out in the knowledge that pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon  might kill Western hostages "and worse."  </P> <P> Answering three leftist no-confidence motions in Parliament, Rabin also  disclosed that the Cabinet approved Friday's capture of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid  two months ago.  </P> <P> He said final approval was delayed until "every grain of possibility for  dialogue" had been exhausted on winning the release of three Israeli soldiers  believed held in Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Countries Not Informed  </P> <P> Rabin said Israel did not inform any other country of its intentions to abduct  Obeid. "We didn't include any other country before the action and did not even  offer information about it," he said.  </P> <P> Rabin told Parliament that Israel has rejected an International Red Cross  appeal to visit Obeid, who was abducted along with two associates from the  south Lebanon village of Jibchit.  </P> <P> He said Israel will agree only if the Red Cross is able to visit Israeli  captives.  </P> <P> Rabin defended the Obeid kidnaping against criticism that Israel did not  consider the dangers to foreign hostages.  </P> <P> "We took into consideration all the possible reactions," he said. "We saw them  all, including the actions that already took place, and ones even worse."  </P> <P> A Shiite group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said  it killed Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on Monday after Israel refused to  free Obeid. A second group said another American hostage, Joseph J. Cicippio,  will be killed Thursday unless the cleric is freed.  </P> <P> Israel maintains that Higgins was killed several months ago.  </P> <P> Rabin said the Cabinet approved the abduction of Obeid, a spiritual leader of  the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement that is believed an umbrella group for  hostage-takers in Lebanon, after extensive efforts to gain freedom for its  captured soldiers. He did not detail those efforts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Successful'  </P> <P> He described the abduction of Obeid, whom he accused of involvement in Higgins  kidnap and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers, as "very successful."  </P> <P> The defense minister was interrupted at one point by an Arab member of  Parliament, Mohammed Miari, who chided Rabin for announcing his hostage swap  offer 30 minutes after the deadline set for Higgins' purported hanging.  </P> <P> Communist and Arab legislators accused the government of kidnaping Obeid to  divert attention from efforts to resolve the Palestinian problem and end the  uprising against Israeli occupation.  </P></p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Independent bid seeks to escape monopolies probe The consortium which is close to taking control of The Independent and Independent on Sunday will today urge the Department of Trade and Industry not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The bidding group, which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, will emphasise that the delay and uncertainty of an MMC reference could seriously damage the two newspapers, which face losses of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m this year. DTI approval is the last hurdle after the decision yesterday by independent directors of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the Independent titles, to recommend an improved offer from the Mirror's group which values the company at more than Pounds 74m. The new offer includes an increased cash alternative of 355p - 5p more than the price paid by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland for its stake of just under 30 per cent. The consortium is offering 104.6p in cash and 1.35 new MGN shares. At MGN's share price of 172p at offer announcement, this values the deal at 336.7p. Journalists at The Independent, worried about the editorial independence of the papers, last night renewed their call for a full MMC investigation. If the deal goes through, MGN will have between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the company, but its voting stake will be 10 per cent less than its share stake. Existing Newspaper Publishing shareholders El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy will each hold 20 per cent, but together will have a voting majority. The founders, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith who will become chairman as well as editor-in-chief, will hold about 3 per cent rather than the present 10 per cent. The Irish Independent group will now press for board representation at Newspaper Publishing to reflect its status as the largest single shareholder. The signs are that Mr O'Reilly will not sell his stake but will seek to remain an influential minority shareholder. He has given undertakings to the Takeover Panel not to make a bid worth more than 350p within 12 months. Founder rolls up sleeves, Page 7</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna -- live] </F>   [Text] The nuclear inspection by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], which was supposed to begin in a  full-fledged manner in Yongbyon, North Korea today, has not been  conducted due to North Korea's lack of cooperation.  Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna:    [Cha Man-sun] The full-fledged nuclear inspection of the  seven nuclear sites has not been conducted as scheduled due to  North Korea's lack of cooperation. The inspection team arrived  in Pyongyang on 1 March and coordinated its inspection schedule  in order to begin a full-fledged inspection activity in Yongbyon  today, but due to the North Korean side's lack of cooperation,  such as the delay in the inter-Korean working contact for the  exchange of special envoys, the inspection team has not been  able to begin the inspection activities, it has been learned  today.    David Kyd, IAEA public information officer, disclosed this  and said that the seven-man inspection team is now standing by,  preparing for a full-fledged inspection. Mr. Kyd said that  although the inspection team has not been able to conduct a  full-fledged inspection activity today, he hopes that the  inspection team will begin the inspection activities on 3 March  and that in view of the fact that the IAEA cannot contact the  inspection team at present, the inspectors may be standing by at  the Yongbingwan [guest house] in Yongbyon.    In connection with this, the IAEA today held an emergency ad  hoc meeting and decided to take follow-up measures after  watching developments for a day or two. Meanwhile, an IAEA  official said that the inspection team in North Korea was  scheduled to conduct inspection activities for at least 10 days  and was to inspect the nuclear fission reaction laboratory  facilities of Kim Il-song University in Pyongyang for a few days.</p>

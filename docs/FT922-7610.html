			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Markets resist ripples of gloom OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S problems provided a day of diminishing returns for aficionados of gloom. The group's decision to seek protection from its creditors under Canadian bankruptcy laws helped trigger a sharp fall in Japanese share prices and pushed the Canadian dollar to a two-year low against the US dollar in Asian trading. But losses in European share markets were limited, except for property and certain bank shares, as the perception gained strength that O&amp;Y's problems did not threaten the world's financial system. Analysts said widespread discussion of O&amp;Y's difficulties in recent months meant that most markets were braced for bad news. Canadian financial markets proved again yesterday that O&amp;Y's problems have been less disruptive than many had feared when news of the company's troubles first surfaced in late March. Tokyo bore the full impact of the bankruptcy filing, which came after working hours on Thursday in Toronto. The 225 Nikkei share index closed down 730.33 points, or 3.88 per cent. Among weaker banks and real estate issues, Dai-Ichi Kangyo bank lost 170 points to 1,250, reflecting press reports that its exposure to O&amp;Y could be as high at Dollars 500m. Analysts said the Japanese market's adverse reaction to the news partly reflected its own worries about falling real estate prices. London's FTSE-100 index lost 20.8 points in its first five minutes of trading, as some bank and property stocks were hit by the O&amp;Y crisis. But the index partly recovered in dull trading to close at 2,682.6, down 12.1. Barclays Bank, which lost 11p in early trading because of its Dollars 200m exposure to O&amp;Y, closed down 6p at 380p. Wall Street stock prices fell, with banks - led by Citicorp - particularly hard hit in heavy trading. Early hopes that the O&amp;Y affair would encourage the Federal Reserve to announce a further cut in interest rates faded. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 15.79 points at 3,353.09. Canadian bonds and treasury bills ended the day stronger while the stock market in Toronto soon recovered from the initial shock of O&amp;Y. The TSE 300 index closed 3 points up at 3,391.0. The Canadian dollar recovered from its Asian lows with the help of central bank intervention. The Bank of Canada intervened to support the dollar late on Thursday night, after the currency dived by almost three-quarters of a cent to 82.47 US cents. By the end of trading yesterday, the dollar was back above 83 US cents. Foreign exchange dealers in London said several central banks, including the Bank of England, intervened to prop up the Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada signalled to the markets that it would support its currency while a statement yesterday afternoon that the Canadian government would not be prepared to help O&amp;Y out of its difficulties temporarily boosted confidence in the currency, one London dealer said. Paris also felt the backwash of O&amp;Y as bank shares headed lower in early trading. But the market made good its losses, with the CAC-40 index closing 6.95 points or 0.34 per cent higher at 2,023.95. Swiss shares in Zurich closed about one per cent lower after some selling of banks because of O&amp;Y.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGASSI WENT TOO FAR WITH BAD BEHAVIOR IN DAVIS CUP MATCHES  </P> <P> In reporting Andre Agassi's arrogance in the Davis Cup competition, Bill Dwyre  did not go far enough.  </P> <P> I was appalled when Agassi used a young ball boy to further his "playing to the  crowd." To make matters worse, the announcers on TV joined the crowd in  laughter at this youngster's expense as he made his way back to courtside with  a very red face.  </P> <P> If Agassi is the best we have to offer in the Davis Cup, then I suggest we drop  out of the competition.  </P> <P> RUBY SCOTT  </P> <P> San Simeon  </P></p>

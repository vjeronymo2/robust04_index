In a  recent interview with station correspondent Li Xiaoqi, Zhou Nan,  member of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee and director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch,  specially spoke about Comrade Deng Xiaoping's farsightedness and  great insight as regards the Hong Kong issue.    Zhou Nan said: [begin recording] With his farsightedness  and great insight, Comrade Xiaoping long ago said we are not  worried about the future of Hong Kong after 1997, because the  Chinese people and their government will honor their words after  1997. What we are worried about is the transitional period. As  of (?1984) there were still more than a dozen years before the  transitional period came to an end. He was worried that  problems might occur during this time. Some might try to create  disturbances. He particularly mentioned that these disturbances  could be created chiefly by the British. Further, he also issued  certain warnings to the British, asking them not to engage in  certain acts such as removing all money reserves or wasting  money in a flagrant manner. At the same time, he also warned  them not to attempt to put together a ruling apparatus to impose  on the special autonomous region. It turned out these are the  very things the British are doing. Everything Comrade Xiaoping  warned them about doing at the time has been done by them. [end  recording]</p>

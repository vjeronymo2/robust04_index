			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: US markets US markets have been strikingly unanimous in signalling expectations of economic recovery this week. The dollar and equities have risen, if with some hesitation on the part of the latter yesterday: the bond market has been soft. This determination to call the turn is all the more curious given the absence of hard evidence that recovery is under way. On the contrary, Tuesday's retail sales figures pointed to continuing weakness. Pessimists would argue there is no general message in the various market trends. Thus, it may not be so much a case of dollar strength as of D-Mark weakness, caused by worries about strike action in Germany. The bond market faces a glut of Treasury issues over the next few weeks. Investors are switching into equities from low-yielding money market funds. It nevertheless seems increasingly likely that last month's discount rate cut has in fact laid the ground for recovery. There is increased scope both for corporations and consumers to improve their cash flow by refinancing debt, and for higher banking margins which should stimulate credit growth. The uncertainty for the markets is thus not whether an upturn is on the way, but more over its strength and timing. It may not set in until the second quarter or even later. Until then, there is a risk of setbacks. Negative indicators may yet discourage equity investors and prompt the exchange market to question how quickly interest rates will harden again. In any case, at these levels the equity market is already pushing its luck. It could not advance much further without appearing to discount a boom. That would be self-defeating, as the Federal Reserve would be forced once again to slam on the brakes.</p>

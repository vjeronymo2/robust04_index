			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B.A. Katsnelson, V.S. Bezel and L.K. Konysheva, </F> Medical Scientific Center for Prevention and Health Protection  at Industrial Plants, Yekaterinburg; UDC 613.632-07:001.5]    [Abstract] Descriptive analysis was conducted on the  application of compartmental models in toxokinetics, using  examples dealing with several Cr. F, B, Pb and Zn compounds. A  review of available information points to the advantages of the  compartmental approach to the pharmacokinetics of toxicants,  rather than reliance on a generalized system data. The key  factor in compartmental analysis is the flexibility with which  individual tissues, organs or body fluids of interest can be  monitored and analyzed for kinetic parameters, with information  on the different compartments then combined for an overall  assessment.

Sources  feared it might have been an inside job by rightwingers. The  military and not police were carrying out initial investigations.    Though SAAF [South African Air Force] spokesmen were unable  to quantify the extent of the haul from 10 Air Force Depot in  Voortrekkerhoogte, sources said the raid entailed "more weapons  than rightwinger Piet `Skiet' Rudolph's arms haul from SAAF  headquarters".    Senior air force personnel will be briefed on the  investigation on Tuesday before a media statement is released.  SAAF spokesman Colonel Tommy Michell confirmed the military was  investigating the crime.</p>

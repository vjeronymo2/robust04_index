			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The negotiations between Thailand and the United  States on double taxation failed to reach agreement. The U.S.  wanted an agreement that was spelled out clearly, while the Thai  side conducted the negotiations flexibly. The Thai side will  review its position in the new round of talks scheduled for  mid-October.    Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said he received a  report  from the Revenue Department's M.R. Chatumongkon Sonakun, who  negotiated on a double taxation protocol in the United States  7-11 February. According to Chatumongkon, negotiations did not  achieve desired results. He attributed this to the U.S. side  wanting the Thai side to base the negotiations on legal  references or clear terms because it had to submit the finished  protocol--a legal documen--for congressional consideration.  Vagueness could result in rejection by the congress.    Chatumongkon said the Thai side engaged in negotiations  ready  to compromise in certain areas, and it did indeed compromise on  several points. However, the United States insisted that the  Thai side produce a legal document spelling out every point,  including permanent business establishment, business, and  investment taxes. The negotiations failed as a result.    Chatumongkon said the Thai side will have to review the  double taxation protocol in two areas. First, Thailand will  have to draft a clear protocol for a new round of talks in  mid-October. Second, Thailand has to assess whether the United  States really wants to conclude a protocol. This is because the  failure of previous negotiations was largely caused by the  United States wanting Thailand to alter numerous points or  shifting its positions constantly.</p>

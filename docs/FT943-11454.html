			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets braced for rate rise: Bank of England's dealings lead traders to expect half-point increase Financial markets yesterday signalled their expectation of an imminent rise in UK interest rates. This was based on Bank of England dealings in the money markets which persuaded many traders that a half percentage point increase was likely. Although the markets found the Bank's dealings confusing, anxiety about a rise in rates prompted selling in the futures market. By the close last night, short sterling, the futures market's medium for speculating on interest rate changes, pointed to short-term rates of over 6 per cent by September compared with base rates currently at 5.25 per cent. The prospect of higher rates bolstered the pound which finished in London at DM2.4413, more than 2 pfennigs up on Thursday's close of DM2.4195. The Bank yesterday accepted bids for Treasury bills - short-term debt issued by the government - at rates of up to 5.75 per cent, half a point above current base rates. That was interpreted by some traders as a sign that base rates would rise shortly, either on Monday morning or on Tuesday when the Bank publishes its quarterly inflation report. In its daily operations, however, the Bank dealt at unchanged rates, before and after the Treasury bill auction. These activities are the Bank's traditional method of signalling its desired level of base rates. While some economists now expect base rates to rise by half a point next week, others thought the Bank did not intend to increase rates and had merely miscalculated the market's reaction to the Treasury bill announcement. In the confusion, many talked of 'mismanagement' by the Bank. The result of yesterday's auction is that the Bank is paying more to borrow money than it is receiving for lending it, a position which cannot last for an extended period. Markets were already jittery about a possible base rate rise, with evidence of inflationary pressure in the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly survey, released on Tuesday, and in the purchasing managers' index, announced yesterday. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, held their monthly monetary meeting on Thursday. Interest rate decisions are taken at the monthly meetings although the timing of the change is left to the Bank. Speculation about rate changes is accordingly at its peak in the days following the meeting. Trade in short sterling reached more than 210,000 contracts, the highest volume this year. The September contract lost 33 basis points to close at 93.95. The FT-SE 100 index fell by 26.2 points at one stage before closing 13.3 points down on the day at 3,082.6.

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURRAY PROVIDES GOOD NEWS;  </P> <P> DODGERS: HE STAYS HOT IN 8-1 VICTORY OVER BRAVES, BUT HAMILTON WILL NOT RETURN  THIS SEASON AND HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO HAVE MORE SURGERY ON HIS SHOULDER.  </P> <P> It was evident Thursday in the clanging balls off the outfield seats, the oohs  of the fans, the slaps of the high-fives that suddenly reappeared in the home  team's dugout.  </P> <P> The Dodgers are never so loud as when they are pulled along by Eddie Murray.  </P> <P> Led by the first baseman who seemingly hasn't taken a bad swing in a week, the  Dodgers defeated the Atlanta Braves, 8-1, before 31,461 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Murray extended his hitting streak to six games by showing all of his best  stuff. He hit his 15th homer. He doubled. He fought off a fastball for a  check-swing RBI single. And he drew a walk after falling behind 0-and-2.  </P> <P> "When Eddie hits," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said, "we score runs."  </P> <P> Murray's efforts, plus a homer by Kal Daniels and nine other Dodger hits, gave  Tim Belcher his fourth win in five starts. And Belcher didn't even have to  throw a one-hitter. He was removed after six innings, during which he allowed  one run on three hits to improve his record to 9-7.  </P> <P> The evening provided the Dodgers with some much-needed good news, because soon  they will receive the disturbing news that injured Jeff Hamilton will not play  again this season.  </P> <P> Before Thursday's game, Hamilton said he has decided to either undergo a second  shoulder surgery or rest the shoulder until next year.  </P> <P> The Dodger third baseman, who has been on the disabled list since April 21 and  underwent arthroscopic surgery May 4, reached the decision after an exam  Tuesday by Dr. Frank Jobe. Hamilton's shoulder has continually hurt since the  surgery, such that he can't lift a suitcase or even swat at a bug without  discomfort.  </P> <P> Jobe recommended a month of complete rest, and then more extensive surgery if  the shoulder did not improve. Such a surgery would require as much as six  months of rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Hamilton said he does not like the idea of surgery on a problem that is still  ambiguous, and he does not think that a month of rest will help.  </P> <P> "So I offered my own option, of not doing anything until next year," said  Hamilton, who has not taken batting practice for 10 days and is still in pain.  "And I will do one or the other. Right now, I feel like taking the second  option and avoiding surgery, but my mind changes every minute. Either way, I am  done for the year."  </P> <P> Jobe said Hamilton's problems could be caused by the location of the rotator  cuff tear, which he discovered but did not fix during the first surgery because  the tear was located in the substance of the tendon instead of tearing clear  through the tendon.  </P> <P> "Usually when it's in the substance like that, it will heal with rest and  rehabilitation," Jobe said Thursday. "But with Jeff, it hasn't gone that well."  </P> <P> Jobe said he did not think avoiding surgery would be a good choice.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's a viable option for this reason: If it doesn't heal over  the winter, then he is lost for next year, too," Jobe said. "He has to think  about his career."  </P> <P> Hamilton's absence has been softened by fine season from platoon replacements  Lenny Harris and Mike Sharperson, who had three hits Thursday against  right-handed pitching while making his first major league start at shortstop.  Combined, Harris and Sharperson are hitting .308.  </P> <P> The entire Dodger offense has played well in this home stand. Led by Murray,  they have accounted for 30 runs on 46 hits in four games.  </P> <P> During his six-game streak, during which the third-place Dodgers have won four  games to pull to within 11 games of division-leading Cincinnati, Murray has 11  hits in 23 at-bats for a .478 average. He has three homers and eight runs  batted in and has scored eight runs. Overall, he has increased his average to  .305 with a team-leading 51 RBIs.  </P> <P> "The ball has just been falling, that's all," Murray said. "A sign of how good  you are going is how many different things are happening to your hits. To hit  .300, you either have to be able to run, or you have to get some bleeders and  bloopers and things like that. I just hope the balls keep falling."  </P> <P> Also in impressive streaks are the two men who hit in front of Murray. Kirk  Gibson, who doubled and scored a run Thursday, has hit in four consecutive  games with a .378 average during that time. Daniels, who added a single to his  15th homer, has an eight-game hitting streak.  </P> <P> Considering the three men have been playing in the same lineup with some  consistency only since June 2, the Dodgers must wonder what an extra two months  would have meant to their pennant chances.  </P> <P> "Everybody is starting to feel comfortable together," Sharperson said. "That  makes a difference."  </P> <P> With the score tied, 1-1, in the sixth inning Thursday, Belcher made the  Dodgers uncomfortable by walking Jim Presley and Dave Justice to start the  inning. But then he struck out Tommy Gregg after Gregg fouled off eight pitches  and retired Jeff Blauser on a foul to the catcher. After walking Greg Olson  with the bases loaded, Belcher fooled pitcher Marty Clary into a groundout to  end a 41-pitch inning.  </P> <P> "I felt like I was pitching a doubleheader out there," said Belcher, who was  made a winner when Daniels led off the sixth with his tiebreaking home run.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> If his rehabilitation continues as scheduled, Orel Hershiser will be pitching  batting practice before the end of the season. According to Dr. Frank Jobe, the  Dodgers want Hershiser to enter the winter phase of his rehabilitation with  some of his pitching rhythm. "Even if you get the shoulder strong and get a  full range of motion, you still need to do a tremendous amount work on the  rhythm of throwing because of the way that rhythm affects the shoulder," Jobe  said. "Before the season ends, we would like for Orel to start working on that  rhythm and mechanics."  </P> <P> The preliminary hearing in the Pittsburgh City Court for infielders Alfredo  Griffin and Juan Samuel on charges of simple assault has been postponed from  July 31 to Aug. 27. The Dodgers are off that day, and play in Philadelphia the  next day, so the players will be able to attend. Griffin, who is still  suffering from a swollen eye and is scheduled for another examination today.  Mike Sharperso had appeared in five games at shortstop in his 2 1/2-year  career.  </P> <P> Bill Bene, the Dodgers' first pick in the June, 1988 draft, fell to 1-9 for  Class-A Vero Beach Wednesday by giving up five runs in one-third of an inning  with five walks. . . . After a celebrated shave earlier this season, Rick  Dempsey is growing his mustache back. . . . The California Egg Commission,  which sponsors today's autographed ball giveaway, will be interested to see  that the prominent autograph underneath their logo belongs to Willie Randolph,  who has not been a Dodger since May 13.  </P></p>

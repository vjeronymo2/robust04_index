			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Kandinsky study may reach Pounds 5m: Saleroom AN IMPORTANT work by Wassily Kandinsky, arguably the first great abstract painter of the 20th century, is to come under the hammer at Sotheby's in London in December. Kandinsky gave it to the artist Paul Klee, whose grandson has submitted it for auction. Sotheby's anticipates a price of about Pounds 5m. 'Sketch 1' is a signed and dated oil study for Kandinsky's most innovative abstract painting of 1913, 'Composition VII', which hangs in the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow. The auction house describes it as one of the two most important works by the artist to have appeared at auction in the past 30 years. The other is 'Fugue' of 1914 which the Guggenheim Museum sold in 1990 - at the peak of the market - for Dollars 20.9m. 'Sketch 1' is among four paintings estimated at more than Pounds 4m and some 14 valued at more than Pounds 1m to be offered by Sotheby's and Christie's in London and New York this autumn. 'It is reassuring to find top-quality works of art returning to the market after an interval of two years', commented Mr Simon de Pury, deputy chairman of Sotheby's Europe.</p>

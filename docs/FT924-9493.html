			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Aid shortfall 'will lead to casualties': Vance warns on Bosnia HEAVY casualties in Bosnia-Hercegovina because of the failure to meet its humanitarian aid needs are inevitable this winter, warned Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairman of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia. While urging the delivery of humanitarian aid to be stepped up to besieged cities in Bosnia, Mr Vance has called on all three sides in the Bosnian conflict to accept the proposed constitution as the basis for a political solution. But despite optimism expressed, in particular, by Lord Owen, Mr Vance's co-chairman, that all sides were prepared to use the document as a negotiating platform, its rejection by Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serbs, threatens this centrepiece of the Geneva conference. The draft document envisages a state divided into 7-10 provinces along regional and not ethnic lines. The hostility of the Bosnian Serbs hardened last weekend when their assembly, in the north Bosnian town of Prijedor, dismissed any such constitutional solution imposed on them from outside. The assembly decided to pull out of the conference unless the talks recognised the self-declared Serb Republic of Bosnia. Mr Karadzic has said that the only basis for solution is an agreement signed in Lisbon on March 18. This agreement, which was first accepted but subsequently rejected by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, called for the creation of three ethnic 'cantons' amounting to a de facto division of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Yesterday Mr Karadzic said Bosnian Serbs had agreed to continue Geneva negotiations on the understanding that their demand for three to five cantons would be discussed alongside the proposal by the international mediators. In September, Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, his Yugoslav counterpart, signed the Geneva agreement, which would form the basis of a peace treaty between Serbs and Croats. This has increased fears among Bosnia's Moslems that Croatia and Yugoslavia intend to divide the republic between them. But Mr Vance has made it clear that the international community will not accept this. Mr Vance also reiterated that the results of 'ethnic cleansing' must be reversed, although United Nations and European Community officials admit that enforcing this would be almost impossible, even if a political breakthrough were achieved in Geneva. Many refugees have nowhere to return to. A 200-strong advance party of Canadian troops being sent to northern Bosnia has been obstructed by local authorities in the region of Banja Luka, a Serb-held stronghold. General Philippe Morillon, commander of the UN force in Bosnia, is to try over the next two days to resolve deployment problems amid reports of fighting at Olovo, north of Sarajevo, and at Brcko, northern Bosnia.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Management: Rail network runs along new lines - Radical changes to Italy's inefficient and overmanned state system Remember Lord Beeching, the axeman of British Railways who launched the first pre-Thatcherite onslaught on the UK's overblown public sector? Today there is a remarkable parallel with the FS, the Italian state railways under the management of Lorenzo Necci. Europe's most inefficient and overmanned rail network is being given a radical face lift, slimmed down and partially privatised. Endowed with its first business plan worthy of the name, the FS is due to become a publicly-quoted company at the end of this month. The FS, with the treasury as sole shareholder, will act as a holding company for a network of subsidiaries - some of which will include private capital - covering every activity from property development, through to freight, high-speed trains and computer software. When Necci was brought in as special administrator of the FS in June 1990, the railways had been through a series of disastrous management experiences. It took him until last May to present a business plan and he did so on a take it or leave it basis. He wanted things done his way. In the event, he had little difficulty in gaining support for a new mandate. 'The basic problem in the FS has been one of management,' says Necci, whose main experience has been in the state sector - working with ENI, the national oil concern, and latterly running their chemicals side. He believes in management by objectives and leadership from the top. He inherited a railway in which only 5,000km of the 16,000km of track was considered economic (essentially the north-south Milan-Naples route). Productivity on the basis of units of traffic per employee was 70 per cent less than the French railways and a third less than that of Germany. Passenger tariffs were, and remain, one-third of those in other EC countries. Not surprisingly the FS last year had an operating loss of L9,429bn (Pounds 4.48bn). One of his first priorities was to tackle overmanning. Since June 1990, the number of jobs has dropped by about 20 per cent from 208,000 to 165,000. This is the most concentrated reduction in manpower ever carried out by an Italian state entity and has been done with remarkably little labour protest from a traditionally powerful sector of the union movement. A further 40,000 jobs could go in the next seven years. The secret has been a generous system of early retirement, funded largely by the state but with FS contributing L700bn a year. Necci has recruited 60 new managers. With these he has transformed the old pyramidical FS management structure, based on departments with limited responsibility, by creating nine divisions. These group homogenous activities such as passenger traffic, freight and asset management, and give management operational responsibility for running their own profit centres and investment programmes. The central board under Necci concentrates on co-ordination, strategic planning and relations with the government. The philosophy behind the new FS management is twofold. First, it must shift FS from its previous status as a mere operator-administrator of a loss-making public service to a profit-conscious service, responsive to the public and industry. Second, it must tailor its activities to the financial constraints of the treasury and the possibilities of attracting private capital. In theory the state will only intervene in a regulatory way and in the form of a reguarly-reviewed agreement stipulating those investments deemed entrepreneurial and those considered socially necessary (like the maintenance of uneconomic track). It remains to be seen whether FS can find sufficient resources both for capital needs and to cover its share of projected losses without resort to its new shareholder, the treasury. The hardest conundrum to resolve is that of raising the currently-frozen freight tariffs and fares. Necci has to accommodate both government anti-inflation policy and attract new custom while bringing prices into line with the rest of Europe. This could mean premiums on the most popular routes, already signalled by the effective separation of the 'economic' 5,000 km of track from the rest. Some routes will be closed if they attract less than 30 passengers a day, although the bulk of the uneconomic track is expected to be run on behalf of the regions. Private sector involvement centres on three areas - the proposed high-speed train network, property development and information technology. The most important of these is TAV, which will develop the high-speed train network owned 60 per cent by FS and 40 per cent by Italian and foreign institutional investors. Current estimates for a Milan-Naples north-south link and Venice-Turin east-west axis are about L25,000bn. Another proposed link is Turin-Lyon. For its part, the FS hopes to raise funds not only in the market but through property divestment and development, the latter with private sector partners. A new FS company, Metropolis, will develop stations, track and FS's extensive property holdings. Given the huge projected costs of the high-speed train network, Necci runs the risk of finding this project sucking the bulk of funds at the expense of maintenance and modernisation of the rest of the railways. The difficulty of finding funds also suggests the high-speed train project will move slower than anticipated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan will extend emergency  aid totaling 9 million dollars to international organizations to  help the victims of the conflict in Rwanda, the Foreign Ministry  said Friday [10 June].    The aid consists of 6.45 million dollars to the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees, 2.4 million dollars to the  International Committee of the Red Cross and 150,000 dollars to  the World Health Organization, the ministry said.    The conflict in Rwanda has been expanding and intensifying  since disputes erupted between government and anti-government  troops in early April. The ministry quoted UN sources as saying  more than 500,000 people have died as a result of the fighting  and massacres, while about 3 million people have either left  their homes or fled to Tanzania, Burundi, Zaire and Uganda.    But despite efforts by humanitarian organizations, the  victims of the conflict are in disastrous condition because of  the lack of food, drinking water and medical goods, the ministry  said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs (e) and (f) are extensions of paragraph (d) and would require the Ranger, as part of the written authorization process for the Snake Wild and Scenic River, to make sure that both private and commercial rivercraft users are reasonably accommodated, and that the user capacity of the river is not exceeded, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, paragraph (g) would require the Ranger to identify and minimize to the extent practicable any existing or potential conflicts between motorized and non-motorized rivercraft users or between rivercraft users in general and other individuals like fishermen or researchers who may use or enjoy the Wild and Scenic Rivers in the HCNRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These standards and guidelines have been narrowly tailored to address those specific types of rivercraft use on those specific river segments where the greatest potential risk exists to the agency's ability to administer the HCNRA in such a way as to protect and enhance its natural, cultural, recreational, fishery and other resource values. With respect to the use of rivercraft, the greatest risk is currently presented by the use of motorized rivercraft on the Snake Wild and Scenic River. As a result, most of the standards and guidelines in this section pertain to that use on that river. Though the authority exists, it was deemed unnecessary to establish additional standards for other Wild and Scenic Rivers or other rivers in the HCNRA at this time to address future contingencies which may or may not ultimately materialize.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 292.46&blank;Timber Harvesting Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;292.46 would establish three standards to guide Forest Service administration of timber harvesting activities on National Forest System lands in the HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(2) set forth the standards and guidelines for timber harvesting activities in the Other Lands category of the HCNRA; proposed paragraph (b) establishes the standard in the Wilderness Lands. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and regulations at 36 CFR part 223, 261 and 293 would also apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) would specify that timber will not be harvested solely for commercial gain but, rather, will be harvested only in conjunction with other, non-commercial purposes including maintenance or improvement of ecosystem health, wildlife habitat, or the recreational use and enjoyment of the HCNRA. Trees could also be removed to eliminate hazards to persons or their property. Finally, timber harvesting could also be employed as an appropriate and measured response to natural events including, but not limited to, fire, flood, and disease or pest infestation. The significance of this provision is that it does not provide for timber production in and of itself to be an objective of the timber harvesting activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those instances where one or more of the purposes for which timber may be harvested is recognized, paragraph (a)(2) conditions the manner by which the timber may be harvested. These silvicultural prescriptions authorize timber harvesting only by means of selective or intermediate cuttings. For the purpose of this proposed rule, the term ``selective cutting'' means ``selection cutting'' as that term is defined by the Society of American Foresters. The Agency believes that the Act, in discussing the permissible types of silvicultural prescriptions in the HCNRA, incorrectly used the term ``selective cutting'' which is a type of exploitation cutting generally referred to as ``creaming'', ``culling'', or ``high-grading''. For that reason, the Agency defined ``selective cutting'' as ``selection cutting'' which is, in all likelihood, the term Congress intended to use in the Act and which means the annual or periodic removal of trees individually or in small groups. The other types of authorized cuttings are well understood within the forestry profession and are defined in the proposed rule as they appear in the book,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terminology of Forest Science Technology Practice and Products <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , published by the Society of American Foresters. These types of cuttings represent the most ecologically sensitive methods by which harvesting can be accomplished. Additional proposed restrictions on harvesting in this proposed section include requirements that the smallest area and least number of clearings be created, and that the clearings blend into the natural landscape to the extent practicable. These provisions would ensure that any timber harvesting allowable within the HCNRA would proceed as unobtrusively as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (b) explains that there are no non-duplicative regulations needed for managing timber harvesting activities in wilderness areas of the HCNRA since such use is already generally prohibited by the Wilderness Act. Accordingly, it merely restates the existing prohibition and provides cross references to exceptions permitted in the Wilderness Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 292.47&blank;Mining Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed 292.47 would establish six standards to guide Forest Service administration of mining activities throughout the entire HCNRA. Proposed paragraphs (a)(1)&hyph;(4) set forth the standards and guidelines for mining activities in the Other Lands category of the HCNRA; proposed paragraphs (b)(1)&hyph;(2) establish the standards for the Wilderness Lands category. Though not explicitly referenced, the relevant provisions of the 1872 Mining Law, 30 U.S.C. 22  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. 181  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, 30 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. 1131  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and regulations at 36 CFR parts 228 and 293 would also apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) prohibits mining activities in the HCNRA subject to valid existing rights. This is a restatement of Section 11 of the Act which withdrew all federal lands within the HCNRA from the operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws subject to valid existing rights. Accordingly, the only authorized mining activities that may occur in the HCNRA are those in which the valid existing rights have been established. Holders of mining claims and mineral leases must demonstrate that they have valid existing rights before land disturbing activities can be initiated. This requirement would also extend to what in common parlance has become known as ``recreational mining.'' There is no authority for recreational mining other than the statutes cited in the preceding paragraph. Thus, even if an operator claims that an activity involving the exploration and/or extraction of mineral resources is ``recreational'' in nature, that operator must prove that he or she has valid existing rights to conduct that activity under one of the aforementioned statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

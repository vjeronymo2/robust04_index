			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE AT STATE LEVEL  </P> <P> Even if McDowell is correct that debate of the abortion issue on a  state-by-state basis is desirable to achieve grass-roots involvement, I find  the entire process as absurd and wasteful as the 13th-Century obsession with  how many angels can fit on the head of a pin.  </P> <P> We can never resolve, to everyone's satisfaction, when a fetus achieves  personhood nor under what circumstances a woman has the right to decide to  terminate her pregnancy. These are tough moral questions which will be answered  in different ways by persons holding different beliefs within our religiously  diverse culture. If the Supreme Court had abided by the constitutional  restraint separating church views from state authority, it would have upheld  the wisdom of Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> As the majority of Americans can envision some situation in which abortion  should be allowed, the wise legislator will refuse to curtail the right of any  woman to make her decision with whatever spiritual advice she may choose.  </P> <P> Let legislators and all of us who are concerned with the right to life direct  our energies and our tax dollars toward providing children, whom we all agree  are persons, with their right to quality care, educational opportunities, and  protection from abuse.  </P> <P> KAREN BLANCHARD, M.D.  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

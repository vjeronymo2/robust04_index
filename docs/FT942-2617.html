			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / MPs beef up inquiry into CSA structure The Commons social security committee is to undertake 'root and branch' examination of the Child Support Agency amid mounting concern about the organisation's structure and competence. The committee, which began taking evidence this week, had intended only to examine the possibility of changes to the formula by which absent fathers make maintenance payments to their families. But MPs on the committee are now to make the inquiry much wider. One committee member said: 'The focus is moving away from the operation of the formula to the competence and efficiency of the CSA itself.' The government has repeatedly said that it is keeping the operations of the CSA under constant review, amid signs that officials are increasingly swamped by complaints from absent fathers about the level of maintenance payments they are forced to make. But the widening of the social security committee's inquiry is another sign that pressure is mounting on ministers to introduce primary legislation to reform the agency during the next session of parliament. Most of the committee's recommendations from their first report into the CSA, published last year, were implemented by the government. Ministers privately acknowledge that the committee's next report, due in October, will be examined for its insights. An official at the Department of Social Security acknowledged this week that some reforms would need primary legislation. For example, changes to the principle whereby 'clean break' settlements between divorced couples cannot be offset against maintenance payments, would require a parliamentary bill. One of the factors that has heightened the committee's concern is what one Tory described as an apparent 'breakdown' in the CSA's system of enforcement. He said there appeared to be a 'concerted campaign not to pay maintenance on behalf of absent parents'. But he warned: 'Absent parents are not going to get away with it . . . There is an absolute determination in the committee and the government that absent parents shall pay a realistic amount of maintenance.' The committee is also worried by growing evidence that neither the CSA's first annual report nor its business plan will be published in this parliamentary session.</p>

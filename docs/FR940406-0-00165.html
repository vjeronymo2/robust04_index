			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative or refueling emission control systems by component addition, deletion, or substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section if approved in advance by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart C of this part are applicable to Selective Enforcement Audit testing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;90(a), and may drain the test fuel from other than the lowest point of the fuel tank as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;90(b), provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available to the Administrator upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under &sect;86.140&hyph;94, the manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in the sample collection bags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The manufacturer need not comply with &sect;86.142&hyph;90 since the records required therein are provided under other provisions of this subpart K.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) In addition to the requirements of subpart C of this part, the manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles as follows prior to exhaust emission testing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a pressure of 14.5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.5 inches of water (3.6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.1 Kpa) to the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the fuel system from the pressure source.

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investment Offshore Centres (5): Room for expansion - Isle Of Man THE Isle of Man finance industry is very buoyant and, with plenty of space available for expansion, the island expects considerable growth in that sector over the next few years. The strict regulatory framework, built over the past eight years, is regarded by Manx-based institutions as helpful rather than onerous. The industry and the Manx government are monitoring developments of the single European market, but more with a view to spotting potential for business rather than through fear of loss of business. The Isle of Man, which has its own parliament, is not a full member of the EC, but as a crown dependency of the UK has a special relationship with it. It can export certain products, not financial, into the EC but is not eligible for grant aid. Most island-based institutions have felt no need to be situated inside the EC boundaries. However, Clerical Medical and Target International have opened Luxembourg offices in addition to their bank space to comply with EC regulations that required fund administration to be in situ. Barclays Unicorn moved its operation from the island to consolidate all its offshore work in Luxembourg. The island's financial industry and its attitude to business have changed considerably in the past decade. In the seventies and early eighties naivety and an urgent need for economic expansion left the island open to the ploys of dubious entrepreneurs and practitioners. But the much-publicised Pounds 42m crash of the Savings and Investment Bank in 1982 deeply scarred the island. It forced upon its legislators the realisation that there is much more to operating a finance sector than rudimentary checks. Since the Financial Supervision Commission was instituted in 1983 it has doggedly pursued and addressed areas within the finance industry that left the island open to abuse. The commission is on the side of the investor, but has remained sensitive to legitimate needs of the industry and production of legislation always involves lengthy consultation with members of the industry. Mr Jim Noakes, director of the Finance Supervision Commission, said: 'If we can establish the broad area of common interest between regulator and regulated in safeguarding the customer, it's easier to isolate the cowboys.' The banking sector continues to grow with two new institutions licensed in the past 12 months, bringing the total up to 60 including the building societies. Last year the commission announced it was opening the doors for managed banks, but sought only those with sound, internationally reputable parents. So far three have been set up. Private banking is on the increase and in line with other jurisdiction most island-based banks have set up trust administration arms, using their international branch networks to build the client base. Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, NatWest, Bank of Scotland and others offer specialised trust administration. Insurance forms a large part of the Manx finance industry and big life assurance companies, such as Eagle Star, Royal Life and Safe Assurance of the Danish Trygg group, have centred their offshore businesses there. The growth of captive insurance companies in the Isle of Man reflects the solid base of expertise available in this field. Last year the island secured 30 per cent of captives formed worldwide and to date 102 captives have been formed. These include such leading companies as Jaguar, British Gas and Midland Electricity Board. Investor protection is high on the priorities with legislation for deposit and investor protection schemes passed this year. The schemes mirror those in the UK, with deposit protection of maximum 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 covered and investor protection of maximum Pounds 48,000. Trust and company formation and administration constitute a large proportion of the finance sector but many professionals see this area as the weak link in the chain of respectability and would like to see more control. The three classes of company available are resident, tax-exempt and non-resident. Tax-exempt are managed from the island but carry on business elsewhere and are limited to certain types of business. Non-resident are managed and do business elsewhere and the degree of anonymity this allows leaves their use open to abuse. So far the authorities have refused to eliminate the non-resident company as an entity, in spite of this having been achieved in the Channel Islands. Licensing of trust and company administration is being discussed as an option. Mr Mark Solly, a partner in the accountancy firm Moore Stephens and a former director of the Financial Supervision Commission, feels this may prove difficult. He says the key to cleaning up the act is to insist on accountability within the company by ensuring all companies have at least one Manx director. 'I believe there are too many difficulties to introduce a licensing system to make people responsible for companies they formed, and over which they subsequently have no control,' he said. While banks and reputable firms forming and administering trusts and companies carry out rigorous checks on potential clients, unfortunately there are still some practitioners who do not. Consequently the Manx fraud squad has more than a full-time job dealing with inquiries from law enforcement agencies abroad. The majority of these involve a Manx non-resident company. But the authorities recognise this gap in the legislation and Mr Noakes says it is now their No 1 priority. Serious consultation on the issue is under way between the authorities and members of the industry.</p>

A Foreign Ministry source told Interfax on Thursday [13  January] that refugees were held up by opposition detachments  based in Afghanistan's Konduz Province.    The source said the last meeting between Tajik and Afghan  officials to discuss the refugees' repatriation took place near  the Afghan town of Shir Khan on Wednesday.    Representatives of the Konduz governor once again assured  the  Tajik side that they would take urgent measures to unblock the  road between the town of Konduz and the Shir Khan port to enable  the refugees to return.</p>

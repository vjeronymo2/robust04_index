			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOLPHINS WIN DESPITE FIVE TURNOVERS, 17-10;  </P> <P> AFC: BLOCKED PUNT HELPS MIAMI BEAT NEW ENGLAND IN SLOPPY GAME.  </P> <P> The Miami Dolphins have improved so much they can win even when they play  poorly.  </P> <P> Stingy defense and Mark Higgs' touchdown on a blocked punt helped the Dolphins  overcome five turnovers Thursday night as they beat the New England Patriots,  17-10, to assume sole possession of first place in the AFC East.  </P> <P> The Dolphins (5-1), seeking their first playoff berth since 1985, took a  half-game lead over the Buffalo Bills, who play the New York Jets Sunday. The  Patriots (1-5) sustained their fourth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> An 11-day layoff left both teams looking sloppy. Miami won despite numerous  dropped passes, an interception and four lost fumbles, including one in the  Patriots' end zone.  </P> <P> "You've got to look at how poorly we played offensively, and you can't be happy  about that," Miami Coach Don Shula said. "It seemed like everything you could  do wrong you did. The defense just kept the offense in it."  </P> <P> New England had 34 yards in the first half and 197 in the game against the  Dolphins' defense, ranked fourth in the NFL. Miami stopped the Patriots on 14  of their 18 third-down situations.  </P> <P> "Things went bad for the offense tonight," said Miami defensive end Jeff Cross,  who had one of five sacks for the Dolphins and leads the league with eight. "We  know there'll be days like this. We just hung in there and did enough to get  the job done and win."  </P> <P> The Dolphins had all five turnovers in the first half, but they still led 10-3  because of Higgs' 19-yard return of a blocked punt. With the ball at the  Patriots' 36-yard line, he slipped between blockers up the middle and smothered  Brian Hansen's kick, grabbed the ball on the bounce and scored easily.  </P> <P> Dan Marino set up Miami's other touchdown late in the third quarter by passing  to Mark Clayton for a 36-yard gain to the Patriots' two-yard line. Sammie Smith  scored on the next play to cap a 64-yard drive for a 17-3 lead.  </P> <P> New England's touchdown came with 6:18 left when George Adams caught a  four-yard scoring pass from Marc Wilson on fourth down. The Patriots quickly  forced a punt and took over at the Miami 44, but their final threat ended when  Wilson was stopped for no gain on a fourth-down sneak at the 35 with 3:31 left.  </P> <P> The Patriots had chances to build a big early lead, but they failed to pick up  a first down after Miami's first three turnovers.  </P> <P> "When we ran the ball they beat us, and when we passed, they covered us, and  when we were open, we dropped it," Patriot Coach Rod Rust said.  </P> <P> "We just kept turning them back," Shula said. "In the beginning we looked  awesome as far as pass rush and run defense."  </P> <P> Linebackers E.J. Junior and Hugh Green each had two sacks of Wilson, who  completed 18 of 38 passes for 187 yards. His record as the Patriots' starting  quarterback is 0-8.  </P> <P> Rust said he considered replacing Wilson with Steve Grogan in the second half.  </P> <P> "But then I looked out on the field and thought that Marc was delivering the  ball well," he said. "He had to endure four drops in a row."  </P> <P> The victory gave Miami its best start since 1984, the last time the team made  the Super Bowl, and also gave the Dolphins their fourth consecutive win against  intra-division rivals, the team's best such streak since 1986.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> TALKS ON OLD SCHOOL SITE WILL RESUME  </P> <P> Moorpark city officials have agreed to resume negotiations over the purchase of  land from the Moorpark Unified School District.  </P> <P> Members of a committee from the city and the school district have agreed to  resolve the 8-month-old dispute, Moorpark City Councilman Clint Harper said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> City Manager Steve Kueny said a meeting could be scheduled within two weeks.  </P> <P> The agreement ends a stalemate resulting from a bitter dispute about the old  high school where the land is located, Harper said. He said he was optimistic  about a settlement.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge in November upheld a ruling that the city and the school  district resume negotiations over the sale of nearly eight acres of athletic  fields at the former Memorial High School.  </P> <P> The city wants to turn the land into a park. It claims it is permitted under  state law to buy the property at below market value because it is for  recreational use. It has offered the district $319,000.  </P> <P> District officials claim state laws allow them to sell the land at a higher  price to make up for the cost of building a new school.  </P> <P> School officials need between $4 million and $4.5 million from sale of the  26-acre high school site, Moorpark school board member Tom Baldwin said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 10, 1985, at 50 FR 1314, we published a final rule that established a new part 417 containing the rules applicable to prepaid health care. Section 417.532 provided that, beginning in 1986, 100 percent of the weighted average of the AAPCCs of each class of a cost HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees would be applied as an absolute limit on the total amount payable to that HMO or CMP. There would be no exceptions and no possibility of payments in excess of that limit. The provisions relating to effective incentives were removed from the rules for HMOs and CMPs as no longer necessary, but retained for HCPPs, to which the new absolute limit would not apply. Although the new absolute limit never went into effect, the effective incentives policy was not restored for HMOs and CMPs, and the inoperative rule (&sect;417.532(a)(3)) was not removed from the CFR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In October 1989, HCFA issued HCFA Ruling (HCFAR)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 89&hyph;2, which stated that: ``Since the time that &sect;417.532 of the regulations was promulgated, the courts have construed the authority to set cost limits under section 1861(v)(1)(A) [of the Act] to support generalized cost limits applied on a presumptive basis, but not absolute cost limits applied on a final or conclusive basis *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The courts have interpreted section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act as requiring that a Medicare provider be afforded an opportunity under the regulations to show that in its particular case, costs in excess of the applicable cost limits were reasonable and therefore reimbursable. Thus, the court decisions support application of presumptive limits, that is, limits with an exception process that affords the cost-contracting entity the opportunity to qualify for additional payments if it can show that its excess costs are justified as ``reasonable.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the policies discussed above, we have not accumulated data that would show whether the furnishing of health care services by cost HMOs and CMPs, and HCPPs is cost-effective as compared to the furnishing of those services under the Medicare fee-for-service system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Provisions of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Provisions Applicable to HMOs and CMPs, and to HCPPs That Furnish Inpatient Hospital Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since HCPP agreements pertain only to part B services, HCFA makes payment directly to the providers for part A services furnished to HCPP enrollees. However, some HCPPs ``furnish inpatient services'' in the sense that they make the arrangements for enrollees to receive those services, and pay applicable Medicare coinsurance and deductibles in return for a premium from the enrollee. Like HMOs, HCPPs that furnish both part A and part B services would generally have an incentive to use more cost-effective part B services when possible, rather than more expensive part A services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The powerful Armed Forces (ABRI)  lost its best speakers, Major General Raja Kami Sembiring  Meliala and Maj. Gen. Samsudin, when it withdrew 18 of its 100  appointees at the House of Representatives yesterday.    The two men have played a major role in not only improving  the image of the House, which has been besmirched as a rubber  stamp institution, but also in proving that ABRI, too, can  become a democratic force.    They were among a handful army officers in the House who  championed a more open political climate.    Together with Brigadier General Rukmini Kusumostuti Sujono  and Maj. Gen. Syaiful Sulun, both removed in 1992, ABRI had an  outspoken quartet who pioneered the democratization process from  their seats in the House.    From the first days of their service in 1987, they barraged  government officials with embarrassing questions on subjects  ranging from the eviction of the poor to make way for  development projects and the lack of service given by the  bureaucracy to tax payers.    The legislators will be remembered as army officers who  dared  to express opinions which were not always in line with ABRI's  official views.    Sembiring, a former Cendrawasih Military commander  overseeing  security in Maluku and Irian Jaya, was a voice for the poor  displaced from their homes to make way for development projects.    His dismissal from the legislative body comes six months  after he made critical remarks about the appointment of the  first civilian, Harmoko, to the top spot of the government's  Golkar [Functional Group] political grouping.    Suharto's choice of Harmoko was widely interpreted as a sign  that the guard is changing in Indonesian politics and that more  civilians will follow the information minister into areas once  considered the provenance of the military.    Sembiring's reaction was a swift defense of ABRI's central  role, saying that no one could become president without a  military background.    As for Samsudin, he was transferred from his post as  chairman  of House Commission II [Roman numeral number two] overseeing  domestic political affairs to Commission VII on banking and  industry, where his voice is rarely heard.    Rukmini, who retired from active service in ABRI is more  popular among seminar attendants, where she is almost always a  star speaker. And she has remained ABRI's faithful salesperson,  defending the military's dual function.    She is also a member of the National Commission on Human  Rights, which came to life last year.    Syaiful Sulun has practically stepped out of the political  arena, making no public appearances since losing his legislative  seat in 1992.    He stung the bureaucracy and stunned the public when during  a  nationally televised interview he complained that press  criticism should be directed more at the executive than the  legislative body.    Observers believe his unforgivable sin was his daring move  to  talk with the Petisi 50 [Petition of 50], a loose organization  of former government and military officials that is harshly  critical of the government.    The past two years have been difficult for the military,  with  their "dual function" in both security and politics coming under  intense scrutiny.    As critics have increasingly questioned its relevance,  governmnt and military officials as well as political party  leaders have been just as busy defending it.    They question the privilege because it is unclear who they  represent.    "People criticize (the dual function) because they don't  care  to study the nation's struggle, especially the history of ABRI,"  President Suharto said last August two weeks before the  incumbent House members were sworn in.    One hundred of the 500 seats in the House are reserved for  the military in recognition of its role as the "stabilizing and  dynamizing" force in the Indonesian politics forged by political  leaders in the 1960s.    The remaining 400 seats are contested by the three  sanctioned  political organizations the government-backed Golkar, the  Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and the United Development  Party (PPP) through the general election.    The number of seats granted to the military has been at the  center of debate. Outspoken politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas of  the PPP has argued that while he agrees that ABRI deserves a  place in the House, the number of seats should be reduced.</p>

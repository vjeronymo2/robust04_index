			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Japan condemns numerical trade targets - Miyazawa responds to US demands for commitment on reducing current account surplus JAPAN yesterday stressed its opposition to US demands that specific numerical targets be set to reduce Japan's massive current account surplus and further open the country's markets to foreign goods. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the House of Councillors' budget committee that it would be unrealistic for Japan to make specific numerical commitments on its surplus or import ratio. No one could control GDP figures or the course of imports and exports in a free trade system, he said. Mr Kabun Muto, foreign minister, added his voice to a growing chorus of opposition to the US stance, saying Japan would never agree to setting specific measurable targets. Mr Miyazawa and Mr Muto were responding to US demands that Japan reduce its current account surplus from 3.2 per cent of GDP to 1-2 per cent and increase its ratio of imports to about 3.3 per cent of GDP from a current 2.5 per cent. The US administration has said it would seek such numerical targets in bilateral trade talks with Japan, scheduled to begin on Friday in Washington, in which the two sides are expected to negotiate a new framework for discussing trade issues. The talks will be the first formal working-level contact between the two sides since agreement to set up a new framework for trade relations was reached between Mr Miyazawa and President Bill Clinton in April. The two countries aim to work out a broad outline of the trade framework before the July summit in Tokyo of Group of Seven industrial countries. However, Japan and the US remain deeply divided on how issues should be resolved. Washington appears not to have changed its stance that numerical targets be adopted despite clear resistance from the Japanese side, and despite the fact that both countries last week endorsed the communique from the annual OECD ministerial meeting in Paris promising 'to make no recourse to initiatives and arrangements which are inconsistent with the principles of free trade, and undermine the multilateral system'. As the US set out its demands, officials at the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry insisted yesterday the trade talks needed to be a two-way exercise with the US doing its share by trimming its budget deficit. The request on numerical targets has prompted calls in Tokyo that the US should also produce figures showing it is reducing the budget deficit. However, even were the US to do so this would not mean Japan agreeing to numerical targets, a Miti official said. Japanese trade officials also emphasised that the bilateral talks should be restricted to issues within the government's reach, implying that the setting of numerical targets, under a free trade system, were not. However, recent comments indicate the Japanese side is open to suggestions on how to resolve bilateral trade issues as long as the US does not threaten unilateral sanctions or insist on setting quantitative targets. Japan is expected to propose that the two countries co-operate on environmental issues, transportation technology, telecommunications, and labour and human resources development.</p>

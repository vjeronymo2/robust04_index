			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: French call to fend off US warplanes FRENCH aerospace industry leaders yesterday called for closer European collaboration in military aircraft production to fend off efforts by US manufacturers to penetrate the European market. Mr Serge Dassault, head of the Dassault military aircraft group, said he favoured the development of several different and competing military aircraft programmes in Europe but insisted that there should be greater resolve on the part of European governments to keep the US out of the market. 'European countries should form a bloc and stop buying US equipment,' he added. Mr Henri Martre, former chairman of Aerospatiale and the president of the French Industry Aerospace Association, also urged for greater European collaboration in the military field. He argued this was essential as long as the US bought no European military aircraft. Dassault is developing the Rafale, an advanced combat aircraft which competes with the European Fighter Aircraft.</p>

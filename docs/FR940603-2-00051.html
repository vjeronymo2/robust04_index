Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC for each affected State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any State process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them to Henry S. Cassell, III, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., room 300, Mailstop E&hyph;13, Atlanta, GA 30305, no later than 60 days after the application deadline. (By formal agreement, the CDC Procurement and Grants Office will act on behalf of and for ATSDR on this matter.) The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State process recommendations it receives after that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian tribes are strongly encouraged to request tribal government review of the proposed application.

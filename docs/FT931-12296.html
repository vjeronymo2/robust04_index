			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Divided Republicans to pick new leader REPUBLICAN leaders in the US have gathered in St Louis to elect a new party chairman for the task of leading them back to the White House after last year's defeat of President George Bush. The task is formidable. The Republicans have not yet worked out how to recapture voters with a diversity of views on social issues, such as abortion, and bring them back into the coalition that worked well for President Reagan. Ideology is expected to provide a strong undercurrent at the St Louis meeting. Many of the 165 Republican national committee members who will today elect the chairman are worried about the widespread perception that their party has been taken over by fundamentalist Christian right-wingers. According to soundings taken by the White House Bulletin, a Washington newsletter, 80 per cent of committee members believe their party should scrap or revise its traditional platform promise to work for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. But most of the chairmanship candidates have steered clear of the ideological debate, and have emphasised the 'nuts and bolts' job of strengthening the party's grassroots organisation. The two leading contenders are Mr Haley Barbour, a Mississippi party official who served in the Reagan White House but may have spent too long as a Washington lobbyist for the committee's taste, and Mr Spencer Abraham, a former Michigan party chairman who may be too closely identified with former Vice-President Dan Quayle, a potential candidate for the 1996 presidential nomination. Mr John Ashcroft, who has just stepped down after eight years as governor of Missouri, may have the political stature but some Republicans are wary of his ties to the religious right. Mr Bo Callaway of Colorado and Mr Craig Berkman are viewed as outsiders. This is the first chairmanship contest for the Republicans since 1977. When the party holds the White House, the president can select his own chairman, as President Bill Clinton did for the Democrats last week in picking Mr David Wilhelm as chairman. The Republicans may be in better political shape than their loss of the White House would suggest, having more governors and Congress members than when they lost the presidential elections of 1960 and 1976. But, with Mr Ross Perot lurking in the wings as an alternative, the new chairman will have a struggle to ensure his party casts a wide net for voters.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): In brief .. Small businesses spend an average of Pounds 9,000 a year on external financial advice, of which 64 per cent goes to accountants' fees, according to a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick. The accountants questioned 150 companies with turnover of up to Pounds 5m and based in the south-east. The bank manager is the most popular source of advice on raising finance and is used by 58 per cent of companies, compared with 46 per cent which consult accountants. However, 95 per cent of firms polled turn to their accountant when seeking advice on corporation tax and accounts preparation. ***** A programme to inject the techniquesfor teaching enterprise issues into schools in Hungary has received a further Pounds 32,000 of finance from the UK government's Know How Fund. The extra money will allow Durham University Business School (DUBS), which has been responsible for the programme, to evaluate progress and to revise its manual of enterprise teaching practice. The Hungarian ministry of works plans to extend the project to 250 schools from the present eight. Contact DUBS, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB. Tel 091 374 2211. ***** Evidence of the extent to which recession has hit the liquidity of small businesses appears in the level of savings theyhave at their bank or building society. Net savings by small businesses have remained static at around Pounds 27bn since October 1990 compared with average monthly increases of Pounds 350m in the earlier part of the year, according to a survey by National Westminster Bank. The picture varies according to sector with service companies having more surplus funds available than manufacturing and construction companies. Savings of retail businesses are very low. Businesses inthe south-east have more funds on deposit than those elsewhere in the country while liquidity also improves as businesses increase in size. Twenty five per cent of firms with one or two employees have surplus funds on deposit. Of businesses with five to nine employees 34 per cent have surplus cash while nearly 40 per cent of those employing 10-49 people have business savings. ***** A do-it-yourself kit to help small firms cut the cost of crime is to be devised by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Crime Concern, a government-backed consultancy. Fraud, theft, 'shrinkage' and arson cost small businesses an estimated Pounds 3bn a year. The crime audit pack - a series of self-study units to enable the small business owner to carry out an assessment of exposure to the risk of crime - is to be drawn up and tested over the next few months. Crime Concern will compile the pack on the basis of discussions with owner managers of retailing and construction firms in London, manufacturing companies in Liverpool andhotels in Brighton. The businesses chosen will receive surveys of their physical security, their financial and stock control systems and management and employee attitudes.

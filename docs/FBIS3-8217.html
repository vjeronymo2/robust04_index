On Friday and on Saturday, the Moslems opened cannon,  mortar,  anti-aircraft and small arms fire on Serb settlements and army  positions in the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Maglaj and Mt. Ozren in  northern Bosnia, the statement added.    It also said that regular troops of the Republic of Croatia  had not withdrawn from Bosnia-Herzegovina although the deadline  set by the U.N. Security Council expired on February 17.    On February 3, the Security Council threatened to introduce  sanctions against Croatia unless it withdrew its regular troops  from Bosnia.    From the outset of the Bosnian war nearly two years ago, the  Croatian Army supported the local Croat and Moslem forces in  their war against local Serbs. Since early 1993, however,  Croatia's regular troops and Bosnian Croat forces have been  fighting pitched battles with Bosnian Moslems for territories in  central and southern Bosnia.</p>

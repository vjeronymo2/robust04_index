			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram issues fresh profits warning SPRING RAM, the maker of kitchens and bathrooms, has joined an infamous club of companies, including Hartstone and MTM, that have made two profits warnings in almost as many months. The company, which had to delay publication of its 1992 accounts earlier this year after a row with its auditors and whose fall from grace has been almost as swift as its rise, said profits in the half year to July 4 would be 'substantially lower' than last time. Losses at Regency doors and Artisan Tiles had been greater than expected, mainly due to technical and training problems during commissioning at the new manufacturing sites. The bathroom division's losses had also continued. And increased sales in the kitchen division were 'being held back by necessary increases in operating costs designed to support long-term profitability.' Mr Ron Farr, main board director and chief executive of the special products division, said advisers had reported that City expectations had been too high. At the time of the preliminary announcement in March, Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said that despite tough trading conditions the board believed 'business prospects for 1993 are better than 1992,' a message he repeated at the AGM five weeks ago. Mr Farr said he was still confident, after meetings yesterday with divisional managers, that the second half would be better than the first. But '1993 is no longer guaranteed to be better than 1992.' The latest statement comes three months after a similar warning in March concerning the 1992 figures, and followed last November's discovery of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary. Mr Farr said recently received figures for May revealed that the 'anticipated improvement in the first half did not happen.' Spring Ram's shares fell 8 1/2 p yesterday to 52 1/2 p.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AVA: My Story By Ava Gardner (Bantam: $19.95; 315 pp.). The nicest thing ever  said about her, writes Ava Gardner, was George Cukor's calling her "a  gentleman."  </P> <P> It's easy to see why she liked the term; though Ava often drank into the wee  hours, and addresses her readers as "honey," she never traded in her North  Carolina farm-girl soul for the Hollywood model. Stardom, she writes, "gave me  everything I never wanted," and she admits she wasn't a great actress despite  good notices for films such as "The Sun Also Rises" and "The Night of the  Iguana." And her love life indeed proves as interesting as her career, boasting  an all-star cast; her three husbands were Mickey Rooney, bandleader Artie Shaw  and Frank Sinatra. None of her bed partners comes off very well, which suits  the mood of this autobiography (assisted by Alan Burgess and interim Los  Angeles Times book editor Kenneth Turan): lighthearted, but with an  undercurrent of sadness and resigned dissatisfaction.

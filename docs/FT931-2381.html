			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK victory in dumping ruling The US International Trade Commission has brought to an end a dumping suit filed against British steel producers, with a ruling that the US industry is not injured by exports of new steel rails from the UK, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The ruling, delivered late on Thursday, came after a 5-1 vote in which only the Commission chairman, Mr Don Newquist, a Democrat, found that the dumping caused injury. British Steel accounts for the lion's share of the UK's steel rail exports to the US, adds Andrew Baxter in London. The privatised steelmaker sold 27,000-28,000 tonnes in the US last year, worth Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m and up sharply from the 15,000-16,000 tonnes exported to the US in 1991. The company yesterday welcomed the ITC decision. 'We regard it as a proper solution,' it said.</p>

In the foreign policy section of the annual "Spring Report,"  published by the Euritalia Studies Center, Andreatta opened by  citing the Italian commitment to a negotiated solution in  ex-Yugoslavia and to humanitarian assistance to the civilian  victims of violence there.    "Another important aspect of Italy's activities abroad was  the expansion of relations with the republics which emerged with  the break-up of the Soviet Union," said the minister who also  referred to Rome backing for "the process of democratic  transformation and transition to a market economy" in the  countries of East and Central Europe. In this connection, the  minister recalled the joint British-Italian initiative for the  association of these countries with the political and judiciary  pillars written into the European Union's [EU] Maastricht Treaty.    Italy now holds the rotating presidency of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), an organization with  a role, he stressed, in the prevention of conflict and the  management of crisis situations.    On another front, Andreatta said his nation has "actively  contributed" to European integration and pointed out the  importance of work aimed at forging ties between common foreign  and defense policy and the expansion of the EU. He went on to  recall the development of the Western European Union, of which  Italy held the rotating presidency last year, as "a component of  EU defense (and) an instrument for strengthening the European  pillar" of NATO. In this area, the minister underscored the  activities of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the  Partnership for Peace proposal for military cooperation between  NATO and the nations of East Europe.    On the Italian role in Somalia last year, Andreatta said the  country "expressed concern from the very beginning on an  excessive accent on the military instrument with regard to the  political goals and humanitarian objectives" of the UN mission.    He also referred to "the steady commitment of Italy to  support the peace process" in the Middle East.</p>

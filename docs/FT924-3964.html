			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / BBC says TV budget overran by Pounds 60m THE BBC admitted last night after an internal investigation that BBC television had overspent or overcommitted more than Pounds 60m over two years. The overrun will be reduced by drastic cuts in spending this year. A report by a governors' audit committee chaired by Lord Barnett, vice-chairman of the BBC governors, blamed 'a series of reporting and control failures'. The BBC has ordered the current year's budget to be cut by Pounds 20m. Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC network television, said last night that more would have to be cut. A drama series, The White Lady of Death, has had to be put on ice, other spending has been postponed and more repeats will be shown. Mr Wyatt apologised for the department's overspending and said 'we will do our level best' to correct the errors and minimise the effect on viewers. In the 1991-92 financial year, network television overspent a net Pounds 38m. This included a Pounds 7m shortfall in expected income from co-productions. The figure could have been similar this year if action had not been taken. Part of the problem began three years ago when the television department unwittingly allocated the same sum of money twice. Money was also spent on independent productions while in-house resources were kept too high. The overspending was not apparent in the BBC's 1991-92 accounts because television is lumped in with the Home Services group, which includes all domestic operations. This showed a deficit of Pounds 21.2m in Home Services, although the BBC overall was not in deficit. The audit committee said the problems continued this year. The aim now was to keep the 1992-93 overspending 'at a level well below that in 91-92'. The action taken includes appointment of a new financial controller at network television.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Exercise Giron-94, an exercise that has to do  with the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP] and  confronting crime of all kinds, is under way in the city of  Havana. Indeed, this exercise is also under way [5 second break  in reception]. In Guantanamo, this SUVP, crime confronting  exercise is called Guerrillero-94.    Well, as part of Giron-94 in the city of Havana, NTV carried  an illustrative report on this matter of confronting crime in  the city of Havana. Let's listen to that report:    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] There were 40  sacks containing a detergent the nation has earmarked for  recovering hard currency [para la recuperacion de divisas]; hard  currency that becomes raw materials for producing cleaning  products very necessary for society's consumption. Thus, this  was a theft that conspired against the citizenry's basic  solutions, and one by means of which seven individuals would  enrich themselves, had they managed to get the 500 kg of  detergent into the underground market. But the police stopped  them and returned the 40 sacks that exited through the factory  doors without any documentation to the (Sergio Sierra Cabrera)  Factory, formerly known as the (Sabatez) Factory.    The accused, Esteban Rodriguez Talaveras, Victor Manuel  Valdez Gonzalez, Armando Luis Ploche Torres, and Angel Llane  Mendez, took advantage of negligence in the production area to  move the merchandise, which they left hidden in the stockroom  until it was put into a closed vehicle, which exited the plant  through the gate, without being searched by the guards. [passage  omitted]    It was the job of Jose Dabian Ramos, Edilberto Rodriguez  Bote, and Lazaro Ruiz Cutino to sell the product on the  underground market. The police seized the merchandise from them  at a private residence in Cerro Municipality. The matter does  not appear to be over, for surely the enterprise (Suchel) [name  as heard] has a control system that should prevent anyone from  diverting resources. For that reason, the investigation  continues. [end recording]</p>

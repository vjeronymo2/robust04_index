			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson disappoints Conglomerate Hanson recorded its biggest turnover since the UK general election after announcing disappointing full-year results which prompted a rash of forecast cuts. The shares retreated from their all-time high to finish 16 lower at 268 1/2 p on 52m turnover after the conglomerate revealed a fall in earnings per share and profits down to Pounds 1.016bn, from Pounds 1.286bn previously. Analysts' forecasts ranged between Pounds 1.05bn and Pounds 1.15bn. Hanson's decision not to raise its dividend for the first quarter of the current financial year came as a particular shock to the market. There was also surprise over the loss prompted by currency shifts, which was about Pounds 100m greater than expected, and the damage caused by the Peabody coal strike, around Pounds 15m worse than forecast. Analysts pointed out that the group failed to benefit from Wednesday's surge in share prices so the stock was down about 8 per cent against the market over two days. Forecasts were cut by around Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.1bn for the current year, although conglomerates specialists said that with a yield of 5.3 per cent the stock offered some value. Racal Electronics delivered the second big blow to the electronics sector this week, shocking the market with a Pounds 400,000 loss at the half way stage, against a comparable Pounds 23.2m profit and market expectations of profits which had ranged from around Pounds 16m to Pounds 22m. The interim dividend was held at 1.5p; analysts had expected an increase to around 1.7p. The shares plunged on the news to a year's low of 158p before stabilising and closing a net 29 down at 160p. Turnover of 20m was the stock's highest single day's activity since August 1992. Dealers said the market had begun to factor in full-year underlying profits forecasts of around Pounds 45m, but warned that Racal's once large fan club was waning by the minute. Results from Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks giant, came safely within market expectations and helped the shares advance 13 to 430p in busy turnover of 10m. Analysts said that in addition to a positive results meeting, the group's dramatic turnround of its cash position had done much to improve investor confidence. Boddington added 10 at 275p on vague talk that Bass might be in a predatory mood. The latter stayed at 537p. Ladbroke remained friendless, declining 7 to 144p in a second consecutive day's huge turnover of 20m. Ladbroke attempted to mend fences yesterday over the share sale by one director and worries over the dividend. However, leisure analysts said investors remain nervous over what is perceived as the group's 'bunker mentality'. Granada improved 14 to 489p on speculation that LWT, a rumoured bid target of the north-west broadcaster, may be lining up a bid for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV (YTT). Such a move would mean Granada would not need to tap shareholders for its predicted move on LWT, which slipped 12 to 581p. YTT moved up 4 to 183p. Disappointment with the net asset value at MEPC shook the shares, which tumbled 27 to 523p, the biggest faller in the FT-SE 100 Index, in busy volume of 4.8m. MEPC came in with an nav of 416p, compared with one bullish broker's 485p and the market range clustered around 450p. However, Mr Graham Stanley at NatWest Securities blamed the low nav on the timing of the group's valuation, which was done too early to benefit fully from the recovery in the sector and the improvement in property yields. Food manufacturers wilted in the wake of the poor results from Argyll Group on Wednesday, with which the supermarket operator hinted at wringing keener prices out of its suppliers. Booker retreated 8 to 396p and United Biscuits 7 1/2 to 332 1/2 p, both seemingly subject to Hoare Govett downgrades. Stock overhangs were said to have added further pressure to Northern Foods, off 11 at 212p, and Tate &amp; Lyle, 5 adrift at 401p. Argyll's decision to depreciate its store values hit other supermarket groups. Asda lost 2 at 50p, Tesco 5 at 193 1/2 p and J. Sainsbury the same at 404p. A top slice recommendation, believed to be by Smith New Court, was said to be behind a 17 fall in P&amp;O to 610p. Heavy buying pushed Abbey National up 13 to 437p on 9.5m traded, while TSB, the next of the big banks to report, closed 7 higher at 228p with turnover reaching a very heavy 17m. Standard Chartered jumped 33 to 1110p, although there were hints that a big sell note on the stock was imminent. Fine china group Royal Doulton began trading in the market following the demerger from Pearson, and some 23m shares changed hands. Dealers said the shares were initially offered at around 212p, commenced trading at 193p and closed at 207p. Pearson was marked down by 21p as, under the terms of the demerger, each shareholder receives one Royal Doulton share for every 10 Pearson shares. Ex Doulton the shares closed 3 higher at 597p. Heywood Williams climbed 40 to a peak 384p on the back of a US acquisition, financed by a Pounds 55m rights issue. Other statistics, Page 25</p>

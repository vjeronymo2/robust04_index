			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Arabs seek to regain the initiative on peace: The dramatic change of political style in Israel has sown confusion WHEN Arab foreign ministers meet in Damascus this weekend they face the difficult task of regaining the initiative from a new Israeli government which has moved with surprising speed to assert its claims as a peacemaker. Arab states and the Palestinians in particular, while intrigued by possibilities of progress towards peace, have been discomfited by the quickfire decisions of Mr Yitzhak Rabin in his first week in office. Arab officials have tended to bluster as they seek to take account of the dramatic change in style, if not substance, of the new Israeli administration. Mr Rabin's surgical strike at the heart of US concerns, notable curbing settlements in the occupied territories, has worried the Arabs, aware that President Bush wants to make his peace with the American Jewish community. In Damascus, foreign ministers from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation are certain to urge the US not to release loan guarantees for Israel until it has provided a firm commitment to halt all settlement activity. Arab foreign ministers will also urge the new Israeli government to commit itself to negotiations, set to resume possibly as soon as next month in Washington, within a framework of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 that require Israel to withdraw from land captured in the 1967 war. Syria feels especially strongly about the need to re-emphasise the UN resolutions link to a peace settlement because of concerns that Israel may seek to relegate the Golan Heights issue to a 'second phase' of the peace process, while focusing initially on Palestinian autonomy. Mr Rabin has fuelled these concerns by indicating that his main priority was a confidence-building self-rule agreement with the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the terms of the 1978 Camp David accords which led to the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Damascus believed the agreement destroyed Arab solidarity and set back chances of regaining the Golan Heights. Syrian officials this weekend will be intent on trying to ensure Arab solidarity in the face of Israel's new peace offensive. Both Jordan and the Palestinians are likely to be left in no doubt about Syrian displeasure if they should contemplate breaking ranks. A central preoccupation in Damascus is likely to be what tactics to employ in dealing with the Rabin government. If Arab demands are too insistent there would be a danger of undermining the pro-peace camp inside the Israeli cabinet, and in the Knesset. Egypt is certain to argue strongly that greater efforts should be made by the Arabs to encourage the Israeli peace constituency, now that there is a real prospect of progress. The Arabs are also being obliged to come to terms with the new reality of a dramatic transformation in US-Israeli relations. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, made it clear in public remarks during his visit to the region this week that he believed a new chapter had been opened in relations with Israel. His Arab interlocutors were left in no doubt who would get the blame if the fragile process was allowed to collapse. The US is pressing the Arabs, as a goodwill gesture, to lift the economic boycott on Israel which has been in force for 44 years. It is unlikely, however, that such a step would be taken until talks have resumed, and only then if substantial progress was made. Arab officials have been saying this week that an end to the boycott will require Arab League approval, although the decision would not necessarily require the imprimatur of a full Arab summit. It should become clear after the Damascus meeting whether Arab scepticism will allow the leap of faith required for quick progress. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, paid a surprise visit to Lebanon yesterday after a crucial meeting with Syria's President Hafez al-Assad to press for Arab co-operation in latest peace efforts, writes Tony Walker. It was the first visit by a secretary of state to Lebanon since April 1983 when Mr George Shultz went to Beirut after a suicide car bomber killed 16 Americans in an attack on the US embassy. Mr Baker hinted following his talks with Mr Assad that Middle East peace negotiations might resume sooner than expected. 'We in the US want the talks to resume as soon as possible,' he told reporters. Arab and US Officials say that bilateral negotiations between Israel and its neighbours may reconvene in Washington next month rather than Rome in September.</p>

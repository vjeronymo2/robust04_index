			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Tough medicine helps to cure US banks' ills: Both bankers and their regulators have acted promptly to seek remedies for bad debt and cost problems After two years of recession, heavy loan losses caused by the commercial property slump and a series of tough restructuring programmes to cut costs, there is at last evidence of solid recovery in the US banking industry. This, at least, has been the message over the past fortnight as many banks have put on a parade of improved second-quarter earnings, lower loan write-offs and stronger capital ratios. Citicorp, the nation's largest bank with assets of Dollars 219bn (Pounds 114.6bn), has led the way. Although its North American commercial property division is still in the red, Citicorp's net earnings for the second quarter jumped from Dollars 11m to Dollars 171m. For the first six months of 1992 earnings were more than trebled, at Dollars 354m. Across the US, institutions large and small showed signs of an upturn in the second quarter. These include Chase Manhattan (15 per cent higher net income); First Chicago (up 19 per cent); Bank of New York (up 45 per cent); JP Morgan (up 67 per cent); Norwest of Minneapolis (up 21 per cent); First Fidelity of New Jersey (up 47 per cent); Barnett Bank of Florida (85 per cent higher); and Fleet Financial of New England (net profits more than doubled, from Dollars 28m to Dollars 71m). Mr James McDermott, president of New York-based bank analysts Keefe Bruyette, notes: 'Two years ago it looked as if the banking industry was going out of business. Today, it looks as if the banks will last forever.' In some ways, the recovery has been faster than Wall Street and the industry itself might have expected. This is partly because bank profits have been bolstered by fatter interest margins that owe much to the series of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board since last December. With the Fed funds level - the wholesale money rate at which banks borrow from each other - at around 3.25 per cent, the opportunity for better margins have been abundant, since the prime lending rate for companies stands at 6 per cent. Regulators have also moved fairly quickly to seek remedies for bad debt and cost problems. The clouds over the US property market began to appear in early 1990, when prices began to soften, but by the autumn of that year bankers had begun to realise that their loan portfolios had deteriorated even more rapidly than they had expected. In 1990-91, the US banking industry faced its most serious crisis since the less developed country (LDC) loan debacle of the early 1980s, when US bank loans to Mexico, Brazil and other countries led to large write-offs. Most senior bankers got the message quickly and acted. Dividend payments at many banks were slashed or halted; workforce reductions at dozens of medium and large US banks averaged 10 per cent; and non-strategic assets - including, for example, service companies and European property holdings - were disposed of. More important, most banks faced their problems head-on, classifying large chunks of commercial property loans as non-performing, providing against loan losses and simply writing them off. It came as a shock to Wall Street when, in the autumn of 1990, Chase Manhattan halved its dividend, made heavy provisions and unveiled a package of draconian measures that included reducing its workforce by 12 per cent and selling a number of European assets. But Chase, like others who took the medicine, is now on the mend. Another important step towards rationalisation, taken as the banking crisis coincided with the sputtering performance of the US economy last year, was a series of mergers. The first of the three most prominent mergers, all of which are already yielding benefits in terms of cost savings, was the decision in late 1991 to combine NCNB of North Carolina and C&amp;S/Sovran of Georgia into NationsBank. It is now the fourth-biggest US bank, with Dollars 111bn of assets and more than 1,800 branches in 10 south-eastern states. NationsBank says that by 1994 it will have achieved annual cost savings of Dollars 450m, through rationalisation of business and eliminating duplication of administrative services. The second big merger came a year ago, when Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank joined forces to become the third-biggest US bank, with assets of Dollars 142.4bn and a powerful branch base in the New York area. This week, Chemical managed a 30 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit, and said it had reduced total staff by more than 10 per cent and was well on the way to achieving Dollars 750m of annual cost savings. Bank of America last August engineered the biggest bank merger in US history when, in what has been seen as a take-over, it merged with Security Pacific, the Los Angeles-based bank troubled by heavy loan losses. It is even more ambitious - it plans to achieve estimated annual savings of Dollars 1.2bn by 1995. Although Bank of America's first results since the merger with SecPac was completed in April showed second-quarter net profit down 11.8 per cent, Wall Street is impressed by the speed with which SecPac is being integrated into its larger partner's operations. Mergers have not been the only driving force behind the recovery, however. Other crucial elements have been the drive to strengthen capital and to generate new revenues, especially from fee income. For example, Citicorp, which has been among the weakest of US banks in terms of capital, added Dollars 1.5bn of new capital during the first half of this year and brought its main Tier One capital-to-assets ratio  - the main capital adequacy measure used by US banking regulators - to 4.25 per cent, up from 3.74 per cent at the end of last year. Observers say that one example of the way in which banks have attempted to raise fee income is an increase in charges to companies for back-up lines of credit, from an average of a fifth of one per cent to a third of one per cent. There are still problems in the industry, however, particularly as the commercial property market seems unlikely to improve in the short term. But the view of Wall Street is summarised by Mr Tom Hanley, a leading banking analyst at First Boston who says that 'the worst is now behind us'. Most bankers say their industry will obviously only stand a chance of continuing its recovery when the US economic recovery solidifies and the corporate and consumer debt burdens of the last decade are eased. 'There is no way to cure an over-leveraged system quickly,' remarks Mr McDermott of Keefe Bruyette, who none the less sees bank industry earnings improving into 1993. In the meantime, bankers claim they have learned from the property loan fiasco of 1990-92 and will no longer leap into a single lending sector with such abandon. The same, of course, was said by bankers after the US property slump of the mid-1970s, and the LDC debt crisis of the early 1980s and the Texas oil-related bust of the late 1980s. This time, however, the bankers swear they mean what they say. Additional research by Rivka Nachoma</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LUGINBILL'S THOUGHTS OF SDSU SPRING FOOTBALL ETERNALLY HOPEFUL  </P> <P> Spring football opens Monday at San Diego State, and that means Coach Al  Luginbill is thinking spring thoughts.  </P> <P> He says he's excited about getting started. He talks about the importance of  making strides with the young athletes. He frets about the work that lies  ahead.  </P> <P> The discussion eventually rolls around to probably the most important variable  for the Aztecs this spring -- continuity.  </P> <P> A year ago, Luginbill was new to the program, having replaced Denny Stolz. He  had a handful of new assistants. They were practically learning players' names  as they instructed them on the field.  </P> <P> A year later, a system is in place. Familiarity, Luginbill hopes, will breed  improvement.  </P> <P> "It's no longer a struggle," he said last week. "The young men can just go out  and take care of business. The staff understands the players, and the players  understand the staff."  </P> <P> Despite the growing pains, SDSU was 6-5-1 last season -- the first winning  season for the Aztecs since 1986 -- and 4-3 in the Western Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> There has been just one coaching addition this season -- Steve Fairchild was  named recruiting coordinator/quarterbacks coach, replacing Steve Devine, the  former offensive line coach. Dave Lay, the offensive coordinator who previously  dealt with quarterbacks, will take over responsibility for the line, and Dan  Underwood will take over running backs and tight ends.  </P> <P> Luginbill said he will work the team hard over the 20 practices he is allowed  by the NCAA -- 15 in which contact is allowed -- partly because the team still  is not quite where he would like it to be and partly because it is relatively  young. There are just 16 seniors on the roster.  </P> <P> One of them is 6-foot-8 quarterback Dan McGwire. His 1989 statistics, while  good, didn't match his stature. He threw for 3,651 yards, the second-highest  season total in school history, but was inconsistent.  </P> <P> "I've talked with Dan several times about where he is and where he needs to  be," Luginbill said. "If he improves like most players going from their first  to their second years, this offense will be an excellent group."  </P> <P> McGwire will have several targets in wide receivers Jimmy Raye, a healthy  Patrick Rowe (he missed last season with a knee injury), Dennis Arey and  redshirt freshmen Merten Harris, Jake Nyberg and Will Tate.  </P> <P> "I can't believe anybody in the western United States will have better speed  than us out wide," Luginbill said.  </P> <P> The Aztecs have four or five running backs jockeying for position this spring,  and Luginbill will be watching the offensive line closely, attempting to fill  both tackle and guard slots.  </P> <P> But what he will be working hardest on is the defense. The Aztecs averaged 30.7  points a game last season but allowed 31. The biggest culprits were, in order,  the linebackers and secondary.  </P> <P> To that end, two of the four community college transfers Luginbill brought in  are linebackers, and one is a cornerback. The linebackers, Andy Coviello  (Sacramento Community College) and Lou Foster (De Anza College in San Jose) are  enrolled at SDSU and will participate in spring drills.  </P> <P> SDSU will practice on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays and scrimmage on  Fridays. There will be no contact during the Monday drills, and Friday's  scrimmages, according to Luginbill, will be 120 plays or longer.  </P> <P> The team will be off April 9-13 for spring break, and the annual Red-Black game  will conclude drills on May 5 in the Aztec Bowl.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Two players are injured and will miss spring practice: senior center Nick Subis  (broken foot) and freshman defensive lineman Greg Porter (dislocated shoulder).  Junior offensive lineman Kevin Macon (dislocated toe) is questionable.  </P></p>

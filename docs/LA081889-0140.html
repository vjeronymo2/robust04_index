			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBE OF DEFENSE CONTRACTORS REVEALED;  </P> <P> SOME SUPPLIERS ACCUSED OF TRAFFICKING SECRET DOCUMENTS  </P> <P> Federal officials say the indictment of a former Boeing Co. official is part of  a broader investigation into how defense contractors allegedly obtained secret  Pentagon documents showing which weapons may be purchased.  </P> <P> The probe is separate from the ongoing "Ill Wind" investigation of bribery and  influence-peddling in the awarding of Defense Department contracts.  </P> <P> The case became public Tuesday when Richard Lee Fowler, a former Boeing  official, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., on 39 counts  of theft, conspiracy and fraud arising from his alleged trafficking in  classified documents.  </P> <P> "It's part of a continuing investigation by the Department of Defense inspector  general's office into how certain contractors and their employees have  illegally trafficked in classified documents," a Pentagon official said  Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> "How Fowler obtained these documents is the subject of further investigation,"  he said.  </P> <P> The 68-page indictment alleges that Fowler, while he worked for Boeing in  Washington as a senior marketing analyst from 1978 to 1986, obtained hundreds  of the Pentagon's most sensitive documents.  </P> <P> Those papers included Air Force and Navy directives, along with the Pentagon's  five-year budget plan, the main defense spending blueprint used by the  secretary of defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and civilian service leaders, the  indictment charged.  </P> <P> In addition, the indictment alleges, Fowler obtained three National Security  Council decision directives signed by former President Reagan. Those documents  are normally closely held.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fired by Boeing  </P> <P> The three documents all dealt with the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed  shield against nuclear attack, the indictment said.  </P> <P> Although Fowler had a security clearance, he did not have authority to have  access to those papers, the indictment said.  </P> <P> Fowler, contacted at home, said, "I do not wish to comment whatsoever on any of  this."  </P> <P> Fowler was fired by Boeing in September, 1986, said Harold Carr, a spokesman  for the company in Seattle. The Wall Street Journal reported that the firing  was because investigators began looking at Fowler's activities.  </P> <P> Boeing is cooperating with the investigators, Carr said. "There has been a  considerable number of requests for documents, papers, records and so on," he  said. "We have provided those and will continue to answer requests for them."  </P> <P> The indictment alleges that after obtaining the papers, Fowler passed them  along to Boeing officials and other, unnamed contractors. It also charged that  he obtained some documents which had been specifically requested by Boeing  officials.  </P> <P> In some cases, according to the indictment, Fowler removed the "secret"  classification from some of the papers before passing them on to other Boeing  officials.  </P> <P> None of the other people under investigation are identified, although the  indictment said some of the other alleged conspirators created separate log  books to keep Pentagon officials from knowing that Boeing had the unauthorized  classified documents. Boeing has authority to handle certain classified  documents because it is a major defense contractor.  </P></p>

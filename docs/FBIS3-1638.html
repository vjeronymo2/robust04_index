			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] With the beginning of the New Year, Zhejiang  provincial procuratorial organs began stepping up efforts to  hunt down economic criminals, including those who involved in  the crimes of accepting and taking bribes. In the period 1-15  February, the province's procuratorial organs arrested a total  of 12 economic criminals on the run, thus scoring an initial  victory in hunting down fugitives.    The provincial procuratorate lists the number of fugitives  who were involved in the crimes of accepting and offering bribes  at 200. Thanks to long-term efforts, the provincial  procuratorial organs have arrrested 100 of them. As the  remaining 100 are still on the run, it is impossible to  immediately conclude some of the bribery cases. On 1 January  this year, the provincial procuratorate issued a circular in  which concrete instructions were set forth for local  procuratorial organs to step up efforts to hunt down fugitives.  Upon receipt of the circular, grass-roots procuratorial organs  began to act in line with the circular's instructions on hunting  down criminals under their jurisdiction.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / DTI rejects Labour plea on Archer Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday rejected Labour claims that a report from his department on Lord Archer's Anglia Television share dealings could be published. Mr Heseltine said the Financial Services Act gave him 'no power' to publish the report, compiled by DTI inspectors after MAI paid Pounds 292m for Anglia earlier this year. Labour dismissed Mr Heseltine's interpretation of the act, accusing him of a blatant attempt to avoid 'matters of genuine public concern'. The report was compiled by DTI inspectors earlier this year after Lord Archer, the novelist and former Conservative party deputy chairman, placed orders for Anglia shares on behalf of an associate shortly before the MAI bid was announced. After taking legal advice on the report, Mr Heseltine decided not to prosecute Lord Archer. The London Stock Exchange decided to take no action against Lady Archer, a director of Anglia, under its Yellow Book rules aimed at preventing the leakage of price-sensitive information. Labour claims that section 179 of the Financial Services Act allows the trade and industry secretary to publish an inspector's report if those named give their consent. But Mr Heseltine said the inquiry was carried out under section 177 of the act, which provides for investigations to determine whether a criminal offence of insider dealing has been committed. 'Thus, inspectors' reports, as well as detailing the facts as they find them, set out their judgments.' he said in a letter to Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary. The DTI would not say if Lord Archer was asked for permission to publish the report. He was not available for comment.</p>

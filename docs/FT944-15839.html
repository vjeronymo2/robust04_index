			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Kim Jong-il to be named leader soon - Public appearance in Pyongyang points to his assumption of presidency Mr Kim Jong-il's first public appearance in almost three months signals he will soon be formally named as North Korea's new leader. Mr Kim attended a memorial ceremony yesterday in Pyongyang, marking the end of the 100-day mourning period for his father, the late President Kim Il-sung. Analysts in Seoul believe the end of the mourning period will clear the way for Mr Kim, last seen in public at his father's funeral on July 20, to assume the presidency of the country and head the ruling Korean Workers' Party in the next few weeks. Mr Kim, who appeared somewhat haggard, was flanked by leading members of the ruling hierarchy in an apparent show of unity. The absence of Mr Kim from public view has led to speculation that his assumption of power may be encountering internal opposition. However, analysts believe he is already firmly in control of the government and has avoided formally taking power during the mourning period because it would appear unseemly, immediately after his father's death. 'Since the death of Kim Il-sung, there has been no sign of a power struggle in North Korea, including a conflict with the military. Moreover, there are no rival candidates at present who can compete against Kim Jong-il,' said Mr Hideshi Takesada, a researcher at the National Institute for Defence Studies in Japan. 'Kim Jong-il has been consolidating family loyalty by recruiting relatives and classmates to major official positions. Over 90 per cent of officials with the rank above chairmen in the party and state administration council are those appointed by Kim Jong-il,' explained Mr Kil Jeong-woo, director of policy studies at the Research Institute for National Unification in Seoul. He also 'seems to have secured absolute support from the major figures in charge of the three military organisations,' which have been mentioned as the main source of possible opposition to his rule. One sign of continued stability has been North Korea's negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme, which have shown some signs of progress in the past week. But weekend discussions in Geneva remained stuck over North Korea's refusal to accept international inspection of undeclared suspect nuclear facilities. The talks, begun by Kim Il-sung, have shown little sign of deviation since his death. 'Policy making in North Korea is the product of team work among leading figures; Kim Il-sung's death did not have any drastic impact on security strategy,' said Mr Gunter Unterbeck, a former East German diplomat in Pyongyang. However, Mr Kim may be forced to share more decision-making with the top leadership than his father did.</p>

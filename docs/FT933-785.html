			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Yeltsin warning spreads from Moscow to the Urals THE TELEX warns that 'armed men in ski masks' have just evicted the governor of the Bryansk region for protesting against President Boris Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament and convening new elections. Mr Vasily Cherepanov, deputy chief of the regional council in Perm, a city in the Urals 800km east of Moscow, sympathises with the telex from Bryansk, several hundred kilometres away, appealing for solidarity against 'the appearance of armed dictatorship'. A mild-mannered former communist boss, he believes Mr Yeltsin is pushing the country towards civil war. Across the street from his office, a senatorial-looking American, Mr Paul Weyrich, is teaching activists from Russia's fledgling democratic parties how to win the parliamentary elections due to be held in two months. None of the neo-communist parties has been invited. They are the bugbear of the parties which fear that communists will capitalise on the pain of market reforms, just as they did in Poland's recent elections. 'Our top priority is to keep the communists out,' says Mr Ergash Narullayev, an organiser for the Unity and Agreement party, founded only this summer by the deputy prime minister, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a close aide to Mr Yeltsin. Mr Shakhrai, who is expected to run in presidential elections promised for next summer, says his party's main aim is to transform Russia into a genuine federal state to prevent it from falling apart. Twelve other parties are taking part in the seminar, many of them hopelessly divided when it comes to working together. Mr Vladimir Zotov, chairman of the local Democratic Russia Movement, a coalition of small parties, agrees that the aim is to keep out the communists and bring in a new parliament sympathetic to market reforms. But he is worried about what will happen if the 'wrong' kind of entrepreneurs, concerned only about lobbying for their own interests, go to parliament in Moscow. 'It would be even worse than Khasbulatov's parliament because the people will not be responsible to anybody,' says Mr Zotov, who heads the city council's privatisation committee. In his presentation, Mr Weyrich covers everything from lobbying to direct mail and financing the campaign. He emphasises the need for candidates to organise big public rallies to persuade other people that 'it is safe to vote for your candidate'. Many people in the provinces are waiting to see Mr Yeltsin in firm control before taking a stance. Mr Cherepanov has been unable to get a regional council quorum to condemn Mr Yeltsin's decision because many of its members are staying away until the final outcome of events in Moscow becomes clearer. Having removed the governor of Bryansk as a warning to other local governors, many of whom have been appointed by Mr Yeltsin, the Kremlin has said that only those councils which impede the holding of elections will be dissolved. The test for Perm's council comes on Friday, when it is supposed to offer Moscow candidates for the local electoral committee. If it does not find a way to procrastinate, it could be forced to make its position clear. The challenge for those who say they want democracy will be to pull together. As president of the Krieble Institute, a US non-profit organisation, which is promoting democracy and free enterprise in the former Soviet empire, Mr Weyrich is familiar with the weaknesses of anti-communist politicians. 'Not only do they lack the communists' experience of government, but they are not used to coming to conclusions and are prone to bickering.' As for Mr Cherepanov, he is considering running for parliament if Mr Yeltsin can allay fears of an impending dictatorship by agreeing to run for election at the same time.</p>

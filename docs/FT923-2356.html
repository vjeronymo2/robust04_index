			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Treasury gurus lick wounds AFTER this week's bloody and futile battle to defend the pound, the senior officials trying to uphold the currency's value have emerged with plenty of scars but few honours. Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury, and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, held important roles as the government on Wednesday twice ordered a rise in interest rates and spent up to Pounds 15bn supporting the pound - only to end the day admitting defeat with an effective devaluation. Sir Terry and Mr Leigh-Pemberton were among a small group who advised Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as he sought to conduct the government's defence strategy from his office in the Treasury. Other actors in the drama included Mr Andrew Turnbull, Treasury deputy secretary in charge of monetary policy, Mr Alan Budd, Treasury economic adviser, and Mr Eddie George, deputy governor at the Bank and overall supervisor of its market operations. As the officials yesterday licked their wounds, there was no shortage of people accusing them of having chosen the wrong weapons. Many in the City reckon the government should have put up interest rates much earlier in the effort to defend the pound - perhaps two weeks ago - in an effort to convince the markets of its willingness to bring out the heavy artillery in propping up the currency. Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities, the investment group, said the initial action of raising interest rates by 2 percentage points at around 11 am on Wednesday looked 'messy' and smacked of panic. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at brokers Greenwell Montagu, said: 'I don't think anyone with any knowledge of foreign exchange markets would have expected the actions the government took to quieten things down. The Treasury totally underestimated the huge force of the money flowing out of the pound via the currency markets.' One difficulty, according to Mr Bootle, is that the Treasury has few people with a background in financial markets. 'Time and again in the past 30 years, we have seen the government crucified by the markets, but the Civil Service insists on filling the top jobs in the Treasury by people who come in with academic backgrounds.' One handicap in recruiting such people with a knowledge of financial markets to the Treasury is the large difference in salaries paid to civil servants compared with people in the City. In recent years, there has been a large flow of people from the Treasury going to work for financial groups, with few going the other way. According to Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of economics at brokers Charterhouse Tilney, this week's events indicate the Treasury's difficulty in assessing the mood of financial markets, where many saw big obstacles to Britain's maintaining the high interest rates required by membership of the exchange rate mechanism at a time of deep recession. 'The position was looking to many people increasingly untenable,' Mr Jeffrey said. 'We have seen this week just how distant the Treasury is from the real world.' While such criticisms are commonly made about the Treasury, there are indications that some aspects of Treasury culture are changing. For example, Mr Budd, who came to the Treasury last year from being economic adviser at Barclays Bank and is one of the few Treasury senior mandarins with experience in the financial services sector, has instituted a series of regular meeting with top economists from companies as part of an attempt to find out about economic conditions in industry. Mr Gerry Grimstone, a former senior Treasury official who is now head of corporate finance at Schroders, the merchant bank, said that in spite of such efforts a culture gap existed between the Treasury and the outside world. 'Treasury people are a bit like the inhabitants of a monastery who think they have all the answers. They are the keepers of the faith and the others outside are the infidels.'</p>

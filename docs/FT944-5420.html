			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (3): Extra cost, but extra service too - Broker unit trusts A broker unit trust forms a separate part of a unit trust of a host company  -such as a unit trust group or life insurance company, which retains legal ownership - but with investment advice provided either by a stockbroker or independent financial adviser. The broker or adviser has to obtain special permission from the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), the Investment Managers Regulatory Organisation (Imro) or the Securities and Futures Association (SFA) before he can offer broker unit trusts. The biggest host company of broker unit trusts is Old Mutual (which this month changed its name from Providence Capitol), with about Pounds 70m under its control. The host company has the power to withdraw the adviser's investment management role if it feels the adviser is no longer fit and proper to run the fund's investments; in which case the host company may absorb the broker fund monies into its own unit trust or manage them itself. Because the broker unit trust forms part of the unit trust company, the investments have to be within unit trust legislation and regulation. This will include shares quoted on any recognised worldwide stock exchange, futures, derivatives and so on. With the host company and broker both involved in running the broker unit trust, all charges are split between the two. The initial charge will be shared out to cover the broker's or adviser's commission and the management company's administration. The annual management charge is also shared. However, the charges on broker unit trusts are usually higher than those levied by the underlying unit trust. There are basically two types of broker unit trust: the securities version, and the fund-of-funds version. The securities version invests directly in shares and securities to achieve a specific investment objective. By contrast, the fund-of-funds trust involves clients of a similar investment profile, being invested in one unit trust which then invests in a range of others to provide the required spread of investments with attendant saving on costs boosting efficiency. One big advantage of investing in fund-of-funds broker unit trusts is that capital gains tax can be kept to a minimum. Through bed-and-breakfasting, the liability can be diminished even further to almost nil. A broker unit trust manager can make one transaction within his fund on behalf of many clients without CGT, buying in bulk at competitive prices. A broker unit trust is basically an asset allocation and administration tool, which provides an extra level of service paid for by a higher management charge. As such, the broker unit trust can offer a worthwhile financial planning vehicle, and the fund-of-funds version offers a cost-effective way of replacing the discretionary unit trust portfolio management service, with the added benefit of closer dialogue with the investment manager (the broker).</p>

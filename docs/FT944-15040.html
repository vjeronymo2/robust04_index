			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / People: Sikorski scores at Proteus International Jurek Sikorski, business development and marketing director at Proteus International, has been promoted to chief executive just five months after joining the biotechnology company. The move follows the group's decision to accelerate the search for commercial applications for some of its 30 products under development. Sikorsky, 43, is expected to use experience gained at Smith and Nephew - the healthcare group where he was international marketing director - to form more collaborative ventures with pharmaceutical companies, offseting the cost of bringing products to market. Of those products, Proteus has high hopes for Adjuvant - its immune system booster for treating arthritis - and a new diagnostic test for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease, in live cattle. Proteus is discussing development programmes for Adjuvant with nine pharmaceutical companies, while an animal health company is said to be interested in manufacturing and marketing the BSE test. Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, said Sikorski - son of a Polish immigrant and one-time professional footballer with Swindon Town - was 'ideally placed' to push the products forward. 'Jurek will not only accelerate our development programmes but help us replace our entrepreneurial style with the kind of structured line management we now need,' he added. John Pool, Proteus's 50-year-old managing director, has been named deputy chairman but will continue to oversee the group's research and development arm.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt  (Free Democratic Party) believes that buoyant forces are  increasingly gaining the upper hand in the German economy.  Introducing the monthly economic report, Rexrodt said in Bonn  today that the economic revival is strengthening in western  Germany. With growth of 2.1 percent, the GDP in the first  quarter of 1994 has for the first time in a year surpassed last  year's figure. Around half the loss in overall production which  occured during the preceding recession was made up as a result  of the latest increase. In general, a further strengthening of  the upward trend in the west can be expected.    The rate of recovery in the eastern states is particularly  strong in industry. Thus, incoming orders in the manufacturing  industry in the first quarter are nearly 20 percent higher than  last year. The construction industry is also expanding rapidly.  According to the ministry, orders in the construction industry  exceeded last year's results by 31 percent in the first quarter  of 1994.    The consequences of the recession on the labor market in the  west are still in evidence. In general, however, unemployment  seems to have bottomed out, said Rexrodt. Seasonally adjusted,  the decline in employment and rise in unemployment has slowed  down noticeably.</p>

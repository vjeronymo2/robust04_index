The forecast that the surplus will fall to 2.8 percent of  gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1994 starting Friday  cannot "so directly become a promise or target," Manae Kubota,  Director General of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a  regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. But  the government will "make efforts" to realize the 2.8 percent  figure, which was previously released as the official forecast,  she said.    Kubota noted that the current account surplus, expected to  come to 3.1 percent of GDP this fiscal year, is affected by such  international factors as currency exchange rates.    The surplus forecast, as well as plans to review the  government's 430 trillion public works spending program for the  decade through 2001, were included in the package of  market-opening steps approved at the cabinet meeting.    The United States has said it will consider restarting  collapsed bilateral trade "framework" talks depending on the  contents of the package.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Spain's annual inflation rate slows to 5.2% SPAIN'S consumer price index rose just 0.3 per cent in July, well below market expectations, to draw annualised inflation down a full percentage point from June, to 5.2 per cent. The figures are the best recorded in a July in Spain since 1983 and were greeted with delight by the government, which had to revise upwards its 1992 inflation forecasts after big price rises at the beginning of the year. The Finance Ministry said the July figures would help narrow Spain's inflation gap with the EC's best performers and said the low CPI rise was due mainly to weak food costs.</p>

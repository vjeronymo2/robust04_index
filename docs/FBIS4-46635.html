			<p>Presence   <F P=102>   94UM0472A Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY in Russian 14 Jun 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 94UM0472A </F> <F P=104>  Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Aleksandr Kostyukov, commander of </F> the Simferopol Brigade of the Ukraine National Guard, by Senior  Lieutenant Igor Krol, press service officer of the Ukraine  National Guard commander; place and date not given: "A  Detachment Patrols the City..."]    [Text] [Krol] The situation surrounding the Ukraine  National Guard troop unit created two years ago in the Crimea  has recently become an intensely heated topic in certain of the  mass media. Is everything truly taking place the way it is being  presented in the sensational newspaper reports we have been  reading?    [Kostyukov] In my view, the authors of many published  materials on the Guardsmen lack objectivity in their approach  and treatment of the issues surrounding the Guard's vital  activity in Crimea. The problem lies in the fact that they make  little effort to ascertain whether or not the facts they report  on the pages of the newspaper conform to reality. On the other  hand, no one forgets to saturate his material with sarcastic  commentary, hang insulting labels on the soldiers and officers  without justification, and make every possible "prediction" with  respect to their future service on the peninsula...    Time and again I have been able only to marvel as I read the  missions supposedly assigned the troop unit under my command. I  could not even imagine that our brigade was to put its foot down  somewhere or take the city by storm, that extended operation  would cause our automatic weapons to burn out...    Although I am far removed from the journalism profession, as  an individual entrusted with great responsibility I am directly  concerned with seeing to it that truth alone prevails in the  treatment of events taking place with respect to us. In  developing their subject material, certain writers truly forget  to look before they leap and simply throw out their report. Can  it be permissible to relate to this issue in such a manner?    I want to tell everyone desiring to write about those under  my command that the door to my office, and the doors to the  offices of my deputies, are always open to receive editorial  personnel. "Come in, be our guest!"--as they say. We are always  happy to show you how we live and serve. We will answer any  question of interest to you.    [Krol] What in your view are the reasons behind the  appearance in the press of all kinds of attacks against the  Guard?    [Kostyukov] I will tell you quite frankly that it is no  accident all of this is taking place. Standing behind this flow  of filthy propaganda is a certain political or other force whose  agenda welcomes the newspaper accounts purposefully directed  towards slandering our Guardsmen, accounts that intentionally  create a negative impression of them among the local populace.    The Guard is standing in the way of certain destructive  forces of society striving at any price to achieve the  implementation of their plans to destroy the unity and integrity  of Ukraine. These forces see us as a threat to themselves and  are therefore fighting us with lies, aspersions, and mudslinging.    [Krol] In particular, there have been reports concerning a  number of conflicts...    [Kostyukov] This is the way it happened. On 15 May, three  soldiers in a special missions company, on leave, went into a  cafe for something to eat. An intoxicated man came up to one of  them and started taunting him, to the effect of--what are you  doing here soldier, you with the Ukrainian uniform insignia? The  soldier had to endure an abusive verbal assault, but decided not  to get into a fight and did absolutely nothing in response to  the insulting provocation. Only when the man put his fists in  motion did the soldier respond with a professional rebuff. The  servicemen sat in the cafe a while longer, then went for a walk  in the city. However, they were soon subjected to attack by a  militia group of eight men armed with automatic weapons.    Not understanding what was going on, the Guardsmen were  forced to defend themselves from a group that constituted in  fact their comrades-in-arms. In this regard, the latter acted  without any explanation whatsoever... The soldiers were beat up  and accused of involvement in a drunken brawl, although a panel  of experts confirmed their absolute sobriety. After all was said  and done, they were released to their unit.    I do not understand why the militia had to act in this  manner, and under a false accusation to boot. Would it not have  been wiser to report the incident to the military headquarters  and have a patrol sent out instead of conducting an armed  assault against innocent comrades?    [Krol] What kind of impression can such fabrications impart  to people, especially if they do not have accurate information?    [Kostyukov] You can only imagine. If I were in their  position  I would feel far from good about it. I am horrified at the  thought of such "defenders." But this has already become the  system. God help us if people believe lies. As people used to  say in bygone days: The truth cannot even manage to get started  in the time it takes a lie to travel the world over.    [Krol] What is the military collective of the brigade doing  today?    [Kostyukov] There is a great deal to be done in resolving  problems concerning the rear, making the living conditions of  the soldiers suitable. The main portion of our training time,  naturally, is devoted to combat and special training. But the  most important aspect is the official detail, operating five  times a week, aimed at preserving public order in the city. We  may assert that we have managed to attain fairly good results in  the fight against crime, especially this year. We are assigning  more and more military details to assist the militia. This is  how citizens are afforded security with respect to criminal  attempts on their lives and property. Since the beginning of the  current year, soldiers have detained more than 3,200 individuals  for administrative violations, seven persons for crimes. Three  firearms have been confiscated.    A few nuances emerge here, however. In my constant  inspections of duty performance procedure, I often discover that  not all the internal-affairs personnel comprising a joint  militia-Guard patrol treat the performance of their official  duties in a fully responsible manner.    But I see my most important task as brigade commander in  ensuring that all my subordinates become true Guardsmen  representing the elite of the Armed Forces, that they serve as  an example to all military servicemen.    Experience shows that wherever National Guardsmen are  stationed and whatever missions they are carrying out, they have  always earned the prestige of the local populace. Is there any  reason for certain people to fear us? Yes--those who have  decided to break the law, to profit from others' good deeds, to  raise a hand against the weak...    By virtue of our calling, we have been and always will be  found where conditions are the most difficult, where people need  our help. The people of Crimea can put their complete trust in  us, can rely on us for anything. We will not let them down.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Receivers appointed at Henry Barrett ADMINISTRATIVE receivers were yesterday appointed to Henry Barrett Group, the Bradford-based steel stockholding and construction company, which suspended its shares on Wednesday at 7p. Five subsidiaries are in receivership - Westbury Tubular Structures; Don Reynolds, which makes flat-panel cladding; Potter Johnson, which fabricates steel-framed buildings; OSS Origo, a material handlings company; and HB Projects, which manages construction. Subsidiaries not in receivership include Henry Barrett Steel Services, the stockholding side of the business; Henry Barrett Steel Buildings; and Lindpater International, the special fastenings group. The receivers - Mr Alan Griffiths, Mr Peter Flesher and Mr Geoff Gee from Grant Thornton - said all three had interested buyers and negotiations for sale were underway. Mr Gee said the companies in receivership would continue to trade while potential buyers were sought. It was too early to tell whether redundancies would be inevitable. The group employs 750 people, of whom 400 are based in Bradford with a further 81 in Wetherby, Yorkshire. A total of 225 employees are in subsidiaries affected by receivership. Henry Barrett has been supported for some time by its banks, led by Barclays. It appears that the group's failure to achieve any of the disposals under negotiation, along with the gloomy trading outlook, led to the receivership.</p>

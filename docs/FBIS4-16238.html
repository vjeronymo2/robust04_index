			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Despite current  difficulties, all CIS states are moving ahead to establish their  national armies, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said.    Grachev believes there is a good chance of establishing  united armed forces in the Commonwealth of Independent States by  the end of the year. He admitted, however, that the pace of the  process will largely depend on the economic situation in these  states.    Speaking to journalists after a meeting of the CIS defence  ministers in Moscow on Thursday, Grachev stressed that the  establishment of united armed forces will enable CIS  member-states to begin thinking about an Eurasian defence union,  which, according to the minister, will be "much bigger than the  Treaty of Collective Security." "Together we will hold  defenses, arm ourselves and make military equipment," he said.    The meeting which was attended by 11 CIS defence leaders  with  the exception of Moldavian [Moldovan] minister focused on  documents regulating the work of the secretariat of the  collective Security Council and a declaration of states parties  to the Treaty of Collective Security which outlines the basic  principles of cooperation on security issues. The declaration  will be submitted to the CIS leaders for signing on Friday.    Grachev who chaired the meeting said that the CIS presidents  will discuss, among other matters, issues connected with  additional measures to protect the Tajik-Afghan border and the  status of collective peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan.</p>

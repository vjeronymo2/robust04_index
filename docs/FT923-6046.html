			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / German banks defend low saver rates GERMAN banks defended themselves yesterday against charges that they were paying too little interest on savings accounts, arguing that rates paid on most deposits were well above the inflation rate. Stung by the Federal Cartel office's decision to investigate savings rates in the Berlin area, leading banks said that most pass-book accounts - on which low rates are mostly payable - were used as cash accounts, with money available on demand. The cartel office, based in Berlin, said it was limiting its inquiries to the city to keep down the cost and complexity of the operation. But it said the suspicion that banks were colluding to keep rates low on pass-book savings applied to the whole country. The cartel office has written to banks informing them of its scrutiny and will send a further letter with detailed questions about their position and policies in the savings market. The banks under investigation are: Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank, Berliner Bank, Berliner Volksbank, Grundkreditbank, Landesbank Berlin, and the Postbank. If the cartel office finds against the banks, it can require them to lift rates. It said there were around DM500bn (Pounds 179bn) of savings in pass-book accounts, of which roughly half were subject to interest rates of less than 3 per cent. This is below the inflation rate and has hardly risen in recent years. The cartel authorities received support from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank, who said banks should do more to encourage the expansion of savings across a wide spectrum of the population. However, banks said the strong growth in savings deposits, helped by the switch of east German savers to higher-rate accounts, showed they were offering competitive rates. At mid-year, Deutsche Bank had DM40bn-worth of savings deposits, only a quarter of which were in pass-book accounts paying an average 2.7 per cent; the rest were mostly at rates of 7 per cent or more. To obtain higher rates, savers need a minimum of DM5,000. Pass-book accounts are for savings of less than DM2,000. The cartel office claimed this discriminated against people saving small amounts regularly to build up a larger balance.</p>

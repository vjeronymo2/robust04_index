The so-called framework trade negotiations between Japan and  the United States move up to the deputy minister level Sunday as  working-level officials were struggling to complete a "progress  report," their positions deadlocked over pivotal provisions of  the framework accord.    "I guess objective criteria will be main theme at the  deputies' meeting" on government procurement, a Japanese  official involved in the trade talks told reporters after  completing yet another working-group session with U.S. officials  Saturday.    A huge Japanese Government team comprising 40 to 50  officials  is in Washington for a wide range of sector-by-sector trade  talks set for the coming week.    Two sets of deputy minister meetings are set for Sunday, one  on the implementation of existing trade agreements concluded  between the two countries and the other on foreign access to the  government procurement market in Japan.    The U.S. insists on setting "quantitative criteria" to  measure the progress of foreign access and sales in the Japanese  Government procurement market. Japan has balked at the U.S.  demand, arguing that any numerical yardstick would inevitably be  regarded by the U.S. as a formal commitment by Japan to set  aside a certain market share for foreign firms.    Japanese officials appear not to be hopeful of any  breakthrough on the "objective criteria" issue at the deputy  ministers' meetings. "The prognosis looks dicey," one official  said.    The stalemate on objective criteria is just one of many gaps  between the two sides on the government procurement issue.    Japanese officials said there is no agreement on the scope  of  public entities that must be covered under new government  procurement codes nor on the amount of government procurement  that must be open to foreign participation.    In addition to government procurement issues, other areas of  framework trade talks scheduled for the coming week in  Washington include sales of foreign-made automobiles and auto  parts in Japan, regulatory reform and issues of competitiveness  between the two countries.    The entire set of negotiations is supposed to be concluded  prior to the summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11 in Washington.</p>

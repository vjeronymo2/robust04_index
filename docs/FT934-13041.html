			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Agency success should also be recognised Sir, Your headline, 'Arrogant Welsh agency is humbled' (October 21) and subsequent comments contained in the article appear to miss the fact that the Welsh Development Agency was successful on a world scale. Dr Gwyn Jones, the former chairman, and Philip Head, former chief executive, have committed the heinous crime of running a quasi-government body in a professional and successful manner. The relatively small amounts of money spent outside Treasury guidelines (I understand it to be less than Pounds 3m) pales into insignificance when compared to more than Pounds 1bn of inward investment they attracted to Wales last year alone and the operational savings they made within the WDA. We continue to benefit from both. While, like all human beings, neither Gwyn Jones nor Philip Head is perfect, both have proved themselves excellent custodians of public money, creating wealth and opportunity within the Welsh agency.

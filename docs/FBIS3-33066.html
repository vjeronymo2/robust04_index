			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria said today he was pleased by the support  he has received for his possible candidacy for OAS general  secretary. Gaviria commented he will soon announce whether he  will run. "I am pleased and thankful for President Alberto  Fujimori's anticipated support of a possible candidacy for the  post," Gaviria said during a tour with his Peruvian colleague  through the crowded Ciudad Bolivar neighborhood, south of this  capital.    Gaviria's still unofficial aspiration to the OAS post has  gained momentum in recent days as former Bolivian Foreign  Minister Carlos Irurralde withdrew his candidacy, while  concomitantly announcing his support for the Colombian president.    The executive noted: "I must weigh the opinions and requests  of friendly nations in order to make a decision in the next few  days."    At the conclusion of a visit to Washington, Colombian  Foreign  Minister Noemi Sanin was "more optimistic than ever," stating  that if OAS elections were held now Gaviria would win.    Colombia's political opposition, which has criticized  Gaviria's aspirations for this post, called President Alberto  Fujimori "Gaviria's OAS campaign manager." At the beginning of  his two-day visit on Monday to Colombia, the Peruvian president  made public his support for Gaviria's candidacy, arguing that  the Colombian president's vitality and youth make him the best  choice for the post.    Both presidents toured Santa Fe de Bogota's poverty-stricken  neighborhoods, according to Fujimori, to "see how the Colombian  Government faces problems with public services with a view to  possibly transplanting this experience to Peru."    The visitor, who ended his stay in Colombia on Tuesday,  awarded his host the "Sun of Peru" order in the "Large Cross  With Diamonds" grade.    Diplomatic sources see a complicated scene for Costa Rican  Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, Gaviria's main opponent, while  noting that only Oscar Arias, former president of that same  Central American nation, could pose a challenge to Gaviria for  the post.    Media reports from Miami, Florida, indicated on Monday that  Arias would be willing to accept the OAS candidacy if Niehaus  withdraws and if this would guarantee Central America a place in  the OAS General Secretariat.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: GFSA reaps benefit of higher average gold price in first term A 17 per cent rise in the average gold price received helped Gold Fields of South Africa lift after-tax profit from its gold mines by nearly 30 per cent to R396.6m (USDollars 115m) from R306.6m in the first quarter, which ended in September. The mid-year price spike in the gold bullion market saw the average price rise to R41,640 a kg from R35,672 a kg the previous quarter. Gold Fields does not hedge any of its production, so the price accurately reflects the spot market. However, Mr Alan Munro, executive director, pointed out that this price was still lower in real terms than the price of between four and five years years ago. Overall group production rose slightly to 29,258kg in the quarter from 28,775kg in June. Working profit increased by 45 per cent to R491.3m from R337.8m, but the tax bill more than doubled to R148.6m from R72.4m, which restricted growth in bottom-line earnings. Mr Munro would not comment on whether the better gold price (following the recent weakening of the rand, it is still trading close to R40,000 a kg) would encourage any new mines to be developed, but said existing producers were busy with substantial replacement tonnage schemes. Driefontein, the group's flagship producer, had a steady quarter, with West Driefontein continuing to recover from disruptions caused by fire and East Driefontein again the star performer. After-tax profits rose to R185.9m from R161.9m, but the tax bill rose to R142.5m from R67.5m. Kloof, the other large producer in the group, fared rather better because the merger last year with Libanon and Venterspost resulted in it paying barely any tax. As a result, after-tax profits increased to R187.5m from R114.1m. Mr Munro also pointed to the turnround at the Libanon division, which would have been closed but for the merger. The mine made a working profit of R7.7m, following a R15.2m loss in the previous quarter. Of the other two producers in the group, the marginal Doornfontein made a taxed profit of R4.6m, down from R15.3m, while Deelkraal increased profits to R18.6m from R15.2m.</p>

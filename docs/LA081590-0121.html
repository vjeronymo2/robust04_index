			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TRUST PLEDGED TO UCI  </P> <P> A Fullerton couple has pledged a trust fund valued at more than $100,000 to  create a much-needed biological sciences fellowship at UC Irvine, a university  spokesman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The William D. Redfield Fellowship will provide research funds and expenses for  a promising graduate student in the department of molecular biology and  biochemistry beginning this fall, UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said.  </P> <P> It is the first fellowship of its kind at UCI's School of Biological Sciences,  and Dean L. Dennis Smith said he hoped it would encourage the creation of  others to support graduate students who otherwise could not afford to get their  degrees.  </P> <P> "I got a fellowship when I went to school. Had I not had one, I'm not sure how  far I would have progressed," said Smith, a developmental biologist who on  Sept. 1 takes UCI's No. 2 position as executive vice chancellor.  </P> <P> The fellowship fund was offered July 26 on Redfield's 75th birthday by his  wife, Elaine, a longtime UCI supporter and member of the university  foundation's board of directors.  </P> <P> "This type of contribution is an investment without peer," said Redfield, a  retired scientist for the Chevron Oil Field Research Corp. who, himself, made  it through UCLA's microbiology doctoral program in 1945 with the aid of a  privately funded fellowship.  </P> <P> "It is the only way to attract really good people into research," he said.  "Even a public university cannot depend solely on government support."  </P> <P> A recipient for this year's Redfield fellowship will be chosen by a faculty  committee this fall, Smith said.  </P> <P> The trust fund is expected to generate about $5,000 annually to support a  graduate student. Because it does not revert to the university until the death  of the Redfields, they have pledged annual donations of $2,500. That amount  will be matched by Redfield's former employer through its employee matching  gifts program, Nelson said.  </P> <P> Smith said graduate students in the University of California system are paid  about $14,000 annually, which must cover tuition, fees and living expenses. But  because only 50% of the graduate students are covered, the others, typically  those who work in the sciences, must be funded through various research grants  and fellowships.  </P> <P> "It is ironic, when you think about it, that there is developing a major  national need for Ph.D.s in the sciences at the same time research support to  train students is decreasing," Smith said, referring to the increasing  difficulty professors nationally are having in winning federal funds for  research grants.  </P> <P> UCI, which took in a record $78 million in the 1989-90 academic year in  research grants, is "doing quite well," Smith said. But for the biological  sciences school to be at the forefront in this major research field, more  fellowships are needed.  </P> <P> "I earnestly hope that the Redfield fellowship will be an example for other  people to set up similar kinds of fellowships," Smith said.

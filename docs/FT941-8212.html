			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: German groups reluctant to list / Examining a deep-seated cultural aversion of family-owned companies to the stock market Last summer, Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, head of corporate finance at Deutsche Bank, made a brave prognosis. He predicted that in the medium to long-term, between 1,500 and 2,000 companies would come to the German stock market In retrospect, his prediction looks excessively optimistic. In spite of buoyant stock market conditions last year, only 11 companies went public - up from seven in 1992 but down from the 19 new issues in 1991 and 26 in 1990. Following last year's listings, the number of companies quoted on the eight German stock exchanges is now a modest 664. Collectively, Germany's quoted companies had a market capitalisation of about DM800bn (Dollars 466bn) at the end of last year. This represents 30 to 35 per cent of Germany's GDP - far less than in the UK, the US, Japan or Hong Kong, where the stock markets account for between 60 and more than 100 per cent of GDP. These figures show that Germany's stock market, however popular with international investors last year (the DAX index of 30 leading shares rose 46.7 per cent in 1993) is underdeveloped. The capitalisation of the German market is only the third largest in Europe  -although Germany is Europe's largest economy. The total number of new issues in Germany over the last 10 years has been about 200 - compared with 180 in the UK last year alone. 'We looked on with envy at the number of new issues in the UK last year,' said Mr Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse (the German stock exchange). This lack of development means that investors are denied the opportunity to buy into important sectors of the German economy, such as food manufacturing or services, because there are few quoted companies in these sectors. There are at least 2,000 German manufacturing companies with turnover of DM100m or more, that being the size at which the owners of such companies could bring them to the stock market in they wanted to. The problem is, as the meagre new issue statistics show, few owners of such companies want to bring them to the market. Why should this be? One consideration is that domestic institutional shareholders - pension funds and insurance companies which are the natural buyers of new issue shares - are thin on the ground in Germany. In 1990, when the Bundesbank last published a study of the ownership structure of the German stock market, such institutions owned just 12 per cent of the market - compared with 55 per cent in the UK. If institutional investors are under-represented on the German stock market, so are private households, whose share of stock market ownership dropped from 27 per cent in 1960 to 17 per cent in 1990. In the case of new issues, investors' suspicions have been underscored by aggressive pricing. A recent study from Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, the German bank owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK, shows that new issues have not proved to be very rewarding investments over 1992 - 93. Only two of the 1992 new issues outperformed the market last year, while two fell in price and one went bankrupt. If these factors explain why there is limited demand for shares in new companies, they do not address the problem of supply. Owners of large 'mittelstand' companies could overcome these hurdles if they wanted to. That they do not reflects a deep-seated cultural aversion to the stockmarket. 'Why should I share my independence with anyone else,' asks Mr Reinhold Wurth, proprietor of the Wurth group, a distributor of screws, fasteners and other products used by the building trade. With turnover of more than DM3bn and unbroken profits growth over 40 years, it could easily float. 'But why should I take such a step as long as I can cover my growth with profits and cash flow?' Mr Wurth said. This sentiment is expressed time and time again by family owners of companies which in the US or the UK would almost without exception be listed. The reason is that the move from private company to quote company status forces a reorientation of priorities. 'It is a big step from managing the business with a view to paying as small a tax bill as possible to generating profits for outside shareholders,' says an official at Commerzbank. 'Owners do not want the publicity associated with a quote,' he says. 'They are not particularly interested in money, either - they are rich enough already. They are more concerned not to lose their special position within their local community and are acutely conscious that their power and influence will disappear. If they sell, they become merely rich - as the proprietor of a company they really are somebody.' Even when a family decides to list, it rarely abandons control to the vagaries of the stock market. Thus the BMW group - majority-owned by the Quandt family - can enjoy the benefits of the stock market without changing its essential character as a (very large) family business. Analysts predict that the number of new issues will accelerate towards the end of the current decade. But it seems unlikely that an Anglo-American 'equity culture' will be take root in Germany until well into the 21st century.</p>

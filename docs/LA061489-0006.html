			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EXXON SEEKS TO ASSUAGE ENVIRONMENTAL FEARS OVER DAMAGED TANKER  </P> <P> Exxon executives met with San Diego environmentalists Tuesday to offer  assurances that the Exxon Valdez -- the oil tanker that caused a mammoth oil  spill off the Alaskan coast in March -- will pose no environmental hazard to  San Diego Bay when the vessel is towed here for repairs next month.  </P> <P> Jay Powell of the Environmental Health Coalition and Joan Jackson of the Sierra  Club met with Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank J. Iarossi at the National  Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. yard. According to both environmentalists, Iarossi  requested the meeting.  </P> <P> Nassco built the Valdez in 1986 and has been contracted to do the repairs,  which will cost about $25 million and take nine months to complete. Exxon has  applied for a Coast Guard permit to tow the vessel 2,500 miles from Prince  William Sound in Alaska to San Diego. Iarossi said the company expects to get  the permit later this month, and it will take about three weeks to make the  trip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cleansed of Oil  </P> <P> At a press conference Monday, Iarossi said the giant tanker has been cleansed  of oil residue inside and out. According to Iarossi, the tanks in which the  crude oil was stored have been thoroughly cleaned, and traces of oil amount to  about one part per million.  </P> <P> However, environmentalists said they are still concerned about the possibility  that the Valdez could pollute harbor waters. Despite assurances from Iarossi  that the ship is not a pollution threat, both Powell and Jackson said they will  wait until they review an Exxon-sponsored study of the towing operation before  making further comments.  </P> <P> They said that Iarossi promised to make available to them a 70-page report that  was also made available to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has proclaimed the  vessel seaworthy.  </P> <P> Powell criticized the San Diego Unified Port District's apparent lack of  involvement in planning the towing project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Port District Notified  </P> <P> "Both representatives (from Exxon and Nassco) came into the port and notified  us," Port District spokesman Jim Anderson said. "We asked for some kind of  assurance that it would pose no environmental problems. The two parties said  they would be getting Coast Guard clearance that the ship would pose no  pollution problems."  </P> <P> Powell argued that the Port District should have played a more active role in  the negotiations to bring the Valdez to San Diego.  </P> <P> "They're relying on the Coast Guard to make the call on this and not being  pro-active," Powell said. "They shouldn't do business this way. . . . The port  should be demanding a more thorough review of this thing. They should send  their own guys to look at the ship and decide if it's a threat."  </P> <P> Powell added that his group also has reservations about the sudden announcement  by Exxon executives that the Valdez will be repaired at Nassco and the fact  that they did not solicit public comment.  </P> <P> "We're still very uncomfortable about the way Exxon handled it," Powell said.  "They basically popped this on everybody. . . . They said this is the way they  wanted to do it; do it all at once and let everybody know at the same time. . .  . Basically, nobody had any say in the matter except Exxon and Nassco."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Port District spokesman Anderson said Port officials were notified  that the Valdez was being towed to San Diego shortly before the company made  the decision public at a Monday-afternoon press conference at Nassco.  </P></p>

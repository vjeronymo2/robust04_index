			<p>BFN     [Text] The High Privy Council held a working meeting at  the Royal Palace on the morning of 29 March in the lofty  presence of Privy Councillors Samdech Nhoek Chulong, Samdech  Heng Samrin, Samdech Son Sann, Samdech Chau Senkosal, His  Excellency [H.E.] Say Phuthang, H.E. Chea Soth, and H.E. Mat Ly.  H.E. Kong Sam-ol, deputy prime minister of the Royal Palace,  was also present.    The meeting focussed on the presence of the king of  Cambodia,  who will return and stay in the Royal Palace in early April.    The king will receive the people in audiences to solve their  key problems, specifically problems dealing with the farmers'  livelihood. The king is the last resort to solving, via the  audiences, any problem that the government and National Assembly  are not able to smooth out.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 growers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural growers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of these handlers and a majority of the growers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The marketing order for Florida citrus provides for the establishment of minimum grade and size requirements. The minimum grade and size requirements are designed to provide fresh markets with fruit of acceptable quality, thereby maintaining consumer confidence for fresh Florida citrus. This helps create buyer confidence and contributes to stable marketing conditions. This is in the interest of producers, packers, and consumers, and is designed to increase returns to Florida citrus growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cultural practices of producers of organically grown citrus differ from normal industry practices. Because of these differences, organically grown fruit is usually required to meet a different grade standard under the marketing order. This grade standard pertains only to the external characteristics of the fruit, not the internal quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The different grade standard is needed to facilitate the marketing of organic citrus. There are indications that organically grown citrus, from a marketing standpoint, are a different commodity than conventionally grown citrus. Organic citrus generally has higher external damage. Organic fruit for the most part is marketed differently, is not mixed with non-organic fruit, appeals only to certain consumers, and is in many respects, a specialized commodity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action invites comments on changes to the administrative rules and regulations prescribed under the Florida citrus marketing order. This rule more precisely defines organic fruit, and the type of market outlets which organically grown fruit may be sold in, free from certain requirements imposed under the order. These changes were unanimously recommended by the committee at its November 16, 1993 meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

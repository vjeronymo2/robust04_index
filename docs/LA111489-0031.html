			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A COSTLY HOUR WITH SWEENEY TODD, DDS;  </P> <P> LIVING: WHEN YOUR DENTIST SAYS 'OPEN WIDE,' HE MEANS YOUR WALLET, NOT YOUR  MOUTH.  </P> <P> My dentist -- Sweeney Todd, DDS -- had his receptionist phone me to say that I  should come in for an appointment. I figured Sweeney was having cash-flow  problems again.  </P> <P> "What is it this time?" I asked the receptionist.  </P> <P> "He says that he was looking at your X-rays, and you need a crown in the lower  left something or other," she said.  </P> <P> "I don't mean what is it with me," I said. "What is it with him? Did the kid's  college tuition bill just come in? Would you mind just shouting back there and  asking him how much he owes for what? I'd like to get myself prepared."  </P> <P> "I can't," the receptionist said. "He's in the Caribbean until next Tuesday.  Before he left, he gave me a list of patients to call. He told me that he'll  need you for an hour on the first appointment."  </P> <P> "An hour on the first appointment?" I said. "Sounds like Jamaica. Or maybe  Antigua. This is definitely no cheapie to the Bahamas. That time he went to the  Bahamas he only needed me for a half-hour session with the dental hygienist.  May I ask if he took the wife and kids?"  </P> <P> "And his in-laws," the receptionist said.  </P> <P> "Erghh," I said, with some feeling. "I think we're talking gold crown here.  Maybe even root canal."  </P> <P> I showed up for the hour appointment anyway. What's the alternative? I don't  think I'm up to auto-dentistry.  </P> <P> I could switch dentists, of course, but I've become sort of used to old  Sweeney. I'd feel something was missing if a dentist didn't accompany his  drilling with a lot of talk about how much electricians charge for a simple  rewiring job these days.  </P> <P> Besides, I don't know any other dentists. I don't admit that to Sweeney Todd,  DDS, of course. In fact, I've been telling him for years that some friends of  mine are always singing the praises of the dentist they all go to, a relatively  recent arrival from Kyoto known to his grateful patients as Magic Fingers  Yamamoto.  </P> <P> "They say he's got the touch of an angel," I said of Yamamoto, as I settled  into the chair and prepared for the assaults of a deeply tanned Sweeney Todd,  DDS.  </P> <P> "Open wide, please," Sweeney said.  </P> <P> "Also, Yamamoto belongs to some sect that believes the exchange of large sums  of money corrupts the soul," I continued. "For crowns and bridges, he does  wonders with the same material used for the common paper clip. His fees, of  course, are nominal. Basically, he seeks his rewards in inner fulfillment. He  spits on money -- or he would if he weren't so polite."  </P> <P> "Spit, please," Sweeney said.  </P> <P> Sweeney had stopped his banging around and was standing next to his instrument  cabinet peering at some X-rays.  </P> <P> "What do you see there, Sweeney?" I asked. "A new transmission for your BMW? A  long weekend with the missus in the Adirondacks?"  </P> <P> Sweeney held the X-rays up to the window to get a better look. "Won't be able  to get away for the next few weekends," Sweeney said. "We're doing an addition  to the kitchen."  </P> <P> "You never cease to amaze me, Sweeney," I said. "I've seen those television  commercials that show doctors seeing all sorts of little bitty doodads through  the miracle of CAT scans -- or not seeing them, really, because all of the  patients in those commercials turn out to be OK -- but you've got to be the  only medical man who can look at an X-ray with the naked eye and see an  addition to your kitchen. What's your secret?"  </P> <P> "I have a better X-ray machine," Sweeney said, knocking over the water glass as  he turned toward me, "but it's expensive. Very expensive. Open wide, please."  </P></p>

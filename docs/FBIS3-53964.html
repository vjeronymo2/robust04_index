When asked whether or  not he was in favor of a national referendum, Peres replied: We  will decide at the appropriate time. I am not rejecting the  idea out of hand. The foreign minister was speaking at Bet Berl  during a ceremony in which scholarships were awarded to Jewish  and Arab students.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Daimler plans Dollars 250m Singapore placement Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, is planning to place Dollars 250m-Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) worth of new shares in Singapore when it holds its long-awaited rights issue later this year, the group's finance director said yesterday. Speaking before Daimler-Benz was today due to become the first German company to acquire a listing on the Singapore stock exchange, Mr Gerhard Liener said the planned share placement would be part of the car to aircraft group's strategy of internationalising its shareholder base. Last year Daimler overcame German industry's traditional objections to US-style accounting disclosure and became the first German company to obtain a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest capital market. The group plans further listings in Madrid, Milan and Shanghai, Mr Liener said in Singapore yesterday. 'With Singapore we have decided to introduce our stock on the most dynamic capital market in this region of the world.' Mr Liener explained that Daimler-Benz hoped to raise up to Dollars 2bn from the issue of new shares, of which at least 10 per cent would be placed in Singapore. The cash is required to finance the group's growth and the issue would take place later this year, Daimler disclosed recently. While 30 to 35 per cent of Daimler's shares are owned outside Germany, the group is pursuing further internationalisation partly to support geographical expansion of its car business. Mr Liener hoped the listing would support its rapidly growing sales in south-east Asia - revenues in the region rose 36 per cent to DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) last year. As part of its expansion, Daimler is planning to open a Regional Parts Centre in Singapore. This would provide support for the group's commercial vehicle activities in the region. Mr Liener said the group expected to double its sales of commercial vehicles in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines this year. The group has also received official permission to start assembling buses and commercial vehicles in Vietnam, Mr Liener said. German private and public sector institutions are making increasing use of foreign investors as a source of finance. The most recent example is Dresdner Bank's international placing of new shares to raise DM1.14bn, concluded last Friday.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mixed results posted by Japan's drugs sector - New Products Boost The Bottom Lines Of Some Leading Pharmaceutical Companies JAPAN's top pharmaceutical companies have revealed mixed results for the year to March, with those marketing new products recording strong performances and others turning in lower profits. Sankyo, the second largest in the industry, posted solid earnings for the period thanks to sales of Mevalotin, its anti-hyperlipedemic drug. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, with its anti-ulcer treatment, and Tanabe Seiyaku, which posted a 6.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y13.1bn (Dollars 101.55m), also benefited from strong sales of some products. But Takeda Chemical Industries, Japan's largest drug maker, saw profits drop while Fujisawa Pharmaceutical posted a 16.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits as sales of its anti-ulcer drug failed to reach expected levels. Takeda's after-tax profits fell 12.5 per cent to Y32.5bn partly reflecting capital losses from a typhoon. Fujisawa recorded higher non-operating costs because of a rise in funding expenses. Other companies unveiling lower pre-tax profits included Eisai, which reported a 9.5 per cent decline to Y31.2bn, and Dainippon Pharmaceutical, with a drop of 10.5 per cent to Y9.4bn. For the current year to March 1993, Japanese pharmaceutical companies face the effects of an official drug price cut approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in April. The impact on companies with heavy dependence on sales of antibiotics is expected to be greater than on the industry as a whole. Mr Mitsuo Ohmi, pharmaceutical analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, said that the sector would need to introduce new high-margin products to offset price cuts. Takeda forecasts a 0.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y71.5bn on a 3.4 per cent rise in sales to Y580bn, while Sankyo expects a 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y58bn on a 7 per cent increase in sales to Y385bn.  --------------------------------------------------      TOP JAPANESE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES  --------------------------------------------------              Sales*   Change   Pre-tax   Change                               profits*  -------------------------------------------------- Takeda       560.9    +1.8      71.3      -3.1 Sankyo       359.5    +6.9      51.8     +19.0 Fujisawa     226.5    +2.4      15.5     -16.3 Yamanouchi   225.9    +6.0      61.1      +2.5  -------------------------------------------------- * Ybn for year to end-March  --------------------------------------------------</p>

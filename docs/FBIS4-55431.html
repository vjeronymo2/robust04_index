			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, 13 May (TANJUG) -- Milan Djukic, chairman of  the Serb National Party [SNP] in Zagreb, warned in a special  statement for the public today that the position of the Serbs in  Croatia "is no longer acceptable and can no longer be  tolerated." He asked why the Serbs who remained in Croatia have  become "second class citizens" and why they only have  obligations and not rights stemming from the constitution.  Djukic addressed a series of questions on Croatia's policies to  Croatian authorities, demanding to know "whether Croatia wishes  the Serbs to remain in Croatia at all," because the Croatian  authorities are completely oblivious to "the manner in which the  Serbs are leaving Croatia."    Djukic asked: Does Croatia want to reduce the Serbs to 8 or  5  percent of the total population of the country? He added that  President Franjo Tudjman was persistently trying to explain  certain facts to the public that are "counterproductive at a  time when a solution to the political crisis is being sought."  He cited as an example the introduction of the kuna as the new  currency; the genesis of this, he said, is well known to the  Serbian people [the kuna was the legal currency in the  Nazi-backed Independent State of Croatia during World War II].    Commenting on Tudjman's statement that communism had been  more damaging to Croatia than fascism, Djukic assessed that this  could only be acceptable to like-minded people but not to the  Serbs in Croatia who are not ashamed of their contribution to  the war against fascism and its domestic collaborators.    These questions are being posed at a time when, on the one  hand, the Croatian people are firmly determined to build a  sovereign and national state, while on the other, the Serb  people in Croatia "are having to put up with an imposed  political status against their will."    The Serbs that have remained in Croatia did not vote for a  state belonging solely to the Croats, but for a Croatia  belonging to all its citizens. They are not in favor of an  obscure model of democracy -- such as the national model -- but  of a bourgeois democracy, Djukic said.    We are in favor of Croatia's integrity, "But not at all  costs  -- not at the cost of war," the leader of the SNP said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Hui-yong] </F>   [Excerpts] When we visit the wide rice fields of the  cooperative farms in Unchon county, which is seething with the  work to carry out rice transplanting to achieve a bumper crop,  by highly upholding the party's militant call, we can see scenes  attracting the people's curiosity.    All the farms in this county use substitute fuel, which they  themselves produced, to operate tractors, rice seedling pullers,  and rice seedling transplanters to harrow rice fields, pull rice  seedlings, and carry out rice transplanting.    When passing through Sinchang, Namsan, and Songbong  cooperative farms to go to Yangdam cooperative farm, we were  able to see farmers joyously pull rice seedlings and carry out  rice transplanting using gas as fuel produced on the farms by  themselves. While guaranteeing a full operation and full  capacity of rice seedling pullers and rice seedling  transplanters by using gas as fuel, about 7 to 8 percent of all  the rice paddies are being transplanted every day in the county.  Therefore, rice transplanting on the basic area of rice paddies  has already been finished in the county. [passage omitted]    The functionaries of the county maintained model bases  producing substitute fuels in the plants in the county, and with  the substitute fuel produced here, they showed that they are  able to operate tractors, trucks, rice seedling transplanters,  and rice seedling pullers as much as they want. Therefore,  cooperative farms in the county maintained bases that produce  substitute fuel in accordance with the actual circumstances.  The functionaries of the county went into the cooperative farms  and solved technological problems arising in maintaining the  substitute fuel production bases and actively helped the  cooperative farms to quickly build the production bases.    Therefore, plants, enterprises, and cooperative farms in the  county started to produce substitute fuel from late last year.  [passage omitted]    A functionary of the county whom we met at the rice  transplanting battle field at the third work team of the Yangdam  cooperative farm said that there were many good points in  carrying out rice transplanting by using the substitute fuel.    If rice seedling transplanting is carried out with machines  using substitute fuel, much oil can be saved. Cooperative farms  in this county harrow rice fields, remove the young rice plants  from the seedbeds, and transplant rice by using the substitute  fuel, thus a large amount of oil is being saved.    Another good point is that if gas, the substitute fuel, is  used in rice seedling transplanters and rice seedling pullers,  the machines start easily, thus the expected rate of its  operation can be enhanced greatly. Experiences by the  cooperative farms in this county show that if the functionaries  use their wit and make efforts to fulfill the party policy, and  mobilize the plentiful source, substitute fuel can be produced  ever so much and thus enhance the rate of operation of the  agricultural machines.

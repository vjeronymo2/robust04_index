			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Firmly footed for the final hurdle: Helmut Kohl's revived fortunes in the German election campaign The greatest strength of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, according to one of his closest friends and admirers, is that he is always 'hugely underestimated' by his opponents. Now he appears to have got away with it again. As Germany's 1994 election marathon enters the final straight - with 12 out of 19 elections over, including the choice of a new federal president, and just seven to go - the big man is back in front, leaving his opponents apparently floundering in his wake. Less than seven months ago, before a party conference of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Hamburg, Mr Kohl looked practically down and out. His party was trailing the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) by 35.1 per cent to 40.9 per cent, and the chancellor himself looked even worse: his popularity rating stood at 26 per cent, compared with 35 per cent for Mr Rudolf Scharping, the youthful new leader of the SPD. This week, on the eve of two important state elections in east Germany, and just five weeks from the general election on October 16, the irrepressible Mr Kohl is sitting almost pretty: the most recent personal ratings give him 40 per cent, to only 30 per cent for Mr Scharping. As for the CDU, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, they are on a combined 40.3 per cent, compared with 34.2 per cent for the SPD. In spite of everything the opposition can throw at him, the chancellor appears unmoved and unflappable. And in spite of all the urgent promises the SPD can make, it does not seem to be able to break through the barrier of electoral suspicion. Mr Kohl's personal performance has been remarkable. He has scarcely put a foot wrong. For a start, he has calmly sat back and waited for the economy to turn the corner out of last year's sharp recession. All the latest indices suggest the economy has come right even faster than the government's optimistic advisers expected. Unemployment appears almost to have peaked at just less than 4m, although it was expected to keep rising for the rest of the year, and gross domestic product could end the year with a growth rate of at least 2.5 per cent, compared with a rosy government forecast of 1.5 per cent last December. Second, he has exploited every possible opportunity to hammer home his obvious electoral advantage as an international statesman over the relatively untravelled Mr Scharping. The great outcry raised by government politicians all summer over the illegal export of plutonium from the former Soviet Union owed a great deal to the desire to remind the German electorate just how unstable their eastern neighbours remain. The subliminal message was clear: in an uncertain and dangerous world, vote for the devil you know. The sudden emergence of European integration as an issue in the campaign is unlikely to do the chancellor any harm, either. Mr Kohl enjoys a substantial reputation as a 'good European', but the one issue which could cost him votes is the prospect of eventually abandoning the D-Mark in favour of a single European currency. By allowing his party to publish a tough position paper, suggesting that future economic and monetary union would be based on a hard core of only five member states of the European Union - Germany and France as well as the Benelux countries - Mr Kohl may well help to reassure some of the doubters. Mr Scharping, a worthy but uninspiring candidate, has failed to set the electorate alight, not to mention his own party. Only last weekend, he was still appealing for his loyal followers 'not to be down-hearted'. It certainly seemed a bit late in the day. Having launched his campaign as the undisputed leader of the party, he has been forced to co-opt his two greatest rivals, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the Saarland premier, and Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Lower Saxony premier, as part of an uneasy 'triumvirate'. Mr Scharping's own performance was clearly seen as lacklustre by his supporters. Perhaps the fatal moment for Mr Scharping was in May, when he launched, with great fanfare, the party's new tax plans, drafted largely by Mr Lafontaine. In them, he proposed to cut taxes for the lowest paid - in particular the surcharge to pay for unification - at the expense of higher income earners. The trouble was, that the threshold for the better income earners of DM60,000 a year meant that a very large number of middle-income earners - classic swing voters - would be caught. It was a gesture of electoral suicide. And yet all is not over, bar the shouting. Mr Kohl is by no means home and dry. The result is still too close to call. For the complex arithmetic of Germany's coalition-building means that Mr Kohl cannot be so sure of gaining the overall majority he needs for his own party and his allies, the CSU and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP). For a start, the FDP is floundering in a state of pre-electoral paralysis, after a string of resounding setbacks in earlier polls. It is an open question if the FDP can win enough votes to give Mr Kohl an outright majority. In the latest poll published by the Allensbach opinion research institute in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung this week, the FDP stood on 8.2 per cent, to give the coalition a combined 48.5 per cent - still short of the magic 50 per cent. The challenge for Mr Kohl is to drag the FDP up with his own revived momentum. Indeed, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the FDP party leader, seems to be begging for votes on just that basis: his message at his election launch rally in Nuremberg was 'vote for us, to re-elect the coalition'. But it is not his allies who may end up giving Mr Kohl the greatest headache. Ironically, the party which could end up holding the real key to the result is the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) - the reformed old East Germany Socialist Unity party (SED), the Communist party. Tomorrow's elections in the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony will give the clearest indication so far about just how the long-suffering east German electorate will vote in five weeks. Battered by soaring unemployment, by the collapse of their traditional industrial economy, and the disappearance of all the old certainties in their grim communist lives, the east Germans are confused, divided and yet resigned. Those who have jobs are satisfied. Those without are bitter. The opinion polls seem often to be wide of the mark. Many may not vote at all. Others will vote with varying degrees of enthusiasm for western parties. And others are clearly turning back to the PDS in protest at the confusion in their lives. So far, the three-party-dominated west German system of Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, and Free Democrats has not taken root in the east. Instead, to the horror and amazement of most westerners, the former communists are picking up a very healthy proportion of the votes  - up to 20 per cent. The PDS, which inherited the SED's organisational structure, including a well-disciplined grass-roots movement, has 130,000 members, of which 90 per cent were SED members. This is still less than a tenth of the former Communist party, but the PDS still boasts the biggest paid-up political membership in east Germany. With between 15 per cent and 20 per cent support, the PDS is the third largest in east Germany after the SPD and CDU. On an all-German basis, however, it still would not gain the 5 per cent minimum needed to gain seats in the Bundestag, the directly-elected lower house of parliament. What the party is far more likely to win is three directly-elected members of the Bundestag, if they can gain an outright majority in the first round of voting: and if the party can do that, it automatically qualifies for representation according to whatever proportion of the national vote it won, even if less than 5 per cent. That is the horror scenario facing both Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping. For if the PDS does not get into the Bundestag in October, it will be possible to form a coalition government of right or left with less than 50 per cent of the vote. If the PDS does win through, it could prevent either side forming a coalition with its natural partners. The end result could be one nobody wants: a so-called Grand Coalition of CDU and SPD, leaving the job of opposition to the minorities and the extremists, including the PDS, the Greens, and the FDP. The result is that, in spite of its virtual non-existence in the west, and its uneven showing in the five eastern states, the PDS has been singled out as the bogey-man in the election campaign, by all the main western parties. One of the reasons for this characterisation is that over the past year, the PDS has managed to erode the support held by the SPD in east Germany. It has also managed to capitalise on its image as the one genuinely 'home-grown' party in the east, in contrast to the imported SPD, FDP and CDU. Given the social conditions in the east, with unemployment in some areas exceeding 50 per cent, the SPD might have been expected to flourish. Mr Scharping has fought a campaign dedicated to social justice, and his controversial tax reforms to aid the low-paid at the expense of the better-off, should also appeal to voters. But the tax proposal has not really helped, at least so far, in either east or west. Mr Kohl's CDU has launched a massive publicity onslaught against the PDS, and sought to tarnish the SPD with the same brush. The CDU suggests that the Social Democrats can only hope to gain power in Bonn with PDS support. According to the latest polls, the SPD plus the Greens, their closest allies, would have 44.4 per cent of the vote. With 4.4 per cent from the PDS, they could be just in front of the ruling coalition. Mr Scharping has flatly rejected any such solution, but the voters do not really believe him. Some 54 per cent are convinced that if it was a question of gaining power, the SPD would accept overt or tacit PDS support. So the onslaught on the former communists is stepped up. And yet the ultimate irony is this: the more the western parties attack the PDS, the more eastern voters appear inclined to back it after all. It is as if east German voters feel an instinctive solidarity for 'one of theirs'. Mr Kohl is therefore treading a very delicate path. All the evidence suggests that he must have done enough to be re-elected, albeit by a narrow margin. But his efforts to ensure that outcome could trip him up at the very final hurdle.</p>

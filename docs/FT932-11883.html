			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Hungarian travel agency tumbles to Ft1.7bn loss IBUSZ, Hungary's largest travel agency and the first east European company to go public, suffered a Ft1.745bn (Dollars 20m) consolidated loss in 1992 after breaking even the year before. The size of the deficit caused the company's shares to slip Ft100 yesterday on the Budapest stock exchange to end the day at Ft800. This compares with the Ft4,900 price at which Ibusz shares were offered in 1990 in the first stock market flotation in a former communist country. The fall has wiped out the bulk of the investment made by the western institutions which own most of the travel agency. Mr Eric Bedo, newly-appointed financial director, blamed the share price collapse on the overly high expectations which had surrounded Ibusz at the time of its flotation in 1990. Ibusz said that its core tourism business suffered from a decline in traffic last year, partly because of the war in former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Abbey National increases MTN programme to Dollars 5bn ABBEY National has increased the size of its global medium-term note (MTN) programme from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 5bn. The increase underlines the bank's preference for this method of raising funds through the steady issuance of privately-placed paper in place of big, public bond issues. Mr Jonathan Nicholls, Abbey National deputy treasurer, said the increase reflected the high legal expenses of changing the documentation. The new upper limit should last Abbey National for two to three years, he added. The MTN programme was set up last May and allows for the issuance of paper in multiple currencies with maturities of more than a year. Dealers to the programme are Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan. More are to be added this week. Abbey National aims to raise floating rate funding at below the London interbank bid rate. This has proved impossible in the public bond markets. The group has not made a public bond issue in the international market since last July. In addition to MTN, it has concentrated on structured private placements with institutional investors. In January, Abbey National placed Dollars 250m of notes issued under the MTN programme with US institutions under Securities and Exchange Commission rule 144a. State Bank of New South Wales is arranging a Dollars 1bn multi-currency global MTN programme to complement its ADollars 3bn domestic note programme. The programme will allow the bank to issue notes in the Euromarket and place paper in the US under rule 144a.</p>

Chalfont, however, retains a 20.4 per cent equity holding. The investors, via a company called Atlantic Shelf 8, have bought 5.34m ordinary shares at 0.75p each and with the co-operation of the company's bankers, have agreed a partial refinancing to nurse Tamaris back to health. Mr Barry McFadzean of Atlantic has been appointed to Tamaris as non-executive chairman, while three directors - Messrs Cameron Brown, Hanafi Fraval and Keith Smith - have resigned.</p>

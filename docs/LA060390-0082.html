			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> INDONESIA ORANGUTANS USE RULES OF THE JUNGLE TO TEST SAVIORS' SKILLS  </P> <P> Urinating on its pursuers from the tree tops, a Sumatran orangutan shows no  sign of wanting to leave its home, a scrap of jungle in the middle of a cocoa  plantation.  </P> <P> The plantation is inexorably expanding, however, and what is left of the furry  red animal's habitat will soon be providing beans for the chocolate lovers of  the world.  </P> <P> The hapless clutch of people wielding chain saw and nets under the tree were  part of a project sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature to save the  threatened apes by moving them to forests safe from cocoa farmers, developers,  loggers and animal traders.  </P> <P> The orangutan rules the jungles of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it has no  natural enemies except r man.  </P> <P> A baby stays with its mother for years, clinging with little hands onto her  long chest fur as she swings from tree to tree. It is helpless without her, and  she protects it fiercely.  </P> <P> In Indonesia it is illegal either to keep baby apes as pets or to trade in the  animal internationally.  </P> <P> A live baby fetches $190 locally, four times that in Jakarta, and up to $5,000  in New York, according to a local forestry official.  </P> <P> It is not hard to capture a baby orangutan. Shoot the mother and you have the  child.  </P> <P> Trapping an adult is a different story, however.  </P> <P> Drive it up a tree, cut off its escape route by felling the surrounding trees,  and then chop down the tree it sits in. The orangutan will scuttle down the  swaying trunk straight into the waiting nets. Easy.  </P> <P> Or so the textbook says.  </P> <P> "I've seen the way orangutans operate in the wild," said Michael Griffiths, the  nature fund's representative in Sumatra's main city, Medan.  </P> <P> "They sit up there staking out the scene from their vantage point and then come  down and make off through an opening no one on the ground even thought of."  </P> <P> Sure enough, annoyed by net handlers yelling instructions and dogs yapping at  the base of the tree, one orangutan slid down the trunk and lumbered off into  the bushes, dogs following.  </P> <P> It paused long enough to turn and give the dogs a withering look, then sped up  another tree.  </P> <P> Eventually two orangutans were caught and taken off the plantation.  </P> <P> "The plantation called us in instead of just going out and shooting the animals  or leaving them to die as they cleared the land. That's a real step forward,"  Griffiths said.  </P> <P> The apes were released in Gunung Leuser National Park, near the nature fund's  north Sumatra Orangutan Rehabilitation Station.  </P> <P> The station also gets young orangutans when they have been seized by the  authorities from captivity or when they outgrow their welcome as pets and are  turned in.  </P> <P> "As pets, they don't know anything (about survival). We have to teach them to  climb, to hunt for food," a field worker named Ketut said.  </P> <P> After a short time in quarantine to rid them of ailments unknown in the jungle,  and basic training in the art of swinging on vines, they are taken to the  forest.  </P> <P> There, on a platform up a tree, fieldworkers feed them a daily diet of milk and  bananas.  </P> <P> "Bananas, bananas, bananas. A very boring diet, and we (intentionally) never  give them quite enough," Ketut said. "That way they get bored and hungry and go  off hunting on their own."  </P> <P> Forays for more interesting food take the animals farther and farther afield.  Some stop coming back to the feeding place of their own accord, some need a  little encouragement.  </P> <P> "We lug them off into the forest, sometimes five days' walk away, where they  can have their own territory," Ketut said.  </P> <P> With its 3,100 square miles of land, Gunung Leuser park gives the apes plenty  of protected territory to choose from. The nature fund estimates there are  about 2,000 orangutans in Sumatra, and another 5,000 in Indonesian and  Malaysian Borneo.  </P> <P> The effort to protect the beasts has gone international. Six orangutans  intercepted in Bangkok on their way to Yugoslavia were returned to Jakarta in  late May.  </P> <P> "We're serious about this," forestry official Ajisasmito said. "If we find any  more Indonesian orangutans abroad, we will extradite them too."  </P></p>

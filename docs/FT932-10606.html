			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks drift ahead of April jobs report Wall Street US STOCKS continued to drift in narrow price ranges as investors traded cautiously ahead of today's important jobs report for April, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.20 at 3,441.90, having spent the day no more than a few points off Wednesday's close. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.26 lower at 443.26, while the Amex composite finished up 1.06 at 426.95, and the Nasdaq composite down 3.22 at 680.04. Trading volume on the NYSE was 152m shares, and rises and declines were running almost neck and neck at 940 to 933, respectively. Trading was fairly subdued throughout the day, with many investors choosing to stay on the sidelines until today's release of the April employment report, which should give the best indication yet of how the labour market has responded to the recent slowdown in economic growth. At other times, yesterday's weekly unemployment claims data might have moved prices, but the fact that the figures came in unchanged for the final working week of April left the markets unmoved. There was no lead for equities from the bond market, which was still trying to digest the implications of Wednesday's announcement of the Treasury's changes to its debt mix, which will involve cutting the number of long bonds issued and increasing sales of shorter-dated securities. Retailers were actively traded and mixed in the wake of April sales figures. Woolworth fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 29 3/8 after reporting a fall in same store sales for last month. Stocks buoyed by solid figures included JC Penney up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 43 3/8 , May Department Stores, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 73 7/8 , and Carter Hawley Hale, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 13 5/8 . Dayton Hudson fell more than Dollars 2 in early trading after the company said that sluggish April sales would mean its first quarter earnings will come in lower than a year ago, but recovered later to end up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 70. Forest product stocks, which have been hit by concerns about the impact on earnings of falling wood prices, ran into further selling. Louisiana-Pacific, fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 61 3/8 , while Weyerhauser dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 . Storage Technology firmed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 34 7/8 in volume of 1.3m shares after analysts at Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers raised their rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy'. On the Nasdaq market, Rochester Savings climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 after the company received a takeover offer. First Empire and KeyCorp are believed to be among the possible suitors. Canada TORONTO STOCK prices closed mixed in extremely heavy trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index rose 5.85 points to close at 3,794.74. The gold group recorded the day's biggest gain , up 1.8 per cent, as the price of gold in New York rose USDollars 2.70 to USDollars 356.95 an ounce.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman, Feb 25 (AFP)--The hardline fundamentalist  group Hamas vowed on Friday [25 February] to attack Israeli  soldiers, settlers and other Jewish targets in revenge for the  massacre of more than 50 Palestinians at a mosque in the  Israeli-occupied West Bank.    The Islamic Resistance Movement put all its militants "on a  maximum state of alert" and called on them "to retaliate as hard  as possible to avenge the slaughter in Hebron."    In a statement to AFP here, Hamas said that "emergency  military plans were put in place to strike at Zionist targets,  occupation soldiers and settlers."    It also declared that the massacre had dealt a "fatal blow"  to the peace process.    Hamas has been at the forefront of attacks on Jews in the  occupied territories since the PLO signed its peace deal with  Israel in Washington in September.</p>

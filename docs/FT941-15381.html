			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Ignorance underpins soaring Malay stocks: Private investors have piled into shares, with unpredictable results Florrie Chong and her brother Sammy run a unisex hairdressing salon in Kuala Lumpur. Florrie and a team of girls cut the hair. Sammy, who is blind, is much sought after for his head massages. None of the idle chit chat of film stars, football matches or sex scandals at Florrie's. All the talk is about the stock market. 'I told Sammy to sell his shares when they reached MDollars 10 (Pounds 2.50) but he won't listen,' says Florrie. He bought at MDollars 2.50 - he thinks they might go still higher.' Stock market fever has gripped Malaysia over much of the last year. In common with most stock markets in Asia, the Kuala Lumpur bourse has been flying high. The Kuala Lumpur index rose 98 per cent in 1993. Market capitalisation nearly trebled to MDollars 600bn. Most spectacularly of all, daily turnover has increased from MDollars 200m 12 months ago to between MDollars 3bn and MDollars 4bn now. Michael Greenall, an investment analyst with Barings Securities in Kuala Lumpur, says: 'What makes this market interesting is that it's not been the fund managers and institutions that have been driving shares up. It's the shopkeepers, housewives, even the civil servants. They are the ones who jam the broking houses. They are the ones who are shouting trading orders down their mobile phones.' In most markets the so-called retail sector accounts for a relatively small amount of share transactions. But in Kuala Lumpur the institutions have been elbowed out by individual buyers, who account for an estimated 70 per cent of share dealings. 'For years people have been parking their money in safe havens overseas,' says the head of a local securities house. 'Now they are bringing it back. That's a good thing. But it's going into highly speculative stocks. Ignorance is mixing with greed. It's a lethal combination.' Greed was certainly evident at a recent car crash outside Kuala Lumpur in which four people were killed. A macabre feature at the site of such accidents is people noting down the numbers of crashed vehicles - for betting in the lottery. But in this accident one of the cars involved had been delivering share scrip. Passers-by were seen bundling the stolen scrip into their cars and driving away. Stock market gurus struggle to find rational explanations for the stock market euphoria. Malaysia's economy continues to perform well - outstandingly in comparison with the sluggish western countries. For the sixth year in succession, Malaysia's gross domestic product increased by more than 8 per cent in 1993. But more cautious market observers say Malaysia's economic fundamentals have not changed much in the last nine months. In fact, with a sharp drop in foreign investment and renewed inflationary pressures, things are not looking quite as rosy as they once were. However, stock market punters give short shrift to fundamentals. Like many countries in Asia, politics and business in Malaysia are closely linked. To most stock market traders, the political connections of a company are far more important than price earnings ratios or balance sheets. While foreign institutions have been investing in blue chips, locals have preferred the smaller, more volatile shares listed on the market's second board, the index of which went up by more than 150 per cent last year. Union Paper Holdings is a small second board company involved in manufacturing toilet paper and joss sticks. In the middle of last year rumours went round that Union Paper was about to be taken over by a co-operative linked to the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), Malaysia's dominant political party. Union Paper's shares went into orbit, rising from MDollars 1.73 to MDollars 23. In the event, there was no Umno takeover. Share dealing scandals involving a number of Kuala Lumpur's prominent business people erupted over the affair. Many shareholders got badly burned as the shares dropped back to earth. The government has been in two minds about the stockmarket fever. At first it was giving share traders an Ivan Boesky style pat on the back. The soaring stockmarket, said the government, was yet one more indication of Malaysia's economic success. But as the stockmarket reached undreamt of heights in the first week of this year it grew concerned. With so many individuals involved in the market, the social and political consequences of a sharp fall in prices could be severe. As a result, Mr Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister, said things had reached a dangerous stage and the time had come for a big correction. 'Almost everybody is getting into the market,' said Mr Daim. 'Everybody is busy on the phone. Nobody seems to be working. Everyone talks about shares. This will affect productivity and low productivity will affect our economy.' Mr Daim is no ordinary politician. He is a close confidant of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. He is treasurer of the Umno party. Most importantly, he is one of Malaysia's richest men who has been behind many of the country's biggest corporate restructurings - and an avid market player. Mr Daim said he had already 'cashed out'. Mr Daim's words had the desired effect. In the following three days the market went down by 14 per cent. Then it seems the government became alarmed that the fall was a little too steep. Mr Daim was again on the front pages of yesterday's papers, saying that the market would bounce back again. Sure enough it did, rising 10 per cent yesterday. Once again, the market was the only topic of conversation down at Florrie Chong's hair salon. And Sammy still hasn't sold his shares.</p>

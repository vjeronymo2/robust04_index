			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAB IS FINED FOR BOTCHING PAP SMEAR TEST RESULTS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: TARZANA FACILITY MUST PAY $558,000. IT ALSO SURRENDERS LICENSE AND  AGREES TO INFORM CLIENTS THEY MAY BE RESCREENED.  </P> <P> A Tarzana medical laboratory that was closed earlier this year for  misinterpreting the results of many pap smear tests has agreed to pay a  $558,000 fine and surrender its license to screen the tests, according to state  health officials.  </P> <P> The settlement of the lawsuit filed by the state of California also requires  Central Pathology Services Medical Group and its sister firm, Central  Diagnostic Laboratory, to offer free rescreenings of all pap smear tests  analyzed since 1984.  </P> <P> The pap smear test is used to detect medical problems in women, including  cervical cancer, which kills an estimated 7,000 women in the United States  every year.  </P> <P> Before it was closed in April under pressure from the state, Central Pathology  screened nearly 700,000 pap smears a year, more than half the number of  screenings in Southern California. Central Pathology ceased operating after a  health inspection found that the lab had misinterpreted 21% of a random  selection of 1,103 pap smears.  </P> <P> The state filed suit in May in Los Angeles Superior Court, asking for $3  million in damages. Named as defendants were Central Pathology and Central  Diagnostic, along with Dr. Allen Levy, a pathologist who owned both firms.  </P> <P> Central Diagnostic used Central Pathology to evaluate pap smear tests, but  since April, Central Diagnostic has been sending smears to other independent  labs. Central Diagnostic was not fined as a result of the settlement.  </P> <P> Another condition of the settlement prohibits the top officials at Central  Pathology from ever owning or operating a laboratory that provides pap smears  tests and other cytology services in California. Those officials include Levy,  Dr. Cyrus Milani, a lab director, and Harry Sagheb, secretary of the board of  directors.  </P> <P> Martin Cooper, a spokesman for Central Pathology, said Levy believed the  charges against him and his firms had been exaggerated, but chose to settle to  put the incident behind him. Cooper said that some of 4,742 rescreenings  uncovered previously undiagnosed problems, but none of the cases were found to  be cancerous.  </P> <P> The settlement was reached Friday, when the department's deputy director and  chief counsel, Diane Shell Campbell, signed the agreement. Copies of the  settlement agreement obtained by The Times indicate that Levy and Sagheb signed  on Nov. 3.  </P> <P> State officials said the crucial part of the settlement is the agreement by  both Central Diagnostic and Central Pathology, whose offices are located in  Tarzana, to notify their clients that rescreenings are available. The officials  said they had been dissatisfied with the effort the firms had made previously  on their own to contact former clients.  </P> <P> Central Pathology will be allowed under the settlement to deduct the cost of  the rescreenings from the fine. But state officials said they do not expect the  entire fine to be used in paying for the medical tests.  </P> <P> A Newport Beach medical firm, MetWest Inc., has agreed to purchase Central  Diagnostics and has applied for licenses to operate with the Department of  Health Services. The application is under review, a spokeswoman for the  department said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 15 Apr (MENA)--A high-ranking Palestinian  source has said that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will sign an agreement on the  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles in Cairo in early May.    The source, who supervised the Palestinian delegation to the  latest round of negotiations, said agreement on many issues has  been reached with the Israelis. These include the size and  deployment of the Palestinian police force, linking the  deployment of the force and the Israeli pullout of Gaza and  Jericho with the release of Palestinian detainees and civil  affairs, the source said.    Geographic jurisdiction and the judiciary system in the  Palestinian autonomous region are now being discussed, the  source added.    The source said 'Arafat will enter Gaza and Jericho in late  June or early July at the latest.    He said there is an agreement within the PLO leadership that  the Political Department, led by Faruq Qaddumi, and the Arab and  International Department, led by Mahmud 'Abbas, remain in Tunis.    Informed Palestinian sources said the readiness expressed by  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday to dismantle some  settlements in the occupied territories as part of efforts to  achieve a permanent peace with the Palestinians constitutes a  serious beginning toward ending over 50 years of enmity.    The sources expressed a belief that the recent operations in  'Afula and Hadera, in which many Israelis were killed, will give  the negotiations more momentum than expected.    Other Palestinian sources said the recent telephone  conversation between Rabin and 'Arafat dealt with some aspects  of the Declaration of Principles, especially the pressing  Palestinian desire to get the negotiations into their final  stage. The sources said that many sides are now making efforts  toward this end. They added that 'Arafat expressed his full  preparedness to enter into this final stage.</p>

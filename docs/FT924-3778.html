			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: Eyebrows raised as Canal Plus bids to join film club SINCE its launch in 1984 Canal Plus, the French pay-TV station, has emerged as one of Europe's most dynamic media groups and one of the most successful players on the French corporate scene. Canal Plus is pursuing a long-term strategy of diversifying to turn itself into a broadly-based entertainment group. It is approaching a critical period when it must prove that those investments have been worthwhile. Mr Andre Rousselet, Canal Plus's septuagenarian chairman, a socialist of the same generation as President Mitterrand, with whom he plays regular games of golf, is sanguine about his company's prospects. From his office at the top of Canal Plus's shiny white, state-of-the-art headquarters on the banks of the River Seine he says: 'We have stuck to businesses that we know and that are compatible with our core interests. Within the next five years we should achieve our goal of making 50 per cent of our profits outside France.' Canal Plus depends on its original pay-TV station for all net profits - FFr1.08bn (Dollars 199m) on revenue of FFr6.99bn last year - and investment in new ventures. The station shows no sign of faltering. It was launched eight years ago at a time when French TV was struggling to throw off the shackles of state control and still trapped in its traditional programming formula of games shows and dated Hollywood movies. Canal Plus offered a different mix of new films and sport. 'All we did was give the French audience what it wanted,' says Mr Rousselet. Canal Plus needed 1m subscribers to break even. It achieved that target in 1986 and has 3.5m subscribers with a reassuringly low churn, or cancellation, rate of just 5 per cent. But the scope for growth is limited. Mr Claude Ravilly, finance director, reckons that its subscriber base should continue to grow by 7.5 per cent a year for the next five years, when it will have reached its optimum 5m homes. It is this prospect that has prompted Canal Plus to diversify. The hitch is that, so far, its new businesses have not proved as successful as the original pay-TV service. Mr Rousselet insists it is too soon to judge the success of Canal Plus's diversification. The new pay-TV channels, he says, are making progress. All are still in the red. But Spain, after a slow start, has 550,000 subscribers and should attract the 600,000 it needs to break even by the end of this year. Belgium is on course for break even in early 1993. Germany, which has 460,000 subscribers against the 1.2m needed for break-even, will be 'more difficult because of the level of competition'. Canal Plus has had a rocky ride in film finance. It has had some successes, such as the Oliver Stone film JFK. But 1992 has been an erratic year and Mr Rousselet is resigned to waiting until 1994 for the real benefits to emerge. 'It will work out. Not everyone gets burnt in the film business.' It is Canal Plus's investment in satellite television that has given analysts most cause for concern. The recent agreement with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to co-operate on technology - which involves constructive consultation, as Mr Rousselet delicately puts it, between the two companies on their expansion plans - should at least allay the risk of a hardware war. However, some analysts suspect Canal Plus could lose up to FFr400m on satellite over the next four years. The satellite losses have prompted Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European media analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, to trim her forecasts for Canal Plus to static profits in 1992 and a slight fall in 1993. She sees Canal Plus as 'fundamentally a very good business, with a question mark over diversification'. Mr Rousselet now faces the challenge of erasing that question mark.</p>

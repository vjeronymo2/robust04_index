Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> AFGHAN TROOPS ABANDON SAMARKHEL  </P> <P> Afghan government forces have abandoned the strategic garrison town of  Samarkhel near the eastern city of Jalalabad, allowing it to fall back into the  hands of U.S.-armed Muslim rebels, Western diplomatic sources said today.  </P> <P> The report could not be independently confirmed.  </P> <P> The diplomatic sources said Afghan government troops were forced to abandon  Samarkhel soon after they captured it on June 7 because it was too vulnerable  to strikes by guerrillas occupying adjacent high ground.  </P> <P> The guerrillas have suffered several recent military setbacks and failed to  take major Afghan government targets despite the February pullout of all Soviet  troops backing the Afghan army.  </P></p>

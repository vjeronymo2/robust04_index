			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Iceland to expand via Littlewoods THE RAPIDLY expanding Iceland Frozen Foods is set to take over the food retailing operations of Littlewoods, after the privately owned stores group's decision to withdraw from the market. The shopworkers' union, Usdaw, has confirmed that it had already held preliminary meetings with management at Littlewoods and that they would meet again tomorrow. Iceland is understood to be the strong favourite to take over the business that turns over Pounds 100m a year from 60 of Littlewoods' 120 stores. There are, however, other groups interested in the business. Iceland already has 600 shops and could be expected to make significant savings on bulk buying and distribution. It has maintained strong earnings growth by rapid expansion of the number of stores. Last year, however, the group enjoyed a further boost when it shifted its emphasis away from simply supplying bulk frozen food towards the sale of convenience foods on the high street. The Littlewoods deal is likely to put Iceland in a stronger position to compete with the likes of Marks and Spencer in the growing market for convenience prepared foods. The deal would give it about 250,000 square feet of extra retail space. It is likely to pay Littlewoods a percentage of sales. Littlewoods has been under pressure from the Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway supermarket chains which have significantly more buying power and larger out of town shops. According to Usdaw, Littlewoods has decided to offer the business to Iceland because of undertakings it has made about staffing levels. 'Littlewoods have been influenced into making the deal by Iceland's indication it would try to keep on as many Littlewoods people as possible. 'We will seek to ensure their current terms and conditions are protected,' the union said.</p>

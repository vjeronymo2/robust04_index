			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH BANS BROCCOLI  </P> <P> All the publicity about President Bush's distaste for broccoli is just so much  "corn" and will only encourage tomato throwing.  </P> <P> If the President will read my lips, he will discover that broccoli is good for  a kinder, gentler nation. It certainly is a better diet than chili or lima  beans. Don't give up, Barbara. The White House may yet become the Green House.  </P> <P> MONROE RUBINGER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

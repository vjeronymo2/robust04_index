			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day chairman quits after board split A BOARDROOM split at Amber Day has led to the departure of Mr Stacey Ellis as chairman only seven months after he joined the discount retailer in an attempt to rebuild its shattered credibility with the City. Mr Ellis, a former director of Inchcape, the blue-chip business services group, has resigned and will be replaced by Mr Peter Carr, an experienced retailer who Mr Ellis recruited as a non-executive director in March. Mr Carr becomes executive chairman of Amber Day and Mr David Thompson, the group's finance director, will become chief executive of the company which owns the Glasgow-based chain of 52 What Everyone Wants stores. Mr Thompson denied any split, but other sources insisted that Mr Ellis's departure comes after a bitter boardroom wrangle in which the chairman was outmanoeuvred by Mr Carr. Mr Carr is being backed by Warburg, Pincus, the US investment institution, which yesterday acquired a 10 per cent stake in Amber Day from HSBC Holdings in an off-market deal. Warburg, Pincus will put a non-executive director on the board and may fund more rapid expansion by the group. Mr Thompson has been acting chief executive of Amber Day since the sudden departure last September of Mr Philip Green, Amber Day's controversial chairman and chief executive. Mr Green stepped down with a Pounds 1.13m golden handshake after a deluge of adverse press coverage was followed by results well below analysts' expectations. Mr Ellis will not be leaving his Pounds 75,000-a-year job empty-handed. He bought 500,000 shares before joining the company, and was awarded 1m options at 28p, which he will now be able to exercise. Amber Day's shares yesterday closed 7p higher at 71p, so he stands to make more than Pounds 600,000 from his shares alone. Mr Ellis had wanted to give the post of chief executive to an external candidate, but other board members favoured Mr Thompson. Reports of a boardroom split appeared in the press last weekend. Mr Ellis said on Sunday that the entire board supported the search for a chief executive from outside the company and that Mr Thompson was not likely to be a suitable candidate. It was that statement which appears to have prompted Mr Ellis's departure. Mr Thompson said last night there had been no boardroom split, just a democratic decision. Amber Day's shares collapsed from a peak of 129p at the end of 1991 to 23p last August after a series of bear raids and newspaper stories about Mr Green's business associates and commercial deals. They recovered steadily after Mr Ellis arrived, peaking at 86p in April, but fell back after Mr Green unloaded his 8 per cent stake for Pounds 7.6m later in the same month. Mr Carr, 52, until recently worked in Spain, where he was chief executive of Galerias Preciados from 1988-91. Before that he spent 11 years with the stores group Debenhams and was promoted to managing director.</p>

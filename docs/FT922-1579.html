			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter (2): Demise of NEDC leaves UK without means for valuable industrial dialogue Sir, I have worked on various projects for NEDO, including 10 years on the Cotton and Allied Textiles Economic Development Committee, eight of them as chairman, and in the last four as chairman of the manufacturer-retailer panels. Those of us who have worked on the sector groups did so because their work was not being done elsewhere. But the government has thrown the baby out with the bathwater in dismantling the think-tank activities of the sector groups. The work of the sector groups and their various working parties has been actively supported by countless busy industrialists, yet this work was not taken into account in the pronouncements of last week. The sector group's job has been to develop strategic thinking and put key pan-sector issues under the microscope, thereby influencing management, employees and the stance of government, domestically and internationally. Yes, this involves exchange of views and communicating findings to individual firms, an activity that can be described as a 'talking shop', a phrase used disparagingly by eminent politicians and the Confederation of British Industry when the NEDO closure was announced. Yet are not all committees 'talking shops' and has anyone, particularly government, found a better way to involve knowledgeable and experienced people in constructive debate? I had hoped that the need to create a more productive industry-government interface would now be acknowledged as it has become clear that the issues of the 1990s and beyond are global by nature and that the nation's competitiveness is a micro-economic problem, requiring detailed understanding, sector by sector, and which cannot be solved by grand ideas alone, by tinkering with taxation, or without government in partnership with industry. Stuart D Hollander, chairman, Dunkeld Group, Elsley House, 24-30, Great Titchfield Street, London W1P 7AD</p>

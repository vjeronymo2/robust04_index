			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (19): Polluters in revolt - Industry queries the cost of environmentalism ENVIRONMENTAL protection in Germany is like motherhood: no one would dare to question it. Environmental issues remained the number one public concern until last year, when it was overtaken by crime and unemployment. Green affairs cut across party lines. Some of the toughest environmentalist laws were adopted in the 1980s under a conservative government. In the September elections in Hamburg, the Green party saw its support double from 7 to 14 per cent. But with the recession biting hard, the private sector has sent clear signals to the government that environmental policies need to be rethought. It argues that high environmental expenditure makes it harder for German companies to compete internationally. The debate is in full swing: the government reiterates the formula that 'the polluter pays'; industry calls on the government to go easy on environmental legislation. 'We need a breathing space to allow companies to implement existing requirements,' explains Mr Manfred Schneider, member of the board at the Bayer chemical group. Other business leaders claim environmental requirements are slowing investments. According to Mr Adolf Huttl, chairman of Kraftwerk Union, Siemens' power subsidiary, investment is being diverted from new power stations. Problems also arise in the public sector. German municipalities, responsible for waste water treatment, are increasingly unable to finance the last stages of clean-up laws adopted in the early 1980s. Assessing the share of total costs represented by environmental expenditures remains difficult. Figures differ according to the speaker. Government officials say environmental expenditure accounts for only 0.7 per cent of total costs. Consulting groups estimate that they lie between 1 and 2 per cent. The OECD, in its report on the environment in Germany, reported that such expenditures could be as high as 3 per cent in the manufacturing sector. But a company such as Bayer, spent 8.5 per cent of its turnover, or DM1.5bn, on environmental protection last year. The German industry federation, the BDI, recently urged the government to implement two changes in its environmental policies to ensure that German enterprises were not put at a disadvantage. First, it wanted a simplification of complicated and bureaucratic environmental procedures. 'We end up with an information deficit which is particularly dangerous for our small and medium-sized enterprises,' says Mr Arnold Willemsen, director for environmental issues at the BDI. Second, it says the government should set targets but let industry decide how they can be met. 'Companies want more market-oriented solutions to the environment. They don't want to just be pushed into a corner,' explains Mr Franz-Joseph Fraundorfer, managing director for the environment at Arthur D. Little in Germany. Government officials have been on the defensive. 'Environmental protection is not a luxury for sunny times. It remains an important goal even under difficult economic conditions' says Mr Wolfgang Schaubel, leader of the ruling Christian Democrats in parliament and a key adviser to chancellor Helmut Kohl. But the government has responded to some of the industry's demands. Earlier this month, the parliament adopted a law which considerably simplifies the procedures needed to conduct research in bio-technology. Previous procedures, which were time-consuming and bureaucratic, had made research companies prefer to open laboratories in other countries, such as in the US, rather than in Germany. The government is also considering allowing more choice over how to comply with a proposed law on recycling of consumer goods. Rather than demand recycling at any cost, the law should allow enterprises to burn refuse if such methods are 'economically more viable'. A lesson has been learned from the law which set high recycling quotas for household waste packaging. The near-bankruptcy of Duales System Deutschlands (DSD), the national collecting and recycling system set up by industry, has provided food for thought. DSD has accumulated more waste packaging than it can recycle partly because industry failed to develop the recycling technology in time to meet the targets set by the law. Such problems caused the government to think twice about how industry should meet environmental targets. It is now considering incineration for household waste disposal - a method long opposed by politicians who viewed it as environmentally unaccceptable. However, changing policies will meet public resistance. For example, local pressure groups are opposed to the construction of waste incinerators in their communities. Government officials point out that the need to match high environmental standards has led the private sector to develop the equipment to do so. The manufacture of environmental products and technologies now provides jobs for 860,000 people in Germany, according to Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister. The industry, which last year had a DM40bn turnover, is expected to grow by between 6 and 8 per cent next year. Environmental technology has also become a valuable export for German companies who hold 21 per cent of the world market in this sector. In 1990, the industry exported 40 per cent of its turnover, as compared with 10 per cent in the US and 6 per cent in Japan. 'Environmental protection is a chance for German industry to show its competitiveness,' says Mr Gerhart Baum, liberal deputy in charge of the parliamentary environmental committee. That still reflects the mood of the government.</p>

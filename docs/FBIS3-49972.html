			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, January 19 (TANJUG) -- Leader of the  opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) Vojislav Seselj said  Wednesday [19 January] he was not optimistic as regards solution  to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that he believed the  war would last for a long time as the Moslems were preparing for  a spring offensive.    Seselj said in a talk with Bulgarian Embassy First Secretary  Marjan Raikov that the Bosnian Serbs could not cede more  territories to the Bosnian Moslems as they have already `made  too many concessions'.    The Moslems were dissatisfied with one-third of the overall  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which was supplied mostly by the  concessions provided by the Bosnian Serbs. Seselj, who is head  of the SRS deputy club in the Federal parliament, also said he  urged as close as possible rapprochement between the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.    Setting out he did not oppose an independent former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.M.), Seselj stated doubt that its  independence was possible because, as he said, of the threats  from the neighboring Albania. The Albanian national minority  accounts for 21 percent of the overall population of over two  million in the F.Y.R.M. the political leaders of the extreme  nationalistic parties of ethnic Albanians urged secession of the  western part of the F.Y.R.M., where this ethnic group had a  marked majority, and joining it to the neighboring Albania.    The issue of F.Y.R.M., according to Seselj, would at any  event have to be resolved between Belgrade-Sofia-Athens, which,  as set out, could be the only guarantors of independence of the  F.Y.R.M.</p>

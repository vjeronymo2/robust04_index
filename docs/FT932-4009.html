			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Working change delayed by BT THE PLAN by British Telecommunications to fit working patterns to customer needs - including more weekend working and daily cover from 6am to 10pm for engineers - faces resistance from the National Communications Union, the main BT union, David Goodhart writes. The NCU's annual conference yesterday voted to back a strike ballot if compulsory weekend working or flexible starting and finishing times are imposed by BT. BT had originally planned to implement its flexible working proposals - the Customer Service Improvement Programme - in October but has agreed to defer it until April.</p>

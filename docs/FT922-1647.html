			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's It looks as though perhaps a sixth of Lloyd's Names will bear three-quarters of the Pounds 2bn of 1989 losses which the insurance market is expected to announce next Wednesday. Those getting off lightly will no doubt sleep easily this weekend - but they should be under no illusion that the burden sharing threat has permanently been headed off. A formal bail-out fund has indeed been abandoned, but given the hugely disproportionate share of the risks many Names will genuinely be unable to pay. Although the Central Fund has already been topped up to Pounds 1bn to deal with such eventualities, a further call on members' pockets one day cannot be ruled out. Individual hardship aside, the important issue is whether Lloyd's will remain a dominant force in the 1990s. As Names defect, there are obviously question marks over the market's medium-term capacity and its ability to retain critical mass. The gloom, however, should not be overdone. The capping of losses will ultimately make Lloyd's more attractive, and corporate capital will doubtless be tapped. Moreover, some sort of correction was not only inevitable but desirable after the overcapacity of the 1980s.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GIAMATTI INHERITS MANY PROBLEMS AS NEW COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> He has served as commander in chief of the National League. He has slapped the  wrist of a man who bumped an umpire. And Saturday, he ascended to a baseball  job whose fringe benefits include free box-seat tickets to any game at any  time.  </P> <P> Yet when you ask A. Bartlett Giamatti to choose the most lasting memory of his  association with baseball as a fan, author and administrator, he chooses none  of these high-profile moments. Instead, he ponders a moment, thumbing the  salt-and-pepper goatee that sets him apart from, say, Sparky Anderson, before  reluctantly reaching back four decades.  </P> <P> "That's hard," Giamatti said. "But I guess it would be my first memory of  Fenway Park, about 1945 or '46."  </P> <P> Giamatti's recall of the game and the circumstances of his attendance were  remarkable. He ticked off a number of unrelated details, including the facts  that his father and uncle had escorted him to the park that afternoon, that he  was 7 or 8 years old at the time, that the Red Sox' starting pitcher had been  Boo Ferris and that he had been unable to close his mouth throughout the  afternoon.  </P> <P> "I remember feeling as if I were gaping," said Giamatti, who grew up a Red Sox  fan in South Hadley, Mass. "I just remember sitting there and feeling, 'I am  overwhelmed by this. This is absolutely extraordinary.' And it was. It was very  much out of the ordinary from what I was accustomed to."  </P> <P> The little boy with the slack jaw still attends games and still admits to  rooting, though more discreetly, for the Red Sox. But, as of Saturday, when he  officially became the seventh commissioner of major league baseball, Giamatti's  ties to the sport are certain to become a good bit closer. And infinitely more  complicated.  </P> <P> As commissioner, he inherits from Peter V. Ueberroth, his predecessor, a  lengthy list of problems, uncertainties and annoyances.  </P> <P> For instance, the investigation of the alleged gambling habits of Cincinnati  Reds manager Pete Rose, which began on Ueberroth's watch, figures to be  completed soon. Depending on the findings, Giamatti could be called on to  perform the unenviable task of hitting Rose with a one-year suspension (if he  wagered on baseball games) or a lifetime ban (for placing bets on games  involving the Reds).  </P> <P> And there are other matters:  </P> <P> Major league baseball's record for hiring minority workers into front office  positions, though improved over the last year, remains dubious. Giamatti will  be held accountable for continued progress on that front.  </P> <P> The pressures on baseball to grant expansion franchises continues to mount.  Giamatti is certain to be called upon either to minimize the political fallout  from further delays or to oversee the addition of two teams.  </P> <P> And looming above all else is the possibility of a players strike that could  knock out a good portion of the 1990 season. With the current labor agreement  between players and owners due to expire in December, that possibility is  considered ominously real by both sides.  </P> <P> Into this mine field walks a man who is a scholar of Renaissance literature,  who served eight years as president of Yale University and who was hired into  his first baseball job just three years ago.  </P> <P> Despite those credentials, which would seem to qualify him to direct the  Library of Congress, but not baseball, Giamatti, who turns 51 Tuesday, was the  resounding choice to take over the reins. When Ueberroth announced he would  step down last fall, the owners so delighted in the opportunity to fill the job  with Giamatti, the National League president, that they did not seriously  consider other candidates.  </P> <P> Some of those baseball executives say that Giamatti fulfills the needs of  baseball for a bright, able man who has cares about the sport and can help to  repair strained relations between players and owners.  </P> <P> "We can't keep having the off-season blood-letting that we've had every single  year on contracts. The threats, charges, allegations. Who does that help?" said  Atlanta Braves president Stan Kasten, who is hopeful that Giamatti can work to  lower the tensions.  </P> <P> "If anybody can do it, Bart will," Kasten said. "He is a sincere person, he  loves the game and he has an appreciation for its players - that's a starting  point."  </P> <P> New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who described himself as "a strong  Giamatti supporter," also praised the commissioner-elect's talents for thinking  through problems and arriving at reasonable solutions.  </P> <P> "Bart is a Renaissance man, a brilliant man," Steinbrenner said. "He has great,  sound reasoning powers. And that is what we need now."  </P> <P> Despite the support of Kasten, Steinbrenner and other baseball executives,  however, it is unclear what role Giamatti can play in the upcoming labor talks.  As Yale president, he publicly lamented the 1981 players strike, which  stretched from June until August, and even authored a piece about it for The  New York Times. However, when his university became embroiled in a strike of  clerical workers in 1984, Giamatti was unable to resolve the dispute quickly or  without ill feeling. Before an agreement could be reached, the Yale workers had  stayed off their jobs 10 weeks.  </P> <P> This time, Giamatti has said repeatedly that he will do his best to convince  the baseball players and owners that they should commit themselves to reaching  a settlement before the strike deadline. However, as commissioner, he is hired  and paid by the owners. Despite the popular beliefs that he can command the  parties to behave, the commissioner has virtually no authority to impose a  labor agreement.  </P> <P> Asked recently what he would do to prevent a players' strike, Giamatti shot  back, "I'm not going to do anything if both sides are intent on having a  strike."  </P> <P> Then, speaking to a group of reporters, he added, "You guys love to promote the  fiction that the commissioner can fix it all up, that the commissioner somehow  has total suasion over everybody ..."  </P> <P> In fact, Giamatti said, he would welcome the opportunity to write an agreement  fair to both the players and owners. "If both sides want to come to me and say,  'Listen, we don't want a strike. We want to present it to you, and you, in your  wisdom, adjudicate' -- wonderful," he said. "Then I'll perform that function  beautifully and superbly, and everyone will be happy."  </P> <P> Until that unlikely request is presented to him, however, Giamatti said he  intends only to continue to talk about the senselessness of picket lines and a  padlocked ballparks.  </P> <P> "My stake is to maintain the integrity of the season," he said. "That's what  the commissioner worries about because (he) ought to be worrying about a season  that is meaningful and coherent, whose statistics make sense."  </P> <P> Labor questions, though they seem to dominate all his public comments of late,  were the furthest thing from Giamatti's mind when he left Yale to become the NL  president in 1986.  </P> <P> That career move, like his appointment to the commissioner's post, was not  planned, Giamatti said. Instead, he was happily ensconced on the Yale campus in  New Haven, Conn., when he received a phone call from Los Angeles Dodgers  president Peter O'Malley, wanting to discuss Giamatti's interest in the league  president's job.  </P> <P> In placing the call, O'Malley has said he simply was following up on a broad  hint dropped by Giamatti several years earlier concerning his interest in a  top-level baseball post. "I remember clearly, reading in the paper, the day he  became president of Yale," O'Malley once recalled. "It's a famous quote picked  up by all the wires and sports pages. He said the only thing he ever dreamed  about being president of was the American League."  </P> <P> His colleagues in academia were stunned by Giamatti's decision to abandon his  university post for a baseball job - one Yale faculty member, in a note to the  college president, asked, "Do you really think that you can be of service to a  nation which desperately needs the best and most experienced minds by serving  as president of the National League?"  </P> <P> Giamatti ignored the advice, accepted the baseball job and had a busy and  highly publicized three-year term.  </P> <P> During his years as National League president, for instance, Giamatti gained a  reputation for dealing severely with batters who were discovered using corked  bats and pitchers found doctoring baseballs. When Philadelphia Phillies pitcher  Kevin Gross was caught with sandpaper in his baseball glove, Giamatti suspended  him for 10 days. The circumstances were repeated during the National League  playoffs last season when an inspection of Dodgers pitcher Jay Howell's glove  turned up a foreign substance. Again, Giamatti suspended the player.  </P> <P> If there was any ambiguity concerning Giamatti's insistence that the rules of  the game be observed, his handling of an incident concerning Rose last season,  laid them to rest. In the most publicized and controversial act of his term as  National League president, Giamatti handed down a 30- day suspension for the  Reds manager after he twice bumped umpire Dave Pallone during a heated argument  last April.  </P> <P> In each case, Giamatti's judgment was questioned by the offending player and by  others who wondered whether a former English professor is best qualified to  preside over affairs of the National League. But Giamatti has remained  unperturbed. Had Ueberroth not decided to eschew a second term, the National  League president said, he would have remained at his job through the end of his  five-year contract, then would have stood by to see "if (the owners) wanted me  to do it anymore."  </P> <P> "In many ways, being National League president is a wonderful job. You are in  touch with the game on the field in a much more realistic and intimate way,"  said Giamatti, who counted daily supervision of umpires and frequent dealings  with players and managers among the job's appealing duties.  </P> <P> As commissioner, however, Giamatti's job description has changed, and perhaps  not all to his liking. He'll attend fewer games and, except in rare cases, no  longer will be fashioning penalties to fit the crimes of baseball players.  </P> <P> "So why would you give up one for the other?" Giamatti asked. "Well, that's not  absolutely clear to me. I suppose because if you really care about baseball and  somebody asked you to be commissioner, you don't ask them to rethink it, lest  they will. Rather, you say, 'OK. Sure.' Because at least you have a capacity to  try to shape things overall."  </P> <P> Now that he formally has been installed as commissioner, Giamatti will continue  to lobby aggressively for a variety of issues he holds dear. Perhaps most  prominent among them are a package of controls, fine-tunes and changes that the  commissioner refers to as "ambiance issues."  </P> <P> Under this heading, Giamatti files all matters that directly affect the viewing  of games at ballparks, either by distracting attention from the game itself or  by creating potentially dangerous situations in the stands.  </P> <P> During his term as National League president, for instance, Giamatti took steps  to try to curb alcohol consumption and the disturbances that inevitably result  when too many fans have too much to drink. At his direction, National League  clubs have developed alcohol policies that include attempting to restrict  excessive drinking in parking lots before games and a training program to  assist ushers and security guards in spotting drunks before they become  nuisances.  </P> <P> Giamatti emphasized that he does not advocate a ban on ballpark beer. "I've  never been interested in having someone think the best way to do this is to  declare prohibition," he said. "The point is to keep people from acting in an  excessive or immoderate manner."  </P> <P> Giamatti also has adopted a "less is more" attitude concerning the operation of  stadium scoreboards, public-address systems and other electronic accoutrements  that has turned many a modern ballpark into an open-air video arcade.  </P> <P> Last year, for instance, Giamatti issued to National League teams what he  refers to as "very stringent" guidelines covering the use and misuse of  electronic wizardry. Among other things, Giamatti's policies established bans  on the playing of loud music when hitters step into the batter's box and on  showing live TV pictures of the game on the stadium scoreboard -- a practice  that strikes Giamatti both as redundant and just plain dumb.  </P> <P> "My view is that you go to the game to watch the game," he said. "You don't go  to the game to watch the scoreboard watch the game."  </P> <P> On this score, Giamatti's influence has been felt even in the American League.  And even in Baltimore.  </P> <P> "He has had some impact on us," said Baltimore Orioles president Larry  Lucchino, referring to Giamatti's calls for electronic and alcoholic restraint.  "We have tried to be more thoughtful about ambiance questions, in part, because  of our own concerns but also because we have been listening to him address  these sorts of issues."  </P> <P> In particular, Lucchino said the Orioles have been more mindful of "turning  down the volume level" of other activities at the ballpark, and of pushing the  feeling that "baseball is the main event."  </P> <P> These are words that Giamatti himself could have spoken. In the next few years,  expect that he will. Often.  </P></p>

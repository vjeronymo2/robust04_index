			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: KIROV SHOWS DANCERS ARE GOOD COMPANY  </P> <P> "Yah vas loo-bloo! " Igor Stupnikov, a professor at Leningrad University, was  teaching Kathryn Thompson Owen how to say "I love you" in Russian (Ya vas  lyublyu).  </P> <P> "Yah vas loo-bloo!" she repeated, giggling. "Yah vas loo-bloo!"  </P> <P> Oh, yes, it was love, not the Waterford chandeliers, that lit up the  Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point on Sunday night.  </P> <P> After performing "The Sleeping Beauty" for a matinee at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, members of the Kirov Ballet had bused it down to the  Ritz for an evening barbecue with Center board members and major donors.  </P> <P> When the troupe filed onto a seaside patio to join guests such as Center board  Chairman Henry Segerstrom, his wife, Renee, and Center President Thomas  Kendrick and his wife, Judy Morr, they were quiet and rather shy. They had,  after all, come upon a party scene that had been happening for a solid hour.  Guests, gussied down in invitation-prescribed California casual wear, arrived  at 6 p.m.; the troupe, at 7.  </P> <P> But before you could say "Tchaikovsky," the dancers began to turn on their love  lights: some sat at the chic cocktail tables and flashed heart-stopping smiles;  some danced -- so gracefully -- with guests to the Ruff Riders bluegrass band  (guest Michael Gilano was in a full state of blush after an oh-so-slow dance  with prima ballerina Tatyana Terekhova). Some, like Stupnikov, actually said,  "Ya vas lyublyu."  </P> <P> And some said it in other ways. "I am glad to see you -- your country, your  California," said Oleg Vinogradov, the Kirov's dashing artistic director and  chief choreographer (who later donned a cowboy hat and crooned "Tom Dooley" in  deliciously broken English). "And glad to see that you are all happy for me,  for my company! Thank you very much."  </P> <P> After a twilight cocktail hour or two, guests settled down to devour what had  to be one of the most divine buffets this side of the repast served up at  Malcolm Forbes' recent tango in Tangier: an array of fresh fruit fanned on  silver trays the size of Boogie boards, barbecued lamb chops (cooked up on  sizzling open grills with coals the size of beach balls), crab tacos with big  leaf cactus (the hands-down fave of hamburger mogul Carl Karcher), salads  drizzled with champagne lime dressing, and desserts that kept guests saying  "Encore! Encore!" -- wickedly yummy chocolate-chip cookies, apple tarts and  sludge-thick fudge and butterscotch sundaes.  </P> <P> "The Kirov represents the quality and stature that the Center has come to  represent," said Center board member and the hostess of the gala, Kathryn  Thompson Owen, officially opening the festivities. (Owen, the newlywed wife of  developer Gus Owen, wowed the crowd in her cropped blue denim jacket. Its  swaying fringe dripped with iridescent bugle beads and crystals.)  </P> <P> Stupnikov told guests that Kirov "was a great politician and friend, killed by  Stalin in 1934."  </P> <P> "The company is 206 years old," he continued. "A little behind with France, but  with the U.S.A., grandmothers and grandfathers in ballet. The Kirov produced  Pavlova, Nijinsky, Balanchine. . . . "  </P> <P> And of the dancers who portrayed "Sleeping Beauty," Stupnikov said: "All of our  dancers are young wine . . . our Auroras very young and beautiful, our princes  still kicking! It is the task of beauty to save the world -- that is what the  Kirov is doing."  </P> <P> Then, choking up, he concluded: "As Dostoevsky said, 'Beauty will save the  world.' "  </P> <P> Faces in the crowd: Gus Owen (asking the Ruff Riders to play "May I Have This  Dance for the Rest of My Life?" for his new bride); Dr. Walter Henry with Maria  Carmen del Calvo; Jill and Joe Thomas (sporting a platinum 1844 Russian coin  around his neck); Jim and Judy Beard (chic in chamois skirt and vest); Maria  Crutcher; Lillian Fluor; Bobbitt Williams; Sandra Clouse; Jeanne and David  Tappan; Maurice and Marcy Mulville; Tom and Marilyn Nielsen; Julia and Irving  Rappaport; John Rau; Diane and Harry Rinker; Sheila Prell Sonenshine with her  daughter, Mandy; Billur Wallerich (fashion director for Saks Fifth Avenue in  Costa Mesa); Joanne Sokolski; Dotti and Glenn Stillwell, and Joyce and Tom  Tucker.  </P></p>

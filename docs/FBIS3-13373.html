			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Mar (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR newspaper calls on  the international community to face up to its political,  humanitarian, and moral responsibility by reaching a decisive  and clear resolution on the brutal crime of the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque perpetrated by Israeli extremism under the sponsorship of  Israeli military and civilian leaders.    In an editorial written by its chief editor today, Monday,  the paper says that the Security Council's failure to pass a  resolution of denunciation during the past two weeks is  repulsive and indicates that the aim is to contain the  revolution of world public opinion against the brutal measures  against the Palestinian people.    The paper calls on the United States to act as a fair judge,  to stop being partial, and adhere to moral and humanitarian  principles in its international dealing if it is serious in  truly playing the role of superpower in today's world.    The paper emphasizes that a clear vision of the flagrant  aggression being suffered by the Palestinians will contribute to  the resumption of the peace process in an atmosphere of trust  until an agreement recovering the legitimate Palestinian Arab  rights is reached. Thus, the paper concludes, the hope for a  fair world order guaranteeing security and stability for all  states and nations can materialize.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> WHALE'S RELEASE NO FISH STORY  </P> <P> Rescuers perched in dinghies worked for three hours to untangle a whale from a  fishing net, then whooped and cheered as the humpback swam free.  </P> <P> The rescuers were nearly capsized Monday when they came within inches of the  38-foot whale's breathing hole.  </P> <P> The whale named Mallard was discovered earlier in the day thrashing in the  Atlantic Ocean, 30 miles from Boston.  </P> <P> "Boy, did these guys have guts," said Capt. Tom Hill of the Yankee Captains,  one of the vessels dispatched to try to save the 5-year-old whale. "All it  would take is one good swipe with a flipper to kill them."  </P> <P> But with patience and daring, the rescuers untangled the net from Mallard's  flippers, mouth and tail. The 25-ton humpback, spouting and breaching, joined a  throng of whales that had remained nearby.  </P> <P> Rescue workers attached buoys to the trailing ends of the net wrapped around  Mallard and waited for the humpback to tire and rest on the surface. The other  whales kept a safe distance, except for one that came up alongside the  entangled mammal and rubbed its head.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: A 'Giselle' of intelligence / Review of Derek Deane's new production for English National Ballet A certain amount of fuss has been generated around Derek Deane's new production of Giselle for English National Ballet. The transfer of the action to the Austrian Tyrol in the 1920s - shock, horror - has been cited as a means of making the ballet more interesting for audiences, and a note in the programme opens with the question: 'How do you make an old ballet come alive or a new audience?' The short answer to that is 'By dancing it well'. But fashions being what they are in opera and classic drama, the idea is common that the old repertory is made more appetising today by giving it a sharp kick in terms of historical period or theme. The sadness is that such galvanic activity usually serves to mask the inability of dancers and companies to discover the qualities of a work by more reputable means. Directoral caprice becomes a substitute for technical probity, stylistic respect, even rational understanding. Hence such fatuities as Mats Eks' relocating of Giselle in a loony-bin, or the continuing open-season for Nutcracker abuse, where any foolery is better than attention to score or choreography. And so we now have Deane's Giselle, given its first performances at the Palace Theatre during ENB's current Manchester season. It has to be said that his innovations are largely cosmetic. This is not a radical re-thinking of a Romantic masterpiece. The text is traditional, the staging intelligent in reminding us of the dramatic tensions in the second act, where the wilis are shown as vengeful spirits rather than the usual horde of po-faced misses trying to look meltingly graceful while hopping across the stage in arabesque. Were it not for the ludicrous outfits of the Courland hunting party, and a few egregious touches in the first act, this Giselle would be run of the mill, and no less welcome for that. Visually, the production is undistinguished. Charles Cusick-Smith provides a skewed and unlovely front-cloth of a Tyrolean resort, which rises to reveal a set for White Horse Inn. Giselle inhabits the obligingly identified 'Stag Lodge' which faces a hostelry where her mama is house-keeper. (Cue bell-boys and maids for the pas de six). Albrecht arrives in a Rolls-Royce, whose luggage-boot will serve as hiding place for sword and cloak. So far, so dubious and, thank heavens, half-hearted. The peasants are peasants still, in timeless balletic peasant gear (the boys have Bisto-Kid caps, which are a mistake). There is little shock for the traditionalist even with the arrival of the Courland hunting party. All Courland hunts look like refugees from the wonderful world of soft furnishings. This gaggle are merely more ludicrous than most, in stupefying hats and maniac suiting (Bathilde wears a frenzy of ocelot and a pair of curtains), with Charlie Drake as the Emperor Franz Joseph in a guest appearance from Mayerling. A winning touch are the skis borne by the servants - so usual at grape-harvest time. The production is knocked hysterically for six, and on Monday night it took the sincerity of Agnes Oaks' mad-scene and the intensity of Thomas Edur's Albecht to remind me that we were watching a tragedy. The second act is, happily, timeless and true. The setting is of a rocky wilderness - rather too contrived in its menace - and the action well-staged, well-danced. Agnes Oaks may not be one of nature's Giselles, and her teak-dyed hair seems an affront to her blonde beauty, but everything that care and intelligence can do make the role credible, and her mad-scene is excellently thought-out. Edur, that aristocrat among danseurs, is a heaven-sent, haunted, elegant Albrecht, his reading in the great tradition, his dancing of purest distinction. Susan Jaffe is a fine and menacing Myrtha, and Deane - who has restored a powerful sense of terror to this act - makes us feel a frisson of Romantic horror amid the circlings of vampiric, vengeful wilis. (When Fanny Elssler first danced Giselle in London 150 years ago, the programme note declared that Albrecht had fallen among 'the wilis' fangs'. Deane admirably evokes this long-lost ferocity). ENB's dancers were in excellent shape on Monday night: the peasant dancers were buoyant; the wilis (Theda Bara to a woman) moved with implacable grace. Let the company persuade the Courland mob into mufti, and ENB will have a sound and useful Giselle. ENB tours Giselle and Swan Lake to Leeds and Liverpool during November.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO WERE THOSE, UH, MASKED LAKERS?;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: RILEY SITS JOHNSON, WORTHY AND THOMPSON, AND L.A. IS BEATEN BY  A CLUB-RECORD 42 POINTS IN PORTLAND.  </P> <P> Doing his part on Earth Day, Laker Coach Pat Riley implemented his own form of  energy conservation by sitting out most of his starters in Sunday night's final  regular-season game against the Portland Trail Blazers.  </P> <P> Riley's preplayoff move, not unprecedented for him, resulted in the worst loss  in the franchise's history. The Lakers were pounded by the Portland Trail  Blazers, 130-88, a 42-point deficit that eclipsed their previous mark for  futility.  </P> <P> In 1966, the Lakers lost by 39 points to the San Francisco Warriors. The  circumstances were different. It was played in November and, presumably, all  the Laker players who were able to play did.  </P> <P> This is not the first time Riley has rested starters heading into the playoffs.  At the end of the 1984-85 season, Riley left Magic Johnson and Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar in Los Angeles when the Lakers traveled to Kansas City to end the  regular season. For that, the Lakers were fined by the NBA because they did not  suit up non-injured players and gave no legitimate reason for leaving them  home.  </P> <P> This time, Riley had Johnson, James Worthy and Mychal Thompson dressed and  taped and ready. But they did not leave the bench. Along with Byron Scott, back  in Los Angeles nursing his sprained left ankle, Riley said he did not want to  risk another injury to a significant player before Friday night's first-round  playoff opener against the Houston Rockets.  </P> <P> "It really was an insignificant game for us," Riley said. "I do want to  apologize to the Portland fans. They paid their money to see us play. But this  game was bigger than that for us. I had a gut feeling that we might get  (injuries) if we played our guys. It's always a war up here."  </P> <P> Although Trail Blazer Coach Rick Adelman said he understood Riley's motives,  team president Harry Glickman told the Portland Oregonian he planned to call  the NBA office to complain about Riley's action.  </P> <P> "If I told you what I think of it, it wouldn't be quotable in a family  newspaper," Glickman said. "Any game in this league you play, even though it's  meaningless, you have an obligation to try to win."  </P> <P> Portland forward Buck Williams said the Lakers might have been avoiding another  confrontation. Portland won the season series, three games to two.  </P> <P> "(Riley) accepts the fact we've arrived," Williams told Portland writers. "He  did not want to gamble psychologically about getting into a war with us and  losing. It's just easier not to show up."  </P> <P> Winning obviously was not the Laker priority Sunday. They had already secured  the franchise's third-best record ever -- 63 victories -- after beating the  Clippers on Saturday night. In the Clipper game, Johnson played 35 minutes;  Worthy 38.  </P> <P> "I made my decision (Saturday) night," Riley said. "We found out last year that  injuries are a big thing. I just didn't want to push it. That is my privilege."  </P> <P> When Riley was asked whether he might be fined for resting three starters, he  said: "I tell you what, I did it (benched starters) for disciplinary reasons.  The reason was that we had the league's best record."  </P> <P> Adelman said he understood Riley's thinking and might have done something  similar had he been in such a situation. He also said he was proud of the Trail  Blazers for playing hard anyway and achieving a franchise record of 59  victories in a season.  </P> <P> "I was surprised (Riley) didn't play all of those guys," Adelman said. "I was  sure he'd cut down the minutes those guys would play. But I don't have a  problem with it, because it's his decision as a coach. We were still trying to  play for something."  </P> <P> Portland fans, however, were not so understanding. They booed the Lakers  throughout the game -- even afterward.  </P> <P> Laker players held out of the lineup were supportive of Riley and happy to be  given the night off.  </P> <P> "I think people who understand basketball and its strategy at this important  time in the season understand why we did it," Worthy said. "Those who are upset  don't understand. They don't see the whole picture. We wanted to stay healthy."  </P> <P> Added Johnson: "We've always done this as a precaution. . . . (Riley) did the  right thing. We have to look ahead to the playoffs. That's the way it goes. We  saw Byron fall (to a sprained ankle a week ago), and we didn't want it to  happen again."  </P> <P> Told that this was the franchise's most lopsided loss ever, Johnson said: "We  can live with that. It's over now until Friday."  </P> <P> With Scott out and three other starters resting, the starting lineup for the  Lakers: Vlade Divac at center, Larry Drew and Jay Vincent at guards, Orlando  Woolridge and A.C. Green at forwards.  </P> <P> Green was the only regular Laker starter to put in his normal time. As  indestructible as plastic, Green has played 321 consecutive regular-season  games, among the NBA active leaders in consecutive games played.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the Lakers were blown out as they have never been blown out  before. They trailed by 25 at halftime, and then it got really ugly.  </P></p>

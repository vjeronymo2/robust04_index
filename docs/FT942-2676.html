			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (32): Group F - Saudi Arabia The first to arrive and the first to leave' - that's the world press's considered opinion of the Saudi Arabian team's prospects in the World Cup. The Saudis arrived in the US a full month before the start of the tournament, but their chances look slim. If they have one strength, it will be the element of surprise. Outside Asia they are an unknown quantity, but in continental competitions they have proved themselves a force. In 1984 and 1988 they won the Asian Championship, but this will be their first appearance in the World Cup finals. They topped a six team round robin tournament in Doha to win their place. The behind-the-scenes story of that tournament illustrated the critical weaknesses in the Saudi set up. Brazilian trainer Jose Candido was sacked midway through the tournament for questioning a telephone order during a match against Iraq to substitute the goalkeeper. The call came from a Prince watching the game on television in Riyadh. The Saudis do not lack for facilities or money and every care has been taken in their preparations. All they lack is a team sufficiently enthusiastic about taking part in the World Cup itself. Huge bonuses were paid to the players on qualification, and Leo Beenhakker, one of Europe's most experienced coaches, was brought in to take them through to the finals. He lasted less than three months, sacked because the players and officials thought he was working the players too hard. - The team's preparations have been shrouded in secrecy. Publicity from the world media, so often the oxygen for teams from the third world, is something they feel they can do without. Instead only brief glimpses have been seen during matches they have played in the build up. Jorge Solari, the man who brought Diego Maradona back into club football this season with Newell's Old Boys in Argentina, has replaced Beenhakker, but results have not been impressive. - They will be led by the 35-year-old Majed Abdullah Mohamed (Al Nasr), known as the Pele of the desert'. His experience may give the side the stability they need. All the Saudi squad play their club football inside the kingdom. Their lack of experience could be the prelude to disappointment for the travelling Saudi fans.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Investment body set for tough rules THE CHANGE of chairman at the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail financial services, reflects the determination of the City's chief regulator, Mr Andrew Large, to prod the industry into accepting tough new rules, industry officials said. On Wednesday, Sir Gordon Downey, PIA chairman for the past nine months, announced his resignation. Mr Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, announced that Mr Downey would be replaced by Mr Joe Palmer, a SIB board member and a former stalwart of the life insurance industry. 'The PIA chairman's role is to sell the organisation,' said the chief executive of one life company. 'And it is difficult to see how Sir Gordon could do that. From the point of view of banks and building societies, which the SIB wants to join the PIA, progress has been too slow.' Mr Large, in a wide-ranging review of City regulation in April, said that the PIA is central to his vision of how a two-tiered supervisory system can genuinely offer better investor protection. Last December, Mr Large set out a tough agenda for the PIA, telling Sir Gordon that he will not allow the new body to come into existence unless it meets much higher standards than those currently prevailing at the two existing self-regulatory organisations for the industry. But Sir Gordon - who, according to board members, has sought to rule by consensus - has moved far too slowly to put Mr Large's agenda into place. 'We have made progress on detail but not on principle,' said one board member. 'Most of the issues on principle remain outstanding.' Yesterday, PIA board members said that Mr Palmer had been going to great lengths to reassure them that in spite of his former role as chairman of Legal and General, the life insurer, and as an ex-chairman of the Association of British Insurers, he represented no industry in particular. In a series of phone calls to board members, Mr Palmer said he was relinquishing all his non-executive directorships connected with the financial services industry, including board membership at the SIB. One board member said Mr Palmer had told him he was not giving these up 'not to be my own man'. Several board members also said that they had had telephone conversations with Mr Large reassuring them that Mr Palmer was independent of life insurance interests. They added that the fact that Mr Large had reached into his own board to find a replacement for Sir Gordon was a sign that he expected him to put the SIB agenda into practice.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Israeli cabinet agrees budget cuts: Reduction in ministerial spending and public sector jobs planned The Israeli cabinet last night approved a Shk128.7bn (Pounds 27.5bn) budget for 1995, the central components of which include about a third of the total for debt repayment, 20 per cent for police and security, and 11 per cent for education. The budget provides for a reduction of almost Shk800m in ministerial spending, a 2 per cent cut in the government workforce - eliminating 630 full-time positions - and an average 1 per cent reduction in public sector pay. There will also be a reduced allocation of funds for the absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union (achieved by revising the estimate of immigrant arrivals for 1995 to 70,000 from a previous 80,000 figure), a 3 per cent rise in the prices of public transport and a 7 per cent increase in water charges to agriculture and industry. Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, intends to use some of the extra monies freed to help pay off debts owed by the kibbutz movement, to provide much-needed assistance to Israel's near-bankrupt Kupat Holim Clalit main health insurance fund, and to boost the ailing military industry. Money is also budgeted to finance the redeployment of Israeli troops in the occupied territories, as anticipated in the coming phases of Israel's autonomy agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The proposal features more than Shk2bn worth of tax cuts, including a reduced purchase tax on homes and lower taxes on electrical items. A proposal to reduce government subsidies granted to companies investing in various designated development zones, strongly opposed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, was not discussed at yesterday's marathon cabinet session. Instead, ministers will reconvene next week for another meeting devoted solely to economic issues. That meeting will focus mainly on means to halt rising prices, which are pushing inflation estimates for 1994 to 14 per cent and beyond. While the budget was the main item of cabinet business yesterday, ministers also discussed the implications of Friday's murders in Ramle, central Israel, of two Jewish workers at a building site. The Hamas Islamic extremist group on Saturday took responsibility for the attack, the first murder of Israeli civilians inside Israel since the Palestinian self-rule accord came into effect in May. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel knew the identities of the murder suspects, and that he expected the co-operation of the Palestinian police force in tracking down the men. Israeli officials said this was regarded as a 'test case,' and that future phases of the peace deal might be put at risk if the Palestinians did not co-operate. The PLO has condemned the murders.</p>

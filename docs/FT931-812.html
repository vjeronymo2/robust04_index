			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonus payouts are cut THE DOWNWARD trend in pay-outs on with-profits policies has continued in the past two weeks. Prudential, the largest life insurer in the UK, has cut both terminal and reversionary bonuses. Assuming policies had been taken out by a 29-year-old man paying monthly premiums of Pounds 30, 10-year endowments would have paid Pounds 6,350 (7 per cent down on last year's Pounds 6,828), and 25-year policies Pounds 58,032 (3.4 per cent down on last year's Pounds 60,075). In addition, the Pru is cutting back on sales of its with-profits, single-premium bond, the Prudence Bond, which also invests in the company's main life fund. Minimum investment has been increased from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 while early-surrender penalties have been added. If you discontinue in the first year there is a penalty of 5 per cent, reducing to 3 per cent in the second and 1 per cent in the third. Legal &amp; General has also cut bonuses across the board. As a result, using the same assumptions, pay-outs fall 7.9 per cent (from Pounds 6,704 to Pounds 6,173) over 10 years, and 2.4 per cent (from Pounds 61,586 to Pounds 60,113) over 25. Over 10 years, this is equivalent to an annual return of 10.4 per cent, while the return was 13 per cent over 25 years. Britannic Assurance also announced reversionary bonus cuts, which brought 10-year pay-outs down by 6.1 per cent since the same time last year (from Pounds 6,796 to Pounds 6,385). But Britannic bucked the trend over 25 years, increasing pay-outs by 3.6 per cent (from Pounds 51,336 to Pounds 53,160) - although this leaves it as one of the lowest-paying companies.</p>

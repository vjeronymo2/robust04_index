			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenyang, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Liaoning Province,  a major heavy industry centre where state-owned firms  predominated, has witnessed a rapid development in its private  economy.    By the end of last year the province had over 740,000  privately owned firms, with a total of 1.303 million employees  -- respectively 17.9 percent and 22.4 percent up over the  previous year.    The figure means that on average there were over 8,000  self-employed people and over 400 private firms emerging each  month in the province last year.    For a long time in the past the private economy had made  slow  progress in Liaoning.    But with rapid social development in recent years, this  northeast China province has given priority to boosting the  private economy.    The average registered capital of each self-employed person  was over 6,300 yuan last year, 30 percent more than in the  previous year.    Increasing numbers of technological and export-oriented  private firms have been founded in the province.    In 1993 Liaoning had more than 2,600 self-employed and  private technological firms, and over 160 foreign-funded firms.    The private businesses have started to carry out joint-stock  and leasing systems. Some have set up co-operation ties with  collective or state enterprises not only locally but also in  other areas of the country.    Last year private businesses recorded a total production  value of 11.8 billion yuan, 83.8 percent up over 1992, and  handed over 1.5 billion yuan in taxes, six percent of the total  tax revenue of the province.    The development of the private economy has boosted local  markets.    It has also helped employ large numbers of surplus rural  labor.    The province has a nearly 20 million rural population, with  average per capita cultivated land of about 0.08 ha, lower than  the average level of the country.    Now household businesses of farm product processing,  fisheries, garment and shoe making, and knitwear have mushroomed  in rural areas of Liaoning.</p>

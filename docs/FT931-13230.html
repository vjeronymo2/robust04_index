			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: Orchestral birthday - London Sinfonietta/Barbican For months already the London Sinfonietta has been celebrating its 25th birthday; but Sunday was the actual anniversary, and the orchestra marked it one day earlier with an elaborate double concert at the Barbican. A rich bill of fare, suitable to the occasion: two premieres (world and local), some hardy Sinfonietta perennials, a staged Stravinsky and a swatch of Broadway songs to remind us that Broadway-on-CD is now, in these straitened times, the Sinfonietta's ace in the hole. Robert Saxton's new Psalm - A Song of Ascents is a trumpet concerto commissioned by the orchestra for John Wallace, who delivered it eloquently. Like other recent Saxton, it has visionary aspirations, and here and there echoes of Jewish intonations. The dissonance-factor is ingratiatingly low. From a striking start with bells, each of its continuous sections accelerates eagerly (though with less than the expected thrust, this time anyway); at last there is a soulful climax, and a small, serene coda. An intricate solo cadenza midway puzzled me - it tickled the ear, without explaining quite what it was meant to be doing: perhaps that will emerge on further hearing. In Oliver Knussen's four delicate, impacted Songs without Words (first heard last year in New York) there were some teasingly dense passages which want further acquaintance too, but there was a palpable sprinkle of magic in each 'song'. A ravishing cello line in the second; an elegantly melancholy one for cor anglais in the fourth, where the other seven players slip in, one by one, to extend it with tender discretion. Edgard Varese's Integrales had opened the first concert with all its scathing truculence intact, players spread out across the wide Barbican stage; and Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony no. 1 - in which the Sinfonietta team is peerless - ended it. (A trick of the acoustics, though, made the horns domineer uncomfortably.) There was a smoochy performance of Ravel's two-hand piano concerto by Paul Crossley; and Felicity Palmer revelled confidently in Berio's evergreen set of Folk Songs: for the next few years, everybody will want her to sing them. L'Histoire du Soldat, the staged Stravinsky, turned out disappointingly flat. Nothing wrong with Elgar Howarth's treatment of the brilliant little score (he conducted the Varese and Ravel too), nor of course with the instrumentalists, and Roger McGough's new words served well enough; Jim Carter's sturdy narrator and John Sessions' nervy soldier did what they could with what they were given to do. Stephen Langridge's production, however, gave them next to nothing. His initial premise, that the role of the devil could be assigned effectively to six young amateur mimes, was already a grave mistake. Far worse, indeed quite ruinous, was the use he made - or rather failed to make  -of the crackling score. Instead of letting it generate all the lively, inventive movement and byplay that Stravinsky and his collaborator Ramuz expected for their show, he let the action stop dead, again and again, while the music proceeded like abstract concert numbers from stage left. Sad, and boring, a complete waste of an enviable opportunity. The nine Broadway numbers in the last half of this second concert made more than fair amends, some old favourites (Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine', the sumptuous original version of Jerome Kern's 'All the Things You Are') and some fine rediscoveries (some more Kern, two strong Kurt Weill songs). The conductor John McGlinn, a specialist in this repertoire, had an excellent quartet of New York show-singers with him to give their professional all: Jeanne Lehmann, Ann Morrison, Hugh Panaro and George Dvorsky. They gave unqualified pleasure, and - in the circumstances - much-needed relief.</p>

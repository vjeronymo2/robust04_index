			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Arts: Death and the Maiden No doubt like many readers, I had seen the reviews but not the play - not until Thursday, by which time two new principals were safely ensconced in Ariel Dorfman's tight, even-handed melodrama. Reading just two or three reviews was enough, one discovered, to have learned almost everything about the action, swift and spare as it is. All that is left is to watch it being played out. 'Melodrama' is not meant insultingly, but it is the right word; the basis of the piece is a volatile, violent confrontation which may or may not end in murder. Several comparable plays have cropped up in recent years, often with a feminist slant: a woman turns the tables savagely on a male oppressor, generally after an attempted rape. Dorfman's version, however, enlists broader resonances in its background - from the black years in Chile (or any such place) when arbitrary arrests, torture and rape were commonplace, and the problem now of how to live with that unredeemed past when the quondam oppressors have slipped into respectable mufti. The tension is well sustained, with the extra tease that Paulina's cornered 'oppressor' may be a case of mistaken identity - but not electrifying. One's withers weren't wrung. Though the new heroine, the excellent Geraldine James, captures her sympathetically overwrought character with precision, she is not a creature with a really dangerous edge. We are quite sure that if that gun ever goes off, it will be just an accident, or a result of momentary panic. Perhaps her predecessor Juliet Stevenson suggested more unpredictable depths; in any case, for Anglo-Saxon prejudices a passionate, pistol-waving Latin American lady would present a naturally wilder threat. Michael Byrne continues as her benign, ambiguous victim. Her temperate husband is now Paul Freeman, whose part in the implicit moral debate, as written, leaves him under-explored (why has he shied off discussing what happened to Paulina, all these years?) and slightly weak-kneed: we have to take his honourable gravitas on trust. At the end, it is doubly frustrating that the crucial facts are never established - since we know perfectly well that there could never have been a truth-of-the-matter, but at most only the playwright's whim.

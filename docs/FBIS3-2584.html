			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong members  attending the Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)  issued here today a statement on Hong Kong Governor Chris  Patten's tabling of the remaining parts of his political reform  bill.    Following is the full text of the statement:    On March 9, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten tabled the  remaining parts of his political reform bill to the Legislative  Council for the first reading. This is yet another deliberate  violation by the British Hong Kong authorities of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region and earlier agreements and  understandings reached between China and Britain, and another  demonstration of the British Hong Kong authorities' policy of  confrontation with China. We hereby issue our solemn statement  as follows:    1. The talks on the arrangement of the 1994-95 election of  Hong Kong between the Governments of China and Britain have  terminated because the British side unilaterally tabled to the  Legislative Council its political reform bill that violates the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and agreements and  understandings reached by the two sides, thereby disrupting the  talks completely. The three-tier legislative structure that the  British Hong Kong authorities set up according to its political  reform bill naturally comes to an end by June 30, 1997. Hong  Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee fully support  relevant declarations and stand of the Chinese Government  pertaining to the establishment of the first government of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its three-tier  legislative structure on July 1, 1997 in accordance with the  Basic Law and relevant resolutions of the National People's  Congress (NPC).    2. We hereby ask the central government to accelerate  preparation work for the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region, speed up work pace and make all necessary preparations  so as to ensure a smooth transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty and  maintain its stability and prosperity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Guatemala Flash" newscast] </F>   [Text] Rodolfo Rosales Garcia Salas, Revolutionary Civic  Alliance leader, termed yesterday's referendum results a  political earthquake. The yes vote won over the no vote by a  minimal margin, which means that the Ramiro de Leon Carpio  government, and especially the politicians, received one of  their worst setbacks because most of the population did not vote.    The controversial politician said the president should  abstain from making decisions to solve the country's crisis  because it is obvious that the Guatemalan people have rejected  the package of constitutional reforms that Congress approved.  These constitutional reforms were also backed by presidential  scheming, which translates as a deep rejection of the  traditional political classes and the maneuvers of President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio.</p>

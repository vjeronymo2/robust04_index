			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] Referring to Syrian President al-Asad's  agreement to accept a condolence-bearing delegation of Israeli  Arabs headed by Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahab Darawshah,  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said on 18 February that it is "too  little, too late." Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's  ambassador to the United States, issued a similar reaction.  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said this is "a positive signal"  from al-Asad.    Syria announced that it will allow the delegation to arrive  in Syria only through a third country, and not directly from  Israel through the Golan Heights, and that it will not stamp the  visitors' passports. Political sources in Jerusalem said  yesterday that the fact that Darawshah was invited to Damascus  should not be overrated. At the same time, they pointed out two  positive aspects: the fact that Syria has agreed to allow the  visit of an Israeli MK, and the fact that al-Asad accepted the  Israeli pressure and approved the visit. [passage omitted]    Ambassador Rabinovich said that the Syrian Government  agreement to receive the delegation headed by MK Darawshah is of  certain importance, but it should be viewed in the right  perspective. "This is one step, but additional and more  significant steps are needed for us to be able to say that Syria  is taking steps to project the feeling that it has indeed  undergone a change of heart with regard to Israel," Rabinovich  told reporters in Washington.    Ambassador Rabinovich added that "it is clear to us that  al-Asad is not al-Sadat, that he will not follow the latter's  example, but there is still a giant gap between what Syria could  do and this step. Inviting Darawshah and receiving the U.S.  delegation of inspection of the MIA's and POW's issue are  beginnings; we expect a continuation." Israeli sources said  that the visit to Damascus by MK Darawshah was raised in the  meeting of the chief Israeli and Syrian delegates to the  bilateral negotiations, and that the issue "was handled in a  practical manner which indicates that the Syrians wish to prove  that the Washington track is alive and active."    In the first week of the current round of the Washington  talks with the Syrian representatives, Israel asked that a  discussion be devoted to the time aspect of the negotiations --  that is, to the relation between the stages of withdrawal from  the Golan Heights and the stages of implementing the full peace.  The Syrian delegate, however, again demanded that the depth of  the Israeli withdrawal be discussed first. [passage omitted]    [A report from Washington by Hayim Shibi on page 4 of Tel  Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 20 February adds: "Senior  sources in the Israeli delegation for talks with Syria disclosed  last weekend that one of the ideas to break the ice in the  negotiations between Israel and Syria is to have President 'Ezer  Weizman invited to Damascus to meet Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad."]</p>

Snimshchikov; UDC 681.51:681.3]    [Abstract] Fundamental characteristics of optical  electronic neural network on a holographic photo-thermoplastic  disk are examined. Based on the method of simultaneous local  hologram recording on a photo-thermoplastic (PTP) disk with  infra-red laser heating, and a method of automatic recording of  two- dimensional Fourier holograms with uniform characteristics  over the entire PTP surface and control of the recording process  by a personal computer, a PTP disk with a holographic recording  was developed. A picture of the PTP disk is shown, and the  optical vector-matrix multiplication process is described.  Information recording density of  2x10[.sup]5[/]bit/mm[.sup]2[/] was experimentally obtained  by this method. It can provide a 1 Gbit capacity of the  holographic PTP disk with a 133 mm diameter. Diffraction  effectiveness, obtained for Fourier hologram digital information  with a diameter of 1 mm, was 5% while signal-to- noise  ratio  was not smaller than 70:1. Prospects of developing an  optical-electronic neural network (OENN) using a holographic  disk (HD) in systems for optical information processing appear  to be the most attractive. The accuracy and speed of signal  processing with the OENN-HD system is analyzed. Comparison  between the best electronic neural computers indicates that the  OENN-HD parameters are not inferior to the parameters of the  multiprocessor computing system ``Connection Machine-2'' Figures  5, tables 1, references 18: 10 Russian, 8 Western</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: It's all in the voice - Radio For all its innate superiority, the senior service lags behind television in the mater of free expression. Take Two Way Cut. This serial about Glaswegian cops and particularly nasty murder (decapitation) would, on television, entail raw nerves, toughness and abrasiveness. On Radio 4 one marvels at the mild-mannered articulateness of it all. Dick Barton, Special Agent was surely more gritty, despite the current would-be verismo use of location recording, surely the most expensive bluff ever foisted by producers on to costing departments. The mania for realistic radio drama - I remember a BBC Bristol director years ago making an actress strip to her underwear in the studio when the script required it - suggests that these producers might be happier in film and to hell with it. Voices matter in radio, not atmospheric mush, boom and twitter, certainly not squeaky bedsprings or creaking floorboards. This fundamental radiophonic grammar is constantly flouted by casting that disregards the basic rule: that character is expressed by the voice and that voices must be distinguishable from one another. The problem recrudesces with the return of Sherlock Holmes to the airwaves. In spite of a bombardment of complaining letters, the BBC persists in offering Clive Merrison and Michael Williams as Holmes and Watson, excellent actors but confusingly similar to the aural palate. Don't radio producers audition with their eyes shut? They should. The old Gielgud-Richardson casting had the right idea, though the ideal partnership was Carleton Hobbs and Norman Shelley in the ever-lamented Children's Hour. Still, children are getting a good deal from Radio 4's new adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, a nicely unforced Anglo-American blend led by Barbara Barnes and numbering in the cast Philip Franks (winning the nation's hearts as Tom Pinch in the junior service's Chuzzlewit). How well, alas, an English accent conveys charming inadequacy. An Australo-American accent suits the mad dogs and insomniacs who spend the small hours with the World Service. Last week Pop on the Line, the biggest phone-in around, presented Kylie Minogue to her admirers and a grateful telecommunications industry. Brutally honest, she doesn't mind telling people her age (26), though a question about scanty clothing in pop videos reduced her to gasps and giggles at the intellectual challenge of it all. The presenter gallantly answered for her, explaining that Kylie was expressing herself, and that was part of her. He added hastily that she doesn't walk down the street scantily clad. She agreed on this point. To a fan in Kenya who asked about filming with Jean-Claude Van Damme she replied mysteriously that he was 'well and truly stacked in the body department' but added ominously that he was delighted that she was 'five foot noth ing' as it made him look tall. A girl in Sweden asked how Kylie entered the music business, a question that occurs to all who hear her sing. She put it down to instinct. 'I felt like pursuing music,' she explained. I hope she catches it. The excellent Scapegoats reached the mentally ill and a chilling catalogue of callousness and crookedness. It traced attitudes to the mad from the divinely punished to victims of society, from Bedlam through big business to beatification via RD Laing. From segregation to integration; and the alarming evidence that public tolerance is again strained. We heard from Edna, committed by her grandfather to Rampton as 'a moral imbecile' for going to the cinema with a young man. She was kept there for 20 years. Now that statistics show that immigrants have a higher rate of 'madness', uneasy questions arise about how we perceive the inconvenient.</p>

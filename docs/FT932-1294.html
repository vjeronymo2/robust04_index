			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Letter: Competitiveness not tied to labour costs Sir, John Major is doing Britain a big disservice in claiming low labour on-costs are the route to competitiveness. Playing the poor relation is totally against our interests. Your report on the analysis on world competitiveness ('Japan still the 'most competitive nation' but US closing', June 24) puts Denmark third, while your report, 'Europe's jobs crisis' (June 21), showed it had one of the highest labour on-costs in the world.

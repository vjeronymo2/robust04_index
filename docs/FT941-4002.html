			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / UN observation teams arrive in Maglaj US gunships were ordered to strike at Bosnian Serbs firing at French troops, but the raid was called off yesterday after Serb guns fell silent and bad weather obscured the target, agencies report from Bosnia. Shortly after the Nato attack order was rescinded, UN officials reported the arrival of UN observation teams to Serb-besieged Maglaj. Under attack by the Serbs since last June, the 19,000 residents of the Moslem enclave in northern Bosnia have suffered great hardship, with all land convoys blocked since last October. The latest development appeared to represent a concession by the Serbs. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur made a surprise visit to French UN peacekeeping units in the Bihac pocket of northern Bosnia yesterday where the French last week lost one of their men to Serb Shooting.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Fresh aid call for smaller companies A RENEWED call for incentives to help smaller companies to invest in manufacturing technology has come from Sir Ronald Halstead, president of the Engineering Industries Association and deputy chairman of British Steel. The plea, coupled with strong criticism of UK banks for their attitude towards smaller companies, echoes the campaign in the machine tool industry for investment incentives to encourage purchases of manufacturing equipment. The campaign, organised by the Machine Tool Technologies Association, has been given new impetus by the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as Trade and Industry Secretary. Sir Ronald, speaking on a visit to Bridgeport Machines, the Leicester-based machine tool builder, said the key to economic recovery and future prosperity lay in the thousands of smaller companies that collectively contribute much of industrial output. He said it was high time that the UK, through the Department of Trade and Industry and leading financial institutions, took a more positive approach towards encouraging the growth and development of smaller companies, as was the practice in most other countries. Smaller companies' needs could often be met through specific measures. His plea comes as the machine tool industry meets today for the start of the Mach '92 exhibition at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre. Yesterday Mr David Shail, managing director of Sandvik Coromant UK, the Swedish-owned supplier of cemented carbide tooling and related systems, said inquiries for investment-related business had increased in the past two months, although they had yet to be converted into orders.

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Robert Lowe back in black in second half TIGHT CONTROL of money, production and sales helped Robert H Lowe, the Cheshire-based maker of leisure and childrens' wear and owner of the Baby-Gro brand, return to profits in the second six months of its year to end-October. It reported a pre-tax profit for ongoing activities of Pounds 100,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 500,000. Full year pre-tax losses fell from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 297,000. The reported comparable loss was Pounds 453,000 The figures continue a gradually improving trend and Mr Tony Cant, chief executive, sees 1992 as a year of further consolidation 'against a difficult trading background'. Of the year under review he added: 'We cut working capital, reduced stock losses and production overruns.' Falling interest rates helped cut the interest charge to Pounds 1.53m (Pounds 1.86m). The company also reduced its level of debt in October with a Pounds 3.4m rights issue and gearing has fallen from 167 per cent a year ago to between 90 and 100 per cent now. 'This is still too high and we are aiming for 50 per cent in another year,' said Mr Cant. He added that the ultimate aim was zero gearing. Trading profit for ongoing activities doubled from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.23m Turnover for the year edged higher to Pounds 34m (Pounds 33.6m). After a tax charge of Pounds 191,000 (credit Pounds 151,000) losses per share came out at 11.19p (9.11p). The company is proposing passing its final dividend for the second year in succession. There was no interim dividend. At the time of the rights issue, the company said it did not foresee any dividend being paid for 1992. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 500,000, compared with Pounds 700,000 income, reflecting the 'final' costs of withdrawing from some business sectors, largely in the Irish market.</p>

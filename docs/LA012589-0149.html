			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> $1 BILLION BID FOR U-HAUL PARENT FIRM  </P> <P> Dissidents within Amerco Inc., the holding company which operates the U-Haul  rental network, have negotiated the proposed sale of the company to an  unidentified buyer for about $1 billion, the founder has confirmed.  </P> <P> Leonard S. Shoen, 71, who organized U-Haul in 1945 in a Seattle suburb and  moved the headquarters here in 1968, declined to identify the buyer and said he  was speaking up because he feels that current management has undervalued stock  in soliciting for more shares.  </P> <P> Amerco is a Nevada-chartered company based in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Amerco Chairman E. J. (Joe) Shoen, the third of Leonard Shoen's 12 children,  could not be reached for comment, but Amerco's general counsel, Gary V.  Klinefelter, said today that the board of directors has not been told of any  purchase offer.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> AST Research says its first personal computer targeted at the home and  small-business market -- the recently introduced Bravo/286 -- is getting strong  reviews from computer dealers.  </P> <P> "The Bravo is doing very well," said Dan Sheppard, AST's senior manager of  systems marketing. AST announced the new computer in early February.  </P> <P> Demand for the Bravo, which carries a starting price of about $1,100, is  currently exceeding AST's forecasts, Sheppard said. AST has had to boost  production by 15% at the company plant in Taiwan, where the Bravo is  manufactured.  </P> <P> "We are scrambling right now to produce enough machines to keep the dealers  stocked," Sheppard said.  </P> <P> AST has shipped 3,000 of the machines and has orders for another 10,000,  Sheppard said.  </P></p>

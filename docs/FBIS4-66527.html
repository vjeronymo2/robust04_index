			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dangerous to Maintenance of Peace"] </F>   [Text] India has strongly objected to the U.S. offer to  provide F-16 planes to Pakistan. Mr. Krishnan Srinivasan, Indian  foreign secretary, has made it clear to U.S. Deputy Secretary of  State Robin Raphel that provision of these planes to Pakistan  will increase tension in this region and endanger security here.  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has already said the same thing to  the U.S. senators visiting India recently. History proves that  whenever the United States provided large-scale weapon aid to  Pakistan, these were used against India. Whenever Pakistan  received weapons in large quantity by becoming member of the  SEATO and CENTO military pacts, it started its conspiracy to  take over Kashmir. At that time, the United States had assured  us that Pakistan will not use those weapons against India.  Pakistan did not pay heed to it and attacked India using Sabre  jets and Patten tanks. It is not possible that the U.S.  politicians are not aware of this fact. Robin Raphel should not  have any problem in proving this through her government  documents. Now that the United States is suspending Pressler  amendment for one year and providing F-16 planes to Pakistan, we  cannot deny the creation of a very dangerous situation.    Robin Raphel told India's foreign secretary that the United  States wants to initiate the process to resolve the problems  between the two countries and welcomes the talks held between he  two countries last January. So far so good, however, the United  States is thinking about suspending the Pressler amendment for a  short period. This will disrupt the power balance not only  between India and Pakistan but in the whole of South Asia. While  the United States is talking about maintaining peace in this  region, its actions will only create military rivalry and  conflict here. It appears that the U.S. government is trying  everything to keep both India and Pakistan happy. It tried to  remove the tension created by a statement issued earlier by  sending the deputy secretary here and, at the same time,  loosened the Pressler amendment to satisfy Pakistan. It is not  difficult to see how this political ploy of Clinton  administration is giving a conflicting message. Republican  Senator Larry Pressler has expressed serious concern over this  decision of the Clinton administration. He also met President  Clinton to question him about the proposal to give exemption  under this law.    There is no doubt that if the Pressler amendment is  suspended, Pakistan will get 71 F-16 planes, three submarines  for its navy, and the destructive planes P-3 Orion. This will  naturally increase Pakistan's military might. Not only its air  force but also it navy will become significantly stronger. The  step the United States is taking by suspending Pressler  amendment for one year in order to comply with the older arms  deal with Pakistan will greatly increase Pakistan's military  power, which in turn will directly endanger India's security. As  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has said, this will trigger a new  weapons race and India will have to rethink its defense policy.  The United States is also the world's largest arms dealer. The  Clinton administration is forced to consider suspending the  Pressler amendment for a short time under pressure from the  company that manufactures F-16 planes. In this context, he has  to write a letter assuring that Pakistan does not have an atomic  bomb. How will this be done? That is an interesting subject. The  reason is that for the last several years there have been talks  about Pakistan having nuclear bombs. This news was published in  prominent American newspapers. The Pakistani prime minister has  admitted that her country is not without a nuclear program. That  is why the Pressler amendment was imposed on Pakistan. This law  can be suspended only by sacrificing a declared policy and  principles for trade profits and selfish reasons.</p>

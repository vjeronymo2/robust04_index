			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Offer in pipeline for Brandon Hire Brandon Hire yesterday announced an acquisition that could lead to a mandatory offer being made for the USM-traded tool, catering and furniture hirer. The purchase, for 3.75m new ordinary shares, is that of JSL Fasteners, formed last year by Mr John Laycock who founded a similar business in 1975 which he sold to Brown &amp; Tawse in 1989 for Pounds 10m. At the same time Mr Laycock has agreed to acquire 2.25m Brandon Hire shares  -some 21.7 per cent of the equity - at 55p from Mr Colin Stone, Brandon's joint managing director, finance director and co-founder, who will resign with compensation for loss of office. On completion of the transactions, which are subject to approval at an extraordinary meeting convened for May 18, Mr Laycock will own or control 6m ordinary shares, representing 42.5 per cent of the enlarged capital. Under Stock Exchange rules he will then have to make a mandatory offer for the outstanding balance at the highest price he has paid over the past 12 months - namely 55p. Mr Laycock, who will be appointed chief executive, is also being offered warrants which, if exercised, would raise his interest to 52.04 per cent. JSL Fasteners, which started trading last September, operates from four depots. In its first six months of trading it achieved turnover of Pounds 730,000 and incurred anticipated pre-tax losses of Pounds 140,000. It was pointed out that over the period monthly sales had risen from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 160,000 and were currently running at a level which would produce an annualised turnover of about Pounds 2m. Brandon Hire shares closed 7p higher at 60p.</p>

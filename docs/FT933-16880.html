			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Power systems is GEC's star performer - Chinese show 'incredible' interest in fossil-fired turbine generators POWER SYSTEMS, GEC Alsthom's operations in power generating equipment and transport systems, was the star performer among GEC's principal businesses with an order book up 24 per cent at Pounds 6.1bn. Profits rose from Pounds 157m to Pounds 174m, on sales of Pounds 3.1bn compared with Pounds 2.8bn. China, Taiwan and Germany were among the countries ordering fossil-fired turbine generators. Lord Weinstock said there had been 'incredible' interest from China which had yet to translate into orders. Orders were won for combined cycle gas turbine power stations in Europe and Asia including a 2,500MW power plant for Hong Kong and a 1,700MW station in the Netherlands. Lord Weinstock said that GEC Alsthom's order book for rolling stock was now full for the next three years. Main contracts include 27 trains sets for the planned Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam network, and 139 night service coaches for the Channel tunnel. The company managed to achieve negative net assets of Pounds 81m on its power systems business because of pre-payments received for large capital projects. Apparently low margins achieved on such contracts were misleading, Lord Weinstock said, because of the interest which could be secured on the pre-payments. However, both revenues and profits fell in telecommunications as orders for System X equipment from BT fell off rapidly. Sales of Pounds 1bn and operating profits of Pounds 106m were achieved, GEC said: 'in trading conditions characterised by falling volumes and prices.' The price GEC is able to charge BT for an individual line has fallen to less than a quarter of its value in the late 1980s because of the growth of miniaturisation and integrated circuits. A BT order valued at Pounds 579m, principally software for advanced applications, is the key to GEC's prediction of modest growth in sales and profits for the coming year. First half sales and profits, however, will be well down on on 1992-93. Operating net assets were reduced by Pounds 120m as greater efficiencies are sought. Lord Weinstock warned that some parts of the company were beginning to invest in developments which would not reach the market. A review would be conducted soon to identify and cancel these developments: 'It is not a big issue but 10 of these projects can end up costing you Pounds 100m a year' he said. Electronic systems, comprising principally the defence businesses, showed an increase in sales despite declining defence expenditure in the US and UK. Exports grew 38 per cent to Pounds 862m and the order book advanced 9 per cent to a record Pounds 4.9bn. Operating profits came to Pounds 264m after reorganisation costs and development expenditure on programmes for the Eurofighter 2000, equipment for the Merlin helicopter, the US F22 fighter and an in-flight entertainment system for United Airlines. Other parts of the business which performed well included office equipment and printing, achieved principally through the re-equipping and restructuring of AB Dick, the US-based office equipment supplier, and strong growth at Videojet, a world leader in continuous ink jet printing.  ------------------------------------------------------------     1993 OPERATING PROFITS AND TURNOVER BY ACTIVITY  ------------------------------------------------------------                                  Operating        Turnover                                profit Pounds m    Pounds m  ------------------------------------------------------------ Electronic systems                 264             2,698 Power systems                      174             3,135 Telecoms                           106             1,012 Consumer goods                      16               253 Electronic metrology                19               413 Office equipment &amp; printing         32               314 Medical equipment                   39               568 Other*                              45             1,039 Intra-activity sales                                (134) Total                              695             9,298  ------------------------------------------------------------ *Includes Electronic components, Industrial apparatus and  Distribution &amp; trading.

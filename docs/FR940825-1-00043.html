			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed under section VII.E.3 of this preamble, HUD has reconsidered its interpretation of 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(ii) and (d)(4)(B)(ii). The 1994 proposed rule provides that an otherwise eligible applicant must be admitted to a housing assistance program, if such assistance is available, during the reasonable opportunity to submit immigration documents, pending the INS primary or secondary verification of immigration status, or pending the conclusions of the INS appeal process. Again, however, as discussed earlier in this preamble, the statute does not provide identical protection to an applicant during the informal hearing process. Although assistance may not be denied pending the conclusion of the informal hearing process, assistance to an applicant may be delayed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to tenants, the 1994 proposed rule provides assistance may not be terminated during the reasonable opportunity to submit immigration documents, pending the INS primary or secondary verification, or pending the conclusion of the INS appeal process, or pending the conclusion of the informal hearing process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Proration of Assistance Permitted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters disagreed with HUD's analysis in the preamble to the 1988 proposed rule (53 FR 41046&hyph;47) that IRCA's prohibitions against delaying, denying, reducing or terminating assistance pending verification also preclude the proration of assistance (i.e., permitting a family with ineligible family members to continue to receive assistance, based only on the eligible members). The commenters insisted that this language was intended solely to protect individuals against the loss of benefits during INS verification of immigration status, and should not be used by HUD to prohibit the proration of assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier in this preamble, HUD has revised its position on the issue of proration of assistance. HUD agrees with the commenters that the statutory language is insufficient to support the prohibition of proration of assistance. The 1994 proposed rule provides for proration of assistance for applicants and tenants. Again, HUD specifically requests comment on the issue of proration of assistance, on the formulas for prorating assistance as set forth in the proposed rule, and welcomes suggestions and recommendations on how these formulas could be improved or made simpler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Changing Units or Housing Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked HUD to revise the provision in the 1988 proposed rule that would require a responsible entity to verify a tenant's immigration status as a condition of transferring from one unit to another, or from one housing assistance program to another. The commenter stated that there may be instances in which the tenant family has to transfer through no fault of its own during the term of the lease, and HAs should have the discretion to continue assistance under such circumstances for a minimum of one year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD agrees that a tenant who transfers from one unit to another within the same housing project should not be required to verify eligible immigration status since that tenant would be merely seeking to continue an existing subsidy, and the 1994 proposed rule adopts this change. In the case of public housing, even a transfer from one project to another would be continuation of the existing subsidy and therefore not involve an ``admission,'' which would require verification of eligible immigration status, unless the move was from the jurisdiction of one HA to another HA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to transfers from one subsidy program to another or from one housing project to another, immigration status is verified when HUD regulations require that the tenant be treated like any other applicant attempting to receive a new form of housing assistance. HUD's position is not dependent upon whether the change is voluntary or involuntary, but rather if the change renders the tenant a new applicant under HUD's regulations. For example, if a family moved from one section 236 project to another, the move would be considered a new admission, because each project is separately owned and operated and the family would be required to satisfy admission criteria of the management of the project to which it was moving. Therefore, the family would be asked to submit information about citizenship or eligible immigration status along with income eligibility information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Hearings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Administrative Burden <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter claimed that the hearing requirements contained in the 1988 proposed rule would place a tremendous administrative burden upon HAs, and would result in overloading its existing hearing officers with potentially ``hundreds of ineligible alien determinations.'' The commenter maintained that this would delay proceedings against truly undesirable residents, such as those involved in drug transactions. Another commenter suggested that HAs should respond to the increased administrative burden by delaying the ineligibility determination hearings until more serious cases are heard, or by developing some other priority system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD believes that these commenters have overestimated the number of hearings that will be requested by persons as a result of ineligibility determinations under this rule. As noted earlier in this preamble, HUD believes that the majority of applicants and tenants will be citizens and assert citizenship. Additionally, HUD expects that it is unlikely that a noncitizen who has been confirmed by the INS verification system and appeals process to be ineligible for assistance will go to the trouble of requesting a hearing to contest the final INS decision. Consequently, HUD expects the administrative burden imposed upon HAs and project owners as a result of providing these hearings to be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Expansion of Procedural Protections in Hearing Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter questioned the legal sufficiency of the 1988 proposed rule's informal hearings on the denial and termination of assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Syria tries to rekindle talks SYRIA said yesterday it would convene a meeting of Arab parties to the Middle East peace process to discuss the resumption of negotiations, but warned that a quick restart was unlikely without a solution to the Palestinian deportees crisis. Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said in Brussels that the delegations to the stalled talks would be invited to Damascus 'within the coming days or weeks' to discuss the invitation by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, to reconvene bilateral talks with Israel in April. Mr al-Shara said it would be 'wrong to think' that any Arab parties would agree to resume negotiations until a 'satisfactory solution' had been found to the impasse over 396 Palestinians who remain in south Lebanon after their deportation by Israel in December. 'We in Syria insist on the return of all the deportees,' he said. The Syrian minister's remarks followed talks yesterday with several European foreign ministers and Mr Christopher, who said Mr al-Shara had assured him that Syria would back US attempts quickly to reconvene the peace talks. Neither Syria nor any other Arab party has accepted the invitation to return to the table by April, the date raised by Mr Christopher following his week-long tour of Middle Eastern capitals. Mr Christopher, in Brussels to attend a meeting of Nato ministers, said he remained optimistic that talks could restart soon. 'I'm encouraged by developments since yesterday when the announcement was made,' he said. However, Mr Haider Abdel-Shafi, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, added another note of caution from Jerusalem, saying that Mr Christopher's decision to issue invitations for an April resumption were 'premature' in the absence of a settlement to the deportees issue. His comments were echoed by spokesmen from the Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters in Tunis. Nevertheless, senior Palestinian officials in Cairo said that a US proposal to resolve the stalemate remained alive and offered hope for an acceptable solution.</p>

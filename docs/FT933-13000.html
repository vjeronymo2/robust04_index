			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Warner-Lambert improves 6% WARNER-LAMBERT, the large US drugs group, reported a 6 per cent improvement in second-quarter earnings to Dollars 189.9m, or Dollars 1.40 a share, on sales which rose 6 per cent to Dollars 1.45bn. A year earlier, the company earned Dollars 177.8m, or Dollars 1.32, on sales of Dollars 1.37bn. A 29 per cent advance in consumer sector sales outside the US offset a 2 per cent decline in the US and a 6 per cent drop in worldwide pharmaceutical sales to Dollars 532m from Dollars 566m. US pharmaceutical sales were hit by the loss of some Dollars 34m in sales related to manufacturing and regulatory compliance issues in Puerto Rico. Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman and chief executive, said the company was close to reaching a settlement with the Food and Drug Administration over its manufacturing plants, mainly in Puerto Rico. Earlier this month, the company said the planned settlement, in the form of a consent decree, would reduce earnings. 'At this point, its financial impact appears to be manageable,' said Mr Goodes. 'However, coupled with the delay in Cognex (a treatment for Alzheimer's disease) approval, it will undercut our ability to generate double-digit earnings growth for the year.' For the first half, Warner-Lambert posted net income of Dollars 372m, or Dollars 2.75 on sales of Dollars 2.78bn, against Dollars 341.5m, or Dollars 2.54, on sales of Dollars 2.68bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has sent a letter to UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali about the [word indistinct]  situation in Gorazde. The letter reads:    The news I have received from Gorazde says that the town is  in agony. For 20 days Karadzic's Serbs and units of the  Yugoslav army have been attacking the town -- besieged for 10  months -- with unabated intensity. The strange game, in which  the obvious things are not seen, loud voices are not heard, and  mechanisms have become impotent, has also been going on for 20  days. The so-called protected zone has become the most unsafe  area in the world.    The organization which you head proclaimed the free  territory  of Gorazde a UN-protected area almost a year ago. Security  Council resolutions 824 and 836 refer to this protected zone,  but they have remained only empty phrases. Neither you nor your  personnel have done anything, or hardly anything, to use the  mandate of all those resolutions in order to protect the people  of Gorazde and the credibility of the United Nations. The  result is obviously tragic.    Mr. Secretary General, my people hold you responsible for  this situation. This [words indistinct] is bleeding, and there  is not much room for diplomatic hesitation. If Gorazde falls, I  think that the feeling of moral responsibility would command you  to leave the post of UN secretary general. This is the least  you can do for this (?suffering) people whose two years of  suffering the world has watched with so much indifference.</p>

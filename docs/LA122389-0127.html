			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOTTEST SPOT IN CONTINENTAL U.S. IS SAN JUAN AT 82  </P> <P> The National Weather Service reported Friday that the warmest spot in the  continental United States was San Juan Capistrano, with a comfortable 82  degrees. The low, meanwhile, was 47 degrees below zero at Hardin, Mont.  </P> <P> Upon hearing the news, San Juan Capistrano City Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze  gloated: "It's just a typical day in San Juan Capistrano. It's one of the best  places in the world to live. The lovely weather. The beautiful green hills."  </P> <P> Schwartze said he also thought that the day's high and low were "ironic"  because a San Juan Capistrano city planner had left a few days ago to visit  relatives in Montana. "She'll appreciate California a lot more when she gets  back here," he said.  </P> <P> Normally sun-drenched Florida cities, all the way to Miami, braced for snow  flurries and sleet this weekend.  </P> <P> Most of the nation owes its cold weather to a high-pressure system 300 miles  west of Los Angeles that was protecting Southern California from threatening  storms, according to WeatherData Inc.  </P></p>

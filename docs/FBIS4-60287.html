			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, al-Maa [May] 14, (JANA) -- After the  bitter suffering, hardship, the death of some of them and loss  of many camels, the Libyan Arab pilgrims, heading for Mecca to  perform their religious duty, crossed on camels the Jordanian  territory to Saudi Arabia after they arrived in Jordan from  Egypt on a crossing ferry through the Red Sea. This was due to  the occupation of the area of Umm al-Rashrash by the Zionist  enemy separating it from the Arab world and blocking the land  road to Mecca.    The Libyan Arab pilgrims arrived on camels in the area of  Halat 'Ammar in Saudi Arabia where they were welcomed by members  of the brotherhood bureau to Saudi Arabia and the Saudi  authorities in the area.    The pilgrims chanted slogans reaffirming their determination  to continue their journey to Mecca.    Also the pilgrims chanted slogans in support of the great  al-  Fateh revolution and its leader reasserting their defiance of  the unjust measures imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah by Western  countries preventing the Libyan Arab citizens from performing  their religious duty.</p>

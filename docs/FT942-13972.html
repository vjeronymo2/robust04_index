			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Output of cars for export up 4.8% Car production for export rose by nearly 5 per cent in March, reversing six months of decline and providing another sign that continental Europe's worst new-vehicle sales slump since the second world war is over. Statistics issued jointly yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office also showed both car and commercial-vehicle production in this year's first quarter to be higher than a year ago. The trend was described by the SMMT as 'encouraging', particularly for the commercial-vehicle industry. The UK truck and van market's recovery from recession has been slower and weaker than that for cars. It was badly affected by last year's slump on the Continent, in which commercial-vehicle sales were almost halved compared with 1992. The statistics showed car output in March of 147,656, a 2.32 per cent rise on the previous March. Export output at 57,607 was up 4.76 per cent compared with the previous March. Last month's rises lifted total first-quarter car output to 362,536, only 0.54 per cent below the previous quarter. Yet the March increase was not enough to prevent first-quarter output for export, at 138,547, remaining 10.32 per cent below the previous quarter.</p>

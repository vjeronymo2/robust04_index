			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinians today demonstrated near the settlement  of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. Sami Abu-Samahdanah and a Fatah  Hawks group, including the Abu-Sittah brothers who are suspected  of having murdered settler Uri Megidish at the time, today  blocked off the Netzarim junction and did not allow settlers'  vehicles to cross through. Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar  reports that Abu-Samahdanah organized the demonstration in  protest against fire which he claimed was directed at him from  Netzarim last night. He asked for the Palestinian police's  intervention and filed a complaint with the Israeli-Palestinian  liaison office. The demonstrators reopened the junction only  after a senior Palestinian police officer promised he would take  action to safeguard Palestinians moving near Jewish settlements.  The Netzarim settlers and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  spokesman deny that shots were fired from Netzarim yesterday.</p>

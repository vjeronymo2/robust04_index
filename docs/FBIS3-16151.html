			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Falichev: "Continuation of the Military </F> Reforms Is a Priority State Task"]    [Text] As is known, any reform, no matter where it is  carried out, is a pretty complex process, and painful as well.  Our ailing economy is graphic confirmation of this. But how  are the reforms progressing in the armed forces? What problems  are cropping up? Finally, what is the country's top leadership's  assessment of them?    The president recently delivered a message to parliament "On  Strengthening the Russian State." A whole section of it is  devoted to an analysis and assessment of the reforms in the  Army, to what the Armed Forces are to be like in the immediate  future. What is the situation?    The reforms in the Army and Navy are going according to  plan:  in line with the blueprint for the organizational development of  the Armed Forces devised by the Defense Ministry, the Law "On  Defense," and the defense minister's order. Since 7 May 1992 --  following the president's edict on the creation of the Russian  Army -- 11 basic laws regulating the activities of the Armed  Forces in the Russian Federation security system and more than  100 normative legal acts have been devised and adopted.  Parliament has ratified 14 international treaties and  agreements in the military policy sphere.    As is known, the organizational development of the Armed  Forces has been mapped out in three stages. The first ended in  1992. Its tasks have been resolved. The decline in the level  of combat readiness has been halted. Approaches to the creation  of groupings of forces and general-purpose forces have been  revised. The formation of new groupings has been started in  connection with the changes in state borders -- which applies  primarily to the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts.    Not everything has gone as smoothly as one would have liked,  perhaps. At one stage it was necessary to adjust certain  provisions of the blueprint for the organizational evolution of  the Army, in particular those connected with the prospects for  its development. The General Staff conducted a careful analysis  and adjustment of the Armed Forces personnel in 1994-1995. Not  surprisingly, since the reform began the authorized strength has  been cut by nearly half a million men (457,000). Three military  district directorates, eight Army directorates, one Army corps  directorate, 19 divisional directorates, and eight military  schools have been disbanded. The process of reducing the number  of formations and combined units and higher educational  establishments, scientific research institutions, and redundant  and parallel management organs continues. The tasks the Army  was set for this period were implemented by and large, Colonel  General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy chief of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces General Staff, believes. The reforms in  the Armed Forces have gone according to plan.    What now? What can one expect in military policy in the  immediate future? Before answering these questions let us  stress that the president categorized the further reform of the  Armed Forces as a priority state task.    "The content of the message gives some confidence that the  correct reform path has been chosen," Lieutenant General G.  Ivanov, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry  Military Organizational Development and Reforms Directorate,  believes. "The message lays down the main guidelines for the  organizational development of the Armed Forces and provides an  assessment of the actual state of the forces: They are  battleworthy. We saw this assessment as a confirmation of the  correctness of the chosen course of army development and  improvement."    The basic structure of the Armed Forces is clearly going to  be preserved until 1996. But if we are talking about future  reforms, then the entire complexion of the Armed Forces is  probably going to be fundamentally transformed. Which will also  affect the operational and strategic levels. Depending on the  country's economic potential, of course.    What new contours are discernible right now in the  structural  makeup of the Armed Forces? Let us examine just some of the  components.    Strategic Armed Forces. An analysis of the status of the  Russian Armed Forces showed that in present-day conditions the  Strategic Nuclear Forces have been and remain the real guarantor  of Russia's security in the military sphere. This was confirmed  in the president's message. It is enshrined in the military  doctrine and in the blueprint for the organizational development  of the Army and Navy.    General-Purpose Forces. The nature of Russia's geopolitical  position and the reduction of the numerical strength of the  Armed Forces demonstrate that it is impossible to have a  grouping of forces along the entire length of the border, as was  the case before. So their organizational development is based  on the principle of mobile defense. Its implementation  presupposes the availability of small but sufficiently powerful  forces, ready for operational employment wherever a real threat  to Russia's security occurs. Mobile forces are being created  that are operationally maneuverable and capable of tackling  tasks in various regions.    Military-Technical Policy. The priorities here include  maintaining nuclear security; equipping mobile forces; providing  the Army and Navy with modern means of battle command and  control, communications, intelligence, and electronic warfare;  and improving their reliability and survivability.    The Military Law Base. The entire legal foundation of the  organizational development and activity of the Armed Forces has  to be brought in line with the Constitution and basic provisions  of the Russian Federation's military doctrine. Proposals have  been prepared on adjusting existing laws in the defense sphere,  and around 20 new draft laws will need adopting. In particular,  "On Martial Law," "On the Military Police," and "On Naval  Vessels." The plan is to give military lawyers the job of  providing legal protection for Armed Forces servicemen and  civilian personnel. To that end the possibility of creating a  body of military lawyers, which we have never had before, is  being considered. In other words law, above all, must replace  ideology in the Armed Forces. The plan is to complete the  elaboration of a blueprint for military law reform by mid-1994.    As for the military budget, it has not yet been approved for  1994, unfortunately. Although the Defense Ministry has made all  the necessary calculations and they have been submitted to the  Russian Federation Finance Ministry and Economy Ministry. The  fact is that until very recently the country did not even have a  general budget. So financing will be on a month-to-month basis.    "Certainly we are not getting everything we need by any  means," Major General V. Burov, chief of the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry Main Military Budget and Financing Directorate  Economic Directorate, said. "In January we only managed to  provide pay and allowances and wages and tackle urgent tasks.  The situation was the same in February. It is clearly not  going to be any better in March...."    Nonetheless, the president's message does give some cause  for  optimism. When he delivered it he made it plain that military  expenditure is not expenditure on war. This money is used to  finance a substantial section of our science, to construct  housing for "homeless officers," and to maintain our children  serving in the Armed Forces.    Today the Armed Forces embark on the second stage of their  reform, which will be completed in 1995. I believe that its  tasks will be resolved, despite the complex economic situation  in the country. The guarantor of this is the state itself, in  which the Army remains a very important factor not only of  external security but also of the stability of our society.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / War breaks out at opera Olympics: The first battle in Barcelona is between tenors THERE will probably be more of this as Spain's 1992 festivities get under way, but it has fallen to the country's clutch of famous opera stars to deliver the first childish spat of the year. The Canary Island-born tenor Alfredo Kraus has been threatening to take revenge against his Catalan rival, Jose Carreras, for being left out of the gathering of opera singers who will open the 1992 summer Olympic Games in Barcelona in July. Mr Carreras is the artistic director of the event and has apparently declined to invite Mr Kraus to join himself, Madrid-born tenor Placido Domingo and Barcelonan soprano Montserrat Caballe to sing a medley of popular arias to the opening ceremony. Mr Kraus claims this is because he criticised Mr Carreras, Mr Domingo and the Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti for singing at the World Cup soccer championship in Italy in 1990. He intimated at the time that the appearance of the stars debased opera. Mr Carreras, proclaiming great personal affection and respect for Mr Kraus, has said he left him off the invitation because Mr Kraus had 'repeatedly argued against the presence of opera at multitudinous events'. Mr Kraus, never a man to mince words, replied: 'Jose Carreras has done nothing more than perform a hostile act against (me) which amounts to a declaration of war.' Mr Kraus has been able to take an early dig at the Olympic performance by pointing out that it will be recorded and videoed and will merely be mimed at the inauguration. 'Play-back has always seemed like fraud to me,' he told the Spanish press. 'I would obviously ignore Jose Carreras if I am ever asked to mount anything similar.' This unartistic exchange speaks volumes for the cosseted world in which Spain, with vast amounts of public money spent on opera, wraps up and promotes its operatic treasures. To the general public, who seldom get a chance to see opera before city, regional and national politicians snap up shovelfuls of free tickets, the affair must seem almost surreal. Ms Caballe has already made her own important contribution to the demystification of local operatic seriousness. While she was sitting with local dignitaries at a theatrical performance in Extremadura not long ago, the floor beneath her gave way, miraculously leaving her uninjured. Footage of the fall was nevertheless played around the country. Then, earlier this year, she refused to sing at Barcelona's fabulous Liceo opera house until the building's director apologised for suggesting she was not a very good singer. But he has stuck to his guns and, having listened to Ms Caballe's latest record (an adaptation of modern commercial songs), is unlikely to change his mind. Mr Domingo, himself not above cashing in on popular collections, has so far proved far too smart to get involved in the Olympic debate. He tends to distance himself from the politics of opera in Spain and has, anyway, begun to mutter recently that he finds orchestral direction more interesting than singing. The other smart man in the spat is Spain's minister for culture, Mr Jordi Sole Tura. Asked what he thought could be done to repair the damage to operatic harmony, he declined to comment. 'Its all far too sensitive,' he said.</p>

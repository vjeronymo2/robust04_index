			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Italy approves takeover rules LONG-awaited rules for takeover bids of stock market quoted companies have been approved by Italy's politicians, just hours before the dissolution of parliament. The new ruling, designed to protect the rights of minority shareholders, brings Italy into line with market practice in other big industrialsed countries. It should put an end to the Italian practice of exchanging crucial stakes in listed companies at premium prices without offering the same terms to small investors. The new law was welcomed on the Milan bourse. Brokers said it should bolster the image of Italy's capital markets and attract more private investors to the stock market. Mr Attilio Ventura, head of the stockbrokers' committee which runs the Milan bourse, said the law represented 'a decisive step for the market'. Under the rules, the sale of a controlling stake in a company will have to be followed by a full bid by the buyer. Stricter reporting requirements also apply to deals involving large packets of shares falling below the legal ceiling for launching a full bid. A purchaser of 25 per cent of a company's equity would now be obliged to mount a full takeover should it seek to buy any more than a further 2 per cent in the following 12 months. Once a takeover has been launched, a bidder may raise the offer price only once, and by at least 5 per cent. The new law also allows contested bids, with the counter-bidder being required to make an offer at least 5 per cent superior to that of the original bidder, which may in turn improve its offer.</p>

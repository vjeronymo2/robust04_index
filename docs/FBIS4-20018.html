			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Eighty paracommandos are landing at Melsbroek  military airport outside Brussels this morning. They left from  Nairobi in Kenya last night, following the evacuation operation  of Belgians and other Westerners from Rwanda nearly three weeks  ago. Several hundreds of Belgian troops are still stationed at  the military camp at the Nairobi airport. The Defense Ministry  in Brussels says they will all be repatriated. Earlier it was  expected that the troops would stay in Nairobi to intervene if  necessary in Burundi, south of Rwanda where ethnic violence has  claimed thousands of lives in the past few months.

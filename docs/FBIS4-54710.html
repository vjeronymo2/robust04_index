			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F> Ramon Lobo in Sarajevo; date not given: "Silajdzic: `UN Hates  Bosnia'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Silajdzic suggests in this  interview with EL PAIS, given in the prime minister's residence  in Sarajevo, that as things stand it would be better for the  United Nations to withdraw from Bosnia.    [Lobo] What have you learned from the last three or four  weeks, from the events of Gorazde and the actions of the  international community in this crisis?    [Silajdzic] The United Nations has developed a very negative  role. It has not used the mandate it was given and did not  accept NATO's offer to bomb Serbian positions when their  artillery continued to kill civilians after the ultimatum was  issued. It appears that someone very high up (politically -- EL  PAIS editor's note) has tried to save these fascists from being  punished. In Gorazde alone, and nobody knows why, they killed  719 people. Their aim was to force the inhabitants out and to  conquer the territory. This has been going on for the last two  years. There are still people who call this a civil war which,  translated into political language means "I do not want to get  involved." Everyone knows that this is not a civil war but  aggression, and that the tanks, artillery, and soldiers come  from Serbia. Everyone knows that, and yet nobody wants to call  it genocide. Do you know why? Because if they did, they would  have to intervene. Everything is just an excuse, and when NATO  and the United States take the initiative and the alliance is  ready to put a stop to this hell, the United Nations then says  no.    [Lobo] When you say that someone very high up is playing  dirty, to which country or to whom are you alluding?    [Silajdzic] If I had wanted to say who, I would have said so  before now. Clearly, there are people very high up who have  allowed this to continue for two years and at the same time they  have kept our hands tied (by the embargo -- EL PAIS editor's  note). They have prevented us from defending ourselves and they  have let the Serbs do anything. This is not a war, it is  genocide. Now, the United Nations comes here and tells us:  Look, there are two parties involved and we do not want to take  sides. What is happening here is not just a violation of the  basic UN Charter, it is a violation of every principle. If the  United Nations will not respect its own charter and its own  resolutions, why doesn't it just get out?    [Lobo] Are you asking the United Nations to leave Bosnian  soil?    [Silajdzic] I believe that, since Gorazde, there should be a  major change in the UN leadership. Srebrenica was a year ago.  Now the same thing has just happened to Gorazde. They allowed  this (the Serbian offensive -- EL PAIS editor's note) to last  almost four weeks, and despite this being a safe area. Why  didn't the United Nations defend this protected area? Who is  supposed to protect it? And all the while, these people are  sitting in the UN building in New York raking in huge salaries!    [Lobo] Some people think that the Bosnian Government has  been  dreaming too much of the possibility of foreign military  intervention and that, after the events of Gorazde, you have  realized that this intervention will never come.    [Silajdzic] I'm sorry? So all this has been a way of getting  this message across to us? Perhaps. If this were the case, we  would be faced with mass murder planned by the international  community itself. However, I do not think this is the case. I  think that the United Nations and some people high up in the  organization hate Bosnia. This has been most apparent over the  last two years. They have been against any action.    [Lobo] What do you think of UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Yasushi Akashi?    [Silajdzic] I think they have held up NATO action. I can  name 20 towns that have been destroyed before Butrus-Ghali's  very eyes. When the alliance wanted to act against this  murderous machine (the Serbian Army -- EL PAIS editor's note),  they stopped them. Why? I don't know, but it is a violation of  the resolutions passed by the UN Security Council. These now  are nothing more than pieces of paper. Who is responsible for  implementing these resolutions? The answer is very simple: the  secretary general. What is he doing?!    [Lobo] What do you think of the role played by the United  States in this crisis?    [Silajdzic] At the end of the day, it has been the United  States that has done everything. Right from the air drops of  humanitarian aid... We would have preferred everything to have  been done much more quickly. For some things, it is now too  late, yes, but in the final analysis it was the Americans who  forced the others into the Gorazde ultimatum. Maybe it is very  little coming very slowly.    [Lobo] What about the European Union's stance?    [Silajdzic] It has been more positive in recent months.  Before, the Community was a witness to a tragedy. For a long  time, it is true, they sent us supplies, but they have to answer  the question of why they imposed the arms embargo on us and left  so many people to die. That is a moral responsibility.    [Lobo] Are you ready to sign a cease-fire agreement?    [Silajdzic] Yes, for three or four months, while  negotiations  are under way. However, they want to keep the situation as it  stands and want the United Nations to award them the territory  they have conquered. That will not happen, however. Bosnia  Herzegovina will remain a single country. I have nothing  against Serbia's size, as long as it remains within its own  borders and does not grow at the expense of Bosnia.    [Lobo] One last question... What do you think of the role  played by the Spanish soldiers in Mostar?    [Silajdzic] I did not like it. There were problems. There  are many signs that they took the side of the Croatian  extremists. We are not very pleased with them. I intend to  talk with the Spanish Government on this subject.</p>

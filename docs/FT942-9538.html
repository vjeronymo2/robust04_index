			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Books: Fantasy, fame and fulfilment - Fiction ADAM'S WISH by Paul Micou Bantam Pounds 14.99, 251 pages PIPPA PASSES by Rumer Godden Macmillan Pounds 12.99, 172 pages Paul Micou's new novel opens with a cosy, John Majorish image of Britain: the white cliffs of Dover fading into sea mist from a cross-Channel ferry. But Adam's Wish is about the new Europe rather than the old, visualising England, France, Italy, even the former Yugoslavia, as the playground of a new aristocracy of money and fame with its attendant media circus. Micou's hero, Adam Gosse, is a slightly stuffy Anglo-Belgian solicitor who strays into this fast-living set more or less by accident when he is best man at a friend's wedding. He is seated next to Natalie, a beautiful young woman who is famous only for being famous. Hello] magazine is never mentioned, but it is clearly the presiding deity of Natalie's milieu. Because Adam is feeling left out and depressed as all his friends pair off, he agrees to Natalie's surprising request that he chauffeur her to Paris where she is about to embark upon a film career. By acceding to this whim, and with as few achievements as Natalie to justify it, Adam achieves overnight fame as the fiance of a starlet. These are lives governed by chance, and by the hysterical interpretations of insignificant events offered by tabloid newspapers. The novel is put together like a movie, with one lavish set rapidly giving way to another: Adam moves from a pretentious French chateau to a film director's minimalist apartment in Paris to a small Italian town which has been reconstructed to resemble Dubrovnik. It is only when the director announces that he intends to move everyone to a genuine war zone in Croatia that reality intrudes and Adam decides it is time to go home. Micou's novel is an ambitious satire on the ease of achieving and corrupting effect of fame. Apart from Adam (whose surname, Gosse, means 'kid' in French, suggesting both innocence and vunerability), the characters are introduced only by their first names, a device which neatly emphasises their disposability. Yet Micou rarely descends into mere caricature; his writing is assured and often very funny. The novel is about authenticity and the importance of maintaining some vestige of identity as all barriers come down. Its moral centre is a reluctant self awareness on Adam's part which never permits him to become a full participant in Natalie's frenetic world; his curse is to recognise desires in himself which he despises in others. The characters in Pippa Passes have no such problems. Their names are of the rich and titled variety, so that the Marchese dell'Orlando is able to boast of his English wife that 'Marcia's lineage is longer than mine'. Rumer Godden's new novel takes its title from Browning and is firmly set in the old Europe in which Italy still represents a gateway to sensuality for the repressed and parochial English. Godden has written for both children and adults in her long writing career and this piece of fiction is, according to her publisher, aimed at 'everyone young in spirit'. This is actually a nervous way of signalling that Pippa Passes is a hybrid, a piece of adolescent wish-fulfillment with a crudely handled lesbian rape scene thrown in. The spirit hovering over this mawkish tale of a young English girl's meteoric rise from the corps de ballet is not so much that of Hello] as Noel Streatfield, creating a sort of Ballet Shoes with sex. There could hardly be a greater contrast with Paul Micou's jaded, polyglot pan-Europeans and it is a relief to recognise in Pippa Fane a ghost from the past, receding into the mist as fast and as surely as Dover's white cliffs.</p>

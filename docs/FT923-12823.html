			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: RJR signs to make cigarettes in Russia RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the large RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group, is to begin manufacturing cigarettes in Russia. The US group announced it had reached a partnership agreement with AS-Petro, a Russian cigarette manufacturer. It claims that this is the first major investment by a foreign company in a private cigarette enterprise in Russia. RJR said that it would make a 'substantial investment' in new equipment for the factory, but disclosed no figures. It said that after the new machinery was installed, RJR-Petro's annual production capacity would rise to 22bn cigarettes, to make it Russia's largest cigarette producer. American-blend brands 'will be phased in as component sourcing is resolved', RJR said.</p>

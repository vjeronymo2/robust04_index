			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'HARD COPY' -- BY ANY OTHER NAME IT'S STILL 'TABLOID'  </P> <P> They're fooling around with the universe.  </P> <P>  -- Alf  </P> <P> Dueling tabloids.  </P> <P> Now available in your home are the true stories about the rumors about the  innuendoes about the insinuations about the gossip about the hearsay, all of it  based on highly reliable scuttlebutt from anonymous sources. The plush star of  NBC's "Alf" was right Monday night in his assessment of tabloids. They are  fooling around with the universe.  </P> <P> And after years of fooling around mostly in print, they're now doing it on  television.  </P> <P> You've got your "Inside Edition," "Inside Report" and the "Inside Story"  segment of "Entertainment Tonight." You've got your "America's Most Wanted,"  "Unsolved Mysteries" and the new "Crimewatch Tonight" and "Missing/Reward."  You've got your "A Current Affair" and "The Reporters."  </P> <P> And now you've also got your "Hard Copy," a new syndicated series on KNBC  Channel 4 that follows "Entertainment Tonight" and on Wednesdays leads into  NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries."  </P> <P> The schlock bloc.  </P> <P> Paramount's "Hard Copy" was originally titled "Tabloid," but that name was  dropped -- apparently because it was too accurate. Judge for yourself.  </P> <P> On Monday, "Hard Copy" aired the first part of its "exclusive" investigation  into the sabotaging of Pan Am Flight 103, the jet that exploded over Lockerbie,  Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all aboard. Although relying on anonymous  sources, it was a convincing story that named the alleged bombers and presented  what it said was evidence that "Iran ordered the bombing. . . ."  </P> <P> On the surface, a tough, honest piece of reporting.  </P> <P> Like all tabloids, however, "Hard Copy" suffers from guilt by association --  with itself. It's difficult buying the show's Pan Am expose when only last week  it premiered with a slimy piece on the demise of Christina Onassis, using  creepy music and gossip to imply that something was amiss ("A curtain of  silence dropped over the death").  </P> <P> If only a curtain of silence would sometimes drop over "Hard Copy," which was  at its pathetic worst last week in exposing the Hollywood stars who "blow their  tops." As evidence of the incestuousness of rumor-mongering, the source for the  "Hard Copy" gossip was a gossip columnist for that scandal sheet, the Star. As  evidence of malicious intent, "Hard Copy" reported that Clint Eastwood is  adored by everyone who works with him, then went on to lump him with the  alleged stormy stars anyway because he reportedly gets mad at people who take  his parking spot when he's working on a film. The tyrant!  </P> <P> Anchored by Terry Murphy and Alan Frio, "Hard Copy" can be nice, as it was in  its tribute to Gilda Radner. But it's obviously more comfortable being snide,  as it was in twitting Maury Povich, anchor of older rival "A Current Affair,"  for supposedly getting snowed on the "Biker Mom" story on which "Hard Copy"  claimed to have gotten the real scoop. This was a payback for the equally snide  Povich reporting on charges of "entrapment" against "Hard Copy" concerning its  expose of minors being allowed inside Atlantic City casinos.  </P> <P>  Nyeh nyeh nyeh-nyeh nyeh.  </P> <P> "A Current Affair" (weekdays at 7:30 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11) and "Hard Copy"  -- which simulated a sensational murder Monday -- both engage in re-creations.  But "Missing/Reward" -- which advertises rewards that the public can cash in on  by supplying information -- really went over the edge in its premiere  (Saturdays at 4:30 p.m. on Channel 4, Mondays at 10:30 p.m. on Channel 3). Its  segment on an allegedly innocent man convicted of murder supported the man's  story with a simulation of "one possible explanation" of what really happened.  Is this the future -- simulations of possibilities?  </P> <P> Tabloid programs are so outrageous that they're nearly impossible to parody,  because they almost seem to parody themselves.  </P> <P> Rather than trying to outdo the real thing, however, "This Is David Lander"  takes another route in spoofing America's tabloid TV. The results -- the series  from England's Channel Four is running at 7:30 p.m Saturdays on cable's Bravo  channel -- are quietly brilliant, and as stone-faced and underplayed as the  tabloids themselves are overcooked.  </P> <P> The setting is a muckraking tabloid show that, among other things, investigates  a housing development that is falling apart. The show is careful to shield its  sources, and in one sequence shows the real person on camera, but protects his  identity by substituting an actor's voice.  </P> <P> Better yet, why not an actor lip-syncing the real person's voice?  </P> <P> No level of conduct seems beyond the tabloids. If they have a common  denominator beyond hyperbole, however, it's crime.  </P> <P> Perhaps the consistently straightest of the tabloids -- but also the most  paranoid -- is the new "Crimewatch Tonight" (weekdays at midnight on KCOP  Channel 13). "Crimewatch Tonight" has an image of credibility in host Ike  Pappas. He spent 25 years with CBS News, covering, among other things, the  Vietnam War, Che Guevara and the Six-Day War in Israel, none of which has  anything to do with the "daily battle with the criminals that infect our world"  covered by "Crimewatch Tonight." But a job's a job.  </P> <P> The crimes on "Crimewatch Tonight" almost seem to merge into a single  frightening blur, with each segment distinguishable from others only by the  level of fear it incites. A Monday segment showed police surveillance tape of  U.S. drug dealers attacking cops. "Crimewatch Tonight" used this to warn  viewers that Colombia's drug anarchy "could happen here," too. That was a huge  stretch.  </P> <P> The overreached conclusion -- unsupported by the facts -- is a favorite of  tabloids. Hence, "Hard Copy" concluded after its story on the Beverly Hills  murder of entertainment industry figure Jose Menendez and his wife, Rose Marie:  "The show business community is on edge." Yes, all of it, from Malibu to  Hollywood.  </P> <P> The best of the tabloids may be "Inside Edition" (weekdays at 8:30 p.m. on  KHJ-TV Channel 9), whose shortcomings are outnumbered by its strengths. The  latter include Monday's sober, well-constructed story on a former female cop  who is in prison for a murder she claims she didn't commit.  </P> <P> The sewer of tabloids is surely "A Current Affair"-clone "Inside Report"  (weekdays at 5:30 p.m. on Channel 13), which hit a low Monday in speculating on  the possible fate awaiting Zsa Zsa Gabor in Los Angeles County Jail, depending  on the outcome of her trial. The piece spoke directly to Gabor, interviewing  "some of the girls you'll be bunking with."  </P> <P> As disgusting as it was, however, it somehow paralleled the mocking tone of the  coverage that the Gabor trial has been getting by some stations. The main  culprit has been usually straight KCBS-TV Channel 2, which seems incapable of  playing the Gabor story without snickering, even though this is a criminal  proceeding carrying a possible prison sentence. Is the purpose of a newscast to  cover a story just to laugh it?  </P> <P> Perhaps this -- the further seepage of tabloid values into generally legitimate  newscasts -- is the ultimate danger for television and for viewers who rely on  the medium for most of their information.  </P> <P> Only recently, NBC hired David Nuell, executive producer of "Entertainment  Tonight," as senior executive producer of its venerable "Today" show, whose  ratings have been slipping.  </P> <P> Nuell may be just the right person to rebuild "Today" into the ratings  powerhouse it once was, just as he did for the syndicated "Entertainment  Tonight" by guiding its transition from middle-brow entertainment news to a  gossipy tabloid show specializing in rumors about the stars. "Today" today,  tabloid tomorrow?  </P> <P> The universe changes.  </P></p>

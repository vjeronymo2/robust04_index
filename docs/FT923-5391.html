			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Keynes v classics at Jackson Hole: America Waking up cold this weekend, I was momentarily disoriented. Then I remembered. I was attending the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual economics symposium: I had traded the muggy summer heat of Washington for the crisp mountain air of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I won't pretend the intellectual peaks scaled at the conference matched the grandeur of the Grand Teton mountain range, but there were some telling insights. The challenge this year was to explain why growth had slowed in all industrial countries and to propose cures. Rightly, the focus was on the secular slowdown in growth since the early 1970s, rather than recent recessionary forces. In the US, for example, the recession has reduced per capita consumption by less than 2.5 per cent whereas slower productivity growth since 1973 has cut consumption by about 30 per cent. On policy, the conference broke into two factions, which might be dubbed 'Cambridge v the classics' or 'Clinton v Bush'. I am referring, of course, to Cambridge, Massachusetts - the home of Harvard and the MIT - rather than Cambridge, England, which was not represented. The Cambridge contingent argued forcefully for investment incentives to spur growth. Lawrence Summers (temporarily on leave at the World Bank) and Bradford De Long, a Harvard colleague, claimed that investment in equipment and machinery offered returns to society as a whole that far exceeded the private return of 10 per cent or so typically earned by individual companies. The reason was that such investment had big 'spill over' effects - actions by one company would help diffuse new technologies raising returns throughout industry. There was thus a case for public subsidies such as the permanent investment tax credit advocated by Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate. Other Cambridge economists advanced parallel arguments for increased investment in 'human capital' (education and training), which is another plank of the Clinton economic plan. The relative merits of investment in equipment, infrastructure and human capital were left unclear. In conversation Mr De Long said the social returns to equipment investment could be 30-40 per cent a year or even higher, making this appear by far the best bet. Mr Summers, however, later scaled this back to 25-30 per cent, arguing that he didn't want to be caricatured as 'Mr Equipment'. Many of the more conservative participants at the conference found the Cambridge arguments hard to swallow. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD chief economist, said reduced investment spending didn't explain the growth slowdown since the early 1970s. The fundamental causes of slower growth included high and variable inflation and growing 'structural rigidities'. Repeating the favourite mantra of his predecessor, Mr David Henderson, he said the cure lay in ancient verities, such as moves toward price stability, the liberalisation of markets and the removal of distortions such as trade barriers. Other conservatives claimed the growth slowdown was illusory: on a long historical perspective the capitalist system was performing about as well as could be expected. Per capita growth in the industrialised countries of 1.9 per cent a year since 1973 looked poor set against the 3.5 per cent growth between 1950 and 1973, but compared well with most other periods. Growth, for example, averaged only 1.6 per cent a year between 1900 and 1913, which is not a period generally considered depressed. The exceptional growth after the Second World War was powered by special factors such as the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, the reversal of protectionism in the inter-war years and unsustainable growth of government spending. Mr Michael Darby, a former Bush administration economist, took a different and equally sceptical line. Growth hadn't slowed in the past two decades, it was just being mismeasured. The main reason was the shift from goods production to services, where productivity was poorly measured and often assumed by definition to be zero. He overstated his case but a related puzzle suggests the statistics may be faulty. The productivity growth slowdown has been accompanied by a big increase in wage inequality which is normally attributed to technical change, such as the rise of information technologies. But new technologies are usually associated with faster rather than slower growth. The circle could be partially squared if much of the service sector and high-tech output associated with new technologies were being systematically understated. The conservatives made some good arguments at Jackson Hole. But I felt the momentum was with the Cambridge neo-Keynesians, who cared less about history and more about improving the future. It is clear that economic battle lines are now being redrawn. Conservatives have had great success arguing against activist counter-cyclical policies. But new theories of economic growth, emphasising the importance of human capital and the divergence of private and social returns on many forms of investment, have opened a new realm for government intervention. Activist governments, it will be increasingly argued, may not be able to prevent periodic recessions, but they can do much to transform long-run growth prospects.</p>

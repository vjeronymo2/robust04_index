			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Manifesto of despair To judge by the coverage of the British newspapers over the weekend, Friday's European summit in Birmingham has already been consigned to the category of a non-event. Conceived last month as an international public-relations exercise, to save Mr Major's face from the domestic consequences of Black Wednesday, it was engulfed before it began by the new domestic crisis caused by the British government's decision to close 31 coal mines. Europe's leaders had answered the call to Birmingham, in the hope that they could help Mr Major and save the Maastricht treaty. By the time they arrived, the British government's self-inflicted coal crisis seemed to be rendering their efforts inadequate, irrelevant and derisory. Unfortunately, the summit was much worse than a non-event; it looked and sounded as if the Community was intent on committing collective suicide. The communique was doubtless intended to inspire confidence in the common leadership of Europe's governments, but it sounded like a manifesto of monetarist despair. The accompanying 'Birmingham declaration' had been long touted in advance by the Mr Major's government as the reassuring answer to the complaints of the Euro-sceptics that Maastricht would subject us to a centralised Euro-state. But the declaration released on Friday evening is about as reassuring as a leaky balloon. The Community's dilemma can be simply stated: Europe's governments are failing to persuade their electorates that the European Community, as it now functions, is providing answers to their real problems; and nothing that occurred last Friday will change that situation. In their communique on the economic situation, the heads of government said they were 'concerned' at lower growth and increasing unemployment. Mr Major adopted an equally lofty tone at his concluding press conference, when he said that he 'regretted' the plight of the miners his government had just decided to put out of work. But the millions of unemployed, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, are unlikely to be impressed by the 12 governments' statement of 'concern', nor appeased by Mr Major's vacuous expression of 'regret'. On the contrary, they are only likely to be interested in Euro-babble if they get the impression that their governments, acting collectively, can do something to halt and then reverse the apparently ineluctable rise in unemployment. Is this the impression that they would get from Friday's summit? In a word, no. On the contrary, all the 12 are able to offer is the same mixture as before. 'Strong co-ordination at the Community level,' they say, 'will help to ensure that the economy of each member state is strengthened by the success of other member states.' The problem is that there has been no effective co-ordination at the Community level (for example, over the fiscal imbalance in Germany which is helping to drive the rest of Europe to perdition); and it is not at all clear what particular 'success' they have in mind. The British and other European governments have tried to cover their policy nakedness, by laying the blame for Europe's troubles on over-centralism in Brussels. They would have us believe that we would all be better off if the Commission stopped interfering in every 'nook and cranny'. Hence last week's declaration on 'subsidiarity'. There are just two problems with this subsidiarity issue: it is an off-shore principle which the UK government does not wish to apply in Britain; and in any case it is entirely irrelevant to the central concerns of the people of Europe. 'We reaffirm that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the citizen,' says the declaration. But it goes on: 'It is for each member state to decide how its powers should be exercised domestically.' In other words, Britain will continue to be governed by an elective dictatorship, as exemplified by the secretive cabinet decision on the pit closures. Mr Major is not really interested in subsidiarity; he is merely lancing at the windmill of a non-existent European state, in the hope that this will make him look like the champion of the national interest. In any case the subsidiarity issue is just a distraction. Does anybody seriously imagine that 49 per cent of the French voted No mainly because they were worried by 'nooks and crannies'? Of course, the hunting-and-shooting extremists object to Community protection of migrant birds. But the main factor behind the No vote was obviously general economic fear. Here is the nub. The problem is not really future fear of the Maastricht treaty, but present fear of the effects of the single European market, which is relentlessly compressing prices, costs, incomes and growth. The corollary of the new world of cost deflation is that it is putting in jeopardy the European model of society. In Britain this is called the welfare state; on the Continent it is called Christian or social democracy; all these variants are threatened by European and worldwide hyper-competition, because Europe is under increasing pressure to cut out all forms of economic activity which are not immediately profitable. There is of course no magic solution; there are no national solutions, certainly not for Britain. But unless the 12 come up with some policies which seem likely to salvage both the prospects for economic growth and their traditional national models of society, the single market, the Maastricht treaty and even the Community itself could founder with all hands. And that would be a paradoxical and posthumous victory for Thatcherism.</p>
